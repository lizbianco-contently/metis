Mr. President, Senator Helms desires to modify his \namendment. I send that modification to the desk.\n\n[[Page S2796]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 141), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . DISCLOSURE OF EXPENDITURES BY LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \n     158) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i) Notice to Members and Employees.--A labor \n     organization shall, on an annual basis, provide (by mail) to \n     each employee who, during the year involved, pays dues, \n     initiation fees, assessments, or other payments as a \n     condition of membership in the labor organization or as a \n     condition of employment (as provided for in subsection \n     (a)(3)), a notice that includes the following statement: `The \n     United States Supreme Court has ruled that labor \n     organizations cannot force fees-paying non-members to pay for \n     activities that are unrelated to collective bargaining \n     contract administration and grievance adjustment. You have \n     the right to resign from the labor organization and, after \n     such resignation, to pay reduced dues or fees in accordance \n     with the decision of the Supreme Court.' ''.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will begin consideration of the Helms amendment, and there are \n16 minutes of debate to be equally divided in the usual form.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Helms is not able to be here at \nthis moment.\n  With regard to labor unions in America, let me say, on behalf of his \namendment, we have had amendments that would guarantee that union \nmembers had an opportunity to consent to their money being used on \ncauses to which they might object. That was voted down. We have had \namendments on disclosure so that union members and the public could \nlearn how union money is being spent. That has been voted down.\n  Senator Helms is now offering a very basic right to members, and that \nis notification. He hopes that if consent is a poison pill, and \ndisclosure is a poison pill, maybe notification will not be. That is at \nthe heart of the Helms amendment.\n  I certainly would urge all Members to support this very important \namendment that provides basic fairness to members of organized labor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will the Chair notify me when I have used 3 \nminutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I obviously did not object to the Member's \ndesire to modify the amendment. That is the courtesy we extend to each \nother in the Senate. I point out that this amendment was poorly \ndrafted. There were actual misstatements of current law included in the \namendment.\n  The modified amendment requires there be written notice. With all due \nrespect to my friend from North Carolina, to begin with, this is an \nunnecessary amendment. Secondly, it is a type of union bashing again. \nThis is the same process we have been through. Yesterday we voted 99-0 \non Senator Nickles' amendment to strike the Beck language from this \nbill. We believed that the Senate should not be legislating like this \non a decision the Supreme Court has left to the NLRB to interpret and \ndecide.\n  Under the Beck holding, there is a requirement of notice. This \namendment attempts to specify the content of the notice, the means on a \nportion of the notice required under that decision. The courts have \nsaid that it is the purview of the National Labor Relations Board, \nthrough case law, to spell out what constitutes that notice.\n  With the amendment we adopted yesterday 99-0, we said: Look, even \nthough we have different opinions about what Beck holds, we should not \ntry to include Beck in the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill \nitself. Congress should defer to the NLRB with respect to Beck. Now, \nhere we go again. We are going right back, almost with the next \namendment, saying we are going to take portions of the Beck decision \nand tell you what Beck means. That, it seems to me, contradicts the \nexact vote we cast yesterday. I am somewhat surprised about this \nbecause I thought maybe we were going to put these amendments aside, \nparticularly after having gone through any number of amendments that \nwere designed to attack organized labor and unions and their \ninvolvement.\n  But with that said, I must note that there are other political rights \nthat union members have. I do not hear my colleagues suggesting that \nthose rights ought to be enumerated and notice given about them. For \nexample, you have a right to join with other union members to register \nmembers, their families, or other employees. Why not send written \nnotice of that right to union members?\n  You have the right to join with other union members and encourage and \nassist other members to vote. That is a right. Why not include written \nnotice of that?\n  There is a long list of rights that union members have that could be \nincluded. You have a right, on your own nonworking time, to volunteer \nto assist other candidates. I could go down a long list of union \nmember's political rights that we do not require under law that there \nbe a written notice. As a result, this amendment is targeted and \npointed in a way that is unfair.\n  Under Federal law, you have the right to organize a union in your \nworkplace, to join a union. Under Federal law, you cannot be \ndisciplined, discharged, or suffer any adverse action by an employer to \njoin or assist a union.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Under Federal law, you have the right to join or assist a \nunion. Under Federal law, you have a protected right, together with any \nother employees, to present any views, requests, or demands to your \nemployer about wages, benefits, and the like. Why not require that \nthese be given written notice?\n\n  My point is this--this amendment is adversely selective in its \napproach. It is picking out one part of the Beck decision, and saying \nto the NLRB: You have no right to decide in this area. Congress is \ngoing to specifically tell the NLRB how to do it. As I said, yesterday \nwe voted 99-0 to strike the Beck language from this bill. We are coming \nright back in again today and asking this body to re-inject itself into \nthe Beck decision.\n  The Beck decision requires notice. The NLRB already has rich case law \non what constitutes notice and how to make sure members receive legally \nsufficient notice. For us to specify, as the Helms amendment does, \nwould be a return to exactly what we are trying to avoid by the vote we \ncast yesterday.\n  For those reasons, I urge rejection of this amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Obviously, unions have every incentive to inform \nworkers of their right to organize and their rights to get them to join \nunions. That is to their advantage. They do not have an incentive to \nnotify members of their opportunity to get their own money back. That \nis precisely what the Helms amendment is about: to require notification \nto individual union members of their rights to receive a refund.\n  It seems to me it is quite simple. It looks to me as if the opponents \nof this amendment think it is perfectly all right for unions to notify \nemployees about the opportunities to organize but not the opportunities \nto receive any refunds they are due under Federal law.\n  So it is quite simple. I certainly urge adoption of the Helms \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to my friend from \nWisconsin.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against this amendment. I, \ntoo, thought we had finished with the antilabor amendments yesterday \nwhen we agreed to remove the codification of the Beck provision from \nthe bill. The debate on this campaign finance reform bill is not the \nproper forum to address labor law issues.\n  I think these kinds of amendments have, at this point, become \ndistractions. Sooner or later, those who oppose this bill are going to \nhave to quit trying to change the subject and face up to the real \nissue, the corrupt soft\n\n[[Page S2797]]\n\nmoney system that they have defended by standing in the way of reform.\n  Sooner or later, we are going to get to the point where people \nrealize a majority of this body wants to pass this reform, a majority \nof the House wants this reform, and most importantly, the American \npeople want this reform.\n  This amendment requires a notice to be posted in every workplace \ntelling union members that they have a right to quit their union. That \nis not balanced and is not evenhanded. So what is next? I guess we \nshould require all companies to send a notice to their shareholders \nletting each and every one of them know they have a right to sell their \nshares if they do not like the political spending of the corporations. \nThat is the logical implication of this.\n  I think it is fitting that our last vote of this week will be to \ntable this amendment. If we learned nothing else this week--actually, I \nthink we have learned a lot, but if we learned nothing else, we now \nknow for sure the Senate is not going to add antiunion amendments to \nthis bill. And it is not going to do that not because it wants to \nprotect labor but because it wants to protect reform.\n  I thank my colleagues, especially on the Republican side of the aisle \nwhere the pressure to take a shot at labor is intense, for standing \nfirm against these distracting and irrelevant amendments and moving us \never closer to passing the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, here is an example of the need to \nensure union members know of their rights. In 1959, Congress enacted \nthe Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, LMRDA, to ``protect \nthe rights and interests of union members against abuses by unions and \ntheir officials.'' The act gave union members various substantive \nrights that were considered so crucial to ensuring that unions were \n``democratically governed and responsive to the will of their \nmembership'' that they were labeled the ``Bill of Rights of Members of \nLabor Organizations.''\n  Of course, Congress realized that the protections provided in the \nBill of Rights of Members of Labor Organizations were meaningless if \nunion members did not know of their existence. Therefore, in section \n105 of the LMRDA, Congress mandated that ``[e]very labor organization \nshall inform its members concerning the provisions of this chapter.''\n  Unfortunately, as demonstrated by the United States Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals' recent decision in Thomas versus The Grand Lodge of \nthe International Association of Machinists, No. 99-1621 (January 27, \n2000), labor unions have frustrated the will of Congress for over 40 \nyears and sought to prevent their members from learning of the rights \nCongress gave them. Unions have done this by simply disregarding \nCongress' direct command to notify ``[e]very labor organization shall \ninform its members concerning the Bill of Rights of Members of Labor \nOrganizations in the LMRDA.\n  Unions take the meritless position, the Machinists Union asserted in \nthe Thomas, that their one-time publication of the Bill of Rights of \nMembers of Labor Organizations in the LMRDA to their membership in 1959 \nsatisfied their obligation under section 105.\n  The Court of Appeals rejected this argument, as any sane person \nwould, because it ran ``counter to the clear text of [section 105]'', \nwhich, according to the Court clearly states Congress' intent ``that \neach individual [union member] soon after obtaining membership be \ninformed about the provisions of the [Bill of Rights of Members of \nLabor Organizations.]'' Unions have been flouting the law in this \nmanner since 1959, so there is a need to not only ensure that workers \nknow their rights, but real need to make unions obey laws that have \nbeen on the books since 1959 that require them to provide certain \nnotices to workers. Does my colleague support unions disregarding their \nobligations under the LMRDA?\n  Mr. President, I repeat, if this amendment is voted down, it is \nfurther evidence during this debate that no amendments will be adopted \nthat in any way adversely impact organized labor. All of those \namendments have been described as a poison pill. It is pretty clear, as \nwe move along, that anything that provides any kind of discomfort for \nthe largest special interest in America will not be included in this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Connecticut.\n  Mr. President, yesterday we decided we were going to leave the Beck \ninterpretation and implementation to the courts. That is exactly where \nthat is right now. This whole issue of what is related to collective \nbargaining is being litigated now in the courts. This amendment goes in \nthe opposite direction.\n  In the Nickles amendment yesterday, we said, let's be silent on the \ndefinitions that are involved in Beck. This now puts in a partial \ndefinition, as the Senator from Connecticut pointed out, in only parts \nwhich are aimed at reducing participation and free association. That is \nnot what we should be doing. We should keep our eye on eliminating the \nsoft money.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I point out, I did have a meeting with the \nleader of the AFL-CIO in which he expressed his dissatisfaction with \nseveral portions of this legislation.\n  I believe it should also be reiterated that taking out the Beck \nlanguage was something that was agreed to on both sides.\n  Mr. President, I am going to make a motion to table this amendment at \nthe appropriate time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut has 30 seconds. The Senator from \nKentucky has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back our time.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield back our time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the Helms \namendment No. 141, as modified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. \nDurbin), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from \nLouisiana (Ms. Landrieu), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller), and \nthe Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Boxer) would vote ``aye.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I yield to Senator McConnell.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe on this side we have an amendment from \nSenator Hutchison of Texas and Senator Fitzgerald of Illinois to be \nlaid down this morning and dealt with Monday, and I believe one on the \nDemocratic side as well.\n  Mr. DODD. If the Senator will yield, we are hopeful Senator Wellstone \nwill have an amendment. I do not think he will offer it today but maybe \nfirst thing on Monday about noon. It should not take much time. We can \nhave that and then go to the Hollings proposal at 2 o'clock, I believe, \non which we will have 4 hours; is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. Under the agreement, I believe it is actually five, but we \nhave worked out that we will shorten that time and it will only be 4 \nhours.\n  Mr. DODD. With the debates ahead of time and some votes ready, we \nshould have business to do when Members come back on Monday.\n  Mr. LOTT. I remind all the Senators that we can expect one or two, \nmaybe even more votes, as many as four around 6 o'clock on Monday. As \nalways, Senator Daschle and I will try to accommodate as many Senators \nas is possible, but we have to make some progress on this legislation. \nWe are trying to accommodate everybody by having debate and then \nstacking those votes on Monday. As my colleagues know, we have not been \nstacking votes, but we need to do that in order to make progress and \nhave those votes late Monday afternoon.\n  Also, while we have had a free-flowing debate and vote on amendments \nand some people like the way this is progressing, at some point we need \nto identify how many amendments are out there, how many are pending. I \nunderstand Senators are now coming up with some new ideas for \namendments they may want to offer.\n  The whole idea has been from the beginning that while we will have \nfull debate and amendments offered, at some point next week--hopefully \nby Thursday night--we will get to a conclusion of this consideration. \nWe cannot do that if we do not know what amendments are out there and \nif we do not begin to make more progress in terms of the amount of time \nwe spend on amendments. We do not have to spend the full 3 hours or 4 \nhours on amendments. If my colleagues need to, fine, but I hope the \nmanagers of the legislation and those who have been working on it--\nSenator McCain, Senator Feingold, Senator McConnell, and Senator Dodd--\nwill receive the cooperation of Senators so we will know what we can \nexpect next week. If you look at the stacked votes on Monday and look \nat the next 3 days--we have been doing two or three amendments a day, \nperhaps as many as three now--that would mean we could only do nine or \nten more amendments. I hope Members will think in those terms to get to \na point where we get a fair conclusion.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader. I understand the necessity, \nbecause of the weekend, that there may be two or three stacked votes on \nMonday. But the original agreement was we wouldn't stack any votes. So \nit will be my intention to object for the rest of the week after these \nstacked votes. These are too critical to wait over the weekend and let \nthem sit out there to then have everybody come running in to vote on \nthem.\n  I thank Senators Dodd and McConnell. We have had an excellent debate \nand a ventilation of this issue which has been educational not only to \nMembers but to the country.\n  I also emphasize we need to get this done. I understand the urgency \nof moving to the budget the week after next, but we need to get this \nissue completed. I hope all Members understand that. We are committed \nto staying on this until we get a final vote either up or down on the \nbill.\n  I thank the majority leader for all his help. This has been a debate \nthat I can personally say I have enjoyed and I think other Members have \nas well.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is obvious we are probably going to have \nto go late Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night to get this \naccomplished. We have difficulty when we have Senators say: I have an \namendment, but I don't want to offer it Thursday night or Friday or \nMonday, but I am available Tuesday--as is everybody else. I hope \nSenators, if they are serious, will take advantage of prime time on \nFriday morning or Monday night at 8 o'clock, which is, I believe, about \n5 o'clock in California. It would be a very good time to offer a \nserious amendment.\n  I yield to Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. At times in the past when we have had debates of this \nkind--and this has been a very productive and good debate this week--we \nhave sought unanimous consent for a finite list, and it would be \nsomething we might want to contemplate doing maybe no later than Monday \nevening so we can work down a list and try to find ways in which to \nmanage the remaining amendments.\n  Most Members on this side would be prepared to work with the \nleadership to find a way to do that. That may be something we want to \ncontemplate over the weekend.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know the managers are trying to identify \nthose amendments. I talked to Senator McCain and Senator McConnell \nabout getting that list identified clearly by Tuesday; certainly to get \nthat done it would have to be in on Monday.\n  We do have pending before the country the need for action on our \nbudget for the year, on tax relief that could be beneficial to all \nAmericans and the economy. We have the education legislation reported \nout of the Health Committee ready to go as soon as we come back from \nthe Easter recess, and we have an energy problem in this country that \nneeds some attention, too. We have a lot of very serious work we need \nto do on behalf of the American people.\n  I hope we can complete this bill by the end of next week, and \nI expect that to be the case.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the distinguished majority leader, it \nshouldn't be a problem coming up with a list of amendments by sometime \nMonday.\n  I think it was George Orwell in the novel ``Animal Farm,'' who said \nall pigs were equal but some pigs were more equal than others. All \namendments are equal, but I think we have a sense of the really \nimportant amendments and those will be dealt with in the early part of \nthe week. I think we will have a clearer sense of where we are.\n  I also want to agree with Senator McCain. This has been a superb \ndebate, enlightening for all the Members. A lot of Members, and \nhopefully members of the press, have learned a little bit more about a \nvery complex issue which we have had out here in a freewheeling fashion \nfor the last week. We understand the need to get to a conclusion and \nwill work toward that on Monday.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I think there has literally only been half an hour or an \nhour of quorum calls all week. The Members have engaged in the debate. \nThis is like the preparation of bacon and eggs. The Members are deeply \ncommitted to this issue in some ways, and we are spending the time on \nit.\n  I hope next week we can complete this. We have had wonderful debate \nand good amendments, by the way. We have improved this bill. I think \nboth Senator McCain and Senator Feingold would agree there have been \nimprovements to the legislation as a result of the amendment process.\n  I know the other issues are tremendously important and all of us care \nabout them. This issue goes to the heart of all of those questions, as \nwell. This will be an important debate.\n  I thank my colleague from Kentucky and the Members who have been on \nthe floor during the week. They have contributed to the debate \nsubstantially.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Presiding Officer. I wanted to ask the \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\nmajority leader if I might make some comments, few in number, with \nrespect to the subject of the forthcoming action on the budget that had \nbeen mentioned. My leader on the Budget Committee is not here at the \nmoment but I simply want to say on behalf of myself and other Members \nof the Budget Committee, particularly those on my side, we do really \nneed to have a good debate on the budget.\n  I will probably have a few additional comments later today, but for \nnow let me just remind the Senate that according to reports, the Budget \nCommittee will not report out a budget resolution. This will be the \nfirst time, I am told, in the history of this Budget Act that the \nSenate will not have the benefit of a markup in the Budget Committee. I \nam not saying at this point to criticize anybody, but this is something \nnew. I am a new member of the Budget Committee so I am learning some \nthings as we go along.\n  I do have to make that point. The people of this country are going to \nbe denied, as Senators will be denied, the opportunity to listen to and \nto engage in debate in the Budget Committee, with amendments being \noffered and acted upon in that committee before a budget resolution is \nsent to the floor. It probably won't be reported from committee, a \nresolution, but according to the law, it is due to be reported by April \n1, April 1 being a Sunday, and we understand it is due to be reported, \ndue to be put on the calendar without debate, without amendments in the \ncommittee, by April 2.\n\n  Now, the second wrinkle in this horn is the Senate has not yet \nreceived the budget from the administration. We have received kind of a \nblue outline which, like the apostle Paul said, enables us to see \nthrough a glass darkly. We don't have a budget. That is not something \nthat is unheard of, as I will say later today, and which was also \nemphasized yesterday by the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nDomenici, the very able chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  I do have a few things, after I read the Record, that I want to say \nin that regard. I only want to say, Mr. Leader, whatever we can do to \nhelp the Senate to be able to examine this budget resolution when it is \ncalled up, have ample time to do it, and I want us to be able to act \nwith some idea of what the administration is going to have in its \nbudget.\n  We had earlier understood that the budget would be up here on April \n3. Now we are told it will be up here on April 9 which is, I believe, \nthe first Monday or Tuesday in the recess. So we will get the budget in \nthe recess. But by then, according to the schedule that we understand \nwill be followed, the budget resolution will be called up in the Senate \nand acted upon.\n  I will make a few additional remarks on this subject after I read the \nRecord because my distinguished and beloved friend, Pete Domenici, \nchairman of the Budget Committee, made some comments yesterday, and I \nhave no fault with that at all, but I do want to read those comments.\n  Please understand we are being confronted very soon with a matter \nwhich is going to be very controversial, thorny, and heatedly debated \nat times, which is all right. But the Senate needs to be put on notice. \nThe people need to be put on notice that this is coming. Coming events \ncast their shadows before them.\n  This is an event that is casting its shadow. Unfortunately, we are \nnot going to have an opportunity in the Budget Committee to make our \nwishes known.\n  The distinguished Senator from Michigan is on the floor. She is on \nthat committee--a very able new member. I am a new member--not so able, \nbut a new member. But she is a very able new member and she will join \nwith me in calling attention to this. Not much is being said about this \nright now, but it is out there, it is coming, and it is probably the \nmost important subject that this Senate will discuss this year. It \ninvolves a huge tax cut.\n  I was glad to see in the newspaper this morning that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Domenici, is \nthinking of having--I don't know how accurate this is, how accurate the \nstory is, but he is thinking in terms of having a rebate, which I think \nmight be a very good approach. But he is also thinking of still having \na 10-year approach. I haven't heard him say that. We will certainly be \nlistening with great interest to what he has to say on this point.\n  I thank both leaders for allowing me to take these few minutes \nbecause I don't think the time has been ill spent by my calling to the \nattention what lies ahead.\n  In closing, let me thank Mr. McCain for his objections to stacked \nvotes. That may be a thing we ought to do, not just with reference to \nthis particular bill that is before the Senate, but we perhaps ought to \nobject to stacked votes. I know how it would inconvenience Senators, \nbut the people did not send me to this Senate for my convenience. I am \nhere to serve them. And it is not in the best interests of the people \nthat we stack votes, and for the very reasons that Mr. McCain said.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I might just comment for a moment to \nsupport the distinguished Senator's comments. Senator Byrd may be in \nfact a new member of the Budget Committee. He is certainly a person we \nlook to for wise counsel on important subjects such as the budget. I \nhave learned a tremendous amount from him as a member of the Budget \nCommittee. I would add to his comments. I am, in fact, a new Member of \nthe Senate as well as to the Budget Committee, but I have sat through \nour 16 hearings, had the opportunity to listen to each Secretary, each \narea of the budget, listening to the views on the President's budget, \nand at the end of this process when I assumed as a new member I would \nhave the opportunity to put forward the wishes of the people of \nMichigan--our values, our priorities in the form of a budget--we were \ntold yesterday we, in fact, would not even debate a budget resolution \nfor the first time since 1974 when the Budget Act was put together.\n  I share Senator Byrd's tremendous concerns. I cannot imagine anything \nmore fundamental than this body debating the future of the country \nthrough the budget. I strongly support and urge that the leadership on \nthe other side decide to allow us to do our job on the Budget Committee \nand come forward with, hopefully, what would be a bipartisan document \nthat would allow us to proceed and work together to do the country's \nbusiness.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I just want to compliment the Senator from Michigan for the \nexemplary service she has rendered on the Budget Committee, and I thank \nher for her comments today.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the quorum call \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Texas has an amendment to offer, and \nI yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 111\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 111 be \nreported.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 111.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt State \n   and local political committees from duplicative notification and \n reporting requirements made applicable to political organizations by \n                          Public Law 106-230)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S2800]]\n\n     SEC. 305. EXEMPTION FOR STATE AND LOCAL POLITICAL COMMITTEES \n                   FROM NOTIFICATION AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS \n                   IMPOSED BY PUBLIC LAW 106-230.\n\n       (a) Exemption From Notification Requirements.--Paragraph \n     (5) of section 527(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (relating to organizations must notify Secretary that they \n     are section 527 organizations) is amended by striking ``or'' \n     at the end of subparagraph (A), by striking the period at the \n     end of subparagraph (B) and inserting ``, or'', and by adding \n     at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) which--\n       ``(i) engages in exempt function activity solely in the \n     attempt to influence the selection, nomination, election, or \n     appointment of any individual to any State or local public \n     office or office in a State or local political organization, \n     and\n       ``(ii) is subject to State or local contribution and \n     expenditure reporting requirements relating to selections, \n     nominations, elections, and appointments to such offices, and \n     reports under such requirements are publicly available.''.\n       (b) Exemption From Reporting Requirements.--Paragraph (5) \n     of section 527(j) of such Code (relating to required \n     disclosures of expenditures and contributions) is amended by \n     striking ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (D), by striking \n     the period at the end of subparagraph (E) and inserting ``, \n     or'', and by adding at the end the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(F) to any organization which--\n       ``(i) engages in exempt function activity solely in the \n     attempt to influence the selection, nomination, election, or \n     appointment of any individual to any State or local public \n     office or office in a State or local political organization, \n     and\n       ``(ii) is subject to State or local contribution and \n     expenditure reporting requirements relating to selections, \n     nominations, elections, and appointments to such offices, and \n     reports under such requirements are publicly available.''.\n       (c) Exemption From Requirements for Annual Return Based on \n     Gross Receipts.--Paragraph (6) of section 6012(a) of such \n     Code is amended by striking ``section)'' and inserting \n     ``section and an organization described in section \n     527(i)(5)(C)''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--Notwithstanding section 402, the \n     amendments made by this section shall take effect as if \n     included in the amendments made by Public Law 106-230.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is a technical amendment to a \nbill that was passed last year by the Senate to correct a problem, and \nit has corrected part of a problem, but it has caused a problem for our \nState and local candidates all over the country.\n  By way of background, this was a bill that was passed in an effort to \nclose a loophole where some stealth PAC organizations that were making \ncontributions and doing advertising did not have to disclose to whom \nthey were contributing or who was contributing to them. In fact, it is \ncalled a 527 organization. Almost all political organizations--party \ncommittees, candidate committees--are section 527 organizations.\n  As a 527, they enjoy Federal tax-exempt status and thus do not pay \ntaxes on contributions. While most 527 organizations also file with the \nFederal Election Commission because they are engaged in express \nadvocacy activities, there are a few organizations, so-called stealth \nPACs, that did not have to file with the FEC because they are engaged \nsolely in issue advocacy and not in candidate advocacy. These groups \ngenerally have been sham organizations.\n  So in an attempt to close the loophole so that the groups' donors \nwould have to be disclosed, we passed a law last summer requiring all \n527 organizations to file notification of their status with the IRS and \nto disclose certain expenditures and contributions.\n  The reason these groups must file with the IRS as opposed to the FEC \nis the new disclosure requirements are imposed as a condition of their \ntax-exempt status. Thus, those groups that choose not to file with the \nIRS could lose their tax-exempt status.\n  While this law was intended to target stealth PACs, it has had the \nunintended consequence of imposing burdensome and duplicative reporting \nrequirements on State and local campaign committees that are not \ninvolved in Federal election activities. State legislators across the \ncountry have been furious about these new requirements because, of \ncourse, they are taking in contributions, as a candidate would, and \nthey do not want to have to file with the IRS as well as the FEC and \ntheir State and local requirements.\n  So the amendment I have introduced is an attempt to fix this, what I \nthink is an inequity that was not intended, by simply saying that if a \ncandidate committee, or any committee, is subject to State or local \ncontribution and expenditure reporting requirements relating to \nselections, nominations, elections, and appointments to such office, \nand they report under those requirements, and those reports are public, \nthey would not also have to file with the IRS.\n  It is a simple amendment. It is a technical correction. I think it \nwill help all of our State and local candidates not to have this \nburdensome duplication. All of their contributions are reported. Their \nexpenditures are reported. There are State laws governing it.\n  I know this wasn't intended by Congress when we passed this amendment \nto section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  I hope we can fix this so these State and local candidates will not \nbe subject to losing their ability to run their campaign--hopefully \nwithout the burdensome overregulation. Many of them don't even have the \ncapability to hire people to make these kinds of extra disclosures, \nwhich are not necessary because they are already public.\n  The bottom line is if someone already publicly discloses their \ncontributions and their expenditures under a law of the State, they \nshould not be required to also file with the IRS.\n  That is the summation of the amendment. I wouldn't think there would \nbe an objection to it by either side. I think there wouldn't be an \nobjection by either House of Congress.\n  I submit for the Record a letter from the National Conference of \nState Legislators, which is a bipartisan organization, asking that this \nbe fixed and stating that it has become an unreasonable burden, one \nthat certainly does not in any way help public disclosure but, in fact, \nis just a duplication of public disclosure that is already required.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                                   March 21, 2001.\n     Ms. Melissa Meuller,\n     Ways and Means Counsel, Office of Representative Lloyd \n         Doggett, Cannon House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Melissa: I wanted to respond to our phone conversation \n     of several weeks ago wherein you asked me to provide you with \n     more information as to how the new Section 527 law (P.L. 106-\n     230) adversely impacts state legislators, paying specific \n     attention to the new tax code requirements.\n       P.L. 106-230 requires political organizations to provide \n     notice of status to the IRS by July 31, 2000, unless an \n     exception applies. The only exception available to a state \n     legislative campaign is Sec. 527(i)(5)(B) (``reasonably \n     anticipates that it will not have gross receipts of $25,000 \n     or more for any taxable year''). Given the size of Texas \n     House districts, the cost of running a campaign will almost \n     always be more than $25,000. Failure to file the notice of \n     status results in a penalty in the form of a tax liability. \n     If the political organization fails to file the notice of \n     status by the due date, the organization must include \n     contributions received after June 30, 2000, in taxable \n     income.\n       The following represents an example of how the new law \n     plays out in Texas:\n       A Texas House member heard about P.L. 106-230 in July 2000, \n     but did not file the notice of status because he didn't think \n     it applied to his campaign. In his opinion, he doesn't have \n     an ``organization,'' just family and friends who help out. \n     Political contributions to his campaign are deposited in a \n     non-interest-bearing checking account. He was not able to \n     reach anyone at the IRS who could tell him with certainty \n     whether he was required to obtain an EIN and file the notice \n     of status.\n       He held a fundraiser in November 2000 and raised $42,000 in \n     political contributions. In January 2001, he learned that \n     P.L. 106-230 did apply to his situation. He filed the 1120-\n     POL tax return on March 15, 2001. Following the form's \n     instructions, he included $42,000 in total income and \n     deducted a total of $2,000. The ``penalty'' for his failure \n     to file the notice of status is $14,000! If he had filed the \n     notice of status before the due date, his tax liability would \n     be $0.\n       Beginning March 2002, he must filed Form 1120-POL if his \n     campaign receives $25,000 in contributions, even though his \n     campaign has no taxable income. In other words, he is \n     required to file Form 1120-POL with all zeros. He must also \n     file Form 990-EZ, the annual information return. According to \n     the IRS, the estimated average time needed to complete Form \n     990-EZ is more than 51 hours! That includes recordkeeping, \n     learning about the law and the form, and preparing the form.\n       Under Ch. 254, Tex. Elec. Code, candidates and \n     officeholders are required to file reports at least \n     semiannually with the Texas Ethics Commission, itemizing \n     contributions, pledges, loans, expenditures, and providing\n\n[[Page S2801]]\n\n     certain other information. The threshold for itemization is \n     $50. See 254.031, Tex. Elec. Code. Most candidates and \n     officeholders are also required to file these reports \n     electronically.\n       The purpose of P.L. 106-230 is to ensure full disclosure of \n     political contributions and expenditures. Form 1120-POL does \n     not provide the public with any additional information on \n     contributions and expenditures. Moreover, Form 990-EZ \n     provides only aggregated information. If the public wants \n     detailed information on a Texas House member's contributions \n     and expenditures, the public must still go to the Texas \n     Ethics Commission reports.\n       I hope you find this information helpful. As I had stated \n     to you in our conversation, the draft legislation proposed by \n     Representative Doggett does not address the concerns of state \n     legislators with P.L. 106-230. I urge you to suggest \n     reworking Representative Doggett's proposed legislation to \n     exempt state legislators from the burdensome and duplicative \n     requirements of P.L. 106-230. Please do not hesitate to \n     contact me if you have any further questions. I may be \n     reached at 202-624-3566, or by e-mail at \n     Susan.Frederick@ncsl.org.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                       Susan Parnas Frederick,\n\n                                               Committee Director,\n                                             NCSL Law and Justice.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I made the argument. I hope the \namendment will be accepted. I understand we will need to clear it \nthrough the Finance Committee and make sure they are also not opposed \nto it.\n  But I believe if anyone looks at the technical nature of this \namendment, they will support it. It would take a terrible burden away \nfrom our State legislators and local candidates for mayor or city \ncouncil.\n  I certainly hope we can do that in an expedited way.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It was discussed earlier on the floor that the bill is \ngoing to come straight out of committee.\n  I am pleased that is going to happen because I would like to have \njust as much say in the budget as would any Member of the Senate. We \nwill have 30 or 50 hours of debate. We will have plenty of time to \ndiscuss our priorities. But with this evenly divided Senate, more and \nmore, all of us are going to have the opportunity on the floor to have \nour input rather than not have it come to the floor and bog down the \nprocess.\n  I am very pleased with what we are hearing. I am very pleased that we \nare bringing the budget up on an expedited basis because I think we \nneed to move swiftly. Our country is looking at an economic downturn. \nMany people think it is a recession. I hope it isn't. But, \nnevertheless, I think action is needed. I think action on behalf of the \nAmerican people is warranted at this time.\n  I think setting the budget and determining what our priority \nexpenditures are going to be and looking at giving tax relief to \nAmerican workers at this time is even more important than it was when \nwe first introduced the idea because many of us believe that having \nthis huge budget surplus sitting in Washington, DC, is certainly not \ngood economic policy and it isn't good fiscal policy.\n  It is time for us to make sure the money that is sitting in \nWashington, DC, in excess of what is needed for the running of our \nGovernment be put back in the pocketbooks of the people of this \ncountry.\n\n  I am very pleased we are working on an expedited basis. I am pleased \nwe are going to take up a budget. I am pleased Senator Domenici, the \nleader of the Budget Committee, is pushing right now, right this \nminute, for an immediate tax relief plan--something that people will \nsee is going to come. They will know for sure that is going to come, \nand that it will come, hopefully, on an expedited basis.\n  I am very proud the Budget Committee is moving forward in this \nfashion. I am so proud of our leadership. I hope we can work with the \nother side of the aisle so all of us will have equal input in the 30 to \n50 hours of debate that we have on the budget resolution so we can \nestablish our priorities; so we can preserve Medicare; so we can have \nreal Medicare reform to include prescription drugs; so we can have the \nnew added expenditures that we know we are going to need to upgrade the \nquality of life for those serving in our military; and so we can \nincrease spending on public education to make sure every child has a \nquality public education, which is the foundation for democracy.\n  I think we will have those added expenditures and we will have tax \nrelief for the American people.\n  If we can take up this budget resolution a week from Monday, we will \ndo it on an expedited basis.\n  I am proud of Senator Domenici and the leadership of the Budget \nCommittee. I am proud of our leadership and their working with our \nPresident to make sure we have tax relief for hard-working Americans.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/23/senate-section/article/S2801-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2801-S2807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 111\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss this amendment which I \nam sorry to oppose.\n  I appreciate the involvement of the Senator from Texas in this issue \nand on this particular aspect of it because it was the first major \nbreakthrough we were able to make in the area of campaign finance \nreform requiring full disclosure of 527 activities.\n  Now that full disclosure has been obtained, we find some fascinating \nthings have gone on in the name of campaign activities, such as buying \ntrucks, giving people very generous salaries, renting office space--\nvery interesting things.\n  Basically, as I read this amendment, it does not require the State \nand local political committees to notify and report the requirements \nimposed in 527.\n  As I understand the comments of the Senator from Texas, I guess \nsomehow it gives them burdensome paperwork that would be difficult for \nthem to achieve in the case of 527s.\n  They are making these reports, and all they have to do is make a copy \nand send it to Washington. So for a 527, it seems to me, it would not \nbe that hard to use a copying machine. In fact, you might want to even \ngo down to Kinko's and get one there.\n\n  But more importantly, this is a reversal of full disclosure. \nEverybody, no matter which side they are on in this debate, says an \nintegral and vital part of the problem is full disclosure. This is \nobviously a reversal thereof.\n  Also, staff informs me that this entire bill would be blue-slipped if \nthis amendment were made part of it because it touches the Tax Code. \nChanges in the Tax Code originate in the House of Representatives and \nit would have to come out of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  So I will be opposing this amendment. I appreciate the involvement of \nthe Senator from Texas. But to exempt people from making a copy of \ntheir financial disbursements in their campaign activities and sending \nit on to Washington, where, if Senator Cochran's amendment is going to \nbe agreed to as part of this bill, it would be posted on the Internet \nand all would be able to see it, is obviously not something that I \nwould really very much favor. I would want Americans to know all this \ninformation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I respond to the Senator from Arizona \nby saying, first of all, I hope he will work with me to try to have the \npurpose of my amendment added to this bill. If there is a specific \nproblem, I would like to work with the Senator because I do not think \nthe amendment we had last year, that affected the 527\n\n[[Page S2802]]\n\norganizations, was intended to affect State and local candidates who do \nnot participate, in any way, in Federal elections.\n  I think it is very clear from the amendment. If it isn't clear, I \nwill certainly try to make it clear in the amendment that it would only \napply to a State and local candidate who had reporting requirements and \nwhose reporting requirements were covered under State law. Copying the \nreport and sending it to the IRS is, unfortunately, not what happens \nwhen you pass a Federal law that affects State and local candidates.\n  What happens is, you have a form that the IRS approves, which may not \nbe the same as is required in some States. So it is a burdensome, added \nrequirement. Furthermore, it isn't necessary because nothing that they \ndo is participating in the Federal campaigns.\n  The second issue is an important one. It is not my purpose to blue-\nslip the bill or kill the bill. In fact, if the bill were to be blue-\nslipped, I would withdraw the amendment. I do not think it is subject \nto being blue-slipped.\n  In fact, the original amendment last year was offered to the Defense \nauthorization bill. It was brought up at the time that this was a \nrevenue measure and, therefore, was unconstitutional to be put on the \nDefense bill. In fact, we voted on that point of order, and it was \ndetermined that this is not a revenue measure.\n  Senator McCain, along with many of the other cosponsors of the bill \ntoday--Senator McCain and Senator Feingold--agreed that this was not a \nrevenue measure. In fact, Mr. McCain argued on the floor at the time:\n\n       This amendment in no way raises any revenue, nor does it \n     change in any way the amount of revenue collected by \n     the Treasury pursuant to the Tax Code. It is simply a \n     clarification in what information must be disclosed by \n     entities seeking to claim status under section 527 of the \n     Tax Code.\n\n  So I believe it certainly would not be considered a revenue measure \nand therefore would not be subject to a blue slip that would kill the \nbill.\n  It is not my intention, with this amendment, to harm the bill itself. \nIt is, though, my intention to try to alleviate this burdensome \nrequirement for State and local candidates who would have to have \nanother layer of reporting.\n  I hope the Senator will work with me to make this acceptable to him \nbecause I do not think it will in any way damage the bill and certainly \nwill not damage the reporting that is open to the public because State \nlaw would cover all of these candidates in their vote disbursements and \ncontribution reporting requirements.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator from Texas, I thank her for this \neffort. We do want to work with her. I would like to put my staff to \nwork with hers. And there are several other Senators' staffs who have \nalso been working on this issue. I think we might be able to get \nsomething done.\n  I will make a couple points. One, these organizations do get a \nFederal tax benefit even though they are only involved in State and \nlocal races. That is something we have to address. The other point is, \nas the Senator from Texas did point out, I argued strenuously that our \nlegislation, which was put on the Defense bill, would not be blue-\nslipped by the House and should not have been. And I still believe \nthat. I agree with the Senator from Texas that this should not be blue-\nslipped either.\n  But after we passed the bill, and they went to conference, the House \nwas insistent upon their position that it would be blue-slipped. So it \nwas withdrawn from the Defense bill because of that adamant position \nthe other body assumed.\n  I have been discussing this matter with our staffs, and I think there \nis a way to work it out. I agree with the Senator from Texas, we should \nnot put additional burdens on especially a majority of these relatively \nsmall organizations that are engaging in State and local campaigns. So \nI rather believe we can probably get something worked out and get it \nmodified so it is acceptable to both the Senator from Texas as well as \nall Senators.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas. We are going to work on it. I thank \nher for her engagement on this very important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I respond by saying, I do appreciate \nthat Senator McCain will work with us. Even though certainly a State \nand local candidate does not pay taxes on the contributions he or she \nreceives, nevertheless, this should not be a report to the IRS when the \nreporting is covered--a point with which I think the Senator from \nArizona agrees.\n  Secondly, I will say right now that I would like to work with the key \npeople in the House and the key people in the Senate to assure--before \nwe put this amendment on the bill, or the amendment as we can work it \nout--that it will not be blue-slipped because if this is going to be a \ngame that will be played by someone who is not for the bill, I will not \nbe a part of it.\n  My views on the bill might differ--and do differ--with the Senator \nfrom Arizona, and I will vote my conscience on the bill. But I am not \nplaying a game here to try to kill the bill with a blue slip on an \namendment. So I will have it cleared before we make a final \ndetermination because that is not my purpose.\n  My purpose is to give the relief that I think we probably all agree \nshould be given. I think the House and Senate will unanimously want to \ndo it.\n  We will clear the blue slip issue to everyone's satisfaction before \nthat would go on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my colleague from Arizona has described the \nhesitations that those of us have about this amendment. They are mere \nhesitations, not opposition. It is a desire to ensure that what the \nSenator from Texas is trying to achieve, will in effect, be \naccomplished by the result and nothing more.\n  Certainly my colleague from Texas can appreciate that unintended \nconsequences of our good intentions sometimes can have effects beyond \nour imagination.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think that is what happened with the original 527 \nact. That does happen.\n  Mr. DODD. Hopefully, we can narrow that.\n  My colleague from Kentucky may want to be heard on this, but I \nrecommend the Senator withdraw the amendment. Obviously, as soon as she \nis ready to bring it back up for debate, we will accommodate her. If \nshe wants to bring back the amendment as crafted or whatever her \nversion will be, that will certainly be allowable. It would be a good \nway for us to proceed. I recommend that, if she is so inclined, and we \ncan all work together to try to achieve the result she desires.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am happy to withdraw the amendment. \nI did want to propose it and have the debate. I thought it would \nactually be acceptable. I think it will be in the end. I am happy to \nwork with the House to assure that there will be no blue slip problem. \nI think, on the merits, this is not a blue slip issue.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I missed part of the debate. Is the Senator saying she \nis going to withdraw the amendment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I was requested to withdraw the amendment so that we \nmight move forward.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest, if it is going to be continued to be \nconsidered in the course of this debate, it might be better to simply \nlay it aside. That keeps it in order. If it is certain that it will not \nbe dealt with in the context of this debate, then withdrawal will be \nappropriate. I missed the earlier discussion.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, the problem is that if you lay an \namendment aside, it takes unanimous consent to continue to lay it aside \nfor other matters to be brought up. Someone could object to that and \nprovoke a delay in the consideration of the bill. We should probably go \nwith withdrawal, with the commitment to the Senator that we will bring \nit back up.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have had a great deal of comity \nduring\n\n[[Page S2803]]\n\nthe course of this debate. The biggest problem Senator Dodd and I are \ngoing to have is accommodating amendments that Members haven't come \nover to offer. My concern is, the amendment of the Senator from Texas, \nhaving done what we asked her to do, which is come over and lay down \nher amendment, by withdrawing it, goes back into the herd that may or \nmay not get dealt with at the end. By simply setting it aside, she is \nin line. It gives an opportunity for discussions to continue with the \nSenator from Arizona and others who, I gather, think there might be \nsome way to work this out. She is still in line rather than sort of \ngetting sent back to the back of the bus. That is my advice to the \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate that. The problem is, we can't control what 98 \nother Senators want to do.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, with the staff of the Senator from Texas \nand our staff, if we work it out, which I am 90 percent sure we will, \nthen there is going to be no debate. We will bring it up and accept it. \nI don't think it will be too big a problem getting back in the queue on \nan amendment that is going to be basically accepted. If not, then it is \ngoing to be brought up, and we will have the full 3 hours of debate. I \nsuggest the Senator from Texas go ahead and withdraw it. Then we can \nbring it up after we have an agreement. We can have it done in 30 \nseconds, since we have already debated the underlying issue.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If I could make a parliamentary inquiry, if I \nwithdraw the amendment--I don't know if there has been a unanimous \nconsent that has limited amendments--I just want to make sure I don't \nlose any ability to consider the amendment. I don't want to be in line \nand cause one person to hold the bill up. Again, I am not in the game. \nI am just trying to have this amendment be agreed to. I think it will \nbe.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator will yield, we are in the process of \nworking on a list of amendments which will probably be completed by \nsometime Monday. Your amendment will certainly be on the list. What we \ndon't know, given the limited amount of time remaining between now and \nThursday night, is whether that guarantees its consideration.\n  The Senator from Arizona is correct; if Senators work it out, there \nwill be no problem. If they don't work it out, I don't want the Senator \nfrom Texas to think it is a certainty that we are going to be able to \nhandle all these amendments before we get to final passage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, I wish to make it clear, if we \nare not done by Thursday night, it will be done on Friday; if it is not \ndone on Friday, we will be on it Saturday; if we are not done on \nSaturday, Sunday; if not Sunday, Monday. We will make time for the \namendment of the Senator from Texas. We will not leave this legislation \nas long as I have the ability to keep us on it. If I don't, then all \namendments will go, and so it won't matter whether the amendment came \nup or not.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 111, Withdrawn\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, based on the assertions of the Senator \nfrom Arizona, the Senator from Connecticut and what the Senator from \nKentucky has said, that we will be a drawing up a list of amendments \nearly next week, I will withdraw the amendment and rely on the good \nfaith of everyone to work on this amendment to try to relieve the \ninequity without getting into the bill itself or damaging the bill \nitself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request to \nwithdraw the amendment? Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Texas. I hope she and the \nSenator from Arizona can work this out to their mutual satisfaction so \nwe can accommodate what I think is a very good idea.\n  Mr. DODD. May I make a parliamentary inquiry. Is not the pending \nbusiness the Specter amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Specter amendment \nwas set aside by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. DODD. Any motion to bring up an amendment requires unanimous \nconsent to lay that amendment aside, is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe the Senator from Illinois is here, and he \nwould like to offer an amendment. Building on the conversation Senator \nDodd just had with the Chair, I say to the Senator from Illinois, the \nSpecter amendment is the pending amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Specter amendment be temporarily set aside in order to give \nthe Senator from Illinois an opportunity to send his amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 144\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Fitzgerald] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 144.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that limits on contributions to candidates be \n        applied on an election cycle rather than election basis)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert:\n\n     SEC. ____. CONTRIBUTION LIMITS APPLIED ON ELECTION CYCLE \n                   BASIS.\n\n       (a) Individual Limits.--Section 315(a)(1)(A) of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(1)(A)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(A) to any candidate and the candidate's authorized \n     political committee during the election cycle with respect to \n     any Federal office which, in the aggregate, exceeds \n     $2,000;''.\n       (b) Multicandidate Political Committees.--Section \n     315(a)(2)(A) of such Act (2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(2)(A)) is amended \n     to read as follows:\n       ``(A) to any candidate and the candidate's authorized \n     political committees during the election cycle with respect \n     to any Federal office which, in the aggregate, exceed \n     $10,000;''.\n       (c) Election Cycle Defined.--Section 301 of such Act (2 \n     U.S.C. 431), as amended by section 101, is amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n       ``(25) Election Cycle.--The term `election cycle' means, \n     with respect to a candidate, the period beginning on the day \n     after the date of the previous general election for the \n     specific office or seat that the candidate is seeking and \n     ending on the date of the general election for that office or \n     seat.''\n       (d) Special Rules.--Section 315(a) of such Act (2 U.S.C. \n     441a(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) For purposes of this subsection--\n       ``(A) if there are more than 2 elections in an election \n     cycle for a specific Federal office, the limitations under \n     paragraphs (1)(A) and (2)(A) shall be increased by $1,000 and \n     $5,000, respectively, for the number of elections in excess \n     of 2; and\n       ``(B) if a candidate for President or Vice President is \n     prohibited from receiving contribution with respect to the \n     general election by reason of receiving funds under the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the limitations under \n     paragraphs (1)(A) and (2)(A) shall be decreased by $1,000 and \n     $5,000.''\n       (e) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) The second sentence of 315(a)(3) of such Act (2 U.S.C. \n     441a(a)(3)) is amended to read as follows: ``For purposes of \n     this paragraph, if any contribution is made to a candidate \n     for Federal office during a calendar year in the election \n     cycle for the office and no election is held during that \n     calendar year, the contribution shall be treated as made in \n     the first succeeding calendar year in the cycle in which an \n     election for the office is held.''\n       (2) Paragraph (6) of section 315(a) of such Act (2 U.S.C. \n     441a(a)(6)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(6) For purposes of paragraph (9), all elections held in \n     any calendar year for the office of President of the United \n     States (except a general election for such office) shall be \n     considered to be one election.''\n       (f) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to contributions made after the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I have an amendment to S. 27 that was \nactually proposed by my own campaign treasurer and, after I started to \nlook into it, I found out that the FEC had, in fact, made this very \nsame recommendation to President Clinton last year and this year to \nPresident Bush.\n  This is an amendment that will simplify the existing Federal election \ncode\n\n[[Page S2804]]\n\nlimits and simplify the bookkeeping and recordkeeping requirements of \nthe act without changing any of its substance.\n  Right now there is a contribution limit of $1,000 per primary and per \ngeneral election. Any individual can give up to $1,000 for the primary \nthat a candidate is in and another $1,000 for the general election. It \nis permissible under current law for candidates to actually ask their \ncontributors to give them $2,000 right now, as long as they designate \nthat $1,000 is for the primary and $1,000 is for the general election. \nAnd this system has been in place since the act first came into \nexistence in the early 1970s. The problem with the way the act is \nwritten is that if a contributor fails to designate which election \ntheir contribution is for, and that contributor has already given \n$1,000, and they give another $1,000, if they do not designate that \nthat contribution is for the succeeding election--say he already gave \n$1,000 for the primary, and he fails to designate that his additional \n$1,000 contribution is for the general election, then the candidate \nmust refund that $1,000, unless he gets the contributor to fill out a \nform saying for which election he or she designates the contribution.\n  This causes a lot of bookkeeping headaches for your treasurer. I am \nsure if you check with your own treasurer, Mr. President, he or she \nwould love this amendment. In fact, the treasurers of all 100 Senators \nwould immediately see the wisdom in my amendment.\n  My amendment would change that per election limit of $1,000 to a per \ncycle limit of $2,000. So, in other words, you would collect $2,000 \nfrom a contributor and not worry about whether the contributor has \ndesignated $1,000 for the primary and $1,000 for the general election.\n  Mr. President, the FEC, in their recommendation to the President--I \nam going to read what they said about this. They recommended that we \nchange this. It simply would save them a lot of time and staff \nresources, and it would also save our own campaigns a lot of time and \nbookkeeping headaches that are simply necessitated by the way the act \nis phrased. Instead of having a per cycle contribution limit, we have a \nper election limit, and we have to keep sending these redesignation \nforms to our contributors.\n  The FEC, in their letter to the President in March of this year, this \nmonth, wrote:\n\n       The Commission recommends that limits on contributions to \n     candidates be placed on an election cycle basis, rather than \n     current per election basis.\n\n  Their explanation for their recommendation was as follows:\n\n       The contribution limitations affecting contributions to \n     candidates are structured on a ``per election'' basis, thus \n     necessitating dual bookkeeping or the adoption of some other \n     method to distinguish between primary or general election \n     contributions. The Commission has had to adopt several rules \n     to clarify which contributions are attributable to which \n     election and to assure that contributions are reported for \n     the proper election. Many enforcement cases have been \n     generated where contributors' donations are excessive vis-a-\n     vis a particular election, but not vis-a-vis the $2,000 total \n     that could have been contributed for the cycle. Often, this \n     is due to donors' failure to fully document which election \n     was intended. Sometimes the apparent ``excessives'' for a \n     particular election turn out to be simple reporting errors \n     where the wrong box was checked on the reporting form. Yet, \n     substantial resources must be devoted to examination of each \n     transaction to determine which election is applicable. \n     Further, several enforcement cases have been generated based \n     on the use of general election contributions for primary \n     election expenses or vice versa.\n       Most of these complications would be eliminated with \n     adoption of a ``per cycle'' contribution limit. Thus, \n     multicandidate committees could give up to $10,000 and all \n     other persons could give up to $2,000 to an authorized \n     committee at any point during the election cycle. The \n     Commission and committees could get out of the business of \n     determining whether contributions are properly attributable \n     to a particular election, and the difficulty of assuring that \n     particular contributions are used for a particular election \n     could be eliminated.\n       Moreover, public law number 106-58 (the fiscal year 2000 \n     appropriations bill) amended the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act to require authorized candidate committees to report on a \n     campaign-to-date basis, rather than on a calendar year basis, \n     as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2001. Placing \n     the limits on contributions to candidates on an election \n     cycle basis would complement this change and streamline \n     candidate reporting.\n       It would be advisable to clarify that if a candidate \n     participates in more than two elections (e.g., in a post-\n     primary runoff as well as a primary in a general), the \n     campaign cycle limit would be $3,000. In addition, because \n     Presidential candidates might opt to take public funding for \n     the general election, but not the primary, and thereby be \n     precluded from accepting general election contributions, \n     $1,000/$5,000 ``per election'' contribution limits should be \n     retained for Presidential candidates.\n       A campaign cycle contribution limit would allow \n     contributors to give more than $1,000 toward a particular \n     primary or general election, but this would be balanced by \n     the tendency of campaigns to plan their fundraising and \n     manage their resources so as not to be left without \n     fundraising capability at a crucial time. Moreover, adoption \n     of this recommendation would eliminate the current \n     requirement that candidates who lose the primary election \n     refund or redesignate any contributions made for the general \n     election after the primary is over.\n\n  Mr. President, we have drafted an amendment to implement this \nrecommendation of the Federal Election Commission. The FEC general \ncounsel's office, I have been told, is OK with the amendment as \ndrafted. I will continue to be in touch with them over the weekend and \nover the next few days to see if we need to make any technical \nmodifications at all to implement their intentions.\n  The bottom line is that this amendment does not change at all the \nsubstance of the Federal election laws. It simply makes life a whole \nlot easier for candidates, especially for their financial departments, \nand in particular their campaign treasurers. This whole business of \nsending people letters and asking them to designate whether their \ncontribution is for the primary or the general and if they don't return \nthat designation, you have to refund their contribution--all of that, \nwhich is necessitated by the inadequate wording of the current law as \nit stands--is something we could avoid. It serves no public policy \npurpose that I can identify or that the FEC can identify.\n  This would simplify things for candidates, their campaigns, and for \nthe FEC. Presumably, it would free up some of the FEC's staff to focus \non more serious matters that could violate the spirit of the election \nlaws.\n  Mr. President, on that basis, I thank you for this opportunity to \nintroduce my amendment. I have shared it with both the Republican and \nDemocratic sides. I would like to have unanimous support for this \namendment. I can assure any Senator who votes against this amendment \nthat their campaign treasurers will not be happy with them. This will \nmake their lives easier. With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Fitzgerald. I wonder if \nthe title of this is the ``Fitzgerald Campaign Treasurers Protection \nAct.''\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. That should be the name of this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Or ``The Treasurers Relief Act.''\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes. The treasurers will love this amendment, and it \nwould cut down on postage expenses and a whole lot of headaches. I urge \nits unanimous adoption.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. First, I thank Senator Fitzgerald because I also have \nheard from people who have to keep track of this paperwork. It is \nvoluminous. It is difficult. It is not only an expenditure of money to \nmake sure that all of these reports are correct, but it is an enormous \nexpenditure of time as well.\n  It seems to me Senator Fitzgerald has an excellent idea. If I \nunderstood Senator Fitzgerald, there may be some technical corrections \nthat could be added to the amendment as a result of recommendations by \nthe FEC in order to make sure this is in keeping with the intent of the \namendment, I ask my friend.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes, we have been in contact with the general \ncounsel's office of the FEC. They just had the last few minutes for \nreview. They have told me they are OK with the amendment, but I want to \ngive them more time and have them scrub it over the weekend to make \nsure.\n  In my own mind, I do have a couple questions on which I want to be \nsatisfied. In particular, I have questions about how our amendment \naffects the requirement that you have to segregate money you have taken \nin the\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\nprimary and general. I want to talk to the FEC about that and see \nwhether my amendment fully comports with their intentions. I want an \nopportunity to make a technical correction later if it is required.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reclaiming my time, with the agreement of the managers, I \nwant to approve of this legislation pending technical corrections that \ncould be made which would not, obviously, change it but would be merely \ntechnical in nature to make sure the intent of the legislation is in \nkeeping with the fact the FEC is the expert on this matter.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois. I strongly support this amendment.\n  I point out, it may be helpful as we conduct this debate over ``hard \nmoney'' because some people say you can contribute $1,000 a year; well, \nthat really means $2,000 a cycle and the aggregates which are $20,000--\nwhat are they?\n  What we are talking about is how much can you contribute to an \nelection, which is every 2 years. It is valuable for us to have this \ninformation. I wish we were talking in those terms now. It would be \nclearer to people as to exactly how much hard money could be given in \nthe proposals I am sure inevitably we are going to engage in as to \nraising of hard money.\n  We would have a clear indication what that means to a candidate in an \nelection. I mention to my friend from Kentucky, we also ought to take \ninto consideration as we debate this issue of hard money--and I see my \nfriend from New York on the floor, too--how much it costs when we are \nspending this money; how much it costs for a minute of prime time on \nNew York City television on ``Monday Night Football,'' how much it \ncosts for a 30-second commercial on ``Friends.'' We all know in order \nto legitimize a candidacy, you need to be on television.\n  I am going to try to inject this in this debate as we go forward, as \nto how much money candidates are able to spend. It is an important \npart; that we not only consider how much they can raise but how much it \ncosts to run a campaign nowadays.\n  I thank my friend from Illinois. I strongly support the amendment. I \nyield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I, too, commend our colleague from Illinois. \nLast evening, a very diligent member of his staff caught me about 9 \no'clock with this proposal. I read it going back to my office. It \nlooked to me like a good idea then and it sounds like a good idea this \nmorning. The suggestion that the Senator from Arizona has made and that \nthe Senator from Illinois, in fact, has endorsed--that we take a day or \nso to run the trap, so to speak, on this to make sure there are not any \nunintended problems with this--is a wise suggestion. I endorse that.\n  My colleague from Kentucky can clarify this, but this may be the last \namendment we consider so it could actually be the pending business when \nwe come back in session.\n  This is a very sound idea. I know of a case that is related to this \nkind of circumstances. This goes back now more than 10 or 15 years ago, \nwhere a candidate held a series of fundraising events. The events were \n$100 events or $200 events. An individual actually contributed through \nthese five or six events, without keeping a good track of how much he \nhad actually contributed to the particular candidate. He exceeded the \ndollar amount by, I think, $50 or $75.\n  At any rate, the candidate then refunded the excessive portion of the \ncontributions over $1,000 limit. It might have been the individual had \ncontributed $1,200 or $1,050. Whatever the number was, it was \nrelatively minor. The candidate was then fined by the FEC because he \naccepted excessive contributions. Notwithstanding the fact that the \nexcessive portion had been timely refunded, the fact that the candidate \naccepted the contributions in excess of the ``per election'' $1,000 \nlimit triggered a fine.\n  The candidate was informed by the FEC that if he had gotten a hold of \nthe contributor and said, Didn't you mean the extra $50 was supposed to \ngo to the primary election, or, Didn't you intend for your wife to \ncontribute the $50, there would have been no fine in connection with \nthe overage. The affirmative act of refunding the excessive portion of \nthe contribution had no relevancy in terms of the allegation.\n  This amendment goes to part of that situation, and it is in \neveryone's interest, including the FEC, candidate and the contributor, \nto allow for a more efficient and effective method of streamlining this \nprocess than lending oneself to the possibility of an added bookkeeping \nproblem.\n  It seems to me like a very sound and commonsense amendment. I am \nhopeful the FEC will agree with that. We will take a look at that over \nthe weekend and keep the Senator and his staff informed as we ask these \nquestions. Maybe we can do it together, with the staffs, so they can be \nfully informed as to the FEC's response to this.\n  I am very confident this amendment, or some technical modification of \nit, can be unanimously adopted. I hope it can be unanimously adopted by \nthe Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Illinois for \nhis excellent amendment. We look forward to its adoption on Monday. I \nam unaware of any additional amendments to be laid down on our side. \nDoes the Senator from Connecticut have any on his side?\n  Mr. DODD. I have no additional amendments. My friend and colleague \nfrom New York has requested 5 minutes to speak, not on an amendment but \non the bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest I put us into morning business.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be a period for the transaction of \nmorning business----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield? I ask I be given 5 minutes at \nthe beginning of morning business because I have to catch a plane. \nOtherwise, I will speak on this bill and ask for 5 minutes now, if that \nis OK with my colleague from West Virginia as well. He has been \npatiently waiting. Whichever way you want to do it is OK with me.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I wish to alert my colleagues to another potential problem we face \nwith this legislation as it evolves. I think the debate has been \nexcellent. I compliment both the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut for a great job in handling this well, as well as \nSenator McCain and Senator Feingold for the job they have done in \nmoving this forward. Those of us who advocate reform are very heartened \nby what has happened this week. It seems that no killer amendments have \nbeen adopted. Lots of changes have been made--good changes but no \nkiller amendments.\n  Next week, of course, we know we face two known challenges and now \nthere is a third one to which I want to alert my colleagues. The first, \nof course, is severability. We know that is coming. The second is the \nHagel amendment. We know that is coming. The third relates to where \nthis debate has evolved.\n  Right now it seems the consensus around eliminating soft money is \ncongealing, but, in exchange, people say we should raise the hard money \nlimits, raise the limits an individual can give from $1,000 per \nelection, per cycle, to $2,000 or $3,000--there were proposals from the \nSenator from California and the Senator from Tennessee respectively on \nthat--but also to raise the aggregate limits, the $20,000 that somebody \ncan give to a party, the $25,000 of hard money that can be given.\n  I alert my colleagues to a potential problem, particularly if we \nraise these limits and do nothing else; and that is, what is the so-\ncalled 441(a)(d) money. That is money, of course, that the Federal \nparties are allowed to give to different candidates.\n  Right now it is limited. It is limited based on the population and \nthe voting population of the State. For instance, in my State of New \nYork, I think the limit is about $1.7 million and the party can give \n$1.7 million. It is probably considerably less in Connecticut or West \nVirginia or Arizona. It is larger in California.\n\n  The exact number is 2 cents multiplied by the voting agency \npopulation of the State.\n  What has happened, my colleagues, is this: There is a case that has \nalready\n\n[[Page S2806]]\n\nbeen argued before the United States Supreme Court. It is called FEC v. \nthe Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee. I happen to be an \namicus on this case, as are many of my colleagues, including Senator \nFeingold, among others. In the case, it has been argued that the limits \non the 441(a)(d) money should be entirely lifted, that a party can give \nunlimited money to a Senate or a House candidate.\n  That, in my judgment, in itself, could obliterate the whole intent of \nMcCain-Feingold, and it would be exacerbated dramatically if we raised \nthe limits--not so much the $1,000 going to $2,000 but the aggregate \nlimits: Take the proposal of my friend from Tennessee, that would \ntriple the limits, I believe. That means every year if a person gives \n$60,000 to a party, that party, if it so wishes, can give the $60,000 \nback to that person's State directly to the Senate campaign.\n  We may call that hard money, but that money is as soft a hard money \nas there ever was because the difference between hard money and soft \nmoney, particularly now with recent Supreme Court decisions that have \neliminated limits on party soft money, are now gone. So $60,000, to me, \nis as soft as money gets. You can call it hard because under the old \nlaw it is hard, but it is soft.\n  If we don't do something to reinstitute in whatever way possible the \n441(a)(d) limits, and particularly, if we raise the aggregate hard \nmoney limits--not the $1,000 but the aggregate limits--we will have \ntremendous trouble and we may find that the whole reform we have sought \ntoday is for naught. If you can't give the money directly to a \ncandidate or you can give the money not to the party in one way, and \ncan give it this other way under 441(a)(d) with no limit, we have real \ntrouble.\n  I say to my colleagues, with the help of Senators McCain and Feingold \nwe are working on a proposal to see if we can deal with this issue.\n  Mr. DODD. I would like to engage in this discussion. My colleague is \nmaking a very good point.\n  Only here could we be sitting around saying that a total contribution \namount of $25,000 per person annually is too low. If you take a husband \nand wife jointly that total amount becomes $50,000 annually, with the \npotential of each individual to cap his or her annual limit at $25,000 \neach. The most modest suggestion in other proposals, other than what is \nin S. 27, is to virtually double that annual amount. We are now talking \nabout a family giving $100,000 in contributions. People are now \nsuggesting that amount is too low. I find that stunning. What \npercentage of the American public are in a position to donate $100,000 \nto candidates a year? Or even under the current law at $25,000 annually \nfor individuals--not that many individuals can afford to participate at \nthat financial level. That amount exceeds the average income of a \nfamily of this country.\n  We start talking about campaigns and moaning as politicians that we \ncan't live in a situation where people are limited to giving us $25,000 \na year. I find it stunning this is even a part of this debate. We \nshould be focused on eliminating soft money, and yet here we are about \nto drive a Mack truck through the hard money, as if people understand \nthe distinction between soft and hard money. Money is money. I want to \nunderscore the point my colleague is making.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend from Connecticut who made the point \nextremely well.\n  You can call this hard if you want, but it is as soft as soft money \ncan be. Even in this Colorado case, most of the people who have watched \nthe case have said the Supreme Court, given the past, will get rid of \nthese limits, and then money just cascades in. There are no limits \nwhatever.\n  I think if the 441(a)(d) limits are eliminated and we raise the hard \nmoney aggregate limits, there are a lot of candidates who will not \nbother to raise the $1,000 and $2,000 because they can do it in these \nbig chunks. We ought to be very careful about this.\n  As I mentioned, I am trying to craft language that deals with this \nproblem, but the Senator from Connecticut makes an excellent point. \nUntil we have that kind of language in place, to even think of raising \nhard money aggregate limits would be a serious mistake.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I made a miscalculation, I apologize. I underestimated \ntheir generosity. I said $100,000, if you again combined a husband and \nwife, each with a $100,000 annual contribution cap. The new joint \nannual limit becomes $200,000. I forgot the limit is per calendar year \nhere, but an election cycle means two years, so we are talking $200,000 \nper election cycle for a couple. I apologize to the Americans who want \nto contribute $200,000. I was depriving them of an initial $100,000. An \nelection cycle is a 2-year time period.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I guess that would mean for us that could be $600,000--\nyes, $600,000 because we run every 6 years. To get behind a \nPresidential candidate early on, it could be $400,000.\n  This is absurdity. This is a mockery of what we are trying to do. I \nhope we will be able, together, to fix this.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my friend from New York. For purposes of \nedification, I know many of my colleagues and staffs are familiar with \nthis, but perhaps other people may be interested in this discussion. \nToday, of course, we have limitations. Under current law, a candidate \ncan receive $1,000 per election, or $1,000 for the election and $1,000 \nfor the primary, so $2,000 is what most people do. That is per \nelection, per individual. You then can contribute to PACs if you so \ndesire, $5,000 per calendar year, and if you do it as a couple, of \ncourse, it is $5,000 for the individual, and $10,000 to the PAC. You \ncan give $5,000 per calendar year to the State and local parties, you \ncan give $20,000 a calendar year to the national parties with aggregate \nlimits per calendar year of $25,000.\n  That is what current law is. Every suggestion, including the \nunderlying bill, raises that. S. 27 raises the aggregate amount. \nSenator Hagel, our friend from Nebraska, raises it to $75,000 per \ncalendar year. Senator Thompson of Tennessee raised it to $75,000 and \nSenator Feinstein has it to $50,000 per calendar year.\n  It is important for people to know it is per calendar year per \nindividual. Normally, in the real world in politics, with a husband and \nwife, they each write checks, so take each of those numbers and double \nthem. All Members know this. I am not stating something that is bizarre \nto my colleagues. That is how you do this. You ask the husband and \nwife, so you get double those amounts.\n  So we are talking, in one of the more modest proposals, Senator \nFeinstein, that is $100,000 per calendar year, over 2 years it is \ndoubling.\n  As I said a moment ago, only in this world could we be talking about \nthe hardships being imposed on us as candidates by limiting people to \n$100,000 to $200,000 in hard money contributions to our election or \nreelection efforts.\n  The underlying purpose of McCain-Feingold is to try and reduce the \namount of money in politics. Their focus is on soft money. I applaud \nthat. I support that.\n  What Senator Feingold said the other day is worth repeating: We need \nto stop assuming that there is a guarantee, almost by natural law, an \nassumption of exponential growth in the cost of campaigns; that that is \nnothing we can do anything about.\n  I reject that idea. I realize there will be increases in costs, but \nas I mentioned the other day, a statewide campaign from a few hundred \nthousand dollars to multimillion dollars average cost of Senator races \nin this country, does not have to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n  What Senator McCain and Senator Feingold are attempting to do, as are \nthose of us who support what they are trying to do, is see if we can't \nslow this down, put some brakes on before this just becomes an \nabsurdity where only a tiny fraction of Americans could only hope to \nseek a seat in the Senate or the House of Representatives.\n  Back in the founding days of this country, we had limitations on \nthose who could hold public office. Only white males who owned property \nin the 13 original colonies could hold public office. We have \neliminated all of those conditions, thank God, years ago. De jure, \nthere are no limitations on who can sit in this body except by age and \ncitizenship, and some other problems you can't have had--you can't be a \nfelon and run. But aside from that, we don't put on limitations. But \nwhat has\n\n[[Page S2807]]\n\nhappened de facto, if not de jure, is we have created a barrier for \nmost Americans to ever think about having a seat in the House or Senate \nbecause, de facto, the cost of getting here is prohibitive. Either you \nhave to have the money yourself, or you have to have access to the kind \nof dollars that would allow you to be a candidate in a statewide Senate \nrace in the year 2001.\n  What Senator McCain and Senator Feingold and those of us who are \nsupporting them are trying to do is see if we can't change this \nassumption, this assumption that there is nothing or very little we can \ndo about this, and we are just going to continue to raise the amount of \nmoney we can raise from individuals and groups and go to political \naction committees, to national parties, and State parties. Instead, we \nsay: Enough is enough; 25 years of this exponential growth--we ought to \nbe able to do something to slow this down. And that is what we are \ntrying to do.\n  S. 27 allows for increases. McCain-Feingold allows for doubling \ncontributions, if a few instances, one being a calendar year from \n$5,000 to $10,000. We have the same amount as currently permitted going \nto national parties, and we have an aggregate limit increasing from \n$25,000 to $30,000 per year.\n  How many people in this country can write a check for $30,000 for \nFederal officeholders? And I am told that is too low. Too low? Too \nlow?--$30,000 a calendar year, to write checks for politicians, is too \nlow?\n  You would be laughed out of my State, the most affluent State on a \nper capita basis, if you stood and said this is too little. And that \nis, in effect, what we are saying. I don't think it is too little. We \nwould do ourselves, this institution, and the political process a world \nof good by adopting the McCain-Feingold approach and living with it and \nlearning how to live with the spirit, as well as the law, of S. 27.\n  The adoption of the Torricelli amendment the other day, which I think \ncould save millions of dollars for candidates by insisting that these \ntelevision stations not charge in excess of the lowest unit rate \ncharge, will contribute significantly to our slowing down the rising \ncost of campaigns. And some of the other provisions that have been \nintroduced to allow for a more expeditious and efficient way of \nreporting will help as well.\n  Before we close out the debate on this subject, I wanted to say after \nthe first week of debate, this has been one of the more enlightening \ndebates I have been a part of in the time I have been in the Senate. We \nhave had very few quorum calls. We have had terrific participation by \nMembers concerned about this issue in the form of offering their ideas \nand thoughts by amendment. It has been one of the better moments in the \nSenate in the last number of years, in my view. So I commend my \ncolleagues for that.\n\n  I hope next week will be as enlightening and as helpful as we move \nforward. The hope is the ultimate adoption of the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation--as is, with some of the improvements I know my colleagues \nwill be offering.\n  I prefer we come along next week having made the positive changes we \nhave made over this past week and ending up doing what some of these \nproposals suggest since the ideas are coming from both sides of the \nisle. But anybody who stands up and suggest to me that the reality--\ndon't try to play games by what you write--this $50,000 per person per \ncalendar year--cannot expect to smuggle the $50,000 through as the \nreality. The reality is it generally is per individual and spouse, \nwhich means as a practical matter, it is usually $100,000 per family. \nAs a result, in an election cycle of 2-years, it is $200,000. If \nsomeone thinks they are going to smuggle that past this Member as a \nmodest request, they have another consideration to make.\n  It is outrageous, excessive--there is nothing modest about it. It is \nwhat contributes to the feeling that so many Americans have about the \npolitical process in this country today. I look forward to the coming \ndebate next week. It could get testy if we think these numbers are \ngoing to fly through without significant debate. Some of us Members \nthink there are already ample limitations on contributions for \nindividuals and ample room for people to make significant contributions \nin the political process.\n  Senator Wellstone made the point last week that it is less than one-\nhalf of 1 percent of the American public who make contributions of \n$1,000. Mr. President, 99 percent of the American public cannot even \nthink about that level of contribution. I know for a fact most \ncandidates will not bother with that 99 percent of the American public \nand ask for their financial help.\n  If you can get the $1,000, $2,000 and $3,000 contributions, then that \nis the pond you are going to fish in. You are not going to go out and \nraise money in $50 and $20 and $100 contributions from average \ncitizens.\n  I think there is something terribly dangerous about excluding average \npeople from financially participating in the political life of America. \nThat is what we are doing. That is the reality of it. There is not a \nsingle candidate who will bother with these people except to create \nsome political event but not as a fundraiser. You will not be raising \nmoney from average Americans. You will be going after the big-dollar \ngivers, and there are only a handful in this country who can make those \ncontributions. The idea that we have to double and triple the size of \nthat contribution limit is shameful.\n  I look forward to the debate next week. Hopefully the majority of my \ncolleagues will reject those unnecessary increases in hard money \nindividual contributions.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I did not see my friend from West \nVirginia behind me. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/23/senate-section/article/S2807-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate Budget Committee held \nits last hearing on the President's budget plan prior to the Senate \nconsideration of the budget resolution. As a new member of the Budget \nCommittee, I would like to take a moment to commend Chairman Domenici \nand ranking member Conrad for a series of thought-provoking hearings on \nthe future challenges facing our Social Security and Medicare programs, \non our efforts to improve the education of our children, and to address \nour Nation's infrastructure deficit and national security needs.\n  During the hearing yesterday, I inquired of--we often say ``our good \nfriend,'' my good friend Senator Domenici. When I say ``my good \nfriend,'' I mean just that; my good friend, Senator Domenici--about the \nprospects for the Budget Committee marking up the budget resolution \nprior to the April 1 reporting deadline contained in the Budget Act.\n  Let me say at the beginning of my remarks, again, I am a new member \nof the Budget Committee. Of course I was around 27 years ago when we \ncreated the Budget Committee, and I took a very considerable interest \nin the preparation of the Budget Act in 1974. I spent a great deal of \ntime on it. So although I come as a new member of the committee, I am \nnot wholly unaware of the fact that I have been around as long as the \ncommittee has and perhaps a little longer--longer than the Act itself.\n  One thing I try to remember is not to take myself too seriously. \nSometimes it is pretty hard to avoid taking one's self too seriously. I \ntry studiously to avoid that.\n  But I do take seriously the work of that committee. We have a great \nchairman. Senator Domenici is a very diligent Senator.\n  The Bible says: ``Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall \nstand before kings.''\n  Senator Domenici is diligent in his business. I have no doubt that he \nhas stood before kings in his tenure as a Senator.\n  I admire him on top of all these things. I think he is a congenial \nperson. I like him. It doesn't make any difference how this situation \ncomes out--what the outcome of the budget action may or may not be. It \nisn't going to intervene in my admiration and my affection for Senator \nDomenici,\n\n[[Page S2808]]\n\nthe Senator from New Mexico. We happen on this question to be a little \nbit at loggerheads with respect to our viewpoints. But who am I to say \nI am all right and he is all wrong?\n  I say the same thing with regard to my leader on this side, Mr. \nConrad. He is the ranking member of the Budget committee. I am not. I \nam just one of the new members. But my interest comes from elsewhere \nthan just the fact that I am a new member on that committee.\n  I am not trying to rock the boat, or get out in front of the \ncommittee. I am here because I am a U.S. Senator. I love the Senate. I \nhave been in the Senate more than half of my life. I respect its rules. \nI love its traditions, its folklore, its history. But I am exceedingly \nconcerned about the way we are doing things in the Senate in these \ntimes.\n  I am only here for a little while, as we all are. But while I am \nhere, I want to uphold the traditions and the rules of the Senate, \nbecause men who were far greater than I am wrote this Constitution. On \nJuly 16, 1787, they reached a compromise, which is often referred to in \nhigh school as ``The Great Compromise.'' It was out of that Great \nCompromise that this institution, the Senate, came into being. It was \nthat compromise of July 16, 1787, that made possible my coming here as \none of the two Senators who represent the State of West Virginia. It \nwasn't West Virginia when those forebears wrote this Constitution that \nI hold in my hand. It wasn't a State of the Union at that time. My \nState, which I love and share in that love along with Senator Jay \nRockefeller, was borne out of the crucible of the Civil War. It became \na State, and is the only State to have been born during the great war \nbetween the States.\n  But because those forebears, whose names were signed to this \nConstitution, arrived at that Great Compromise, we have this Senate. \nOtherwise, the Presiding Officer would not be here as a Senator from \nthe State of Rhode Island. All the people who work here and our \nwonderful staff wouldn't be here. This ornate Chamber probably would \nnot be here. There wouldn't be two Houses in the legislative branch.\n  So once in a while we have to stop and think about these things.\n  How did I come to be here? What do I mean by ``be here''? What is \nthis institution? Why do we have a Senate? Why not just have a House of \nRepresentatives?\n\n  The answers to those questions go back into the centuries.\n  Why do we have a legislative branch?\n  Is ours a Republic? Is ours a democracy? What is the difference?\n  Look at Hamilton's essay denominated No. 10 among the Federalist \nPapers. Look at No. 10. Look at No. 14 and one will get a clear \nunderstanding of the difference between a pure democracy and a \nRepublic. Ours is a Republic.\n  What does that mean? That means that the people across the land \nparticipate in their government through elected representatives.\n  Think of that. In a pure democracy, the people of my hometown of \nSophia could very well have a pure democracy. There are only about \n1,183 people in that town. They could all meet. They could make their \nown laws. They could execute their own laws. They could have a pure \ndemocracy.\n  But this is a nation spread from sea to shining sea with 280 million \npeople. They could not all gather in one place at one time and act for \nthemselves. So they elect us. We are the directly elected \nrepresentatives of the people.\n  The President of the United States is not directly elected by the \npeople. He is directly elected by the electors which are chosen in each \nState by the people. But we Senators represent and speak for the \npeople. And every 2 years, or every 6 years, whichever it may be, \nMembers of the other body and Members of this body have to go home and \nstand for reelection.\n  So we represent the people. I represent, along with my colleague, Jay \nRockefeller, 1.8 million people. But our votes--our votes--West \nVirginia's votes in this Senate are as important and are the very equal \nof the votes of the Senators from the great State of California. If it \nwere a country by itself, California would probably be about No. 7 or \nNo. 8 among all the countries of the world--a great State, a huge \nState, with a tremendous population that would dwarf the size of the \npopulation of my own mountain State of West Virginia.\n  But because of this Constitution, this Senate is a forum of the \nStates, and West Virginia has just as much voice as does California, or \nNew York, or Texas, or Florida, or Illinois, or Pennsylvania--States \nwhose populations greatly outnumber that of West Virginia. So this \ninstitution is the forum of the States. At the same time, it is made up \nof Members who are elected by, and who represent, the people of the \nUnited States.\n  Now this is a long way of saying these things which are not new to \nany of the people who are listening. But once in a while we need to be \nreminded.\n  Why do I take the floor today to talk about the budget? And what does \nall this that I have said got to do with the budget? What does it have \nto do with what we are doing in the Budget Committee? That is the \nproblem. We do not pause and remember why we are here, and whom we \nrepresent here. We represent the people. We represent the States.\n  I am not the ranking member of this Budget Committee. I am not the \nchairman of it. But I am a member of it. I did not seek to become a \nmember until this year. All these years since the act has been on the \nlaw books of this country, I never sought to be on the Budget \nCommittee. But I saw that the Budget Committee, more and more and more, \nwas becoming the major wheel in the constitutional system of this \ncountry--more and more things are being decided in that committee--and, \nas one who helped to write the legislation, I must say that it was not \nintended to become that. The Budget Committee was not intended to have \nall the power it has today. It never was intended to be used as it is \nbeing used today.\n\n  So I have become increasingly concerned about the fact that the \nBudget Committee of the Senate--this is no reflection on its members or \nanything of that nature, it is just a fact that what that Budget \nCommittee does this year, will have a major impact on the work of all \nthe other committees, and on the work of the Senate throughout this \nyear.\n  So that brings me now to what I want to say today.\n  I was disappointed to learn that Senator Domenici was not planning to \nhave a committee markup. Now, he and I had discussed this privately on \na couple of occasions. But apparently he reached that decision and so \nindicated during the last session the committee had, which was \nyesterday. He indicated that, given the 11-11 split on the committee, \nit would not be productive--in his way of looking at things--to go \nthrough the markup process. And following the hearing yesterday, I came \ndown to the floor to express my disappointment that the chairman was \nnot planning a markup, and--no reflection on him, nothing personal in \nwhat I say--I spoke on the floor. He indicated to me, by written note \nearlier yesterday, that he would be responding to what I had to say.\n  And everything is just fine between the chairman and myself. I have \nto remember that I am 83 years of age. I do not have a long life ahead \nof me, and one of these days I have to meet someone who is much more \npowerful than Senator Domenici or Senator Lott or President Bush or \nanybody else. I will have to give an accounting for my work here, for \nmy stewardship in this life. So I want to be able to leave this Senate \nwith the good will of every Senator. I hope I have that. I am sure I do \nas far as Senator Domenici is concerned.\n  So he notified me that he would be speaking. Last evening I had to go \nsomewhere. I do not often accept invitations to dinner. I like to have \ndinner with my wife, to whom I have been married almost 64 years, and \nwith my little dog Billy when I can do so, so I do not accept many \ninvitations.\n  One could spend all of his or her time in this town as a Senator by \nrunning here and there and thither and yonder and thither and letting \nthe work on his desk pile up. But I found out a long time ago that \nthere was not much to be had, not much that was important that went on \nat these cocktail parties, and so on, around this town. I could speak \nquite at length on that subject, but I will try to avoid getting off on \nto that, except to say that I could not come up at that point to the \nfloor and participate or listen to Senator Domenici and all he had to \nsay.\n\n[[Page S2809]]\n\n  Therefore, this morning I said to Senator Domenici: I haven't seen \nthe Record yet. I want to see what is in the Record. I understand you \nmade a fine talk, and I heard just a little bit of it, but I couldn't \ncome up. So I may have something to say today after I look at the \nRecord.\n  So he said: That's fine.\n  And here I am.\n  We had many excellent, knowledgeable witnesses at our hearings, and \nour members engaged in spirited, incisive, and deep, probing \nquestioning. When the Senate takes up the budget resolution, I believe \nthe Senate should have the benefit of the committee's views.\n\n  Now, the Senate, in 1816, began to formulate the major committees. \nThey have not always been around. There were committees in the very \nfirst week of the Senate's meetings. There were temporary committees, \nad hoc committees, whatever, appointed to deal with this or that or \nsomething else. But in 1816, the major committees really began to take \nshape. Among those early committees, of course, were the committees \nthat dealt with foreign affairs and the finances of the Government. It \nwas not until 1867 that the Appropriations Committee came into being as \na separate committee. The work of the Appropriations Committee was done \nby the Finance Committee. And in 1867, if I am not mistaken, the \nAppropriations Committee came into being.\n  By virtue of my seniority on that committee, I, at length--after 30 \nyears, I believe it was, on the committee--I became, lo and behold, the \nchairman. So I take these things pretty seriously, having been chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee. And knowing what impact the Budget \nCommittee of the Senate is having and what some of its decisions are \nhaving on the operations of the Senate, I decided I wanted to be on \nthat committee. So again I say, here I am.\n  I also believe that when the Senate takes up the budget resolution, \nit should have the benefit of the committee's views.\n  Why do we have committees? They are the little legislatures, you \nmight say, in the institution here. The members of the committees have \na very special understanding of the work over which the respective \ncommittee or committees have jurisdiction. The views of those committee \nmembers are very important. In many instances, I have been guided by my \ndecisions on matters, on votes and so on, by what the members of the \ncommittee having jurisdiction over the subject had to say. They are the \nspecialists. They give their time, their talents, dealing with that \nparticular subject matter, whatever it may be.\n  Members of the Senate need to know what the views are of the members \nof the committee with respect to the legislation before the Senate.\n  As I say, I am not saying something that is teaching anybody \nanything, but it may be that some of our people out there who are \nwatching through those electronic goggles up by the Presiding Officer's \ndesk, it may be that what I am saying will mean a little something to \nthose people, that they will have a better understanding of what we are \ntalking about. They need to be informed. Woodrow Wilson said the \ninforming function of the legislative branch is as important as the \nlegislative function. We need to be informed.\n  It is more difficult to keep informed on subject matters of today \nthan it was when I came to the Congress 49 years ago this year. There \nare a lot more things about which to be informed. We didn't have a lot \nof the laws on the books then that we have today. We didn't have as \nmany agencies in Government then as we have today. We didn't have the \nInterstate Highway System that we have today. We didn't have the \nAppalachian Regional Commission or the Appalachian regional highways \nthen that we have today. We didn't have the Clean Air Act; we have it \ntoday. We didn't have the Clean Water Act then, but we have it today. \nWe have much more today to be informed about than we had in those days. \nThat is why I am concerned about what is happening with respect to the \nbudget which will be coming up in the Congress shortly.\n\n  That is a long way around to tell you, but you need to know that \nthese are important matters that affect you, you the people, we the \npeople. It is the impact on you. It isn't that I am a new member of the \nBudget Committee and I ought to have all this information and I am \nquibbling over this and quibbling over that. No, I am not quibbling at \nall. This is serious business. It is your business.\n  I believe the public would greatly benefit by having a markup in the \ncommittee. Having been the appropriations chairman, let me say what a \nmarkup is. The chairman, with his staff, develops, based on the budget \nthe President sends up to the Congress, based on the hearings that have \nbeen conducted in the Appropriations Committee, and draws up an \nappropriations bill. It may be different from the appropriations bill \nthat came over from the House of Representatives. Not by the \nConstitution but by custom, appropriations bills generally originate in \nthe House of Representatives, unlike tax bills, which, according to the \nConstitution, must originate in the House of Representatives.\n  So I, as chairman, and my staff director, Mr. English, who has been \nthe staff director on the Democratic side for a good many years, and \nothers, sit down and look at this bill and say, this is it. Then I \nalways made it a point to call Senator Hatfield, who then was a Member \nof the Senate from Oregon, who was the ranking member at that time. We \nsaid: This is the plan. We have this amount of money allocated, and \nhere is the way it will be allocated.\n  That is the markup. Then the whole committee sits down and looks at \nthat. Republicans and Democrats alike sit down together and look at \nthis bill. That is called marking up the bill. We may change it. The \nwhole committee may not like an item. We may have to strike it, or they \nmay want to add an item. In any event, that is the legislative process \n101, as it pertains to appropriations.\n  Yesterday I expressed my dismay also that the administration has \ndelayed from April 3 to April 9 the delivery date for details of the \nPresident's budget. The Senate is being asked to consider a $2 trillion \ntax cut that is estimated to consume 80 percent of the non-Social \nSecurity, non-Medicare surplus over the next 10 years. Yet the details \non over $20 billion of program cuts for just one fiscal year apparently \nwill not be available to the Senate when it is scheduled to debate the \nbudget resolution on the week of April 2.\n  Last evening Senator Domenici sent me a letter, as I say, and came \ndown to the floor to respond to my concerns. I thank him for responding \nquickly, but I am disappointed by his message. In his remarks he noted \nthat in 1993, the first year of the Clinton administration, the details \nof the President's budget were sent to the Congress on April 8 and the \nDemocratic leadership completed the budget resolution for President \nClinton's budget prior to delivery of those details.\n  Senator Domenici said that the schedule for consideration of the \nbudget resolution this year is in accord with the schedule in 1993 and \nthat the schedule for consideration of the budget resolution of 1993 \nshould serve as a role model for how to proceed this year.\n  Mr. President, Senator Domenici is absolutely correct in his \ndescription of the facts, but he missed my point. As I say, I have \nalerted Senator Domenici's office to the fact that I am going to say \nthese things. I am not going to say anything to hurt his feelings or \nanything like that. He has been around here; he is a pro. He \nunderstands. He missed my point.\n  We have a 50/50 Senate. The Republican leaders should not be setting \nup a process that rams the President's budget through the Senate. We \nshould be debating the budget, and we should be trying to reach an \nagreement on a budget. I don't mean we should displace the business \nbefore the Senate right now to do that. But this thing is coming; it is \na train that is coming right down the track. That Senate process should \nstart in the Senate Budget Committee with a markup.\n  As I say, I am not taking myself all that seriously as somebody \ntrying to tell the Budget Committee how to do its work. That is not it. \nI am not looking at that. That is not it. I am concerned that the \nimpact this process will have on the Senate, on its membership--the \nfinal outcome of this budget action--and on the country is a far-\nreaching impact.\n\n[[Page S2810]]\n\n  As Senator Domenici pointed out in his remarks last night, in 1993 \nthe Senate Budget Committee had a markup--get that--the Senate Budget \nCommittee had a markup on March 11 and debated and approved the budget \nresolution, which was filed on March 12. The markup was held in 1993, \njust as there has been a markup in every other year since the Budget \nCommittee was established. Yet apparently the distinguished chairman, \nSenator Domenici, does not want to have a markup this year. He has very \nplainly, forthrightly, and honestly said so. He doesn't make any bones \nabout it, and I admire him for that.\n  In his remarks last evening, the chairman mentioned the first Clinton \nbudget document, entitled ``A Vision of Change For America.'' Here it \nis--``A Vision of Change For America.'' It is dated February 17, 1993. \nThis morning, after briefly reviewing that document, I find that \nseveral sections have applications to the issues we face today. That \n1993 document noted--lend me your ears, friends, ``Romans''; lend me \nyour ears. Here is what the 1993 document said:\n\n       For more than a decade, the Federal Government has been \n     living well beyond its means--spending more than it takes in, \n     and borrowing the difference. The annual deficits have been \n     huge.\n       Deficit reduction is not an end in itself. It is a means to \n     the end of higher productivity, rising living standards and \n     the creation of high wage jobs. In short, it is about \n     securing a better economic future for ourselves and, even \n     more importantly, our children. Huge structural deficits are \n     harmful for a simple reason: when the economy is not in \n     recession, each dollar the Federal Government borrows to \n     finance consumption spending absorbs private savings that \n     would otherwise be used to increase productive capacity. \n     Large, sustained budget deficits mean that we must either \n     reduce our investment at home or borrow the money overseas.\n  This 1993 document went on to say:\n\n       The drain on our savings has caused anemic domestic \n     investment, especially in comparison with most advanced \n     industrial countries. It has retarded growth in productivity \n     and living standards. Meanwhile, borrowing from the rest of \n     the world to maintain investment at even today's depressed \n     levels has increased interest payments to foreign leaders. In \n     effect, we have signed over some of the fruits of today's \n     productivity--enhancing investments to the children of \n     Europe and Japan, rather than preserving them for our own \n     [children].\n\n  ``A Vision of Change For America'' laid out a plan for addressing the \ndeficits that were created by the excessive tax cuts of 1981. It was a \n5-year plan, not a 10-year plan, and it put us on a course to eliminate \nthe colossal deficits of the 1980s and early 1990s. Page 115 of that \ndocument included the following:\n\n       The plan promises rising standards of living, productivity \n     and national savings. It stimulates growth and provides \n     insurance that the current slow recovery will be lasting and \n     strong.\n\n  There are not many predictions one can believe in around here, but \nthat was one we all saw come to fruition.\n  Continuing my quotation:\n\n       It invests in education, training and health of our people. \n     It encourages the private sector to modernize and acquire the \n     tools and technology to compete in the global economy. And it \n     confronts our deficit head on.\n\n  That is what this book said in 1993.\n\n       It confronts our deficits head on, with a serious, fair \n     plan to bring it under control and generate economic growth.\n\n  So that plan worked. It worked. Instead of the colossal deficits \nwhich confronted the Senate at that time, today we have--according to \nthe projections which may or may not come true--colossal surpluses. How \nmany on the Republican side voted for that plan? Zero. Not a single \nvote in either body--not one. Not one. My good friend from New Mexico \nsays that ought to be a role model--that budget--that budget plan, as \noutlined in the book titled ``A Vision of Change For America.'' Not \none. Not one. Not one voted for that.\n  The first question that was ever asked, I believe, in the history of \nmankind was, Where art thou? God walked in the Garden of Eden, when the \nshades of the day were falling and when the cool of the evening was on \nthe forehead of Paradise. God walked in the garden. He was looking for \nAdam and Eve. He said: Adam, where art thou? That was the first \nquestion: Adam, where art thou?\n  In thinking about the votes that were cast on the plan, that \nmarvelous plan which my good friend, Mr. Domenici, called to our \nattention on yesterday and which he said was a role model, one could \nhave rightly asked from this side of the aisle: Where art thou? Where \nart thou? Not one of our friends over here on my right who belong to a \ngreat political party, the Republican Party--by the way, I get lots of \nvotes from Republicans in West Virginia. I am proud of them. But not \none, not one answered: Here am I. Not one.\n  That was the role model, Mr. Domenici said. They did not follow that \nrole model when it came to votes on that occasion.\n  That is why I take the time of the Senate to review these passages, \nbecause we are being asked to take up a budget resolution on April 2 \nwithout the benefit of a Budget Committee markup and without the \nbenefit of a detailed budget from the President.\n  As has been pointed out, this will not be the first occasion when we \ndid not have a detailed description of the President's budget, but \nthere are significant differences in that time and our time.\n  We are also told by the Republican leaders that the core of the \nPresident's budget, a $2 trillion tax cut, may be brought to the floor \nas a reconciliation bill for which debate is limited to, at most, 20 \nhours. Now get that. They say that these moneys are the people's money. \nThey are your money. We are talking about a $2 trillion tax cut. That \nis the President's proposal, as I have read about it in the press--a $2 \ntrillion tax cut. That is a lot of money. We are not used to counting \nmoney in sums of that size down in West Virginia.\n\n  How much is $1 trillion? Have you ever stopped to think? We talk \nabout it as though it were just a few dollars. I have three $1 bills in \nmy hands.\n  By the way, when I married my wife 64 years ago, on the next day \nafter we married, I gave her my pocketbook. I had been working as a \nmeat cutter in a coal company store. My salary was $70 a month--$70 a \nmonth. She was a coal miner's daughter, and I grew up in a coal miner's \nhome. We never had anything as far as refrigerators or vacuum cleaners. \nAs a matter of fact, some of those inventions did not come along very \nmuch in advance of the year we married.\n  I said to my wife: Here's my wallet. We were walking down the \nrailroad tracks. That is the only place we had. We did not have any \nfine streets, shaded avenues, boulevards beautiful in their makeup. We \nhad to walk down the railroad tracks.\n  I gave her my pocketbook, and I said--now this was 64 years ago. I \ngave her my pocketbook. I said: You keep the money. I will work and \nmake it--I won't make much, but whatever I make, you will have. When I \nwant a dollar or two, I will come to you and ask for it. And I have \ndone that for 64 years.\n  This morning she said: Do you need any money?\n  I said: No, I have $3.75, and I am taking my lunch so I don't have to \ngo down to the Senators' dining room and spend 30 or 40 minutes waiting \non somebody to help me with food and then have to spend $8, $10, or $12 \nto pay for it. I just take my little lunch, and there is my $3 I have \nfor the day. You can ask her; she will verify everything I have said.\n  Why do I say that? We are talking about $2 trillion. How long would \nit take you to count $1 trillion at the rate of $1 per second? How long \nwould it take you to count $1 trillion at the rate of $1 per second? \nThirty-two thousand years. A trillion means a little more if I look at \nit in that way.\n  What I am saying is that we are told by the Republican leaders that \nthe core of the President's budget, a $2 trillion tax cut--that is your \nmoney, and they say we ought to give it back. But it is also your debt, \nit is also your schools that are falling down; the windows are broken, \nthe plumbing out of shape; it is your schools; those crowded classrooms \nout there are your classrooms. It is your children. It is your parents \nwho need health care, who need a prescription drug plan. Yes, it is \nyour money, but in our scheme of things, we are elected by you to be \nthe stewards of your money.\n  It is your highways on which you travel. It is the safety of your \nhighways that you have to depend upon when your wives take the children \nto the doctor or to the child care center, or you have to go to the \nhospital, or\n\n[[Page S2811]]\n\nyou have to go to the store, or you go to church, or you have to drive \nto work. It is your safety on your highways for which we are \nresponsible. You cannot build the highways yourself. West Virginia \ncannot build a national system of highways, but the Federal system is \nwhat the people were talking about--those framers--when they wrote this \nConstitution--the Federal system.\n  It is your money. It is a $2 trillion tax cut. What a whale of an \namount of money. It may be brought to the floor, we hear, as a \nreconciliation bill for which debate is limited to, at most, 20 hours--\n20 hours of debate, that is all. Yet it is your money. It is this \nbudget with its colossal $2 trillion tax cut that may return us to the \ndeficit ditch that the 1993 plan helped us to claw our way out of after \n12 years of huge deficits; that 1993 plan which my friend, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, referred to yesterday as a model. That is the plan \nthat helped us to scratch and crawl and dig our way out of that deficit \nditch. It is a role model. Where were you? Where art thou? Where were \nyou? the people might ask. The 1993 plan.\n  Last week, all of the Democratic members of the Budget Committee \nwrote to Senator Domenici and urged him to schedule a markup.\n  I joined with my colleagues and urged Chairman Domenici not to take \nthe unprecedented step of failing to mark up a budget resolution. If we \ndon't mark it up, it will send a dangerous message to the Senate about \nthe prospects for working on a bipartisan basis in this evenly divided \nbody.\n  President Bush, upon several occasions during the campaign, talked \nabout the bickering, the infighting, the bitter partisanship that was \noccurring in Washington. He said he wanted to stop it. He wanted to end \nit. He wanted to do something about it. He is right. And the people \nwant to end it. That is why they sent 50 of us to sit on this side and \n50 to sit on that side in this Senate. That is the only time that has \never happened--50-50. It has happened 37-37 upon an occasion, several \ndecades ago, but never 50-50, which is a tie vote here.\n  If there is ever a time when we ought to have partisanship, it isn't \nnow. We need to work in a bipartisan manner. The President wants that. \nI have great respect for this President. I was inspired by his \ninaugural address. He didn't bow and scrape to the special interest \ngroups. He referred to the Scriptures. Thank God we have a President \nwho referred to the Scriptures in his inaugural speech. He talked about \nGood Samaritans in that speech.\n  I will be very much opposed to his $1.6 trillion tax cut, which will \namount to over $2 trillion. I will be very opposed to that tax cut. I \nmay vote for a tax cut, but it won't be that one. That is not to say I \nam disrespectful of him. I just think he is wrong. On other occasions I \nmay think he is right about a matter, but this, I think, is a colossal \nmistake.\n  I think we are foolish, foolish, to talk of a $2 trillion tax cut \nbased on projections of surpluses 10 years away, 9 years away, 8 years, \nwhatever, which may never--and probably won't--materialize.\n  That is taking a very important step, and it is going to impact on \nyou, the people. So why shouldn't we have a debate? Why shouldn't we \nhave a markup in this bill? We may report out a better measure than \neven the chairman has in mind.\n  Why have we seen fit in our constitutional system to have committees? \nWhy? If we are going to have committees, why don't we have markups on \nbills and let Republicans and Democrats hammer it out, hammer out the \nmeasure on the anvil of free debate? Why does any chairman want to say \nto the committee, I am not going to have a markup, period?\n  Some people might think that is dictatorial, tyrannical, autocratic, \narbitrary. We have had great hearings. We have had witnesses who have \ntraveled here from all points of the compass. They have answered our \nquestions. We have had splendid hearings--you people have attended the \nhearings--but we are not going to have a markup in this committee.\n  Why? Because we are operating on a 50/50 basis. It is even-stephen in \nthis committee. If I had a majority of one or two in the committee, \nyes, we would have a markup then, but we don't have a majority. The \npeople have decided that. We don't have a majority. So whatever you \nsay, I will listen, but we are not having a markup. Might as well not \nhave meetings. A committee chairman may as well just say: We are not \ngoing to have any meetings. We will have a meeting in committee when I \ndecide to and we won't have a meeting in committee when I decide we \nwon't.\n  That is the way it used to be. Do you believe that? It used to be \nthat way in considerable measure.\n  When I came to the House of Representatives 49 years ago, committee \nchairmen could simply bottle up legislation in their committees and not \neven have a meeting. I can remember a Member of the House whom I \nrespected a great deal and admired; he was a former judge in the 16th \nDistrict of Virginia. His name was Howard Smith. He represented the \nEighth Congressional District of Virginia.\n\n  Let me say: You know what, you know what. Howard Smith, this former \njudge, was chairman of the Rules Committee in the House. I have the \nbook here, Congressional Directory, 1953, March. When matters came to \nhis committee, he just would go on back down to the farm and tend to \nhis farming and leave the legislation bottled up in his committee.\n  I remember reading about it in the papers. The chairman didn't have a \nmeeting. Where was he? He was down on his farm. So the chairmen \nsometimes just bottled up things in their committees.\n  In effect, that is what is happening here. Markup of the Budget \nResolution is being ``bottled up.'' Our cries and pleas and prayers are \ngoing to be of no avail because we are not going to have a markup in \nthat committee. Well, why did I attend most of the hearings?\n  So it is in a different form but it is the same old thing as when \nthose chairmen used to say, we will have a hearing or we may not have a \nhearing, or we won't even have a meeting, and the whole session passed \nand there would be no meeting of the committee on many important \nmatters. That is the way it used to be.\n  So what happened? This is not National History Month but I am just \nrepeating a little bit of history today. We have heard that history \nrepeats itself. That is what we see in front of us. History is \nrepeating itself.\n  Here is what happened in the writing of the rules around here--I am \nnot sure I ever read much concerning the House rules. I was there 6 \nyears, but I didn't get so much embedded in the study of them. The \nrules today won't allow chairmen to do that.\n  Let me read, as an example, from rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of \nthe Senate. Here it is. I used to know the rules much better than I \nknow them now.\n\n  Rule 26, section 10(B)--I haven't read this lately. This is a \ndifferent print. This is 1999. That was the last century, 1999. So I \nhaven't read this one. But this is what I think is pertinent to our \ndiscussion. ``It shall be the duty.'' 10(B).\n\n       It shall be the duty of the chairman of each committee to \n     report or cause to be reported promptly to the Senate, any \n     measure approved by his committee and to take or cause to be \n     taken necessary steps to bring the matter to a vote. In any \n     event, the report of any committee upon a measure which has \n     been approved by a committee shall be filed within seven \n     calendar days.\n\n  And so on and so on. I don't think that is the pertinent part.\n  I will ask the Parliamentarian to give me a copy of the rules and the \npertinent provision which I am talking about; 26, paragraph 3. Here it \nis. Each standing committee--aha, here it is.\n\n       Each standing committee (except the Committee on \n     Appropriations) shall fix regular weekly, biweekly, or \n     monthly meeting days for the transaction of business before \n     the committee and additional meetings may be called by the \n     chairman as he may deem necessary. If at least three members \n     of any such committee desire that a special meeting of the \n     committee be called by the chairman, those members may file \n     in the offices of the committee their written request to the \n     chairman for that special meeting. Immediately upon the \n     filing of the request, the clerk of the committee shall \n     notify the chairman of the filing of the request. If, within \n     three calendar days after the filing of the request, the \n     chairman does not call the requested special meeting, to be \n     held within seven calendar days after the filing of the \n     request, a majority of the members of the committee may file \n     in the offices of the committee their written notice that a \n     special meeting of the committee will be held, specifying the \n     date and the hour of that special\n\n[[Page S2812]]\n\n     meeting. The committee shall meet on that day and hour. \n     Immediately upon the filing of the notice, the clerk of the \n     committee shall notify all members of the committee that such \n     special meeting will be held and inform them of its date and \n     hour. If the chairman of any such committee is not present at \n     any regular, additional, or special meeting of the committee, \n     the ranking member of the majority party on the committee who \n     is present shall preside at that meeting.\n\n  That provision applies to the Budget as to any other committee except \nthe Appropriations Committee. So in the rules there is provision for \nmembers of a committee, if the majority of the members so wish, to \ninsist upon and to require and to have a meeting of the committee.\n  Now, there are two problems with this provision. One is that you have \nto have a majority. We have a 50/50 breakdown. In other words, in the \ncommittee we have 11-11. I haven't tested the waters to see if someone \non the Republican side--with, I assume a majority, probably unanimous \ngroup of Senators on my side--would join to insist that we have a \nmeeting of that committee, the Budget Committee, to mark up the bill. \nIt might very well be that we would get a majority. That is the first \nproblem.\n  The second problem is as big or bigger. Once the committee meets at \nthe request and insistence of a majority of the committee, if the \nchairman is not there, the ranking member--which means of the same \nparty--would act as chairman. So far, so good. But the real fly in the \nointment would come in the fact that that chairman can call the meeting \nto order and put the committee out immediately. He has fulfilled his--\nthe request of the majority of the committee. In other words, he \ndoesn't have to sit there and have a long hearing or meeting. He can \njust call it to order and adjourn.\n\n  So why do I call that to the attention of the Senate? Not as a \npossible--not to indicate that there is a possible avenue which would \nconstitute a threat to the chairman. I do not do that at all. But just \nto remind Senators that it is there.\n  When George Mallory, that great Britisher, was asked why he wanted to \nclimb Mount Everest, he said ``because it's there.'' So, today, I have \ntaken the time to point out to my colleagues, some of whom may have not \nread this in quite a while, myself included--that it is there.\n  Why is it there? It is there because it needed to be there. Why did \nit need to be there? Because there were some chairmen in the Congress, \nboth Houses, who just refused to have their committees meet. And if the \ncivil rights bills or whatever were introduced, they went to the \ncommittee. That was the burying ground. They never came out of that \ndoor.\n  So Congress said, and the people said, and the press said: We have \nhad enough. We are going to require--we are going to put something in \nhere by which a majority of the committee can be sure that that \ncommittee does meet. As I say, the chairman may gavel it in and gavel \nit out, but he has to do this before the people. Used to be these \nthings did not have to be out in the sunlight, but you have to be in \nthe sunshine now, so the people say. So if he wants to gavel the \ncommittee in and gavel it out, OK, he can do that. He is elected for 2 \nyears. Probably--it is unlikely he will be expelled from the body for \ndoing that, but there comes a time when he does have to stand before \nthe bar of the people. If he wants to be high-handed, heavyhanded, or \nwhatever, the people will make a judgment.\n  So that is why we have in the rules a way to force a committee \nchairman to meet. We are not talking about that here, for Chairman \nDomenici; he is very excellent about having hearings and so on. But \nthere is just a certain remnant of the evil that existed when chairmen \ncould bottle up matters in their committees, not even have meetings.\n  We have been having meetings, but we face a very serious matter of \nhaving soon to be confronted with a budget resolution which will not \nhave been marked up in the committee, and which will have only details \nwhich will have only been provided by the chairman.\n  I come to a close now just to say again that all I say is meant to be \nwithin the spirit of goodwill, but also to indicate my concern about \nwhat is happening in this Senate and the way it is happening.\n  I thank the Chair and all Senators who have been waiting.\n  Let me thank, again, my own chairman, the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee, for the excellent work he has done in that committee.\n  I made it clear at the beginning, may I say to my ranking member, \nthat I am not here posing as top man on my committee. I couldn't be, \nand I wouldn't want to be. The ranking member has done a very good job.\n  But as a member of that committee, and as one who has been around \nhere now for 49 years in this institution, I am afraid something is \ngoing on that gets to the root of this institution and will hamper the \nrepresentation of the people by virtue of the fact that our hands, \nfiguratively speaking, are going to be tied, and that we are, to an \nextent, being gagged to the point where it is going to be done the \nchairman's way. The way it is going to be done, he has been very \nforthright about and very frank about. It is just going to come to the \nSenate without the benefit of amendment. That in my opinion is not for \nthe Senate or for the good of the Nation. So, I respectfully ask my \nchairman, Senator Domenici, let us follow your own advice, let us use \nthe 1993 Reconciliation Act as a role model and have a markup.\n  I thank all Senators for listening. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nVermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from West \nVirginia for making us aware of the situation which we are coming into. \nI speak as a committee chairman who is deeply concerned about the \nprocess and how we are going to be meaningful in our participation to \nhandle some of the very serious issues of this country. I thank him \nvery much for his help.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I thank him, not \nfor what he said but I thank him for being a Senator who is independent \nin his thinking, who has the courage of his own convictions, and who is \nunafraid to state them. I thank him for his service not only to his \nState and the people who sent him here but also on behalf of the \nSenators from other States who respect that kind of integrity.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/23/senate-section/article/S2812-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2812-S2813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SNOWE-JEFFORDS PROVISIONS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to more fully discuss the \nSnowe-Jeffords provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. \nAccountability and transparency are two of the most important \nprinciples in a democracy. The Snowe-Jeffords provisions will \nstrengthen our campaign finance laws and democracy by ensuring the \nfinancial sponsors of sham issue ads are accountable to the voters \nthrough increased disclosure.\n  I am concerned that the intent and effect of these provisions have \nbeen distorted by some of those who oppose campaign finance reform. I \nam here today to set the record straight.\n  I have been proud to work with my good friend the senior Senator from \nMaine to develop these provisions that our citizens demand and that \nabide by the First Amendment. Senator Snowe has shown great leadership \nand dedication in developing a legislative solution that will fully and \nfairly address the proliferation of these sham issue ads.\n  Let me begin with a discussion of what the Snowe-Jeffords provisions \nwould do. First, they require disclosure of certain information if an \nindividual spends more than 10,000 dollars in a year on electioneering \ncommunications which are run in the 30 days before a primary, or 60 \ndays before a general election. Second, Snowe-Jeffords prohibits the \ndirect or indirect use of union or corporate treasury monies to fund \nelectioneering communications run during these time periods. For my \ncolleagues and those watching on C-SPAN, an electioneering \ncommunication is any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which \nreferences a clearly identified federal candidate within the time \nperiod explained above.\n  Now let me explain what the Snowe-Jeffords provisions will not do:\n  The Snowe-Jeffords provisions will not prohibit groups like the \nNational Right to Life Committee or the Sierra Club from disseminating \nelectioneering communications;\n\n[[Page S2813]]\n\n  It will not prohibit such groups from accepting corporate or labor \nfunds;\n  It will not require such groups to create a PAC or another separate \nentity;\n  It will not bar or require disclosure of communications by print \nmedia, direct mail, or other non-broadcast media;\n  It will not require the invasive disclosure of all donors, and\n  Finally, it will not affect the ability of any organization to urge \ngrassroots contacts with lawmakers on upcoming votes.\n  The last point bears repeating. The Snowe-Jeffords provisions do not \nstop the ability of any organization to urge their members and the \npublic through grassroots communications to contact their lawmakers on \nupcoming issues or votes. That is one of the biggest distortions of the \nSnowe-Jeffords provisions. Any organization can, and should be able to, \nuse their grassroots communications to urge citizens to contact their \nlawmakers. Under the Snowe-Jeffords provisions any organization still \ncan undertake this most important task.\n  My colleagues may wonder what led Senator Snowe and I to work so hard \nfor the inclusion of these provisions in the McCain-Feingold campaign \nfinance reform bill. Since the 1996 election cycle we have both seen, \nand experienced first hand, the explosion in the amount of money spent \non these so-called issue ads. From the 135-150 million dollars spent in \n1996, spending on these so-called issue ads has ballooned to over 500 \nmillion dollars during the last election cycle.\n  It is not the increase in the amount spent on these so-called issue \nads alone that concerns us. Studies have shown that in the final two \nmonths of an election, 95 percent of television issue ads mentioned a \ncandidate, 94 percent made a case for or against a candidate, and \nfinally 84 percent of these ads had an attack component. Does anyone \nthink these statistics are just a coincidence? An overwhelming majority \nof the public recognizes this problem. They see an ad identifying, 90 \npercent, or showing a candidate, 83 percent, or an ad being shown in \nthe last few weeks before an election, 66 percent, as ads that are \ntrying to influence their vote for or against a particular candidate.\n  Some of my colleagues are of the opinion that this increase in money \nspent on sham issue ads is fine. They believe that more money in the \nsystem will better inform the electorate about the candidates. \nUnfortunately, these sham issue ads are corrupting our election system \nand are not better informing the voters about the candidates.\n  The public can differentiate between electioneering communications \nand other types of communications done to purely inform the public on \nan issue. A recent study done by the Brigham Young University Center \nfor the Study of Elections and Democracy shows this, and the effect \nthese ads are having on the public.\n  As you can plainly see from this chart, I have beside me the public \nviews electioneering communications as trying to persuade them to vote \nagainst a candidate. These ads--80 percent--evoke as strong of a \nreaction in the viewing public as the party advertisements--81 \npercent--and are even stronger than the candidate's own ads--67 \npercent. This chart also shows that the public knows when it is viewing \na pure issue ad as compared to the other types of ads tested. Seventy \npercent of the public recognizes that.\n  This next chart, chart No. 2, also demonstrates how the public views \nthese ads, again showing what is the real purpose behind these \nelectioneering communications. Here, like the first chart, you can see \nthat the public is able to differentiate between ads run to help or \nhurt a candidate versus a pure issue ad meant to inform the public. \nWhat is interesting, or frightening, about this chart is that the \nelectioneering communications generate a higher response from the \nviewing public--86 percent--than even the candidate--82 percent--or \nparty ads--84 percent.\n  My third chart shows the degree to which the public felt an ad was \nintended to influence their vote, with 1 being not at all and 7 being \nclearly intended to influence their vote.\n  This chart again shows that the public is able to differentiate \nbetween the communications they receive. Like before, there is a stark \ndifference in public perception between those ads which are seen as \ntrying to influence a vote, election issue ads, party ads, and \ncandidate ads, versus those seen as portraying a purely informational \npurpose, pure issue ads. The chart also shows that the public views the \nintent of these electioneering communications to be to influence their \nvote as strongly as a party ad--6.3 to 6.3; about even--and even more \nstrongly--6.3 to 5.8--than the candidate's own advertisement. The chart \nalso shows the stark difference in the public's mind between the intent \nof electioneering communications--6.3--and pure issue ads--3.7.\n\n  While the public correctly perceives that electioneering \ncommunications are meant to influence their vote, the public is \nconfused about the origin of these communications. As this chart shows, \nchart No. 4, an overwhelming majority--75 percent--of the public \nbelieve that these communications are being paid for by the party or \nthe candidate themselves. The voters deserve to know who is trying to \ninfluence their vote, and the Snowe-Jeffords provisions will give them \nthat information.\n  My final chart, chart No. 5, shows that the public craves the \ninformation that the Snowe-Jeffords provisions would provide them. \nEighty percent of the public believes that it is important or very \nimportant that they know who pays for or sponsors a political ad.\n  I ask our opponents, do they not believe that the public deserves to \nknow who is trying to influence their vote? The public both wants and \ndeserves that information, and Senator Snowe and I provide it to them \nwith our provisions.\n  I think this is an incredibly important part of the bill. I strongly \nurge all of my patriots to study the Snowe-Jeffords provisions to make \nsure they fully understand that all we are requiring is disclosure. We \nwant to make sure people know from where the information to influence \nthem is coming.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for as much time as I \nmay consume in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/23/senate-section/article/S2813-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2813-S2817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE ECONOMY OF OUR COUNTRY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened with some interest today \nto some of the discussion on the floor of the Senate, first about \ncampaign finance reform, and then to Senator Byrd, and others.\n  I come to the floor to talk about the economic circumstances this \ncountry finds itself in for the moment. I want to visit about a number \nof issues that relate to our economy.\n  Mr. President, I came across one of my favorite books last evening \nwhile going through a pile of old books that had been stacked for some \nlong while. The book is written by a man named Fulghum. Most people in \nthis country have read this book or seen the book. It is entitled ``All \nI Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten.'' It is a wonderful \nlittle book.\n  In ``All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten,'' he \ndescribes: ``Put things back where you got them.'' ``Don't hurt \nothers.'' ``Play fair.'' ``Clean up your own mess.'' ``Don't hit \npeople.'' ``Wash your hands.'' ``Flush.''\n  There is a whole list of things you learned in kindergarten that \nrepresent enduring truths throughout life.\n  I started thinking about this in the context of the grappling that we \ndo in this country with our economy. We forget the most basic of \nthings--almost kindergarten-like lessons--about our economy so very \nquickly.\n  Let me describe just a few of them.\n  We have been blessed, of course, with a long period of economic \nexpansion, a period in which we have seen almost unprecedented economic \ngrowth: new jobs, better income, and more opportunity for most American \nfamilies. The stock market began to increase in value and rolled to \nincreasing new heights. People felt good about the stock market. They \ninvested in the\n\n[[Page S2814]]\n\nDow Jones, in the Nasdaq, and would see their net worth increase daily \nor weekly or monthly.\n  We saw college dropouts who were still fighting their acne problems, \nand hadn't yet learned to shave, making million-dollar deals in \ntechnology companies, and then selling them and starting new technology \ncompanies. It was a go-go economy with remarkable and almost \nunimaginable new things that were happening. We had higher economic \ngrowth and lower inflation.\n  Of course, the one constant in all of this was a Federal Reserve \nBoard. The Federal Reserve Board sat down behind its thick doors, and \nin its concrete building, and continued to ring its hands and fret \nabout inflation, despite the fact that inflation was receding rather \nthan increasing.\n  So that is what kind of economy we had. It has been quite an economy.\n  Then about 10 months ago, the Federal Reserve Board, and its \nchairman, Alan Greenspan, decided they once again would increase \ninterest rates--then 50 basis points--because our economy was growing \ntoo rapidly. They had great fear that an economy that was growing too \nmuch would produce inflationary pressures.\n  What they did not understand--and have not understood for some long \nwhile--is the workers in this country are more productive. Productivity \nwas on the march, on the increase. You can have lower unemployment and \nhigher economic growth if you have higher productivity.\n  But, nonetheless, 10 months ago, the Federal Reserve Board took its \nlast step to increase interest rates because they felt America was \ngrowing too fast. It was the last, I believe, in six steps over about a \nyear to substantially increase interest rates and slow down the \nAmerican economy.\n  At about the same time, we began the see some energy problems in this \ncountry--price spikes in natural gas, propane, and home heating fuel. \nWe began to see the dislocation of energy restructuring, especially \nelectricity restructuring in California. And now we see--in recent \ndays--rolling blackouts in the State of California. So we have \nsignificant energy problems.\n  Part of that resulted from the euphoria of having the price of oil \ndrop to $10 a barrel, which resulted in very few people deciding they \nwanted to look for additional oil and natural gas, and the drying up of \nnew drilling rigs. Therefore, because the price of oil dropped so low, \nand we had so few new people looking for oil and natural gas, we now \nfind a dislocation--increased demand for natural gas especially and \noil, and reduced supply.\n\n  Now we have new exploration because oil went to well over $30 a \nbarrel at one point, and we have new people looking for oil and natural \ngas. I suspect 8 months, 12 months, 2 years from now we will have new \nsupplies on line, and we will have some additional balance. But with a \nFederal Reserve Board determined to slow down the economy with high \ninterest rates, and a significant energy problem that has visited this \ncountry and provided great injury, and still does today for many \nAmericans who fought through a bitterly cold first 2 months of the \nwinter and discovered their natural gas prices to heat their homes had \nbeen jacked up, in some cases double and triple, it has been a tough \ntime.\n  At the same time, the bubble began to burst on the stock market. The \nNasdaq began falling. The Dow began falling. The economy began to slow \ndown. We had, and still have, a form of liquidity crisis. We have good \nbusinesses that are building out to try to provide competition in \ncommunications and other areas that can't find the kind of capital they \nneed to continue doing that business. This serious liquidity crisis \naccompanies the slowdown and the bursted bubble on the stock market.\n  At the same time we have a trade deficit that is growing very \ndramatically. This trade deficit is the highest in history of anywhere \non Earth. Personal debt continues to go up in this country. As I \nindicated, economic growth is slowing.\n  Amidst all of this, we have, it seems to me, probably just forgotten \nsome of the fundamentals. Going back to ``All I Really Need To Know I \nLearned In Kindergarten,'' some of the fundamentals we should never \nhave forgotten. Mr. Greenspan should never have forgotten that \nincreased productivity allows less unemployment. Increased productivity \nallows higher growth. Don't be afraid of the American workers being \nmore productive and earning more money and being employed at a higher \nrate if their productivity is up. All we really need to know, we should \nhave learned in the primer course on that subject. Yet the Federal \nReserve Board consistently has insisted that is an equation that \ndoesn't work. They have forgotten the fundamentals.\n  In our market for securities and investors, we have forgotten the \nfundamentals. This is not the first time. You can go back to bubbles of \nspeculation throughout history. One of the most interesting ones for me \nwas to read about the bubble of speculation in ``Tulipmania'' four or \nfive centuries ago in which there was a time when they paid $25,000 for \na tulip bulb because tulip bulbs became the subject of massive \nspeculation. We have had a lot of speculation bubbles in recent \ncenturies. This was just the last.\n  Is it surprising that it doesn't work out when you purchase stock \nthat is selling for 200 times its earnings or when you purchase the \nstock at a wildly inflated price of a company that has never made a \nprofit and doesn't look as if it is going to make a profit? Is it \nsurprising that that doesn't work out at some point? I don't think so. \nYet many of us, probably all of us, temporarily forgot those lessons \nwhen the Nasdaq and the markets continued to go up and up.\n  Will Rogers once said his dad gave him some advice. He said his daddy \nsaid that he should buy stock, then hold it until it goes up, and then \nsell it. And if it doesn't go up, don't buy it. At least that is what \nhe said his dad said. He said that doesn't work out so well.\n  The lesson from all of this that we probably should have learned long \nago is that some of these prices were never justifiable; that is, with \nrespect to the market.\n\n  What about energy? Perhaps we should understand with respect to this \nenergy crisis that it is not enough just to applaud when the price of a \nbarrel of oil goes to $10 because there will be a consequence later. It \nis not enough when you find yourself short of energy to just go find \nnew energy because that is only part of the solution.\n  Opening up ANWR, as some of my colleagues suggest we should do, and \nas I oppose, is not a substitute for an energy policy. I don't believe \nwe ought to open ANWR. But some say: Let's just address this energy \npolicy by simply finding new supplies. Well, let's find new supplies. \nLet's incentivize the finding of new supplies of oil and natural gas, \nand let's use clean coal technology to produce our coal in an \nenvironmentally friendly way.\n  Let's also do other things. Let's understand that conservation is \nvery important. If you are sitting in a 6,000 pound gas hog and \ncomplaining about the price of gas, we have to be concerned about the \nissue of conservation in this country as well. We need to produce new \nenergy. We need to conserve more, both with appliances and vehicles and \nother ways. Additionally, we need to incentivize new sources of \nrenewable energy: wind energy, biomass, ethanol, and more. I know the \noil industry doesn't like it, but that is precisely why I do. When the \noil industry believes it is in its self-interest to impede the \ndevelopment of other sources of energy, I say that is exactly why we \nought to develop other sources of energy. Yes, we need the oil \nindustry. We need natural gas. But we also ought to develop wind power. \nThe new generation of wind turbines are very effective and efficient. \nWind, biomass, ethanol, all can contribute to this country's energy \nsupply, and we ought to understand that.\n  Again, all we need to do is to make sensible decisions. The sensible \ndecision is not to just rely on additional production. That won't solve \nAmerica's energy problem. We introduced a piece of legislation \nyesterday--Senator Bingaman, myself, and others on the Energy \nCommittee, along with my colleague Senator Daschle, the Democratic \nleader--which is a comprehensive energy policy. It moves us in the \nright direction in a range of areas, one that is thoughtful and will \nlead this country out of the dilemma that currently exists with the \nimbalance between supply and demand for energy. Our economy cannot \nsurvive, progress and succeed the way we want it to unless we have \nassured supplies of energy.\n\n[[Page S2815]]\n\n  I talked about the stock market. I talked about the economy. Energy \nis also a very important element of these issues. We have to respond to \nthem, and we have to deal with them.\n  At the same time we are confronting the other issues, we are \nconfronting the challenge of international trade. I mention the \nchallenge of international trade only because, while all of the other \nelements of our fiscal policy seemed to have improved dramatically over \nthe most recent 8 years, the one area that continued to decline was \ntrade. By decline, I mean our trade deficit continued to grow year \nafter year. We have the highest deficit in human history. It is not \nrocket science to fix this. Again, all we really need to know we \nlearned in kindergarten. Everyone needs to play fair. Our current \nmerchandise trade deficit is a huge problem at over $440 billion just \nthis last year. The problem is that when we have trading partners, \nwhether it is Europe, China, Japan, Mexico, or Canada, we say to them, \nwe will open our markets to you, but in exchange, you must open your \nmarkets to us. We have never had the nerve or the will to do that.\n\n  Let me give some examples of what we have done in trade. We just \nnegotiated a deal with China. We said to China, after a long phase-in, \nwe will give you this deal. You have a huge surplus with us or we have \na huge deficit with you, and after a phase-in, we will give you this \ndeal. You have roughly 1.2 billion people who are looking for new \nproducts. However we negotiated a deal that when we sell American \nvehicles to China, they can impose a 25-percent tariff. But if the \nChinese sell automobiles to the United States, we will impose a 2.5-\npercent tariff. In other words, we will make a deal with you. You can \ncharge a tariff that is 10 times higher than the United States on \nautomobiles. That is with a country with which we already have a huge \ndeficit, an over $80 billion last year. I scratch my head and look at \nthat and think, on whose side were our trade negotiators? They \ncertainly weren't for America. At least, they forgot for whom they were \nnegotiating. That is one example here are a few others.\n  The average agricultural tariff in the United States is 12 percent. \nThe global average is 26 percent. The average tariff in the European \nUnion is 30 percent. We have a long series of trade agreements, and big \ndisputes, with the European Union. How is it that our trade negotiators \nlet our European counterparts take advantage of our farmers?\n  The average Japanese tariff is 58 percent. Every pound of T-bone \nsteak that goes to Tokyo has right now a nearly 40-percent tariff on \nit. That is after the beef agreement with Japan--unforgivable. Japan \nhas a $70 billion trade surplus with the United States but they won't \ncut a deal for our ranchers.\n  After our beef agreement, almost every pound of beef going into Japan \nhas a huge tariff on it. Yet this country seems to lack the will, the \nstrength, or the nerve to do much about it.\n  Every time we get involved in a trade negotiation, we lose in a very \nshort period of time and agree to trade concessions that continue to \nratchet up the trade deficit. I hear all my colleagues say: These trade \nagreements are really important so we can sell around the world. Yes, \nthey are important. Every time we have a new trade agreement, we have a \nhigher trade deficit. Does that add up?\n  We have a trade agreement with Mexico. We had a surplus; we turned it \ninto a deficit. We have a trade agreement with Canada. We had a \ndeficit; we nearly doubled it. We have a trade agreement with China. We \ndidn't have a vote on that, but we just had a bilateral agreement with \nChina.\n  I will make a wager with my colleagues that in a year and a half, \nwhen we evaluate our relationship with China, our deficit will have \nincreased and we will be getting fewer agricultural products into \nChina. Incidentally, after the trade agreement with China, in December, \na load of barley was shipped to China from the U.S. and it is still \nwaiting to enter. China stopped the shipment and apparently isn't going \nto let it get in. And China will give no reason for it. It is \nreasonable to ask: Who is looking after our interests?\n  You could put on a blindfold and listen and you could not tell the \ndifference between George Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Ronald \nReagan, or Richard Nixon. It is all the same mantra on trade: This \ncountry is ill served by the trade agreements we have had. I support \nexpanded trade and expanded opportunity for American products abroad. \nThat is not what is happening in these trade agreements.\n  Now we come to a backdrop of an economy with energy issues and issues \nwith respect to the market, trade, and other things I have discussed, \nand we have a new President who wants to cut taxes. In his campaign for \nthe Presidency, when he was campaigning against Mr. Forbes in the \nprimaries, he said he wanted to cut taxes by $1.3 trillion over 10 \nyears. That was nearly 2 years ago that he made that announcement. That \n$1.3 trillion is scored by those who know it all works out that we will \noffer $2 trillion in real costs. So we have a President who, a couple \nyears ago, said he wants a very large tax cut, and that there are \nsurpluses as far as the eye can see. He and virtually all others from \nall political parties say they expect surpluses every year for the next \n10 years, so the American people ought to receive some of those \nsurpluses back in the form of tax relief.\n  I agree. I think it is time for a tax cut for a number of reasons. \nNo. 1, I think our economy is weaker than most people believe. We are \nheaded toward some pretty troublesome circumstances. Our fiscal policy \nought to be stimulative. It is time for a tax cut that will help \nstimulate this economy and help provide additional economic growth.\n  But I do not believe we ought to lock in a tax cut for 10 years that \nis so large that it could pose a danger of putting us right back into \nvery large, significant budget deficits once again. It took well over a \ndecade to get out of that problem. This country should not want to be \nback in the same set of circumstances.\n  First of all, I don't think anyone here really believes that we know \nwhat is going to happen 2 years, 5 years, or 10 years from now. Nobody \nbelieves that we know there will be surpluses. We have never had \nsurpluses for 10 straight years. We have never had those surpluses. \nNobody knows what is going to happen 6 months from now in the economy. \nYet we have people here who are prepared to say we are going to lock in \na very large tax cut in a way that will put us in jeopardy of going \nback into Federal budget deficits 2 years, 5 years, or 10 years from \nnow. I don't think that is wise. We should only lock in a tax cut for \nthe first 2 years, and do the right kind of tax cut so that it is fair \nto everybody and in a way that stimulates our economy.\n  The first 2-year phase--make that portion of it permanent. Make the \nfirst phase stimulative, and at the end of 2 years, if we still have \nsurpluses and the economic outlook is good, do a second phase. That is \na much more conservative and a much more thoughtful way to address \nthese issues.\n  I hope as we have these discussions in the budget debate, and in the \nsubsequent tax debate that will come following that, we will be able to \nthink through exactly what kind of projections we have for the future \nand exactly what we think is going to happen and, as a result of that, \nwhat kind of tax cuts we should enact.\n\n  There are a number of priorities for this country. Tax cuts are one \nat this point, especially because, A, we have a surplus and, B, we have \nan economy that is weakening. There are other priorities as well, one \nof which is to pay down the Federal debt. If you run it up in tough \ntimes, pay it down during better times. To those who say we are paying \ndown the debt, I say when the budget document gets here, we will go to \nthe page number I say and look at gross debt. It is going to increase, \nnot decrease. Tell me why you think we are paying it down. Gross debt \nwill increase, not decrease. That is why a significant part of the \nsurplus that exists, in my judgment, should go to reducing the Federal \ndebt.\n  Second, there are other things for us to do. Yes, a tax cut is a \npriority. So, too, is paying down the Federal debt. But there are other \nthings we should do. We need to improve our schools in this country. \nThat is something that is important to our future. We need to try to be \nhelpful to senior citizens--to all Americans, but especially senior \ncitizens--to pay the cost of prescription drugs. We ought to do that in \nthe Medicare program and in a way that is affordable and effective.\n\n[[Page S2816]]\n\n  So those are the other needs and priorities that we ought to \nconsider. Finally, let me say that without disparaging any of the \neconomic thinkers, either in the administration, or in Congress, or the \nFederal Reserve Board, no one knows what is happening in the future. We \nare all united by that profound lack of understanding. No one knows \nwhat the future holds for this economy. The most important element, by \nfar, for this economy is the confidence of the American people. There \nare some who think we are so sophisticated that the control room on a \nship of state has all kinds of gauges and knobs and dials and levers, \nand if you just go down there and adjust them all right, pull the right \nlever, adjust the right knob, move the right gauge, whether it is M-1B \nor tax cuts or spending or any number of devices, somehow the ship of \nstate will sail forward at maximum speed. That is not the case at all. \nThat has very little to do with the speed at which this ship moves \nforward.\n  What has everything to do with it is the confidence of the American \npeople. This economy rests on the confidence of the American people. If \nthe people aren't confident, the economy is going to contract and there \nisn't anything anybody can do much about it. People make judgments \nabout their future, about buying a house, buying a car, buying other \nthings--making decisions about their life that affect the economy. They \nmake decisions based on their view of what will happen in the future. \nIf they are optimistic, they decide one thing. They may buy a new home, \na second car, or a vacation home. They may make a decision to buy new \nclothing. That confidence creates a wave of improvement in any economy. \nThat economy rests on a mattress of consumer confidence, and it always \nhas.\n  When people are not confident about the future, they delay decisions, \npostpone decisions, or simply decide they will not make purchases. So \nthey behave differently and they create a contraction in the economy. \nThat is the important thing for all of us to understand. This is all \nabout confidence, about the American people's perception about the \nfuture and their confidence in the future.\n  I want to talk for a few more moments about this tax cut. When we do \na tax cut, as I indicated, it ought to be stimulative and fair. Let me \ntalk about this issue of ``the top 1 percent'' because there has been \nso much discussion about that. I open my mail and people write to me, \nand some support this and some support that; it is all over the mark. \nAs some journalists write, some of my colleagues call it ``class \nwarfare'' and so on.\n\n  Let me describe the 1-percent issue. The top 1 percent have done very \nwell, far better than anybody else in the country. That is good for \nthem. When you add up the individual income taxes and the payroll taxes \npaid by the American individual taxpayers, it is about a trillion \ndollars in individual income taxes and about $650 billion in payroll \ntaxes. The top 1 percent bear about 21 percent of that burden. \nPresident Bush, in his proposal, says he would like to give the top 1 \npercent about 43 percent of the proposed tax cut. I think that is \nunfair. When I raise that and somebody says that is class warfare, I \nsay it is not about class warfare; it is about class favoritism. Why \nhave a tax policy that plays favorites, that says: you pay 21 percent \nof the total taxes, but you ought to get 43 percent of the tax cut? \nThat is about class favoritism. What I say is, let's take care of the \n99 percent first, look at their burden; let's look at what they have \ndone, and their struggles. Then we should evaluate what kind of a fair \ntax cut can be helpful to working families, which can reflect their tax \nburden--yes, including the payroll tax because three quarters of the \nAmerican people pay a higher payroll tax than they do in income taxes. \nThat is very important to understand. That is where we get these \ndifferences in numbers.\n  I hear people get on the floor and say these are fuzzy numbers and \nyou are jockeying around these numbers. Look, there is only one set of \ntruths, only one. We know what the tax burden is the American people \nbear, and we know what the proposals are to relieve that burden--and \nthere will be more, I am sure. The proposals that say the payroll taxes \npeople pay don't count are proposals that shortchange working families \nwho pay a significant amount of payroll taxes and are told when it \ncomes to handing part of the surplus back to them, their tax burden \ndidn't count.\n  That is not fair. It is not class warfare to describe that as unfair. \nIt is class favoritism to decide the top 1 percent should get nearly \ndouble what they would normally deserve if we had a proportional tax \ncut related to their tax burden.\n  I know there are differences in how we see the economy that probably \nrelate to our attitudes about this. There are people in this Chamber \nwho firmly believe the economy works based on this so-called trickle \ndown theory. That is the notion that there are some people who run this \ncountry who know about allocation of capital, and they are the ones who \nmake the country go; they are the ones who run the big businesses and \nthey hire the people, and if you give them something to work with, it \nall trickles down to the bottom, and everybody is better off.\n  I had an old farmer write me a letter some years ago. He said: I've \nbeen reading about this trickle down stuff for 20 years, and I ain't \neven damp yet.\n  The old trickle down does not always trickle down.\n  Others believe there is a percolate-up theory of economics: The \nengine works best when everybody has a little something with which to \nwork, when American families have something with which to work. After \nall, you can have the best business in the world, but if nobody has the \nincome to buy your product, your business ``ain't'' going to do very \nwell.\n  Hubert Humphrey used to talk about the trickle down theory. It is an \nold story everybody has heard, I am sure. He said: It's sort of like \nwhen you give a horse some hay and hope later the sparrows will have \nsomething to eat. It is kind of a description of believing that somehow \neverybody will get something ultimately.\n  As we look at this tax issue, which I think is going to be one of the \nsignificant issues in Congress this year, we ought to be pretty \nhardheaded on two fronts: One, how do we do this in a way that helps \nthis economy because this economy is in tougher shape than some know; \nand No. 2, how do we provide a tax cut that reflects the understanding \nwe now have a surplus and ought to give some of it back in a way that \nalso saves some for debt reduction, but in a way when we give it back \nit is fair to all the families in this country, it is fair to \neverybody.\n  There is an old song by Ray Charles that has a lyric:\n\n       Them that gets is them that's got, and I ain't got nothing \n     lately.\n\n  That is an apt discussion, it seems to me, of the way some people \nlook at tax cuts. When they are proposed, they say: Gee, let's take a \nlook at the top; they pay a lot of income tax. We will give them a \nlarge tax cut and the rest we will try to figure out. But we will \ntrickle down, and somehow if we give enough at the top, it will trickle \ndown and everybody will be better off.\n  It seems to me when we talk about taxes, we need to talk about the \ntotal tax burden people face, which is income taxes and payroll taxes, \nand give a tax cut that reflects the burden for working families. That \nis not the case in the proposal that has come from the President.\n  I think it is very unwise not to be somewhat conservative, and I am, \nfrankly, surprised that those who call themselves the most conservative \nMembers of Congress are often saying: Look, we are not conservative on \nthis; what we want to do is provide a very large tax cut, and we are \ngoing to do that on surpluses that do not yet exist, but surpluses we \nexpect we will have in 6 years, 7 years, 8 years, 9 years, 10 years.\n  That is not very prudent, in my judgment. It was an awful struggle to \nget rid of these Federal budget deficits, but they are gone. The last \nthing we want to do is get put right back into the deficit ditch.\n\n  We have a lot of interests and a lot of opinions about all of these \nthings. I come from a farm State, and the Presiding Officer is from a \nfarm State. I mentioned other things we want to do: provide a tax cut, \npay down the debt, and reach other priorities that are necessary, such \nas improving our schools.\n\n[[Page S2817]]\n\n I did not mention one that is most important to me, and that is doing \nwhat is necessary to preserve a network of family farmers in this \ncountry.\n  Again, there is a difference of opinion about that. Some say if \nfarmers are worth saving, let the market system save them. If the \nmarket system does not provide a price that saves family farmers, tough \nluck. So what, America will get its food. Food comes from a shelf, and \nit comes from inside a package. Farmers are like the little old diner: \nThey are kind of a nostalgic thing, like the little old diner left \nbehind when the interstate came through. It is fun to look back and see \nthat vacant diner and think of what was, but we have an interstate now, \nwe don't need to stop there.\n  That is how some feel. It is total nonsense. Farmers produce more \nthan grain. They produce a community, they produce a culture, they \nproduce something so valuable for this country, and yet we are losing \non this score.\n  We have a farm program that does not work. We have family farmers \nstruggling to hang on by their fingertips because commodity prices have \ncollapsed. Our farmers put a couple hundred bushels of grain in the \ntruck and drive to the elevator and the elevator operator says: This \ngrain you produced doesn't have much value. Almost half the world is \nhungry, and probably a quarter of the world is on a diet. We have \ninstability in places of hunger, and our farmers are told: Your food \ndoes not have value.\n  What a strange set of priorities. If there is any one thing this \ncountry can do to promote a better world and promote more stability in \nthe world it is take that which we produce in such abundance--food--and \nmove it to parts of the world where it is needed for survival. What a \nwonderful thing for us to do and do it in a way that gives those who \nproduce it a decent return.\n  We are able to do that with arms. It is interesting, we are the \nlargest arms merchant in the world. The United States is the largest \narms merchant in the world. We sell more weapons of war than any other \ncountry. If we can do that with armaments, we ought to be able to do \nthat with food.\n  Most of us in this Chamber have been to refugee camps and places in \nthe world where people are dying. I held a young girl who reached out \nof her bed. I was the only one she had. I was only going to be there a \nminute or two. She was dying of hunger, malnutrition. I can go anywhere \nin the world and see this. It is happening every day.\n  My late friend Harry Chapin, who was killed in 1981, used to say the \nreason people dying from hunger is not a front-page story is because \nthe winds of hunger blow every minute, every hour, every day; 45,000 \npeople; 45,000 people a day, most of them children. It is not a \nheadline because it happens all the time, and we produce food in such \nwonderful quantity and are told it has no value. We can do a lot better \nthan that.\n  I did not mean to speak at length--I will do so later--about \nagricultural policy, but in terms of our priorities as a country, as we \nthink through all of these issues--taxes, trade, reducing the debt, and \nother priorities--and talk about prescription drugs and Medicare, about \nimproving our schools and a farm policy that works for family farmers--\nall of these things represent values. It is about values: Who are we, \nwhat are we doing here, and what kind of future do we want?\n\n  In conclusion, when I talk about the economy, some say the economy is \nwhat it is and what it will be; the market system establishes the \neconomy. The market system is a wonderful allocator of goods and \nservices, but it is not perfect. In some cases it is perverted. It \nneeds a referee, a certain structure. It needs rules and guidelines.\n  My thoughts are, our economy is what we decide we want to make it. If \nwe want to make an economy in which family farmers can make a decent \nliving, then that is the economy we can have. Europe has it. Good for \nthem. I am not criticizing them. Good for them. This economy is what we \nmake it. The tax policy is what we make it.\n  We need to think our way through this. I do not intend to be \npartisan. We have a new President. I like him. I want to work with him, \nbut I say to him: You have given us a plan--that is good--but it is not \nthe only plan. It is not the only idea. What we ought to do is get the \nbest of what everyone has to offer. When people write to me and say \nsupport the President, I say this is not about the President, it is not \nabout me; it is about this country's future: What are the best ideas to \nensure this country's economic future? What are the best ideas we can \nget from Republicans and Democrats to ensure economic growth and \nopportunity for all Americans?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me first thank the clerks who have \nbeen kind enough to notify me I might come over at this time. I am most \nappreciative of that courtesy. I will try to keep my remarks short. I \nrecognize it is Friday afternoon and Members are anxious to be on their \nway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/23/senate-section/article/S2817-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2817-S2820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE ENERGY BILL\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The purpose of addressing my colleagues today is to \ntalk a little bit about the energy bill. As most Members know, a \nbipartisan bill was introduced by Senator Breaux and myself some time \nago. It was a very comprehensive energy bill. It covered all aspects of \nrenewables, alternatives, conservation, and also went into what we \nthink is very important, and that is the issue of supply because what \nwe have in this country--and it is certainly evident in California and \nmoving out to New York and other areas--is we have increased \nconsumption. In other words, we increased demand but we have not \nincreased the supply.\n  This particular bill attempts to not only, in the sense of \nrenewables, encourage alternatives and conservation, but it addresses \nhow we can go back to our conventional sources of energy and try to do \na more efficient job of ensuring that they, too, continue to contribute \nto our needs.\n  That sounds simplistic in one sense, but in another it should be \nrecognized we have not been able to build a new coal-fired plant in the \nUnited States since the mid-1990s. It is not that we do not have the \ncoal or the method of transporting the coal; it is simply a matter of \npermitting and the difficulties associated with meeting air quality and \nthe costs associated with the particular type of construction required \nto meet the new emission standards.\n  We have not built a new nuclear plant in this country in over 25 \nyears. Nobody in their right mind would even approach the subject \nbecause of, first, permitting, but probably even more pertinent is the \ndifficulty of what we do with the high level radioactive wastes. We \nhave been working out in Nevada for the last decade building a \nrepository that is still 6 to 8 years away, even though it is basically \ncomplete today. The permitting is taking that long. It is at Yucca \nMountain. We have expended over $7 billion.\n  My point is simple. As we address our conventional sources, we find \nwe have eliminated them for one reason or another simply because we \nhave not had the conviction to overcome the objections by some groups \nthat do not want to see nuclear and they do not want to see coal. It is \npretty hard to identify what their contribution is to the recognition \nthat we are short of supply.\n  You can go on into hydro, which is renewable, but nevertheless there \nare those who propose to take down hydro dams in our rivers. Out west, \nif you take down the dams, you close the rivers to navigation. Then \nwhere do you put the tonnage that goes on the rivers? You put it on the \nhighways.\n  We have also seen a tremendous increase in natural gas consumption \nbecause that is the one area that our electric producing entities can \npermit. Nevertheless, we have seen gas prices go from $2.16 per \nthousand cubic feet last year to somewhere in the area of $5.40 or \n$8.40 or whatever--it has doubled; it has tripled. The realization now \nis we are pulling down our recoverable gas reserves faster than we are \nfinding new ones.\n\n  I am not suggesting we don't have more gas in this country, but we \nhave pretty much identified natural gas\n\n[[Page S2818]]\n\nas the preferred fuel. Now we are finding ourselves faced with higher \nprices associated with that.\n  I have kept oil for the last provision in our dependence because I \nthink it reflects on a little different portion of energy. America \nmoves on oil. We do not move necessarily on natural gas. Our industry \ndepends on natural gas, our power generating on natural gas, our homes \nby natural gas, but you don't fly out of Washington, DC, on hot air. \nYou fly out on kerosene in your jet airplane, your bus, your ship. \nUnfortunately, we have little relief in sight from the standpoint of \nour dependence being replaced by any other technology.\n  We talk about fuel cells; we talk about wind, solar panels. We have \nexpended about $6 billion over the last 5 years developing alternative \nenergy. While that development has made some progress, the unfortunate \npart is it still only reflects about 4 percent of our overall general \nmix in energy sources.\n  What we have attempted to do in our bill, Senator Breaux and myself, \nis to concentrate to a large degree on increasing the supply by using \ntechnology to develop more efficiently, more effectively, with smaller \nfootprints.\n  We have also had a bill that has been introduced. I would classify \nthis at least initially as a partisan bill introduced by my good friend \nSenator Bingaman, with whom I share responsibility on Energy, as \nchairman of the committee--he is the ranking member--and Senator \nDaschle. They introduced a partisan bill. The rationale behind many of \nour initiatives is similar. In the area of tax initiatives, they are \nnearly identical. Both have marginal wells, energy efficiency, \nrenewable, accelerating depreciation, infrastructure, other nontax \nprovisions, electric reliability, and Price Anderson issues that \naddress liability on nuclear plants, and alternative fuels.\n\n  However, there are some significant differences. I would like to \npoint those out at this time.\n  There is very little in this bill about existing older coal-fired \nplants that generate a significant portion of the energy in this \ncountry in the form of electricity.\n  There is nothing substantial for nuclear. I have indicated that \nnuclear energy provides about 20 percent of the power in this Nation. \nIt is clean. It has no emissions.\n  As a consequence, more and more utilities are looking at American \nnuclear. But clearly we have to address the waste issue.\n  There is no expedited procedure in the Democratic bill for hydro \nrelicensing, which we think is a necessity, because in the interest of \nsafety and efficiency hydro dams need to be relicensed in an \nexpeditious manner.\n  Lastly, they have not included opening up ANWR--that small sliver of \nAlaska that we believe has the potential to decrease, if you will, \nsubstantially our dependence on imported oil. It will not replace it. I \nwant to make sure everybody recognizes that. It is not the answer to \nCalifornia's energy problem. It never was and never will be. But it \ncertainly is the answer to California's dependence on oil because all \nthe oil that is produced in Alaska is consumed in California, or the \nState of Washington. Oregon has no refineries. So a portion of the oil \nfrom Washington's and California's refineries go to Oregon.\n  My point is a simple one. As Alaska's oil production declines, \nCalifornia, Washington, and Oregon will continue to need oil.\n  The question is, Where are they going to get the oil? They are going \nto bring it in from overseas in foreign vessels, maybe from the rain \nforests of Colombia or other areas where there is no environmental \nconsideration given for the development of the field, or compatibility \nof the environment, or compatibility of the landmass where they develop \noil, or for the technology that we mandate in developing our own oil \nfields.\n  My point is, you might not like oil fields. Prudhoe Bay is the best \nin the world, bar none. The combination of the environmental oversight \nby the Federal Government and the EPA and the State of Alaska is second \nto none. Any spill of an ounce or more has to be reported. Any foreign \nsubstance--even throwing out coffee from a cup--requires reporting. \nThat may sound outlandish, but that is the rule. That is the law, and \nthat is the enforcement.\n  As we look at the decline in production from Alaska and recognize \nwhere it is going, and factoring in the reality that our oil under the \nJones Act, which mandates that the carriage of goods between two \nAmerican ports must be in U.S. flag vessels that are crewed by union \nmembers, that are in ships built in U.S. yards, which provides jobs for \nAmericans as opposed to foreign ships that are coming in that aren't \nbuilt to U.S. standards and don't have the same requirements of Coast \nGuard inspections, and so forth.\n  There is a significant issue for Washington, Oregon, and California.\n\n  The merits of opening ANWR speak for themselves. Can you do it \nsafely? Clearly we can. We have the experience. Is the area at risk? \nWell, those who are opposed to it would have you believe that ANWR is \nat risk. But they do not point out the reality that ANWR is the size of \nthe State of South Carolina. It is roughly 19 million acres. In that 19 \nmillion acres, we have set aside 8.5 million acres in the wilderness in \nperpetuity and another 9 million acres has been set aside in the \nrefuge, leaving up at the top for Congress and only Congress to \ndetermine what is the so-called 1002 area consisting of 1.5 million \nacres.\n  That is what is at risk--1.5 million acres out of 19 million acres. \nAnd industry says if oil is found there in the range that it believes \nexist--somewhere between 5.6 billion barrels and 16 billion barrels--\nthe footprint would be about 1,000, or 2,000 acres.\n  That is about half the size of the Dulles International Airport, to \ngive you some idea of the magnitude.\n  Is that permissible? We think it is. Do we have the technology? We \nthink we do.\n  If the oil is there in that abundance--10 million barrels a day--it \nwould equal Prudhoe Bay. Prudhoe Bay has produced for 27 years about 20 \nto 25 percent of the total crude oil produced in the United States. Now \nit is beginning to decline. It has, nevertheless, exceeded its \nproduction prediction which was 10 billion barrels. It has produced \nover 13 billion barrels.\n  My point is that ANWR and that particular field that is believed to \nbe there would be the largest oil field found in the world in the last \n40 years. Some people say it is only a 6-month supply. That is assuming \nall the rest of the oil production stops. It is a ridiculous argument. \nIt is similar to us saying that Alaska is going to withhold development \nof ANWR, and therefore you are not going to have a 6-month supply of \noil. It is a ridiculous argument. It needs to be tossed aside. It is \namazing that the media believes it is going to take 10 years to \ndevelop. It is not going to be 10 years. We can develop that in 3 \nyears. We already have an 800-mile pipeline. It utilizes half the \ncapacity. We need an extension of about 26 miles of pipeline, which \ntakes us from the field on State land on the edge of ANWR, and we can \nbegin to produce oil.\n  The difficulty I have with the Democratic bill is ANWR is not in it. \nI think as we look at trying to find relief, we have to look at home, \nand we have to recognize that we can do it safely. I have already \nindicated prominent justification for that.\n  The other issue is what is going on with the economy. The economy in \nthis country is in the dumps. How much of it is the cost, if you will, \nof increased energy? Look at Fortune 500 fourth-quarter earnings. They \nall indicate that they were substantially affected by the increased \ncosts of energy. It affected their bottom line. It affected their \nemployment. It affected their inventory.\n  Again, it is an economic factor, and it is a significant one as we \nlook at the contribution that this could make in our own economy. It is \na significant creator of jobs.\n  There are virtually thousands and thousands of jobs associated with \nopening up this oil field. We don't make pipe in Alaska. We don't make \nvalves. We don't have the welders. It is estimated that about 750,000 \njobs are associated with this effort.\n\n  I want to make sure everybody understands the significance of what it \nmeans to the economy.\n  Finally, the national security interests of this country: when do we \ncompromise our national security? At what\n\n[[Page S2819]]\n\npoint do we become so dependent on oil imports that we compromise that?\n  I was asked that question. I said, well, remember in 1973 and 1974 \nwhen we had the oil embargo. We had gas lines around the block. People \nwere indignant, and they were blaming government. We said we will never \napproach 50-percent dependence.\n  So we created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve with a 90-day supply. \nWe never reached that goal. We reached about a 56-day supply. When we \npulled our oil out under the previous administration--about 30 million \nbarrels--we suddenly found that we didn't have the refining capacity to \nrefine the oil. We had to replace what we were importing by opening \nSPR.\n  My point is we have restrictions in our energy situation. And it is \nnot limited to supply. It is partially limited to the capacity we have \nbecause we haven't built a new refinery in this country in 25 years. We \nshut down nearly 100 in the last decade.\n  Here we find ourselves in a situation where we fought a war in 1991. \nWe lost 147 lives. We had 437 Americans wounded. How quickly we forget. \nWho was that war against? It was against Iraq and Saddam Hussein. We \nare now importing nearly 700,000 barrels a day from Iraq. Yet we have \nflown 234,000 individual sorties over Iraq enforcing the no-fly zone. \nWe have been very fortunate. We have not lost any men or women. But \nthey are shot at, believe me. It is a very dangerous situation.\n\n  So here we become dependent, if you will, in a few years, to a \ndegree, on oil from an aggressor, a tyrant. It is kind of interesting \nto proceed a little further with this evaluation of our national \nsecurity interests. Because, as we look to Saddam Hussein, what we do \nis we take his oil, we refine it, put it in our airplanes and go bomb \nhim. Maybe it is not that simple, but I think there is justification \nfor at least that kind of a premise being rationalized.\n  What does he do with the money he gets? He pays his Republican Guards \nto keep him alive. And then he develops a missile capability, a \ndelivery capability, a significant biological capability. And at whom \ndoes he aim it? At one of our closest allies, Israel. I don't know what \nthat does to your digestion, Mr. President, but it bothers mine.\n  Is it in our country's national security interest to continue to \ndepend more and more on imported oil? I do not think so. We can reduce \nthat dramatically. Currently we are 56-percent dependent on imported \noil. If Congress authorized the opening of ANWR tomorrow, we would send \na signal to OPEC that we mean business about reducing our dependence. \nThat would send a strong signal. I think they would increase production \nand the price would drop.\n  However, we cannot seem to come to grips with this problem because of \nthe environmental opposition based on emotion, not sound science, based \non membership, pressure on members, the realization that the \nenvironmental community needs a cause, the realization the \nenvironmental community will not address its responsibility to increase \nsupply, if you will.\n  Why is that increase necessary? We are simply using more energy as we \nknow and learn how to conserve more. We are an electronic society. We \nmove on e-mails. We move on computers. We are expanding. The \nrequirements associated with our structural society--including air-\nconditioning--suggest we are going to continue to use more.\n  They say we can conserve our way out. We can no more conserve our way \nout than we can drill our way out. We need all the sources of energy. \nWe need the technology. And a significant portion, as far as oil is \nconcerned, is ANWR.\n  So that is why, as we look at the four issues--safety, yes, it can be \ndone safely; the effect on the economy; the national security; and, \nmost of all, the attitude of the people in Alaska--75 percent support \nit. We have Native people, Eskimos who are here in Washington, calling \non Members saying: Hey, this is a personal issue. We live there. We \nlive in the village of Kaktovik, which is in ANWR. We have a school \nthere. We have a radar site there. There are 227 people who live there. \nWe have a right to life and disposition on our own land and a right of \nexpression.\n  So when the environmentalists say, it is an untouched Serengeti, they \nare misleading the public. Most of ANWR is untouched and will always \nremain untouched. But this little segment where the people live is the \narea where the oil would be drilled.\n  So we are disappointed with the Democratic bill because it does not \ninclude ANWR.\n  I have a couple more things to say, and then I will try to wind this \nup.\n  In the Democratic bill, in our opinion, there are extremely broad \nresearch and development authorizations on the issue of climate change \nprovisions which might be dealt with better in a separate entity. We \nare all concerned about global warming and concerned about climate \nchange. But the idea of drifting towards a Kyoto accord, I think most \nMembers have indicated by that vote last year of 98-0 that the proposal \nbefore the Senate was simply unacceptable. The reason is, it would \nallow the developing nations to catch up with the developed nations \ninstead of the developed nations using our technology to assist the \ndeveloping nations in reducing their emissions.\n  Finally, the Democratic proposal has an inconsistency in one sense. \nIt does not address, as I have indicated, looking for oil at home; \nnamely, ANWR, even though the residents of my State support it, but it \ndoes propose lease sale 181 in the gulf right off Florida. The \nDemocratic proposal states that we should take the lead in meeting the \nenergy needs using indigenous resources.\n  What I am saying is the Democratic proposal opposes ANWR, which the \nState of Alaska clearly supports, but wants to force lease sale 181, \nwhich Florida opposes--the Governor of Florida and the people of \nFlorida--which is a bit of an inconsistency. Perhaps there will be an \nexplanation on it.\n  They want to shut ANWR permanently, but, by the same token, they want \nto accelerate the export of Alaskan natural gas. That is kind of an \ninteresting comparison because there is a difference of how we propose \nto develop Alaska's gas. They propose a section 29 tax incentive for \nproduction of natural gas from Alaska.\n  It is interesting to reflect on what section 29 means. Section 29 is \ndesigned as an incentive for development of unconventional sources of \nenergy, not conventional sources.\n  What am I talking about? For example, overlaying Prudhoe Bay, we have \nwhat we call the West Sack Field. It is larger than Prudhoe Bay, but \nthe oil is immersed in the sands, and the sands are in permafrost, and \nthe technology of recovery is simply not in existence. The oil is \nthere.\n  So in our bill we have a proposed subsidy for developing that \ntechnology. We have, in our bill, under section 9, an incentive for \ndeveloping biomass technology, coalbed methane technology. But \nsurprisingly enough--and I do not mean to kick a gift horse in the \nmouth or the teeth or the behind or wherever --they propose this \nsection 29 in Alaska's potential natural gas development.\n  Under our proposal, the Alaska natural gas project would not be \navailable for any type of section 29 subsidy. There is a reason for \nthat. In our case, the gas has been found. We found 36 trillion cubic \nfeet of gas associated with oil development in Prudhoe Bay. The \ngeologists will not even get a recognition for finding a gas well. The \nemphasis was on an oil well.\n  So we found this gas. We discovered it. Furthermore, we have produced \nit. We produced it by pulling it out and reinjecting it into the oil \nwells to get greater recovery. So the gas is still there. But to \nsuggest that Exxon, British Petroleum, and Phillips are looking for an \nincentive--a tax incentive under section 29--I do not mean to speak out \nof school, but we are just amazed they would include a subsidy to big \noil for a project that is already proven, already found. The technology \nis available. All we need is the transportation to get it out.\n  So, once again, we see Members of Congress trying to determine what \nis in the best interests of Alaska without talking to Alaskans or \nunderstanding our point of view or giving us the courtesy.\n  Finally, for the record, we have had long debates on this issue of \nwhether or not we could open ANWR safely. We have had long debates on \nthe issue of our national security interests, of the numbers of lives \nwe have lost over oil.\n\n[[Page S2820]]\n\n  I remember Mark Hatfield, a very senior Member of this body, from the \nState of Oregon, saying: I would vote for ANWR any day in the world if \nit meant not sending another American soldier overseas to fight a war \nin a foreign country over oil.\n  Well, the final word--and this is from Representative Ralph Hall, a \nDemocrat from Texas, who said Tuesday in a speech before the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce--and I quote:\n\n       I would drill in a cemetery if it kept my grandkids out of \n     body bags.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/23/senate-section/article/S2820-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2820-S2821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RESTORING A NATIONAL COMMITMENT TO MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in his recent address to Congress, \nPresident George W. Bush made it clear that, unlike his immediate \npredecessor, he strongly endorses the deployment of an effective \nmissile defense system capable of protecting the United States, its \nallies and its forward deployed forces from the growing threat of \nmissile attack. As someone who has long viewed the deployment of \nmissile defense as an urgent national priority, I look forward to \nworking with President Bush to achieve this vital national security \ngoal for America.\n  March 23 marks the 18th anniversary of President Ronald Reagan's \nhistoric speech announcing his determination to see America build a \ndefense against ballistic missiles. It is gratifying to know that \nReagan's vision remains alive today. As Reagan said in 1983:\n\n       What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that \n     their security did not rest upon the threat of instant U.S. \n     retaliation to deter a Soviet attack, that we could intercept \n     and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached \n     our own soil or that of our allies?\n       I know this is a formidable technical task, one that may \n     not be accomplished before the end of this century. . . . It \n     will take years, probably decades of effort on many fronts. \n     There will be failures and setbacks, just as there will be \n     successes and breakthroughs . . . as we pursue a program to \n     begin to achieve our ultimate goal of eliminating the threat \n     posed by strategic nuclear missiles.\n\n  Now, 18 years later, at the dawn of the new century, a renewed \nPresidential focus on missile defense is appropriate and necessary. The \nthreat posed by ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction is \nvery real and growing. And as we have seen over time, the technology to \nbegin to meet this threat is available, if we will make the effort to \naggressively develop it. Today, President Bush promises to do just \nthat.\n  Unfortunately, the Clinton administration squandered most of the last \n8 years, failing to build a proper foundation for the kind of robust \nmissile defense development and deployment which the growing threat \ndemands. Wedded to the outdated 1972 ABM Treaty, to the superstitions \nof arms control and to greatly reduced defense budgets, Clinton was \nconsistently hostile to the deployment of effective missile defense. \nHere is a quick year-by-year review of some of the highlights of the \nClinton administration's dismal record on missile defense.\n  1993: cut $2.5 billion from the Bush missile defense budget request \nfor fiscal year 1994; halted all cooperation with Russia on a joint \nglobal missile defense program; terminated the Reagan-Bush Strategic \nDefense Initiative program; downgraded National Missile Defense to a \nresearch and development program only; cut 5-year missile defense \nfunding by 54 percent from $39 billion to $18 billion; reaffirmed \ncommitment to ABM Treaty, saying any defense must be ``treaty-\ncompliant.''\n  1994: State Department official called the ABM treaty ``sacred \ntext,'' saying ``arms control has more to offer our national security \nthan do more weapons systems. We look first to arms control and second \n. . . to defenses;'' declared Theater High Altitude Area Defense \n(THAAD) non-treaty compliant; placed self-imposed limits on THAAD \ntesting to keep it ``treaty-compliant.''\n  1995: Placed self-imposed limits on Navy Upper Tier system to keep it \n``treaty compliant;'' politicized National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) \nto downplay growing missile threat; vetoed Defense Authorization bill \nrequiring missile defense deployment by 2003.\n  1996: Cut funding and slowed development of THAAD and Navy Theater-\nWide systems, in defiance of the law--the Defense Authorization bill--\nrequiring accelerated development; announced fraudulent ``3-plus-3'' \nprogram for national missile defense: three years to develop, plus \nthree years to deploy. (Later changed to ``5 plus 3,'' then ``7 plus \n3,'' then dropped the ``plus 3''); reaffirmed ABM Treaty as the \n``cornerstone of strategic stability;'' opposed and helped kill \nlegislation calling for NMD deployment by 2003.\n\n  1997: signed ABM Treaty agreements with Russia which, if ratified by \nthe Senate, would: (1) reaffirm the validity of the ABM Treaty banning \neffective national missile defense; (2) sharply limit the effectiveness \nof theater defense systems; and (3) ban space-based missile defenses.\n  Clinton never submitted these for ratification, knowing they would \nfail to get the needed 67 votes for ratification.\n  1998: opposed and helped kill legislation calling for NMD deployment \n``as soon as technologically possible;'' disputed the Rumsfield \nCommission's assessment of the growing missile threat, arguing that \nthere was no need to accelerate missile defense deployment; on August \n24, Joint Chiefs Chairman Henry Shelton wrote to me affirming his \nassurance that U.S. intelligence would detect at least three years' \nwarning of any new rogue state ICBM threat; on August 31, one week \nlater, North Korea surprised U.S. intelligence by testing a three-stage \nTaepo-Dong I missile with intercontinental range, demonstrating \ncritical staging technology and rudimentary ICBM capability.\n  1999: delayed by at least two years the Space Based Infrared System \n(SBIRS) satellites designed to detect and track missile launches \nnecessary to coordinate with any effective national missile defense \nsystem; emasculated the Missile Defense Act of 1999--passed by veto-\nproof majorities in both houses--calling for deployment ``as soon as \ntechnologically possible.'' In signing the bill into law, Clinton \noutrageously interpreted it to mean that no deployment decision had \nbeen made and that therefore he would make no change in his go-slow \nmissile defense policy.\n  2000: cut funding for the Airborne Laser (ABL) program by 52 percent \nover 5-year period, but the cuts were later reversed by Congress; \nallowed Russia to veto U.S. missile defense plans by making NMD \ndependent on Russia's agreement to modify the ABM Treaty, but Russia \nwould never agree; postponed the administration's long-awaited NMD \ndeployment decision from June to September and then decided to defer \nany decision indefinitely to the next administration, insuring that the \nentire eight years of the Clinton presidency would pass without a \ncommitment to deploy national missile defense.\n  The net result of this abysmal record is that America continues to \nremain completely vulnerable to missile attack, despite growing \nthreats. In the 8 years of the Clinton administration, there was never \na commitment to deploy national missile defense. Instead, there was a \nmisguided ideological dedication to preserving the ABM Treaty, whose \nvery purpose was to prohibit effective missile defense. In essence, the \nClinton vision was exactly opposite of the Reagan vision.\n  Today, the threat grows. Proliferation of missile and weapons \ntechnology around the world proceeds at an accelerated pace. Under \nClinton, weapons inspectors were kicked out of Iraq; Russia greatly \nincreased its military assistance to China; China was caught stealing \nU.S. nuclear secrets; U.S. companies were given a green light to help \nimprove the accuracy and reliability of China's nuclear missiles; China \ntransferred missile and weapons technology to North Korea, Iran, Iraq \nand others; China threatened to absorb Taiwan; and China threatened to \nattack the United States with nuclear missiles.\n  The Rumsfeld Commission determined that new ICBM threats could emerge \nin the future ``with little or no warning.'' The Cox Commission \ndetermined that Clinton covered up or presided over some of the most \nserious security breaches in U.S. history, affecting critical national \nsecrets about virtually every weapon in our nuclear arsenal and \nnumerous military-related high technologies.\n  The case for missile defense is more compelling today than it has \never been.\n\n[[Page S2821]]\n\n With a new President determined to set a new course, or rather to set \nus back to the course first articulated by President Reagan, there is \nreason for hope and optimism.\n  I urge President Bush to move quickly in forging a national \ncommitment to the deployment of a robust global missile defense system \ncapable of defending all 50 States, our allies and our forward deployed \ntroops around the world. We should appropriate the necessary budgets. \nWe should exploit all options and technologies. We should seriously \nconsider an initial deployment at sea, using our proven Aegis ships and \ncomplementing it with important ground and spaced based systems.\n  In consultation with our allies, and while maintaining our nuclear \ndeterrent, we should break free of the constraints of the outdated ABM \nTreaty and begin to fashion a security regime based, as Reagan said, on \nour ability ``to save lives rather to avenge them.'' This is the legacy \nAmerica deserves, consistent with Reagan's vision of courage, morality \nand security--a vision I know is shared by President George W. Bush.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/23/senate-section/article/S2821-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2821-S2822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SCORECARD OF HATRED\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in just the last few weeks, two California \nhigh schools a few miles apart, suffered the same terrible fate when \ntroubled students opened fire on both classmates and teachers. These \nremind of us of the many acts of gun violence committed by young people \nin American schools since the attack at Columbine High School almost 2 \nyears ago. In last week's Time magazine, an article called ``Scorecard \nof Hatred,'' lists in detail the many varied plans of copycat attacks \nsince Columbine, including those planned by teenagers who, thankfully, \nfailed in their attempts. Each of the more than 20 different attempts \nby young people to ``pull a Columbine,'' the phrase that some teenagers \nnow use to describe these acts of violence, is disturbing in its own \nright. As a whole, these acts are beginning to become an epidemic.\n  I often wonder why these acts of school violence are so uniquely \nAmerican. The warning signs most commonly associated with teens who \nengage in school shootings--disturbing patterns of behavior, \ndepression, increased fascination with violence, sometimes \ninappropriate living conditions--are no doubt experienced by teens in \nother countries. Yet, even though the gun shots at Columbine were \nwitnessed by teens across the world, teens in other countries are not \nroutinely committing terrible acts of school violence.\n  Last May, on the 1-year anniversary of the Columbine shootings, there \nwas one act of copycat violence in Ottawa in the province of Ontario, \nCanada. According to an article in the Ottawa Citizen, a 15-year-old \nboy, who was teased mercilessly by his classmates, became obsessed with \nthe Columbine school massacre and the violent perpetrators of the \ntragic event. He posted pictures of the young men in his lockers and \nbegan counting down the days until the anniversary. But when the moment \ncame, and the young boy in Canada attempted to carry out his copycat \ncrime, instead of brandishing an arsenal of firearms, he brandished a \nkitchen knife. Instead of 15 dead and countless more injured, 5 people \nwere stabbed, none with any life-threatening injuries.\n  In Littleton, CO and Ottawa, Canada, the circumstances were similar, \nbut the outcomes were substantially different. It seems that the one \ncrucial difference in this and other such incidences is not religion or \nmusic, entertainment, or peer influence, it is access to guns. In most \nof these school shootings in the United States, our young people have \nrelatively easy access to guns. Here are some of the examples used in \nthe Time magazine article: two 8th graders in California were found \nwith a military-sniper rifle, a handgun, and 1500 rounds of ammunition; \na 15-year-old in Georgia gained access his stepfather's rifle; a 7th \ngrader from Oklahoma took his father's semiautomatic handgun; a 6-year-\nold in Michigan discovered a semiautomatic handgun; a 17-year-old in \nCalifornia amassed an arsenal of 15 guns as well as knives and \nammunition; a 13-year-old in Florida picked up a semiautomatic handgun.\n  Mr. President, the lists goes on and on. We must do something to \nlimit our youth's easy access to guns and end the epidemic of gun \nviolence in our Nation's schools and community places.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nTime magazine article, Scorecard of Hatred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Time magazine, Mar. 19, 2001]\n\n                          Scorecard of Hatred\n\n                           (By Amanda Bowen)\n\n\n                          May 13, 1999--foiled\n\n     Port Huron, Mich.\n       Their plan, police said, was to outdo Columbine \n     perpetrators Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold by arming \n     themselves, forcing the principal of Holland Woods Middle \n     School to call an assembly and then killing teachers, \n     classmates and themselves. Jedaiah (David) Zinzo and Justin \n     Schnepp, both 14, made a list of 154 targets, stole a \n     building plan from the school custodian's office and plotted \n     to use one gun to steal more. Classmates caught wind of the \n     plot and reported it to the assistant principal. Zinzo and \n     Schnepp were sentenced to four years' probation.\n\n\n                          May 19, 1999--foiled\n\n     Anaheim, Calif.\n       When police searched the homes of two eighth-graders at \n     South Junior High, they found two bombs, bombmaking \n     materials, a military-surplus rifle, a Ruger Blackhawk .45-\n     cal. handgun, 1,500 rounds of ammunition and Nazi \n     paraphernalia. They were tipped off by a student who heard \n     that the boys, whose names were not released, were \n     threatening to blow up the school.\n\n\n                              May 20, 1999\n\n     Conyers, Ga.\n       Thomas Solomon Jr., 15, aimed low with his stepfather's .22 \n     rifle and wounded six fellow students at Heritage High \n     School.\n       Warning Signs.--Solomon told classmates he would ``blow up \n     this classroom'' and had no reason to live. He was being \n     treated for depression and was teased by a popular sports \n     player whom Solomon believed was the object of his \n     girlfriend's affections.\n\n\n                         Aug. 24, 1999--foiled\n\n     Northeast Florida\n       Two teenagers were charged with conspiracy to commit \n     second-degree murder after a teacher saw drawings, one of \n     which depicted a bloody knife, a shotgun and an assault \n     weapon. The teens allegedly described themselves as Satan \n     worshippers and claimed they were planning to leave a \n     deadlier trail than the one at Columbine. Charges were \n     dropped for lack of evidence, and the boys were released from \n     house arrest.\n\n\n                         Oct. 28, 1999--foiled\n\n     Cleveland, Ohio\n       Adam Gruber, 14, and John Borowski, Benjamin Balducci and \n     Andy Napier, all 15, were white students planning a rampage \n     at their mostly black school. It was to end, one of the boys' \n     friends said, in a suicidal shoot-out with police, with one \n     survivor to ``bask in the glory.'' Officials were tipped off \n     to the plot by another student's mother.\n\n\n                             oct. 24, 2000\n\n     Glendale, Ariz.\n       Sean Botkin dressed in camouflage, went to his old school, \n     entered a math class and with a 9-mm handgun held hostage 32 \n     former classmates and a teacher, police say. After an hour, \n     the 14-year-old was persuaded to surrender.\n       WARNING SIGNS.--Botkin said in a television interview last \n     month that he was picked on, hated school, had a troubled \n     family life and couldn't recall ever being truly happy. \n     ``Using a gun would get the attention more than just walking \n     into school and saying, `I need help' or something,'' he \n     said.\n\n\n                             Jan. 10, 2001\n\n     Oxnard, Calif.\n       Richard Lopez, 17, had a history of mental illness, and \n     police apparently believe he ``had his mind made up to be \n     killed by a police officer'' when he marched onto the grounds \n     of his old school, Hueneme High, took a girl hostage and held \n     a gun to her head. Within five minutes of SWAT officers' \n     arriving, he was shot dead. Lopez's sister said her brother \n     had wanted to commit suicide, but his Catholic faith forbade \n     it.\n       WARNING SIGNS.--Family members said Lopez had been in and \n     out of juvenile facilities and attempted suicide three times. \n     ``He needed help, and I cried out for it,'' his grandmother \n     said.\n\n\n                         Jan. 29, 2001--foiled\n\n     Cupertino, Calif.\n       The Columbine gunmen were ``the only thing that's real,'' \n     according to De Anza College sophomore Al Joseph DeGuzman, \n     19. He allegedly planned to attack the school with guns and \n     explosive devices. The day before, however, he apparently \n     photographed himself with his arsenal and took the film for \n     developing. The drugstore clerk alerted police.\n\n\n                          Feb. 5, 2001--foiled\n\n     Hoyt, Kans.\n       Police were alerted to Richard B. Bradley Jr., 18, Jason L. \n     Moss, 17, and James R. Lopez, 16, by an anonymous hot-line \n     tip. A search of their homes revealed bombmaking material, \n     school floor plans, a rifle, ammunition and white supremacist \n     drawings, police\n\n[[Page S2822]]\n\n     said. They also reportedly found three black trench coats \n     similar to those worn by the Columbine gunmen.\n\n\n                          Feb. 7, 2001--foiled\n\n     Fort Collins, Colo.\n       Just 66 miles from Littleton, Chad Meiniger, 15, and \n     Alexander Vukodinovich and Scott Parent, both 14, were \n     allegedly hatching an elaborate plan to ``redo Columbine.'' \n     Police were tipped off by two female classmates of the boys, \n     who said they had overheard them plotting. Officers say they \n     found a weapons cache, ammunition and sketches of the school.\n\n\n                             nov. 19, 1999\n\n     Deming, N.M.\n       Victor Cordova Jr., 12, fired one shot into the lobby of \n     Deming Middle School and hit Araceli Tena, 13, in the back of \n     the head. She died the next day.\n       WARNING SIGNS.--Cordova reportedly boasted the day before \n     the shooting that he would ``make history blasting this \n     school,'' but no adults were told. Since losing his mother to \n     cancer, Cordova was reportedly suicidal.\n\n\n                              dec. 6, 1999\n\n     Fort Gibson, Okla.\n       Seventh-grader Seth Trickey was a religious, straight-A \n     student. But then, police say, he came to school, stood under \n     a tree, pulled out his father's 9-mm semiautomatic handgun \n     and fired at least 15 rounds into a group of classmates. Four \n     were wounded.\n       WARNING SIGNS.--A juvenile court heard that Trickey was \n     receiving psychological counseling and was deeply influenced \n     by the Columbine shootings. Psychologists said he was \n     obsessed by the military, in particular General George S. \n     Patton, and the shootings may have been Trickey's way of \n     proving he could hold his own in battle.\n\n\n                             feb. 29, 2000\n\n     Mount Morris Township, Mich.\n       A six-year-old boy, whose identity has not been released, \n     left the crack house where he lived and went to school at \n     Theo J. Buell Elementary. He called out to fellow first-\n     grader Kayla Rolland, left, ``I don't like you!'' ``So?'' she \n     said. The boy swung around and shot her with the loaded .32 \n     semiautomatic handgun he had taken from home. Kayla died soon \n     afterward.\n       WARNING SIGNS.--The boy was reportedly made to stay after \n     school nearly every day for violent behavior, attacking other \n     children and cursing. His hellish home life--mother a drug \n     addict, father in prison--had been the subject of complaints \n     to police, but there was no response. On the day of the \n     shooting, another student reported the boy was carrying a \n     knife. It was confiscated, but he was not searched for other \n     weapons.\n\n\n                          may 18, 2000--foiled\n\n     Millbrae, Calif.\n       A 17-year-old senior at Mills High school, whose name has \n     not been released, was arrested after another student \n     reported being threatened with a gun. Police said they found \n     an arsenal of 15 guns and rifles, knives and ammunition at \n     the boy's home, all apparently belonging to his father. In \n     the eight months before his arrest, the boy had allegedly \n     threatened seven other friends with guns and bragged he was \n     going to ``do a Columbine'' at school. The victims said they \n     were too scared to report the threats.\n\n\n                              may 26, 2000\n\n     Lake Worth, Fla.\n       Nathaniel Brazill, 13, was sent home for throwing water \n     balloons. Police say he returned with a .25-cal. \n     semiautomatic handgun, went into an English class and shot \n     and killed teacher Barry Grunow, 35.\n       WARNING SIGNS.--Brazill had apparently shown others the gun \n     and talked about hit lists. In his bedroom, police say they \n     found a letter he had written saying, ``I think I might \n     commit suicide.''\n\n\n                         Feb. 11, 2001--foiled\n\n     Palm Harbor, Fla.\n       Scott McClain, a 14-year-old eighth-grader, reportedly \n     wrote a detailed e-mail to at least one friend describing his \n     plans to make a bomb and possibly target a specific teacher \n     at Palm Harbor Middle School. The friend's mother alerted \n     sheriff's deputies, who said they found a partly assembled \n     bomb in McClain's bedroom that would have had a ``kill \n     radius'' of 15 ft.\n\n\n                         Feb. 14, 2001--foiled\n\n     Elmira, N.Y.\n       Jeremy Getman, an 18-year-old senior, passed a disturbing \n     note to a friend, who alerted authorities. A police officer \n     found Getman in Southside High School's cafeteria, reportedly \n     with a .22-cal. Ruger semiautomatic and a duffel bag \n     containing 18 bombs and a sawed-off shotgun. An additional \n     eight bombs were allegedly found in his home.\n\n\n                             March 5, 2001\n\n     Santee, Calif.\n       Charles Andrew Williams, 15, allegedly opened fire from a \n     bathroom at Santana High, killing two and wounding 13.\n       WARNING SIGNS.--Williams was bullied, a pot smoker, trying \n     to fit in. He told at least a dozen people, including one \n     adult that there would be a shoot-out. When he later said he \n     was joking, they believed him.\n\n\n                             March 7, 2001\n\n     Williamsport, Pa.\n       Elizabeth Catherine Bush, 14, was threatened and teased \n     mercilessly at her old school in Jersey Shore and transferred \n     last spring to Bishop Neumann, a small Roman Catholic school. \n     There she allegedly took her father's revolver into the \n     cafeteria and shot Kimberly Marchese in the shoulder.\n       WARNING SIGNS.--Bush was reportedly still being teased and \n     was depressed. As she fired the gun, she allegedly said, ``No \n     one thought I would go through with this.'' It is unclear \n     whether she had told anyone of her intentions.\n\n\n                         March 7, 2001--foiled\n\n     Twentynine Palms, Calif.\n       Cori Aragon, left, with her mother, was one of 16 students \n     at Monument High School in the Mojave Desert to discover that \n     their names were allegedly on the hit list of two 17-year-old \n     boys arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder and \n     civil rights violations. Tipped off by a female student who \n     overheard the boys' plans, police said they found a rifle in \n     one home, the list in the other. The boys' names were not \n     released. This was the most serious case to follow the Santee \n     shootings. But 14 other California children were either \n     arrested or under observation for making threats. Around the \n     U.S., dozens more copycat threats were reported.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/23/senate-section/article/S2822-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 OFFERING OF AMENDMENTS TO SENATE RULES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I rise today to congratulate Godfrey ``Budge'' \nSperling, a man who has spent the last 35 years satisfying the \nappetites of reporters hungry for both a good meal and a good story. On \nmore than 3,100 mornings, Budge has invited members of the Washington \npress corps to join him for breakfast and conversation with political \nnews makers. He has hosted everyone from Members of Congress to \npresidential nominees to sitting presidents, as well as luminaries\n\n[[Page S2823]]\n\nsuch as the Dalai Lama. Along the way, the Sperling Breakfasts have \nbecome more than an informal gathering of journalists and news makers, \nthey have become a prominent part of Washington's political culture. In \nfact, they have become a brand name.\n  Today, I would like to take a few moments to pay tribute to this \ninstitution by sharing with my colleagues a little bit about its \nfounder. Budge Sperling was born in Long Beach, California, in 1915, \nbut grew up in Urbana, Illinois. In 1937 he graduated from the \nUniversity of Illinois with a degree in Journalism. He continued his \nstudies at the University of Oklahoma, receiving a law degree in 1940.\n  In 1946, after serving for five years in the United States Air Force \nduring World War II, Budge joined the staff of the Christian Science \nMonitor, working his way through a variety of national bureaus until he \nand his breakfast became a brand name. Throughout a career that has \nspanned over 50 years, Budge has served as Chief of the Monitor's \nMidwest Bureau, New York Bureau, and Washington Bureau. He currently \nserves as the Monitor's Senior Washington Columnist.\n  The Sperling breakfasts began, ironically, over lunch. On February 8, \n1966, Budge decided to invite some of his colleagues to join him for a \nmidday meal at the National Press Club with Charles H. Percy, the \neventual senator from Illinois, whom he had met on the campaign trail. \nAfter the successful meeting, Budge was urged by his fellow reporters \nto host another gathering. Budge invited New York Mayor John Lindsay, \nbut was unable to book a room at the National Press Club for lunch. He \ndecided to have the meeting over breakfast instead, and a tradition was \nborn.\n  Since that time, the Sperling Breakfast, or ``Breakfast with \nGodfrey,'' as it has been known, has served as the source of many news \nstories. One of the most well-known breakfasts occurred when Budge \ninvited Senator Robert F. Kennedy to speak the day after the New \nHampshire primary in 1968. While Kennedy was addressing the assembled \nreporters, news of the Tet offensive in Vietnam broke and Kennedy, who \nhad repeatedly denied presidential aspirations, struggled visibly to \nreconcile this new information with his denials. As Budge recently \nrecalled that morning he said, ``we felt we'd seen history in the \nmaking.''\n  This is only one example of the many memorable breakfasts Budge has \nhosted. And while not every one of the thousands of breakfasts has \nresulted in headlines the following day, one thing is certain: Budge \nhas his finger on the pulse of who and what are making news in \nWashington.\n  At the beginning of each and every Sperling Breakfast, Budge begins \nby announcing. ``The only ground rule here is that we're on the \nrecord.'' With that one rule in mind, I am pleased to stand here today \nand state in the Record my congratulations and appreciation to Godfrey \n``Budge'' Sperling for all he has done to help inform the American \npeople about their government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/23/senate-section/article/S2823-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive reports of committee were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. HELMS for the Committeee on Foreign Relations.\n       Marc Isaiah Grossman, of Virginia, a Career Member of the \n     Senior Foreign Service, Class of Career Minister, to be an \n     Under Secretary of State (Political Affairs).\n       Richard Lee Armitage, of Virginia, to be Deputy Secretary \n     of State.\n\n  (The above nominations were reported with the recommendation that \nthey be confirmed subject to the nominees' commitment to respond to \nrequests to appear and testify before any duly constituted committee of \nthe Senate.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/23/senate-section/article/S2823-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n       S. 603.

A bill to provide for full voting representation in the \nCongress for the citizens of the District of Columbia to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide that individuals who are \nresidents of the District of Columbia shall be exempt from Federal \nincome taxation until such full voting representation takes effect, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague \nSenator Russ Feingold and with my longtime friend Congresswoman Eleanor \nHolmes Norton in the House of Representatives, in sending the message \nthat, as the United States Supreme Court has said, ``No right is more \nprecious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election \nof those who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must \nlive.'' Here we are, in the year 2001--225 years after the birth of our \nnation--and the residents of the District of Columbia, despite paying \ntheir full freight of federal taxes, are still deprived of this \nfundamental right. The bill we introduce today, the ``No Taxation \nWithout Representation Act of 2001,'' drawing on the famous cry of the \nBoston Tea Party, is a reminder that full representation is a building \nblock of the covenant of our democracy, a birthright of every American \ncitizen.\n  The voting problems in the 2000 Presidential election make the \nsymbolism of this bill even more powerful. Not since the civil rights \nstruggle of the early 1960's have we been so keenly aware of the \nimportance of a vote. All taxpaying citizens of the United States, \nexcept the residents of Washington, D.C., can vote for representatives \nto advocate for and protect the interests of their constituents in both \nthe House and Senate. As American citizens, we do not regard this \nopportunity as a privilege; we regard it as a right. Many Americans are \nnot aware and, I believe, would be shocked to know that the residents \nof the District of Columbia have no such right. Although they regularly \nelect ``shadow'' Senators and a ``shadow'' Representative, these people \nare not recognized as members of Congress. The sole voice in Congress \nfor D.C. is Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Now I have known Congresswoman Norton for many years, and I know her \nto be able and persistent. The residents of Washington, D.C. are lucky \nto have such a strong and talented advocate on their side. But as a \ndelegate, she has the right to vote only in committee; she does not \nhave the right to vote on the congressional floor. So unlike every \nother American, Washingtonians have no congressional representatives to \ncall who can vote for or against pending legislation that may become \nthe law of the land, their land.\n  Ever since the American Revolution, the power to tax and the right to \nvote have been inextricably linked. D.C. residents pay federal taxes, \nbut have no vote in Congress. I am introducing this bill today in order \nto condemn this unfair situation. If enacted, this bill would exempt \nD.C. residents from paying federal income tax so long as they are not \nfully represented on Capitol Hill. There is a rationale for such an \nexemption from tax. Residents of United States territories such as \nPuerto Rico, Guam, and the United States Virgin Islands which, like \nD.C., have delegate representation in Congress are not required to pay \nany federal income tax. But let me be clear. My goal in sponsoring this \nlegislation is not to provide a windfall to the people of Washington, \nD.C. Allowing the residents of D.C. to live tax-free will not solve \nthis problem. This bill is a matter of principle, not tax policy. And \nthe principle is the right to full enfranchisement.\n\n  As our nation's capital, Washington, D.C. belongs to each and every \nAmerican. We should all take pride in this beautiful city and show its \ncitizens the respect they deserve. That is why I have long supported \nlegislation providing much-needed financial and political empowerment \nfor D.C. I was an original cosponsor of the D.C. Economic Recovery Act \nof 1997, which would have offered tax incentives for people to live and \ninvest in here in D.C. We succeeded in getting two provisions of that \nbill enacted, a tax credit for first-time home-buyers and elimination \nof capital gains tax for economic development investments in D.C. I was \nalso an original cosponsor of legislation to grant D.C. statehood both \ntimes it was introduced. And it is because I still believe that the \npeople of Washington, D.C. deserve full participation in our democracy \nthat I am sponsoring the No Taxation Without Representation Act of 2001 \ntoday.\n  My hope is that by introducing this bill, we can bring national \nattention to the injustice that the residents of Washington, D.C. have \nfor too long endured. I hope it will help rally the necessary support \nhere in Congress to grant D.C. full congressional voting rights. All \nAmerican citizens deserve the right to elect representatives to speak \nand to vote on their behalf in Congress. It is time that the American \ncitizens living within the borders of Washington, D.C. are given their \ndue. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, \nand ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 603\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``No Taxation Without \n     Representation Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) The residents of the District of Columbia are the only \n     Americans who pay Federal income taxes but are denied voting \n     representation in the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate.\n       (2) The principle of one person, one vote requires that \n     residents who have met every element of American citizenship \n     should have every benefit of American citizenship, including \n     voting representation in the House and the Senate.\n       (3) The residents of the District of Columbia are twice \n     denied equal representation, because they do not have voting \n     representation as other taxpaying Americans do and are \n     nevertheless required to pay Federal income taxes unlike the \n     Americans who live in the territories.\n       (4) Despite the denial of voting representation, Americans \n     in the Nation's capital are second among the residents of all \n     States in per capita income taxes paid to the Federal \n     Government.\n       (5) Unequal voting representation in our representative \n     democracy is inconsistent with the founding principles of the \n     Nation and the strongly held principles of the American \n     people today.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title III or the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 to provide for digital education partnerships; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Ready \nTo Learn, Ready To Teach Act. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senators Kennedy and Warner.\n  In 1992, Senator Kennedy and I introduced the Ready To Learn \nTelevision Act. The premise was to utilize the time children spend \nwatching television to prepare them for the first year of school. Data \ntold us that nearly every preschool child in America was watching up to \n30 hours of television per week. While there were some educational \ntelevision shows, there was not a consistent effort to provide truly \nmeaningful programming.\n  Ready to Learn was signed by President Bush in October, 1992. The new \nlaw supported the coordination of existing Public Broadcasting shows \nlike Sesame Street and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. By 1994, more local \npublic television stations began airing a consistent block of preschool \neducational programs and PBS began developing supplemental materials to \nhelp parents prepare their children for school.\n  Today, new research from the University of Alabama and the University \nof Kansas tells us that Ready to Learn is having a positive impact on \nchildren and their parents. The University of Alabama study found that \nReady to Learn families read books together more often and for longer \nperiods than non participants. And--this is a fact that surprises \nmany--Ready to Learn children watch 40 percent less television and are \nmore likely to choose educational programs when they do watch.\n  Using the best research tested information available, Ready To Learn \nsupports the development of educational, commercial-free television \nshows for young children. Between the Lions, is the first television \nseries to offer educationally valid reading instruction which has been \nendorsed by the professional organizations that represent librarians, \nteachers and school principals. Its partners also include: the Center \nfor the Book at the Library of Congress; the National Center for Family \nLiteracy; the National Coalition for Literacy and the Home Instruction \nProgram for Preschool Youngsters. This broad-based support is \nunprecedented for a children's television show. It is well deserved \naffirmation of the Ready to Learn mission.\n  A recent study from the University of Kansas showed that children who \nwatched Between the Lions a few hours per week, increased their \nknowledge of letter-sound correspondence by 64 percent compared to a 25 \npercent increase by those who did not watch it. Continuing research \nsuggests that classroom, teacher led use of the video and online \nresources will be beneficial to kindergarten and first grade students \nand is desired by teachers.\n  Thirty seven million children have played to, sung with, and learned \nfrom Ready To Learn Television shows. The parents and other care givers \nof more than 6 million children have participated in the local \nworkshops and other services provided by 133 public broadcasting \nstations.\n  In my state, the Mississippi Educational Television Network Ready to \nLearn director, Cassandra Washington Love, has received high praise for \nthe effective assistance she provides to families. One grandfather \nsaid, ``It made my grandchildren happy to know that they could get free \nbooks. My wife and I were also happy because we were not able to buy \nthem any books. Thanks to that TV station.''\n  The second element of the Ready To Learn, Ready To Teach Act concerns \nteacher professional development. MATHLINE is a proven professional \ndevelopment model for teachers of mathematics. In 1994, Congress \nauthorized the ``Telecommunications Demonstration Project for \nMathematics,'' which has supported a project called MATHLINE.\n  MATHLINE is a blend of technology and teacher ``best practices.'' \nMATHLINE demonstrations established some of the first internet-like \nonline communications between teachers. The flexibility of video tape \nallows MATHLINE participants to adjust training schedules and cut out \nthe expense and time of travel.\n  This bill graduates MATHLINE to TeacherLine, a more comprehensive \nprofessional development tool for teachers of preschool through twelfth \ngrade. TeacherLine will also support state of the art, digitally \nproduced content for classroom use.\n  Digital broadcasting will dramatically increase the services local \npublic broadcasting stations can offer schools. One of the most \nexciting is the ability to broadcast multiple video channels and data \ninformation simultaneously. This will make possible for instructional \nmaterials to be distributed on full time, continuous channels, on \ndemand, when teachers and students need it.\n  In my opinion we should reauthorize the programs that are successful \nmodels and lead to educational improvement.\n  The Ready To Learn, Ready To Teach Act takes the best of educational \ntechnology programming; improves those proven to work, and places \nrenewed confidence in one of education's most trusted and successful \npartners.\n\n[[Page S2826]]\n\n  I hope Senators will support this important education legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 604\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Public television is a partner with Federal \n     policy to make television an instrument of preschool \n     children's education and early development.\n       ``(6) The Ready to Learn Television Program supports \n     thousands of local workshops organized and run by local \n     public television stations, child care service providers, \n     Head Start Centers, Even Start family literacy centers and \n     schools.

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) Since 1995, the Telecommunications Demonstration \n     Project for Mathematics (as established under this part \n     pursuant to the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994) (in \n     this section referred to as `MATHLINE') has allowed the \n     Public Broadcasting Service to pioneer and refine a new model \n     of teacher professional development for kindergarten through \n     grade 12 teachers. MATHLINE uses video modeling of standards-\n     based lessons, combined with professionally facilitated \n     online learning communities of teachers, to help mathematics \n     teachers from elementary school through secondary school \n     adopt and implement standards-based practices in their \n     classrooms. This approach allows teachers to update their \n     skills on their own schedules through video, while providing \n     online interaction with peers and master teachers to \n     reinforce that learning. This integrated, self-paced approach \n     breaks down the isolation of classroom teaching while making \n     standards-based best practices available to all participants.\n       ``(2) MATHLINE was developed specifically to disseminate \n     the first national voluntary standards for teaching and \n     learning as developed by the National Council of Teachers of \n     Mathematics (NCTM). During 3 years of actual deployment, more \n     than 5,800 teachers have participated for at least a full \n     year in the demonstration. These teachers, in turn, have \n     taught more than 1,500,000 students cumulatively.\n       ``(3) Independent evaluations indicate that teaching \n     improves and students benefit as a result of the MATHLINE \n     program.\n       ``(4) The MATHLINE program is ready to be expanded to reach \n     many more teachers in more subject areas under the broader \n     title of Teacherline. The Teacherline Program will link the \n     digitized public broadcasting infrastructure with education \n     networks by working with the program's digital membership, \n     and Federal and State agencies, to expand and build upon the \n     successful MATHLINE model and take advantage of greatly \n     expanded access to the Internet and technology in schools, \n     including digital television. Tens of thousands of teachers \n     will have access to the Teacherline Program to advance their \n     teaching skills and their ability to integrate technology \n     into teaching and learning. The Teacherline Program also will \n     leverage the Public Broadcasting Service's historic \n     relationships with higher education to improve preservice \n     teacher training.\n       ``(5) The congressionally appointed Web-based Education \n     Commission recently issued a comprehensive report on Internet \n     learning that called for powerful new Internet resources, \n     especially broadband access, to be made widely and equitably \n     available and affordable for all learners.\n       ``(6) The Web-based Education Commission also called for \n     continuous and relevant training and support for educators \n     and administrators at all levels.\n       ``(7) The National Research Council recently issued a \n     report entitled `Adding It Up: Helping Children Learn \n     Mathematics' that concluded that professional development in \n     mathematics needs to be sustained over years in order to be \n     effective.\n       ``(8) Furthermore, the Glenn Commission, appointed by the \n     Secretary of Education to consider ways of improving \n     preparation and professional growth for mathematics and \n     science teachers concluded that teacher training `depends \n     upon sustained, high-quality professional development'.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Cochran \nin sponsoring the Ready to Learn, Ready to Teach Act of 2001. I commend \nhim for his leadership in improving early learning opportunities for \nchildren and families, so that more children come to school ready to \nlearn.\n  In the early 1990s, Dr. Ernest Boyer, the distinguished former leader \nof the Carnegie Foundation, gave compelling testimony to the Senate \nLabor Committee about the appallingly high number of children who enter \nschool without the skills to prepare them for learning. Their lack of \npreparation presented enormous obstacles to their ability to learn \neffectively in school, and seriously impaired their long-term \nachievement.\n  In response, Congress enacted the Ready to Learn program in 1992, and \n2 years later its promise was so great that we extended it for five \nyears. Because of the Department of Education and the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting, the Ready to Learn initiative became an innovative \nand effective program. By linking the power of television to the world \nof books, many more children have been enabled to become good readers \nmuch more quickly.\n  Many children who enter school without the necessary basic skills are \nsoon placed in a remedial program, which is costly for school systems. \nIt is even more costly, however, for the students who face a bleaker \nfuture.\n  Today, by the time they enter school, the average child will have \nwatched 4,000 hours of television. That is roughly the equivalent of 4 \nyears of school.\n  For far too many youngsters, this is wasted time--time consuming \n``empty calories'' for the brain. Instead, that time could be spent \nreading, writing, and learning. Through Ready to Learn television \nprogramming, children can obtain substantial educational benefits that \nturn TV time into learning time.\n  As a result of Ready to Learn television, millions of children and \nfamilies have access to high-quality television produced by public \ntelevision stations across the country. Tens of thousands of parents \nand child-care providers have learned how to be better role models, to \nreinforce learning, and to be more active participants in children's \nlearning from programs funded through Ready to Learn.\n  For many low-income families, the workshops, books, and television \nshows funded through this program are a vital factor in preparing \nchildren to read. These programs help parents and child-care providers \nteach children the basics, preparing them to enter school ready to \nlearn and ready to succeed.\n  Ready to Learn provides 6.5 hours of non-violent educational \nprogramming a day. These hours include some of the best programs \navailable to children, including Arthur, Barney & Friends, Mister \nRogers' Neighborhood, The Puzzle Place, Reading Rainbow, and Sesame \nStreet.\n  A recent study by the University of Alabama found that Ready to Learn \nworks. Parents who participate in Ready to Learn workshops are more \ncritical consumers of television and their children are more active \nviewers. Children watch 40 percent less television overall, and they \nwatch more education-oriented programming. These parents did more \nhands-on activities and read more minutes with their children than non-\nattendees. They read less for entertainment and more for education. \nThey took their children to libraries and bookstores more than non-\nattendees.\n  Ready to Learn extends beyond the television screen. Thousands of \nworkshops are offered by local television stations, almost always in \nconjunction with local child-care training agencies or early childhood \ndevelopment professionals. These workshops have trained more than \n320,000 parents and professionals who serve and support over 4 million \nchildren across the country.\n  Ready to Learn has published and distributed millions of copies of \nPBS magazine, a quarterly which contains developmentally appropriate \ngames and activities around Ready to Learn programming, parenting \nadvice, news, and other information.\n  In partnership with PBS and other programs, each station receives a \nminimum of 200 books each month for free local distribution. More than \n300,000 books are distributed each year. Twelve of the 15 television \nprograms named ``best for classroom use'' by teachers are PBS programs \naccording to a 1997 study by the Corporation for Public Television.\n  In addition, Ready to Learn stations have won 57 Emmys for their \nchildren's programming.\n  Many of the innovations under Ready to Learn have come from local \nstations. WGBH in Boston is one of the nation's leaders in public \nbroadcasting. It created the Reading Rainbow, and Where in the World is \nCarmen San Diego, which are leaders in educational programming across \nthe country.\n  Last year, WGBH hosted 34 Ready to Learn workshops in Massachusetts. \n1,100 parents and 265 child-care providers and teachers attended. These \nparents and providers in turn worked with 3,400 children, who are now \nbetter prepared to succeed in their schools.\n  WGBY of Springfield is the mainstay of literacy services for Western \nMassachusetts. This station trained 250 home day-care providers, who \nserve 2,500 children. A video lending library makes PBS materials \navailable to teachers to use in their classroom.\n  Workshop participants receive training on using children's programs \nas the starting point for educational activities. Participants receive \nfree books. For some, these are the only books they have ever owned. \nThey receive the PBS Families magazine, in English or Spanish, and they \nalso receive the broadcasting schedules. Each of these resources builds \non the learning that begins with viewing the PBS programs.\n\n  Through partnerships with the Massachusetts Office of Child Care \nServices\n\n[[Page S2829]]\n\nand community-based organizations such as Head Start, Even Start, and \nthe Reach Out & Read Program at Boston Medical Center, Ready to Learn \ntrainers are reaching many low-income families with media and literacy \ninformation.\n  In Worcester, the Clark Street Developmental Learning School offers a \nfamily literacy program that uses Reading Rainbow or Arthur in every \nsession with families. In addition, the school has now expanded its \nefforts to create an adult literacy center in the school. Many of the \nparents involved in the Ready to Learn project now attend the adult \neducation program there.\n  Similar successes are happening across the nation. Since 1994, the \nsponsors of Ready to Learn workshops have given away 1.5 million books. \nTheir program has grown from 10 television stations in 1994 to 130 \ntelevision stations today. They have conducted over 8,500 workshops \nreaching 186,000 parents and 146,000 child care providers, who have in \nturn affected the lives of over four million children.\n  The Ready to Learn, Ready to Teach Act of 2001 that we are \nintroducing today will continue this high-quality children's television \nprogramming. Equally important, it will take this valuable service into \nthe next century through digital television, a powerful resource for \ndelivering additional information through television programs.\n  The Ready to Learn, Ready to Teach Act will also increase the \nauthorization of funds for Ready to Learn programs from $30 million to \n$50 million a year, enabling these programs to reach even more families \nand children with these needed services.\n  The Act also authorizes $20 million for high-quality teacher \nprofessional development. Building on the success of the MathLine \nprogram, the bill will expand the program to include materials for \nhelping teachers to teach to high state standards in core subject \nareas.\n  Participating stations make the teachers workshops available through \ndistricts, schools, and even on the teachers' own television sets. In \nthis way, at their own pace, and in their own time, teachers can review \nthe materials, observe other teachers at work, and reflect on their own \npractices. They can consider ways to improve their teaching, and make \nadjustments to their own practices. Teachers will also receive \nessential help in integrating technology into their teaching.\n  Teachers themselves are very supportive of the contribution that \ntelevision can make to their classrooms. Eighty-eight percent of \nteachers surveyed in 1997 by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \nsaid that quality television used in the classroom helped them be more \ncreative, 92 percent said that it helped them be more effective in the \nclassroom.\n  Again, I commend Senator Cochran for his leadership, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in support of this important legislation, so that \nmany more children can come to school ready to learn.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Allard, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 606. A bill to provide additional authority to the Office of \nOmbudsman of the Environmental Protection Agency; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Ombudsman \nReauthorization Act of 2001 in partnership with the Senator from \nColorado, Senator Allard, and my colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig.\n  We all expect our federal agencies to operate professionally, \nefficiently, and with the interests of the American people at the \nforefront. To help ensure this commitment, several officials are \ncharged with the responsibility of internally auditing and monitoring \nthe operations and expenses of agency and department programs. These \nindividuals are sometimes known as ``watch-dogs'' for their role in \nalerting the public and Congress to questionable activities.\n  Within the Environmental Protection Agency's, EPA, Office of Solid \nWaste and Emergency Response, OSWER, this duty is held by the \nOmbudsman. The Ombudsman is ultimately responsible for responding to \npublic inquiries into the activities of OSWER and investigating those \nmatters that warrant closer scrutiny.\n  Originally established in 1984, the Ombudsman provides the public and \nCongress with an added measure of confidence that controversial waste \ncontrol and emergency response actions by the EPA are being properly \noverseen and investigated where appropriate. Communities in Idaho, for \ntheir part, have twice welcomed the Ombudsman and his staff to our \nstate to look into questionable decisions made by the EPA under the \nSuperfund statute. In both cases, the Ombudsman has made extraordinary \nefforts to keep the public informed on the issues and a part of the \ninvestigations. Each time, the people of Idaho have shown collective \nrelief that someone of the Ombudsman's stature and expertise has become \ninvolved in cleanup decisions in our state. In both cases, the \nOmbudsman has demonstrated an ability to understand the will of the \ncommunity and, despite strong agency resistance, to point out policy \ndecisions for cleanups that were not justified or in the public \ninterest.\n  In 1988, the standing authority of the Ombudsman expired, leaving the \noffice and investigations in a precarious position. In essence, while \nthe Ombudsman endured as an ``at will'' employee of the EPA, the \nOffice's independence and authority have continuously been eroded by \nthe agency. Today, the Ombudsman must get approval for new \ninvestigation and budgetary needs from the very people he and his staff \nmust monitor. With these restrictions on the Ombudsman's functions, the \npublic has become increasingly alarmed by the loss of a true internal \nwatch-dog of EPA activities.\n  The Ombudsman Reauthorization Act of 2001 would help restore public \nconfidence. First and foremost, it would reestablish the statutory \nrecognition of the Office of Ombudsman within the OSWER function of the \nEPA. Second, it would clarify the operational guidelines and \nauthorities of the Ombudsman to collect information on matters \nrequested by the public and investigate questionable agency activities. \nFinally, the measure would create a separate budget authority, free \nfrom the possible influence of those that may be subject to \ninvestigations.\n  This legislation is a careful balance between the need to restore \npublic confidence in the independence of the Ombudsman and the need to \nensure discretion and accountability in investigations conducted by the \nOmbudsman. I invite the Administration to engage us in an effort to \nrecreate the Ombudsman in the model originally envisioned by Congress \nin the 1980s when the office was established. Our work together will \nhelp ensure the American people that EPA OSWER programs are chosen \nbased on merits, functioning well, and are conducted in the interests \nof the public health and the environment.\n  I would like to take a moment to congratulate my colleague, Senator \nAllard, for his partnership in this effort. His leadership on this \nissue has helped raise public and congressional attention when few \nothers recognized the importance of this cause. I salute him for his \ndiligence in advancing this debate, and I have welcomed the opportunity \nto work with him on this legislation.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about an \nissue of government accountability and public safety. Today, my \ncolleague from Idaho, Senator Crapo and I are introducing the Ombudsman \nReauthorization Act of 2001. The bill's goal is to reauthorize the \nOmbudsman's Office within the Environmental Protection Agency's Office \nof Solid Waste and Emergency Response, (OSWER).\n  I'd like to keep my remarks brief, but I want to share my reasoning \nand interest in this issue. Last year, I introduced similar legislation \nbecause of an ongoing battle between the citizens of a Denver \nneighborhood and the EPA concerning the Shattuck Superfund site. Only \nthrough the work of the Ombudsman's office, did the truth finally \nbecome known.\n  The story surrounding the Shattuck site in the Overland Park \nneighborhood in southwest Denver and what the EPA did to this community \nwill have a lasting impact not only on the residents of the Overland \nPark neighborhood, but on each and every one of us who looks to the EPA \nto be the guardian of our nation's environmental health and safety. In \n1997, after several years of\n\n[[Page S2830]]\n\nEPA stonewalling, the residents of Overland Park in Denver brought \ntheir concerns about a Superfund site in their neighborhood and their \nfrustrations with the EPA to my attention. I learned that the \nneighborhood had run into a wall of bureaucracy that was unresponsive \nto the very public it is charged with protecting and I requested the \nOmbudsman's intervention. In early 1999, the Ombudsman's office began \nan investigation and quickly determined that the claims made by \nresidents were not only meritorious, but the EPA officials had engaged \nin an effort to keep documents and decisions hidden from the public \nthereby placing their health in danger.\n  The Shattuck saga has been a frustrating and often disheartening \nexperience for all involved. It is an example of what can happen when a \ngovernment entity goes unchecked. For the residents of Denver, the \nOffice of Ombudsman afforded the only opportunity to reveal the truth, \nand for the health and safety of the public to be given proper \npriority. In fact, the Ombudsman was so successful at uncovering the \nfacts surrounding Shattuck, his investigation has resulted in EPA \nofficials restructuring the office so that its actions may be \nrestricted, and its independence compromised.\n  Without the Ombudsman's investigation on Shattuck, the residents of \nOverland Park would have never learned the truth about the decisions \nmade which had direct impact on their personal health. The Ombudsman's \ninvestigation brought integrity back into the process. Without the \nOmbudsman's work, a trusted federal agency would have been able to \nsuccessfully hide the truth from the very people it is charged to \nprotect. The Shattuck issue is a decade long example of why citizens' \ntrust in their government has waned. Our bill will preserve the only \nmechanism within the EPA that the public can trust to protect their \nhealth and safety.\n  I am not alone in my concerns and the Shattuck case is not unique. \nMany of my fellow Senators and Representatives have experienced similar \nbattles with the EPA over the years in their states.\n  After I introduced legislation last year, Senator Crapo joined me in \nmy legislative endeavors and has been a great asset. In experiencing a \nsimilar superfund problem in his home state of Idaho, Senator Crapo \nknows firsthand the need for this independent and trustworthy office. \nAs a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, his \nassistance is greatly appreciated by me, and by all those who believe \nthat their government should be there to serve the needs of the people. \nWith Senator Crapo's assistance, the committee held a hearing on my \nbill last year which helped to bring many of these concerns to light \nand push the issue forward. We have worked together in the first months \nof this Congress to craft this new bill, which I believe takes great \nstrides in properly defining the role, powers, duties and \nresponsibilities of a federal ombudsman. The bill guarantees the much \nneeded independence of the office without creating another \nunaccountable government entity.\n  Let me make it clear that my main priority in introducing this bill, \nis to keep the EPA OSWER Ombudsman Office independent and open for \nbusiness. I believe that in the future, my colleagues may find \nthemselves in a similar situation and I want to make sure that they \nhave every assurance that the public's safety is protected, that its \nvoice is heard, that its questions are answered and that its concerns \nare addressed.\n  I look forward to working with new EPA Administrator Whitman to \naddress these concerns and I'm sure she will agree with me on the need \nfor government accountability and public confidence.\n  I would ask all my colleagues to take a close look at this bill and \njoin Senator Crapo and me in passing it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Gramm):\n  S. 607. A bill to amend the National Housing Act to require partial \nrebates of FHA mortgage insurance premiums to certain mortgagors upon \npayment of their FHA-insured mortgages; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ndirect the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to reinstate \ndistributive shares for excess amounts in the Federal Housing \nAdministration, FHA, insurance fund.\n  FHA provides an important program for first time, low- and moderate-\nincome, and minority homeowners. These families should not be \novercharged on FHA premiums. Premiums in excess of an amount necessary \nto maintain an actuarially sound reserve ratio in the FHA Mutual \nMortgage Insurance, MMI, Fund can only be characterized as a tax on \nhomeownership.\n  On the other hand, Congress, in conjunction with the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, must ensure that FHA stays healthy, so \nthat it can continue to function as an important source of \nhomeownership. The Congress has previously determined that a capital \nreserve ratio of 2 percent of the MMI fund's amortized insurance-in-\nforce is necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of the MMI fund. \nHowever, it has never been clear how the Congress arrived at that \nnumber.\n  Last year, the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche found that the \ncapital adequacy ratio of the fund was 3.66 percent, far in excess of \nthe Congressionally mandated goal of 2 percent. While it is important \nfor Congress to know the capital adequacy ratio, it is just as \nimportant to understand the implications of the ratio and whether a 2 \npercent reserve is sufficient.\n  In order to get a better handle on this issue I requested that the \nGeneral Accounting Office look into the matter, and earlier this week I \nheld a hearing of the Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation to \nexamine their findings. GAO's report finds that the current reserve is \nadequate to withstand all but the most serious economic scenarios. \nHowever, GAO also sounds a note of caution. Economic conditions can \nquickly change, thus changing the value of the fund and the level of \nreserve.\n  I believe that the most prudent court of action is for the Congress \nto increase the reserve requirement to either 2.5 percent or 3 percent \nof the insurance in force, and then direct the Department to reinstate \ndistributive shares whenever the reserve fund becomes excessive. \nTherefore, I am reintroducing legislation that would require partial \nrebates of FHA mortgage insurance premiums to certain mortgagors upon \nrepayment of their FHA insured mortgages. My legislation takes the \ncautious approach of providing rebates only when the reserve ratio is \nin excess of 3 percent, or 150 percent of the reserve level currently \nmandated by Congress. If the reserve ratio drops below 3 percent, \ndistributive shares would be suspended. Of course this rebate would be \nbased on sound actuarial and accounting practice since a major reason \nfor the strength in the fund is that fact that we have experienced a \nnear perfect economy in recent years.\n  The FHA single family mortgage program was designed to operate as a \nmutual insurance program where homeowners were granted rebates in \nexcess of premiums required to maintain actuarial soundness. This \nrebate program was suspended at the direction of Congress in 1990 when \nthe MMI fund was in the red--with the intent that the payment of \ndistributive shares or rebates would resume when the Fund was again \nfinancially sound. With a sufficient capital reserve ratio, it is time \nto resume rebates and return the MMI program to its prior status as a \nmutual insurance fund.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 607\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It is unfortunate because that fact acknowledges that \nwe have made little progress in getting the return of American children \nwho have been abducted and taken abroad, usually by a parent.\n  This resolution addresses the serious issue of international child \nabduction and the importance of The Hague Special Review Commission on \nInternational Child Abduction which formally began its work yesterday \nand will continue meeting until March 28.\n  This commission is raising the importance and the necessity of \ncompliance with The Hague Convention on the International Aspects of \nChild Abduction. The Hague convention is in\n\n[[Page S2832]]\n\nplace to facilitate the return of internationally abducted children to \ntheir countries of ``habitual residence'' for custody determination. \nThis means, according to the Hague convention many countries have \nsigned, when there is a dispute about the custody of a child, the \nchild's place of ``habitual residence'' is the country where that \ndetermination should be made.\n  Sadly, it has been clear for some time that all countries that have \nsigned the convention do not take their obligation seriously. Certain \ncountries in particular--allies of ours such as Germany, Austria, \nSweden--have performed especially poorly in returning children and \nallowing family visitation options.\n\n  What are we talking about? What is the situation that brings about \nthis international parental kidnapping? Usually it is a case such as \nthis: An American citizen falls in love, marries someone from another \ncountry, they decide to live in the United States, and a child is born. \nThen one day the spouse who is the American citizen, the spouse who was \none of the two parties to this union, wakes up and finds the other \nspouse gone and the child gone. That mother, that father, takes that \nchild back to where that mother or dad came from originally, and now \nthe parent in the United States is looking for their child.\n  This is a human tragedy, a tragedy that is repeated in this country \nmany times every year.\n  As many of my colleagues know, this is not the first time I have come \nto the Senate floor to talk about this issue and to raise the tragic \nproblem of international child abduction. In fact, exactly 1 year ago \ntoday, I came to the Senate floor to discuss this issue. I came to the \nfloor and a year ago introduced a similar resolution urging compliance \nwith the Hague convention. While the House and the Senate both passed \nthat resolution, regrettably I have to be back here again this \nafternoon because, tragically, we have seen very little, if any, \nprogress in gaining signatory compliance and ultimately in getting our \nchildren back.\n  Specifically, the resolution before us today identifies key problems \nwith the current Hague convention. What are these problems?\n  No. 1, a lack of awareness about international parental kidnappings \namong policymakers and the general public in the signatory nations. \nThis is just not an issue that people really understand, and it is not \nan issue to which the governments of the signatory countries are paying \nany attention.\n  No. 2, a lack of awareness and training of judges who hear these \ncases, who hear these international abduction cases, training that \nwould enable them to interpret and rule on these cases fairly and would \nenable them to appreciate the importance of these cases.\n  No. 3, different interpretations of the Hague convention by signatory \nnations. We see that all the time. There is no uniformity or \nconsistency.\n  No. 4, one of the problems with the Hague convention is the failed \nenforcement of parental access rights and a lack of enforcement of \ncourt orders for the return of children.\n  Finally, we see a narrow exception to the requirement of returning \nchildren, which prevents them from being returned if they are perceived \nto be, upon return--and this is the language that is in the Hague \nconvention--in grave risk of being exposed to psychologically damaging \nor physically harmful situations.\n  Instead of being the exception, this loophole has really become the \nrule. It has become standard procedure and is frequently used as a \njustification for not returning children at all. Basically, all the \ncourt has to do is to make a determination that if the child were \nreturned to his or her parent in the country where the child was \noriginally brought up, if the court finds that this would place the \nchild in grave risk of being exposed to a psychologically damaging \nor physically harmful situation, the court does not have to abide by \nThe Hague convention. There is nothing wrong with the intent, but it is \nabundantly clear that this language is being used as a loophole, \nparticularly in the area of finding a grave risk of psychological \ndamage being done. These are some of the problems.\n\n  Additionally, our resolution calls on this special session of The \nHague that is now meeting to determine practice guidelines, practice \nguidelines that would build on expert opinions and research-based \npractices in handling international child custody disputes and \nkidnappings.\n  Why do we need these guidelines? We need these guidelines because \ncurrently set standards are not in place telling signatory nations what \nto do when a court rules that a child should be returned. By \nimplementing these guidelines, we would be telling nations that they \ncould no longer hide behind the vagueness of The Hague convention \narticles anymore. They would not be able to use a lack of guidelines as \na reason to keep children from a parent and from their homeland.\n  The reality is, we cannot understate nor can we ignore the importance \nof getting these children returned to their homes in the United States. \nSadly, our previous administration, the Clinton administration, did not \nput these children at the top of its priority list. As a result, the \nnumber of international abductions has continued to increase.\n  In 1997, 280 abducted American children were living in foreign \ncountries. That is the official number. I happen to believe, based upon \nanecdotal evidence, based upon conversations I have had with my \ncolleagues and with other individuals, that the number in 1997 was much \nhigher than that.\n  The official number is 280 in 1997 who were abducted children who \nwere living in foreign countries. In 1998, that number increased to \n398. And in 1999, the official number was 441. Last year, it was a \nstaggering 775.\n  Quite candidly, our inability to resolve these cases has been due to, \nin part at least, our Government's lack of attention to this issue.\n  According to the State Department, each year the United States sends \nan estimated 90 percent of kidnapped children back to foreign \ncountries. In other words, this country, the United States, that has \nsigned The Hague convention, complies in 90 percent of the cases. We \nmake determinations in our courts that in 90 percent of the cases these \nchildren should in fact be returned to the place they were resident \nwhen they were abducted and taken from these countries. So the United \nStates is in compliance. We are following The Hague convention.\n  As the lawyers would say, we come to this issue with clean hands. The \nsad fact is, though, that even though we do it 90 percent of the time, \nand even though we are in compliance with the Hague, the rate of return \nof American children by other nations belonging to the Hague convention \nis much lower. A State Department report singles out several countries \nfor their noncompliance with the accord, including Mauritius, Austria, \nHonduras, Mexico, and Sweden.\n  Notably absent from this report, however, was Germany, which, as I \nhave already mentioned, has also established a disturbing pattern of \nnoncompliance. Because of Germany's noncompliance record, an American/\nGerman working group on child custody issues has been established to \nhelp encourage Germany to return abducted children. However, \nessentially no progress has been made regarding open cases--either in \nthe return of children to the United States or in allowing left-behind \nparents adequate visits with their children in Germany. To that end, we \nmust not allow Germany--or any other signatory nation--to ignore their \nconvention obligations and turn blindly against the parents who have \nsuffered unbelievable heartache due to the loss of their children.\n  What we have to remember when a parent abducts a child is that each \nabduction involves the destruction of a family. Yes, it is unfair for \nthe mother or father who is left behind, but much more importantly, it \nis unfair for that child. A good illustration of this is what happened \nto Tom Sylvester of Cincinnati, OH. I have talked to Mr. Sylvester \nabout his case, about his child. I have seen the desperation on his \nface. Tom is the father of a little girl named Carina, whom he has seen \nfor a total of only about 18 days since his ex-wife abducted her from \nMichigan, where they lived, in 1995. The ex-wife took this little girl \nto Austria. The day after the kidnapping, Mr. Sylvester filed a \ncomplaint with the State Department and started legal proceedings under \nthe Hague convention.\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\n  An Austrian court heard his complaint, and the court ordered the \nreturn of Carina to Mr. Sylvester. However, this court order was never \nenforced, and Carina's mother took the child into hiding. Eventually, \nthough, when Carina's mother surfaced with the child, the Austrian \ncourts reversed their decision on returning her to the father, finding \nthat she ``resettled into her new environment''--a decision clearly \ncontrary to the terms of the Hague convention.\n  Sadly, Mr. Sylvester is still waiting to get his little girl back.\n  The bottom line is this, Mr. President: We must make the return of \nAmerica's children a top priority with our State Department, a top \npriority with our Justice Department. Governance and policymaking are \nclearly about setting priorities. It is my hope that the new leadership \nin our State Department and the new leadership in the Justice \nDepartment will make that issue a top priority and will start trying to \nget these kids back.\n  I raised this issue with Attorney General Ashcroft during his Senate \nconfirmation hearings, and I have written to the Secretary of State as \nwell about the urgency of this issue. Today, I again say to our Justice \nDepartment and to our State Department: We must begin to prioritize \nthese cases. Yes, it is important to worry about trade issues. Yes, \nthere are many other issues on the desks of the State Department and \nour embassies. But what could be more important than a child? If we can \nsay that foreign trade is important, we should also say that our \nchildren are important as well.\n  It is a question of setting priorities, and we must begin to \nprioritize these cases, and our State Department and our Justice \nDepartment must do this. No excuses should be accepted by the parents \nof these children, nor by the Senate, nor by the House of \nRepresentatives, nor by the American people. This must be a priority. \nThese kids must be a priority.\n  As a parent and a grandparent, I cannot begin to imagine the \nnightmare so many American parents face when their children are \nkidnapped by a current or former spouse and taken abroad. It is hard to \nimagine. But, tragically, this is a very real and daily nightmare for \nhundreds of parents right here in this country. That is why the \nresolution we have introduced is critical to encouraging the safe \nreturn of children to the United States. It gives us an opportunity to \nhelp make a positive difference in the lives of children and their \nfamilies.\n  In the end, if we are to succeed in bringing parentally abducted \nchildren back to their homes in the United States, the Federal \nGovernment must take an active role in their return. Ultimately, our \nGovernment has an obligation to these parents, but much more \nimportantly, to these children. We must place our children first. They \nmust become our priority.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in support and passage of this very \nimportant resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/23/senate-section/article/S2833-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE HAGUE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.
