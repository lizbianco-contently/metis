Mr. President, I yield myself 17 minutes.\n  Today I would like to speak for a few minutes about the fight against \ncrime in America. We have made tremendous progress over the last 10 \nyears, largely by putting more police officers on the street. But there \nare some troubling signs that the tide is turning against us. In 2000, \nthe drop in the national crime rate was the smallest since 1991. And \njust yesterday, we learned that crime in North Carolina actually went \nup last year, for the first time since 1995.\n  So now is not the time to rest on the laurels of our victories \nagainst crime. It is time to bring the fight to the stubbornest pockets \nof criminality and the toughest problems in the justice system.\n\n[[Page S5392]]\n\n  In my view, the number one problem in our criminal justice system \ntoday is the early release system--sometimes called probation, \nsometimes parole, sometimes intensive supervision. But whatever you \ncall it, it doesn't work. It is overburdened, understaffed, \ninconsistent, and almost completely unsuccessful.\n  There are about 4\\1/2\\ million people on probation and parole today, \nand most of them will break the law again and end up back in prison. \nAccording to a Justice Department study reported in the New York Times \nlast week, two out of three inmates released from prison in 1994 were \narrested again within 3 years. And that just counts the people who got \ncaught. People on parole make up less than 1 percent of the American \npopulation, but they account for over 35 percent of the people entering \nprison each year.\n  When criminals commit crime after crime after crime, we all suffer, \nand the poorest among us suffer the most. People leaving prison usually \ngo back to the same tough neighborhoods they came from. In Winston-\nSalem, NC, 80 percent of the prisoners go back to 40 percent of the \ncity. And when they return home to return to crime, it's the very last \nthing their struggling neighborhood needs.\n  We need to put an end to this. And we can put an end to it--if we \nfollow the example of successful efforts in states and communities \nacross the country, including a new effort in Winston-Salem. I want to \nname three principles culled from these successful efforts.\n  First, we must make it clear that parole is a simple bargain--obey \nthe law or suffer the consequences.\n  Second, we need a system that has the resources to monitor the \nenormous number of offenders and the methods to monitor them \neffectively.\n  Finally, we need to give those offenders who are truly ready to \nbecome law-abiding citizens the chance to succeed.\n  Let me explain each of these principles a little further.\n  First and foremost, we need real punishments for people who commit \nreal violations of probation and parole. Today we have the opposite. We \nhave a system where at one extreme, people can violate probation or \nparole 10 times before anything actually happens to them. Nearly half \nthe people in the probation system have violated the terms of \nprobation, but only one in five gets sent back to jail for doing it. At \nthe other extreme we have some people who miss an appointment and go \nback to jail for years. It just doesn't make sense.\n  Let me give an example. We know that many people commit crimes to \nfeed their drug habits. Almost half of the crimes in many big cities \nare committed by drug users. So if we are going to cut crime, we have \nto get people on probation and parole off of drugs.\n  Now, it's true that right now, we say you have to remain drug-free \nwhile you're on probation or parole. But too often, that requirement \nonly exists on paper. Drug tests are few and far between--maybe once a \nmonth and maybe less, so if a guy is using, he can hide it. If he does \nget caught, his parole officer has to negotiate with a bureaucracy to \nget the guy punished, so a lot of the time the officer doesn't bother. \nAnd if he does bother, the judge may choose not to impose the only \npunishment that's available, which may be years in jail.\n  The result of all this is that drug users on probation or parole know \nthey're not likely to get caught, and so they use again and again and \nagain. As they return to addiction, they commit more crimes.\n  We can do better. A rational probation and parole system would deter \ncrime before it happens, using two basic elements. First, we would have \nstrict supervision focused on the conduct that leads to crime. Instead \nof just rules against drug use, we would have frequent drug testing, \nlike twice-a-week testing.\n  Second--and this is critical--we would have automatic punishments for \npeople who break the rules. Those punishments would be swift and \ncertain and graduated. You test positive for drugs, you get punished. \nYou test positive a second time, you get punished more severely. \nAutomatic, no exceptions; simple, swift punishment. Here in the \nDistrict of Columbia, the system is moving in this direction, and \nresearch shows that it is helping in the fight against crime. It is \ntime for more places to do the same.\n  By the way, the system ought to be the same for other violations of \nprobation and parole besides drug abuse. Set real rules that focus on \nconduct connected with crime. If you break those rules, you suffer the \nconsequences. That simple.\n  No. 2: We need to get probation and parole officers out of their \noffices and on the streets. Right now, a lot of probation and parole \nofficers sit in their offices and wait for trouble to come to them. A \ntypical probation officer has two 15-minute meetings with each \nprobationer every month. That is no way to keep tabs on anybody.\n  What needs to happen in probation and parole today is not all that \ndifferent from what needed to happen in police work 20 years ago. \nTwenty years ago, cops spent their time in squad cars responding to \ncrimes. They caught some bad guys, but they did not stop crime before \nit happened.\n  Some innovative police chiefs went back to the method of policing \nthey had learned when they first came on the force. They moved police \nofficers out of the cars and back onto the beat, where they got to know \nthe neighborhood; got to know the shopkeepers, the pastors, the \nprincipals; got to learn from the many good folks in every community \nwho the handful of troublemakers were. And this kind of police work, \ncommunity policing supported by the COPS program, has helped to cut \ncrime rates across America.\n  It is time for the same revolution in probation and parole: Officers \nneed to know the communities, not just the criminals. It has worked in \nWinston-Salem, where teams of probation and police, working with the \nclergy and the community, helped cut juvenile violence by 35 percent in \nthe last year. That effort drew on a success in Boston where a team \neffort called Operation Nightlight helped cut youth homicides by 65 \npercent.\n  Getting probation officers back on the streets will not be easy. For \none thing, it will be impossible until we cut the massive burdens on \nthese officers. The average probation officer had over five times as \nmany cases in the late 1990s as in the early 1970s--sometimes 200 \ncases. Under these conditions, even the most dedicated public servant \ncannot get the job done. So we have to both change the bureaucratic \nculture and cut the caseloads in these departments. That may mean \nincreasing the number of officers, it may mean holding managers more \naccountable, it may mean increasing competition for the work. But it is \nsomething we have to do.\n  No. 3, We need to make sure offenders who are ready to turn their \nlives around have a real chance to do it.\n  A convict's debt to society does not end with his prison term. Men \nwho have left prison have a responsibility to obey the law, stay off \ndrugs, and stop victimizing their community. They have another \nresponsibility as well--a responsibility to become productive members \nof our society who work hard, pay taxes, and support their children. If \nthey are willing to fulfill those responsibilities, we have to be \nwilling to help them and keep an eye on them while they do.\n  This is not about what society owes to prisoners, but we have to face \nthe reality that we will never build enough prisons to keep people \nbehind bars forever, and we would not want to be a society that did. \nExcept for a tiny minority, they all come back to our communities.\n  This is about what society owes vulnerable communities. The last \nthing they need is an influx of people who are addicted to drugs and do \nnot have jobs and do not have supervision. Far too often, that is what \nour prisons are churning out today.\n  We know that drug treatment helps prisoners get straight, but the \nshare of prisoners receiving treatment dropped from 25 percent at the \nbeginning of the 1990s to just 10 percent at the end. We know that \nprisoners who learn to read and write are less likely to commit new \ncrimes, but we have cut prison literacy programs. We know that when \nsomebody leaves jail, giving him a sweatsuit and sending him to the bus \nstation in the dead of night is not the way to give him a fresh start. \nToo often, though, that is all we do when we release people from \nprison.\n\n[[Page S5393]]\n\n  We need to recognize that enabling prisoners to reintegrate into our \ncommunities as lawful and productive citizens is good for everybody. We \nshould support proven efforts that get former prisoners to beat \naddictions and stay at work. And we should support the efforts of \ncommunity leaders, especially religious leaders, to keep a stern eye on \nformer offenders, while also lending them a helping hand. This is \nsomething that is beginning to work in Winston-Salem thanks to the \nCenter for Community Safety at Winston-Salem State University. It is \nbeginning to work in places like Maryland and Ohio. It is something \nthat needs to work across America.\n  That is the challenge: First, develop real and automatic punishments \nfor real violations of probation and parole. Second, enable probation \nand parole officers to get out of their offices and onto the streets. \nThird, make sure offenders who are ready to turn their lives around \nhave the chance to do it.\n  Meeting that challenge will not be easy. Every State has different \nprobation and parole systems. Some States have differences within their \nsystems. While the truth is that a lot of these systems are not \nworking, some of them are. Every reform I have described is already \nworking someplace in America today. Our job in Washington will be to \nspread the things that work. I know there is legislation in conference \nright now that will help do that in a limited way.\n  I believe we should think bigger, on the model of the COPS Program, a \nprogram that not only helped police departments hire over 100,000 more \ncops, but that also helped change the way police departments do \nbusiness. We need the same kind of effort when it comes to transforming \nprobation and parole into an effective, accountable system for reducing \ncrime.\n  It may be that this administration will oppose this effort. Their \ncurrent budget has already proposed gutting the COPS Program. This \nadministration seems to think that permanent tax cuts for the very \nwealthiest Americans are more important than cutting crime in the very \npoorest communities. I see it differently.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5393-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ESTATE TAX\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I also wish to say a few words about the \nestate tax debate we are having right now.\n  With all due respect for my colleagues, I think this debate shows \nthat a lot of people in Washington are totally out of touch with \nregular people back at home. I think we should step back and take stock \nof where we are right now.\n  No. 1, as all of us know, we are in the middle of fighting a war \nagainst terrorism, and we do not know when that war will end. Our young \nmen and women are in harm's way overseas as I speak.\n  Here at home, we have very serious homeland security needs that the \nadministration is struggling to meet. It is no exaggeration to say that \nAmericans' lives depend on the success of those efforts. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2: We have a whole raft of serious needs in our country. I have \nbeen talking about the rising crime rate, but that is just the \nbeginning. We have seniors who cannot pay for the medicine they need to \nlive. We have parents who cannot afford to send their kids to college. \nWe have children who go to school every day in crowded classrooms with \nleaky roofs, even as this administration cuts funding for education. \nThat list goes on and on.\n  No. 3: We have a coming challenge in Social Security. We are going to \nhave baby boomers retiring in huge numbers, and we are going to have to \nfind a way to keep our social contract with them.\n  No. 1, we have a costly war against terrorism to fight abroad and at \nhome. No. 2, we have deep problems with crime and education and health \ncare that we are not addressing. No. 3, we have a coming crisis in \nSocial Security.\n  And here is No. 4. Right now we cannot afford to address a lot of our \nserious needs--and in fact, our economy continues to sputter after a \ndecade of extraordinary growth--because the country has gone from a \nmultitrillion dollar surplus to a deficit in barely a year. That is \nvery largely because of the tax cuts targeted to the wealthy this \nCongress already passed. It is a breathtaking fiscal turnaround.\n  With terrorism, with crime and education and health care needs, with \na Social Security crisis, with massive fiscal hemorrhaging, what are we \ntalking about here today?\n  We are not talking about reforming the estate tax to eliminate unfair \nburdens on farmers and small businesses, something I support. I very \nstrongly believe that farmers and small businesses have to be protected \nfrom estate taxes.\n  We are talking about whether to blow another massive hole in the \nbudget to pay for a tax cut that mostly benefits about 3,000 of the \nwealthiest families each year. In a country of over 275 million people, \nmany of them struggling to pay their mortgages and send their kids to \ncollege, we are talking about multimillion dollar windfalls for about \nthree thousand fortunate families.\n  I have only one question. Is this really why the American people send \nus here, to massively cut taxes on a very fortunate few while we are \nfighting terrorism and Social Security is in trouble and millions of \nmiddle class people are struggling? I do not think that is why people \nsend us here.\n  What my colleagues are trying to do today on the estate tax is wrong \nfrom a national security perspective. It is wrong from a Social \nSecurity perspective. It is wrong from an economic perspective. And \nmost important of all, it is wrong from a moral perspective.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from North Carolina \nfor his remarks with regard to his views on probation and the \ndeteriorating situation with regard to how we are moving and \nprogressing with regard to crime. I am also glad to hear the Senator \nfrom North Carolina speak about estate tax in the context of Social \nSecurity. In fact, I will be speaking in a minute with regard to the \nSocial Security issue.\n  It seems inconceivable to me that the roughly 3,000 people the \nSenator is talking about in our Nation, those who have benefited most \nfrom the power and the success of our Nation economically and done so \nwell, should put at jeopardy the universal program that is such an \nimportant part of retirement security for so many Americans. It does \nnot seem right in the context of the national security, but truly it \nseems misplaced when one thinks about Social Security for the breadth \nof Americans.\n  So I commend the Senator for his remarks, and particularly the tying \ntogether and juxtaposition of those efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5393-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5393-S5395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I have \nover the last few weeks been speaking regularly with regard to Social \nSecurity and proposals to privatize Social Security. I think this is \none of the most important debates we as the Senate and Americans need \nto have. It needs to be done before elections, not afterwards, because \nI think we need to hear from the American people about what it is they \nwant.\n  To many Americans, certainly to whom I talk, and many of my \nconstituents in the State of New Jersey--and I certainly hear it from \nmy colleagues, and I feel strongly--these proposals that are \ncirculating with regard to private takings of Social Security are not \nthe mindset of most Americans. That is particularly true when people \nbecome aware that they will involve deep cuts in guaranteed benefits \nand that, by implication, is going to force many Americans to work \nlonger, delay their retirement, and develop a level of insecurity in a \nprogram that was really designed to promote security among senior \ncitizens in our Nation.\n  The fact is that we have seen developing an undermining of retirement \nsecurity for a whole host of reasons, whether it is the diminishment of \nthe number of Americans who are covered by defined benefit programs or \nthe insecurity of 401(k)s which we have seen in light of some of the \nelements that have come out of Enron. It is very hard for me and for \nmost of the people with\n\n[[Page S5394]]\n\nwhom I have conversations to understand why we should be taking the \nsecurity out of Social Security.\n  President Bush's Social Security Commission proposed privatization \nplans--there were three of them--that would cut guaranteed benefits for \ncurrent workers by more than 25 percent. Those cuts would exceed 45 \npercent for those who would be retiring long in the future. They would \napply even to those who choose not to invest in privatized accounts, \nand they would be even deeper for those who did not make such \ninvestments. In fact, actual cuts are likely to be deeper still. This \nis an important part. There is a high probability the cuts will be \ndeeper since the Commission's plans--all three of them--are dependent \non significant infusions of general revenue funds to accomplish the \ntransition from the current system we have, the pay-as-you-go system, \nto the privatized system. This is arithmetic. It is not something that \nis political or partisan.\n  The only way to get from one place to the other is by taking roughly \na trillion dollars from general revenues to make it supportable, if the \nsame benefit payment schedule is going to be held to that which we have \nnow for most future retiring American citizens.\n\n  It is hard to understand how we can talk about taking funding from \ngeneral revenues in the current circumstance when we passed a debt \nceiling limit yesterday of another $450 billion, and that is only \nexpected to take us for 18 months. We have a growing deficit problem in \nthis country. Put that together with a need to be able to provide \ngeneral revenues to support this initiative towards privatization and I \nthink we have a real problem. We have a train wreck coming. To me, that \nis not the direction in which we should go.\n  So I hope we will look at these in a serious way. The Commission's \nreport itself talks about these 25-percent cuts and 45-percent cuts. \nThe Social Security actuaries are the ones who present them. While they \ndid not speak to it directly, those cuts will even be more serious and \nmore immediate for surviving beneficiaries and disabled beneficiaries \nfrom the Social Security Program.\n  We are basically taking a program that has worked, has reduced the \npoverty level for senior citizens in America, and really putting it at \ngreat jeopardy. That is why I feel so strongly about speaking out on a \nrepeated basis to develop this debate.\n  Despite the very clear proposals developed by the Bush Commission, my \nfear is that few Americans have any real idea what is at stake in \nregard to what I have described. I am afraid a lot of this is not on \npeople's radar screens because there has not been a lot of debate about \nit. There has not been a lot of talk about it.\n  There is a point of view that this ought to be put off until after \nthe election. I think it is important that those of us who believe in \nprotecting Social Security as we basically know it--there will have to \nbe some changes but basically as we know it--should be talking about \nthe true nature of the kinds of cuts that are being talked about.\n  A little bit of this dialogue on the Senate floor has developed into \nsome debate, at least inside the beltway. I would like to take it \noutside the beltway because that is where the real impact will lie. But \nthere has been a continuing dialogue between the Cato Institute and \nmyself. A minority of members of the Bush Commission have responded to \nsome of the commentary I have tried to make. We have both exchanged \nlong and relatively detailed treatises that are translated into \nexplaining each other's positions, and I think that is all healthy. I \nthink that is good. Hopefully, there will be more debate in the future.\n  This past weekend, a new player entered the debate, at least as \nreported by the Washington Times. The Commissioner of Social Security, \nMs. Anne Barnhart, went on the record to criticize Democrats--at least \none Democrat--for using false charges and for what the article calls \nincendiary rhetoric. I hope people do not presume the kind of language \nI am using today is incendiary. It is trying to get to a healthy debate \nabout how Social Security should work and how it will impact seniors, \nsurvivors, and disability beneficiaries in America.\n  The article quotes Ms. Barnhart as stating:\n\n       The most important message I want to send out is that \n     benefits are not going to be affected.\n\n  Let me repeat, ``benefits are not going to be affected,'' according \nto Ms. Barnhart.\n  Ms. Barnhart then seemed to back off in the article--again, I did not \nsee the full text of her remarks--and adopt a little less absolute \napproach. That is hopeful because that cannot be an absolute condition \nof the interpretation of the President's proposals, offering assurances \nonly to retirees, current retirees, near-term retirees.\n  In any event, I was very disappointed by these reported statements \nwhich, in fact, I have tried to respond to in a number of venues, which \nI believe are highly inaccurate in themselves. The truth is, as I said \nbefore, President Bush's Social Security Commission proposed \nprivatization plans that call for deep cuts in guaranteeing benefits. \nThis is by the Social Security actuaries themselves. I do not happen to \nhave the pages, but I can cite it in the report that the Commission put \nforward. As I said, these cuts apply to even those who do not choose to \ninvest in privatized accounts.\n  It seems to me we ought to have this on facts at least as they are \ntalked about. I do not want to go back through the point, but if we are \nto avoid these cuts, even for near-term retirees, or certainly for \nsurvivors and disability beneficiaries, we will have to have \nsignificant transfers from the General Treasury to be able to sustain \nSocial Security benefits even for those groups. I think that is going \nto be an increasing challenge for this body, for public policymakers in \ngeneral, because we are running deficits.\n  Arguing that benefits are not going to be affected seems precisely \nthe kind of false charge for which Ms. Barnhart reportedly was \ncriticizing Democrats.\n  This is a debate we need to have. We need to have it on substance. We \nneed to make it balanced, thoughtful, very public. I will work to that \nend. There is not a more important issue--perhaps prescription drugs, \nas the Presiding Officer is articulately making the case to the \nAmerican people. This gets at retirement security, things that make a \ndifference in real people's lives. I was in the chair several weeks ago \nwhen the Presiding Officer made the case that he went to a diner and \nheard what was on people's minds. Prescription drugs are on people's \nminds, and making sure that Social Security is there as people have \nexpected, as they have paid into the system. It is right in the gut to \nmost Americans, at least those diners I go to in New Jersey. This is \nsomething we have to be attentive to, we need to debate, we need to \ncome to a conclusion, and get on with the process.\n  I am hopeful Ms. Barnhart was misquoted in the Washington Times. I \nhave been misquoted once in a while, as I am sure all Members have. I \ndo not think engaging in incendiary commentary is helpful, nor do I \nthink many of my colleagues do. I hope she will write to the editor of \nthe paper and clear up the matter. I would love to get into a very \nserious debate about the substance of how we will finance Social \nSecurity as we go forward. That is an important element of our \nnecessary debate to get to long-term solutions that make a difference \nin people's lives.\n  I hope she will review the facts involved in the President's \ncommission's report when we are talking about these deep cuts in \nguaranteed benefits. They are there in black and white.\n  I ask unanimous consent a copy of the Washington Times article and my \nresponse to Ms. Barnhart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 8, 2002]\n\n                    Social Security Reform Defended\n\n                           (By Donald Lambro)\n\n       The head of the Social Security Administration criticized \n     Democrats yesterday for using false charges and ``incendiary \n     rhetoric'' to stir up political fears over President Bush's \n     plan to reform the retirement system.\n       Jo Anne Barnhart said there is no truth to Democratic \n     claims that Mr. Bush's plan will cut retiree benefits or that \n     the administration was robbing the trust fund.\n       ``I think the fear factor is really unfortunate. It is \n     important that Social Security beneficiaries be reassured,'' \n     said Mrs.\n\n[[Page S5395]]\n\n     Barnhart told The Washington Times yesterday--her first \n     interview since Mr. Bush selected her last summer to run the \n     nation's largest retirement program.\n       ``The use of highly charged, incendiary rhetoric doesn't \n     accomplish this,'' she said.\n       Mrs. Barnhart spoke approvingly of Mr. Bush's plan, saying \n     it's important to restore faith in the program and give \n     people more control over their retirement funds.\n       ``The most important message that I want to send out is \n     that benefits are not going to be affected. Regardless of \n     what proposal you look at in terms of reform, I want to \n     reassure retirees and near-retirees that they will not have a \n     reduction in benefits,'' she said.\n       Democratic leaders have been escalating their attacks on \n     Mr. Bush's Social Security reform plan in recent weeks, \n     believing that the issue will motivate older Americans to \n     vote in larger numbers against Republican congressional \n     candidates this fall.\n       ``It is indisputable that the Bush Social Security \n     Commission's privatization proposals include drastic cuts in \n     guaranteed Social Security benefits,'' said Sen. Jon Corzine, \n     New Jersey Democrat, who has been leading the attacks in the \n     Senate.\n       Until yesterday, the White House had not directly struck \n     back at its critics, and Mrs. Barnhart's surprisingly strong \n     remarks signaled that the administration now believes it \n     should respond to the Democrats' mounting political \n     offensive.\n       Mrs. Barnhart declined to compare the Social Security \n     benefits with what workers would get under Mr. Bush's plan to \n     let workers voluntarily invest part of their payroll taxes in \n     stock and bond mutual funds.\n       ``These are highly technical issues that our actuarial \n     analysts can answer,'' she said.\n       But when asked about questions of financial risk and safety \n     that Democrats are raising about Mr. Bush's investment plan, \n     she revealed that her own federal pension was fully invested \n     in stocks.\n       ``I'm a federal employee. I participate in the Thrift \n     Savings Plan. I went into the stock fund,'' she said. The \n     government's popular Thrift Savings Plan lets federal \n     employees invest their retirement funds in stock and bond \n     funds.\n       Such stock funds are ``widely diversified to lower risks'' \n     and government bond funds posed no risk, she said. The \n     president's commission on Social Security, which proposed \n     three different plans to implement Mr. Bush's reforms, \n     examined the Thrift Savings Plan as a possible model to \n     follow.\n       Mrs. Barnhart said that she thinks that ``we can look at \n     the Thrift Savings Plan'' as the basis for a larger \n     retirement for the general public.\n       ``I don't think there is any question that people, \n     particularly younger people, would have more control over \n     their investments in the future,'' she said of the \n     administration's proposed reforms.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Jo Anne Barnhart,\n     Commissioner, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, MD.\n       Dear Commissioner Barnhart: I am writing with respect to \n     statements attributed to you in an article published in the \n     Washington Times on June 8 on the topic of Social Security.\n       According to the article, you ``criticized Democrats for \n     using false charges and `incendiary rhetoric' to stir up \n     political fears over President Bush's plan to reform the \n     retirement system.'' The article quoted you as saying. ``The \n     most important message that I want to send out is that \n     benefits are not going to be affected.''\n       I am very concerned about this last statement, which is \n     simply not accurate. President Bush's Social Security \n     Commission proposed privatization plans that call for deep \n     cuts in guaranteed benefits. The Social Security \n     Administration's own actuaries have calculated that the cut \n     for many current workers would exceed 25 percent, and cuts \n     would exceed 45 percent in the future (see page 75 of the \n     actuaries memo on the report, dated January 31, 2002). These \n     cuts would apply even to those who choose not to invest in \n     privatized accounts. The cuts would be even deeper for those \n     who do make such investments.\n       I recognzie that, after stating simply that ``benefits are \n     not going to be affected'' you seemed to back off and provide \n     assurances only to retirees and near-retirees. However, the \n     Commission's plan relies on significant infusions of general \n     revenues none of which have been provided for in the \n     President's budget. If and when these revenues fail to \n     materialize, retiree benefits clearly could be at risk. \n     While, in the short-term, I hope that Congress somehow would \n     find the resources to protect current retirees, over time the \n     threat of further benefit cuts for retirees seems very real. \n     In addition, based on the text of the Commission's report \n     describing Model 1, it appears that some near-retirees would \n     have their guaranteed benefits reduced if they participate in \n     the program of privatized accounts.\n       I understand that reasonable people can disagree about the \n     merits of privatization and believe it is importannt that the \n     debate on Social Security's future be conducted without \n     excessive rhetoric on either side. I have tried not to engage \n     in attack language in the discussion so far, and I am hopeful \n     that other parties will adopt a similar approach. The future \n     of Social Security is too important to be decided by \n     misleading claims or partisan politics.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jon Corzine.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. I hope we continue this dialog in a thoughtful, balanced \nmatter.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I believe we are in morning business, is \nthat not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5395-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5395-S5396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this morning I want to speak to a couple of \nissues that I think are important to this body and certainly to the \ncitizens of our country. First and foremost, I want to speak of a \nmeeting that occurred at the White House yesterday that I had the good \nfortune to be a part of, a meeting of the President and the joint \nleadership, Democrat and Republican, of the House and Senate. We met \nwith President Bush, the Vice President, and Governor Ridge to talk \nabout the President's decision to create a new Cabinet-level Department \nof Homeland Security and his decision to send to the Congress a \nproposal that would allow us to work with him in the shaping of \nlegislation to ultimately create that agency.\n  I saw the current Presiding Officer on television the other night \nspeaking to this issue. I was pleased that he, too, like I, agree that \na time has come in our country that we need to recognize the \nextraordinary global terrorism threat that has been brought to our \ndoorstep and to the doorstep of most American citizens, and the need to \nrecognize that the mechanisms of our Government to combat this threat \nhave in part failed--or certainly the mechanisms are not in tune with \nthe current threat in a way that they can effectively connect all of \nthe dots to draw the necessary conclusions of the magnitude of the \nthreat by those who bring it to our doorstep.\n  As a result of that, the President, in a very forward-looking way, \nhaving assumed the leadership of this great country, has brought to us \nan opportunity to work with him to make a decision that I think will be \nhistoric for our country, a decision to create a new department that I \nbelieve, when completed and effectively run, will make all Americans \nsafer. It will give our country, through this department, the ability \nto protect our borders, to collate and analyze intelligence and \ninformation about ongoing threats, to expedite decisions at all \ngovernment levels, and to take immediate action when the conclusion of \nthe event or the risk that might occur warrants it.\n  The new department eliminates what has become a patchwork of agencies \nand lines of authority that were designed for a threat of an era ago. \nWhat worked in cold war and post-cold-war environments does not fit, or \nis apparently not fitting the current threat that this Nation \nrecognizes.\n  This department, in my opinion, is not a step toward big government. \nBig government is when the Federal authorities needlessly take over \nfunctions better left to State and local governments.\n  The Presiding Officer is a former Governor. He understands so well \nthe importance of State government and State law enforcement \nauthorities. What we want to have happen is an improvement of those \nrelationships as they relate to the threat.\n  My Governor, Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho, was once a U.S. Senator. As a \nSenator, he had greater clearance than he now has as a Governor. In \nother words, he had a right to know, under the law and by his title, \nmore about the security risk in our country than he does as a Governor \ntoday. That is wrong. Governors in the role they must play as law \nenforcement officers within their States and directors of law \nenforcement communities within their States have to know. I use as an \nexample the opportunity to create a seamless relationship between \nFederal intelligence and Federal law enforcement and State law \nenforcement. In my\n\n[[Page S5396]]\n\nopinion, this is not the creation of a bigger government. This is \ncalled getting smart and getting it right at a time when our country \ndemands it.\n\n  This proposal, however, which I think the President offers is the \ndirect opposite of what some might call big government. Our Founding \nFathers said it clearly when they stated within the Constitution the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government to provide for the security of \nthe citizens of this country. That was the foremost charge of a Federal \nGovernment's responsibility under the Constitution.\n  I think our President has recognized that oh so well ever since 9-11 \nand now brings to us an opportunity and a challenge to create this new \ndepartment that, in my opinion, will not bloat government. Personnel \nand offices will remain relatively at current levels. In fact, due to \nconsolidation, it is possible we might even see over time a slight \nreduction. The challenge is now ourselves. The challenge is to set \naside that which is mine or that which is yours--it is called turf here \non Capitol Hill--and to recognize that this is a time to act and to act \npromptly.\n  I was extremely pleased to see the bipartisan character and feeling \nof the meeting at the White House yesterday with Tom Daschle, Trent \nLott, Dick Gephardt, and Denny Hastert--all of these leaders talking in \na bipartisan mode about a timeline of importance. I think we all \nrecognize that Leader Gephardt said: Why not 9-11-02? Why not on the \nanniversary of this tragic time in America when we began to rethink and \nrealign our efforts that we should make available to the American \npeople a new department, a new government, a new shaping of government. \nWell, I hope we can do 9-11-02. But if we are to do it, it means we \nhave to burn the midnight oil a bit. It clearly means we have to roll \nup our sleeves and go to work. And it also means that the Senate and \nthe House operate differently than they are historically at least \nexpected to operate. We have done it in the past, and we can do it \nagain. And we should do it now.\n  I hope Leader Daschle and Leader Lott, in recognizing this, can bring \nthe Senate together in a way unprecedented at least in modern times to \nget the job done--to get it done in a quick but thorough fashion, to do \nthe necessary and proper reviews that bring about for this country a \nnew shaping of government that we hope in the end will make us a safer, \nmore secure place, and in that process not infringe upon or in any way \nlessen the rights and the freedoms of the citizens of this great \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5396-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5396-S5397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I want to speak about a need of this Senate \nto act and act soon. I am speaking about a provision within the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act of 1982 that required a procedure by which this \ncountry would ultimately step forward in determining a permanent \nstorage site for high-level nuclear waste. It is known here as Yucca \nMountain in the State of Nevada. It has been a high-profile issue, one \nthat has been given a great deal of debate over the last good number of \nyears, but one that has come again to the floor of the Senate in which \nwe must make a decision to make one step forward in a review and \nlicensing process to determine whether the site of Yucca Mountain in \nthe State of Nevada is capable of handling and effectively storing for \n10,000 years the high-level nuclear waste of this country.\n  In the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, we established what is known \nas an expedited procedure for consideration of the resolution approving \nthe President's selection of the nuclear waste site. Now the President \nhas selected, because the NEPA process through the Department of Energy \nhas determined that it is now time to go to the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission for their review and their determination as to whether the \nsite ought to be licensed. So the time is at hand, as was seen in 1982 \nunder this act.\n  The expedited procedure under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as \namended, specifically provides that once an approval resolution is on \nthe calendar--and that means the authorizing committee has acted and \nsent it forward, as it has--the law says very specifically that any \nSenator may move to proceed to its consideration. And the motion to \nproceed is privileged and nondebatable.\n  Under current practices, measures normally reach this floor through \nagreement to a unanimous consent request by the majority leader. It is \ncritically important for the operation and the procedure of this Senate \non a daily basis that the majority leader of the Senate set the agenda. \nBut there is always the provision, because we are all equal in the \nSenate under the Constitution, that sometimes the majority leader may \nnot set the agenda the way the majority of the Senate would want it \nset. And, of course, that can be objected to and a vote to proceed.\n  But what we are talking about here is recognition of a special \nprocedure--unprecedented, or at least certainly one that does not \nestablish the precedent of the normal decorum of the Senate. If \nunanimous consent cannot be obtained, as we know now, the Senate has \ntaken care of that procedure by simply allowing the rule or the \ndecision to be tested.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act provides special statutory authority to \nmake exceptions to the contemporary practice to which I have just \nspoken.\n  Let me say that again. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act provides a \nspecial statutory authority to make exception to contemporary practice. \nIn other words, it is not to establish a precedent. It is not to \noverride the majority leader, as some would like to have it thought \ntoday and are certainly arguing. It is in fact the law of the country \nand not the rules of the Senate to which we are speaking. It is one of \nfour statutes adopted since the 100th Congress that expressly allow any \nSenator to offer a motion to proceed to an item of approval or \ndisapproval. Those statutes are not redundant to Senate rules and do \nnot upset contemporary practice regarding motions to proceed to other \nlegislation on the Senate calendar.\n  Exercising a Senator's right under the statutory authority in the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act should be considered extraordinary, and not a \ngeneral assault on the normal prerogatives of the majority leader.\n  When the Senate passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, it envisioned a \ncircumstance in which a leader might be unwilling to propound a motion \nto proceed. It appears that may be what is happening on the floor of \nthe Senate. Thus, the law expressly permits someone else to act so \nCongress can work its will before a statutory deadline passes.\n  Finally, let me say this: If a leader will not propound a motion to \nproceed, he cannot contend his leadership prerogatives will be violated \nif someone else moves the procedure. You can't contend that you have \nbeen violated if in fact that is the law of the land. And that is the \nlaw of the land.\n  The very procedure I have outlined is expressly stated in the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act. Agreement with such a position gives the leader \nabsolute and unilateral authority to veto power over consideration of \nany legislation, if in fact that can be argued. But at times, when \nTrent Lott was majority leader of the Senate, that was challenged, and \na majority of the Senate stayed with the leader when it dealt with \ncontemporary legislation of the moment and the setting of the calendar \noutside the statutes of the Federal Government within the rules of the \nSenate.\n  I wanted to speak about that briefly this morning because I know that \nis now being talked about amongst us Senators as we ultimately come to \na time, prior to late July, when we must address this issue for the \nsake of the country, for the sake of ratepayers, certainly for the sake \nof the future of the energy sources of our country, and especially for \nnuclear-generated energy.\n  It is important to understand, and I will be to the Chamber speaking \nout about this issue more as we develop it. I would hope that the \nmajority leader or the authorizing committee chairman who brought the \nresolution forward would act as they should under the rules to \nestablish a time and a date certain when this Senate can debate and act \nresponsibly on this most critical national environmental issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Idaho for\n\n[[Page S5397]]\n\nmaking this last point. He is absolutely right. Under the law that we \npassed, we have to consider what we are going to do with nuclear waste \nbefore the middle of July. And there is only one procedure under which \nit can be done. If the majority leader does not bring it up, then the \nstatute provides anybody else can. That is what will happen.\n  The Senator from Idaho is exactly correct. I compliment him on his \nleadership on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5397-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5397-S5398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PERMANENT REPEAL OF THE DEATH TAX\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about the issue \nthat will be before us as soon as we resume business, and that is the \npermanent repeal of the death tax. This Senate has already repealed the \ndeath tax. The President has already signed it into law. But most \nAmericans are now realizing there was a catch.\n  Under the special procedures that the Senate operates, that bill came \nbefore the Senate with a 10-year sunset. So all we could do was pass a \nlaw that was in effect for 10 years and in the 11th year, we are right \nback to where we were in the year 2001, meaning that while we repealed \nthe death tax, it is back in the year 2010. That is not something we \nintended when we voted to repeal it.\n  I don't think anybody could argue that they intended only that it be \nrepealed for 1 year. That is extraordinarily bad tax policy and a cruel \nhoax on the American people, who thought we were repealing it \npermanently. Obviously, we need to repeal it permanently, and that is \nwhat the Gramm-Kyl amendment will do.\n\n  I want to speak this morning about why this is so important, to bring \nit down to simple, personal terms.\n  In the Mansfield Room, just a few feet from the Senate Chamber in \nwhich we are right now, Mr. President, there is a small businessman, \nthe owner of a lumber company. Actually, his dad owns the lumber \ncompany. He is helping to run it now. His name is Brad Eiffert, from \nColumbia, MO. And it is the Boone County Lumber Company.\n  His problem is this. When his father dies, the U.S. Government says: \nWe want half of the value of everything you own with this lumber \ncompany. Let's explore what that means. They have been paying income \ntax on their corporate income. They have been paying individual income \ntax on the salary they take out of the company. They pay the payroll \ntax. They pay the Social Security tax. They generate a lot of taxes for \nBoone County and for the State of Missouri. And they have created 30 \njobs.\n  This has been a successful, now second-generation company. The \nchildren of the father who owns the company now pay $58,000 a year in \ninsurance premiums so that when their father dies, they will be able to \ninherit the business and have the money to run the business. Think of \nan insurance premium of $58,000 a year.\n  What does the Government do right now? The policy before we repealed \nthe death tax was, the day he dies, his estate--that is to say, the \npeople who would inherit the money the father owns and would inherit \nthe business--has to pay half of that to Uncle Sam--half, 50 percent.\n  There is an exemption of a few hundred thousand dollars. I don't know \nhow much this lumber company is worth, but let's say it is worth $5 \nmillion, just to pick a figure. I could be way off. About $4.5 million \nis now subject to the estate tax when the father dies.\n  So how do people pay the estate tax? This is the perversity of this \ntax. This lumber company has an inventory of lumber. They buy lumber \nfrom different companies that chop down trees and make it for them. So \nthey have a bunch of warehouses full of lumber. And they have trucks \nthat deliver the lumber. They have forklifts that enable them to move \nthat lumber around. They have a little office. They have some other \nthings; I am sure they sell hammers and nails and things such as that.\n  When this business is valued at, let's say, $5 million, they don't \nhave a drawer that says: If you need $2.5 million to pay Uncle Sam, \nhere is $2.5 million. No business has that. What they have is a value \nin the inventory, the lumber, the trucks, the forklifts, the \nwarehouses, and so on. That is what is worth $5 million.\n  So, in effect, Uncle Sam wants to come in and say: We want half of \nthat value. If you have 10 forklifts, we want 5 of them. If you have 10 \nlumber trucks, we want 5 of them. We want half of the inventory. In \neffect, just put it on a railroad car and send it to Washington. We \nwant half of your warehouses.\n  There isn't money to pay Uncle Sam. We are talking about the value of \nthe business. Remember, they have paid their income taxes. We are now \ntalking about the value of the estate. It is called an estate tax.\n  What is the estate? The estate is the Boone County Lumber Company, \nwith its forklifts and trucks and lumber. If that is worth $5 million, \nUncle Sam says: I want half of it. How do you keep the business going \nby sending Uncle Sam half of the forklifts and half the trucks and half \nthe lumber? That is obviously not what happens. You have to sell it to \ngenerate cash to write a check to Uncle Sam. You cannot just sell half \nyour business. You end up selling the whole business.\n  Somebody said maybe they could get a loan to pay the taxes. Wrong. \nAnybody who knows anything about small business knows two things: One, \nyou have financed the purchase of your equipment. You have financed the \npurchase of the land. Who buys a house for cash? You go get a home \nmortgage loan.\n  Well, businesses are the same. They don't pay cash for the land and \nthe buildings; they get a loan from the bank so they can buy the \nproperty. They get a loan from the bank to buy their trucks, just as \nyou buy a car on time, and you pay a Ford or GMC creditor or whoever it \nmight be. The same with lumber, you get a bank loan to buy the lumber. \nThen you sell it and pay back the bank.\n  So these small businesses are highly leveraged in the sense they have \nalready gotten all the credit they could get out of the bank. They \ncan't go to the bank and borrow $2.5 million to pay the estate tax.\n  There is another reason, too, and that is there is an exemption. \nToday you get a $1 million exemption--and some people are proposing the \nexemption be more than that--but you can't qualify for the exemption.\n  The National Federation of Independent Businesses, which knows a lot \nabout this because it represents a lot of these businesses, has \ntestified, as have other experts, before the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, which considered this, that the provision under which you \ncan theoretically get an exemption is way too complicated and does not \nwork.\n  The ABA, as a matter of fact--the American Bar Association--has \nadvised its lawyers of being very careful of trying to help anybody to \nqualify for this exemption because they likely will be committing \nmalpractice. So it does not work either.\n  So the bottom line is, hundreds of thousands of small businesses \naround this country face what Brad Eiffert faces. When his dad dies and \nUncle Sam says pay us half of the value of everything in this business, \nhe does not have the cash. He is not going to be able to borrow the \ncash. He has one choice: Sell the Boone County Lumber Company.\n  I will give you another company. The idea of the death tax was to \nprevent the accumulation of wealth. I had a good friend in Arizona. His \nname was Jerry Witsosky. He died. He created a printing company, \nImperial Lithograph. He started with one employee, himself. He \ngradually built it up. He had about 150 employees, somewhere in that \nneighborhood when he died. It was a very successful business in \nPhoenix.\n  He contributed more money to charities in Phoenix than anybody I have \never known--a wonderful man. He died. His family could not pay half the \nvalue of that printing company to Uncle Sam, and they eventually had to \nsell the business.\n  Who did they sell it to? They sold it to a great big corporation. So \nmuch for preventing the accumulation of wealth. Here you had a family \nbusiness, a going concern, a wonderful contributor to the community, \nand it had to be sold to a big corporation just to generate the cash to \npay the estate tax.\n  Is this right? No. It is bad tax policy. It is unfair. It destroys \nall of the incentive. We talk about the American\n\n[[Page S5398]]\n\ndream: save, invest, and hope that your kids can have a better \nopportunity than you had. That is the American dream. And the estate \ntax, or the death tax, just cuts that right to the quick and says: We \nwant half of everything you earned during your lifetime. And, by the \nway, if you have to sell your business to pay us the money, that is \ntough. We want to spend it back in Washington.\n  This is a perverse tax policy. The good thing about the version of \nthe repeal that Senator Gramm and I have proposed is that it does not \nlet anybody off the hook in terms of paying taxes to Uncle Sam. They \nalready paid the taxes on the income. What we say is when Brad Eiffert \ninherits his father's business, the Boone County Lumber Company, he \ndoes not pay a tax when his dad dies--that is perverse--but if he ever \nsells the Boone County Lumber Company, then he pays a capital gains \ntax, and he pays it based on what his dad paid for the original \ncompany.\n  So Uncle Sam is going to get the full take. We will get all the money \nwe need here to spend in Washington, but it is when he decides to sell \nthe business; that is the taxable event. Death should not be a taxable \nevent.\n  So I hope my colleagues will join Senator Gramm and me later today \nwhen we have an opportunity to finally repeal this perverse tax and \nreplace it with a capital gains tax. We are not letting anybody off the \nhook. We are substituting one tax for the other, but we are \nsubstituting a tax that is fair because it says if you make a decision, \nknowing the tax consequences, to sell the asset, you pay Uncle Sam. If \nyou don't, you don't. But that is your decision. It replaces a tax on \nthe event of death which is more perverse and unfair.\n  The U.S. Government should not have that as a policy for the people \nof the United States of America. I urge my colleagues to reject the \nalternatives. There is only one real repeal, and that is the Gramm-Kyl \nrepeal of the death tax.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, let me remind my colleagues where we are \nand what we are doing. Last year, we adopted a repeal of the death tax. \nUnder that repeal, we phased up the exemption. We will soon start \nphasing down the rates, and in 2010 we will actually repeal the death \ntax. But because of a quirk in the rules of the Senate and the budget \nprocess, this death tax snaps back into full force in 2011.\n  Members of the Senate voted to repeal the death tax. They proclaimed \nthey were repealing the death tax. We are here today to really finish \nthat work by simply taking the provisions of law that are in place and \nin 2010--a\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n\nyear when according to the Congressional Budget Office March estimate \nwe will have a surplus of over $300 billion--we would eliminate the \ndeath tax forever rather than having the death tax come back from the \ngrave to prey on working families. That is the provision we are here to \ndebate.\n  We have had offered an amendment which is really not about protecting \nfamily farmers. It is not about protecting small businesses. It is \nabout protecting politicians. It is an amendment that makes a nominal \nchange in existing law that still allows the death tax to continue but \nit claims to give an unlimited exemption to small businesses and to \nsmall farmers under a section of law called section 2057. This is a \nprovision that was proposed last year by the opponents of the death tax \nrepeal as an alternative when we voted on repealing the death tax. It \nis in law today but at a lower level of protection.\n  The point I want to make is, section 2057--which this amendment \nclaims would be expanded to shelter more value in small business and \nfamily farms--and all the other special exemptions put together have \nbeen used by only 33 taxpayers in the time they have been in effect. In \nother words, these provisions that supposedly shelter and give small \nbusiness and family farms special protection are so convoluted, so \nburdensome, so inefficient that only 33 taxpayers in the years since \nthese provisions have been in effect have found it possible to use this \nsection 2057 to gain the promised relief.\n  So the reality is, if this amendment were adopted, it would provide \nassistance to 33 known taxpayers but it would provide a figleaf to 40 \nSenators by allowing them to vote against the repeal of the death tax \nonce and for all.\n  My colleague and cosponsor on this bill is a distinguished attorney, \nand I want to give him an opportunity to talk about this provision in \nsome detail, but let me basically sum up the arguments we have heard \nthus far and that we are certainly going to hear today.\n  The first argument we are going to hear is that repealing the death \ntax is going to cost money, is going to drive up the deficit, and is \ngoing to increase debt. I remind my colleagues that under the latest \nestimates we have, the death tax collects less than 1 percent of the \nrevenues that we collect in the Federal Government.\n  Yesterday, I made reference to two studies, one by our own Joint \nEconomic Committee titled ``The Economics of the Estate Tax,'' and the \nother by the Institute for Policy Innovation titled ``The Case For \nBurying the Estate Tax.'' Both of these studies make a very strong case \nthat by forcing small business and family farmers who are trying to \nprotect their families from the death tax to pay these big insurance \npolicies, to hire all these lawyers, to hire all these accountants, and \nby forcing people to sell off businesses and farms prematurely to try \nto plan for this tax, we have lowered the efficiency of the economy. \nThe study by our Joint Economic Committee concludes that the level of \ncapital in America is $50 billion lower than it would be without the \ndeath tax. The study by the Institute for Policy Innovation concludes \nthat by disrupting economic activity and lowering efficiency, this tax \nactually collects no net new revenue.\n\n  Our colleagues say, and we are going to hear it throughout the day in \nthe debate, that, well, we would make it permanent but we cannot afford \nit; we cannot afford to make it permanent.\n  I remind my colleagues that the amendment I will offer, which is the \npermanent repeal amendment that passed the House, does not go into \neffect until 2010. As I noted earlier, in 2010 we are projected to have \na surplus of some $300 billion. What those who oppose permanent repeal \nof the death tax are really saying is they want to spend that money.\n  There is an interesting paradox here. Despite all the talk we had \nyesterday and will likely hear again today that we simply cannot afford \nto make the repeal of the death tax permanent and we have to force \nfamilies to sell off the family business and sell off the family farm \nand give government 55 cents out of every dollar people have \naccumulated in their working lifetime in aftertax dollars, that we have \nto do that because we need the money, I find it interesting that in \nfive different instances over the last 9 months where this Senate has \nvoted to spend more money than we would lose in revenues next year if \nwe made the repeal of the death tax permanent. We spent $14 billion on \nnonemergency items in the emergency supplemental appropriation that the \nPresident did not ask for and that over the next 2 years is some four \ntimes as much as repealing the death tax would save families if they \ngot to keep the money.\n  The farm bill next year costs seven times as much as letting people \nkeep the family farm or keep their small business.\n  The energy bill was more expensive than the cost of letting people \nkeep their family farms.\n  The trade bill added new entitlements that cost more over the next 3 \nyears than letting people keep what they have accumulated over a \nlifetime.\n  Railroad retirement costs 15 times as much next year.\n  The stimulus package that was adopted, the parts that were not asked \nfor by the President, cost more than making the repeal of the death tax \npermanent next year.\n  Finally, the budget reported on a straight party line vote out of the \nBudget Committee adds new spending--not requested by the President, not \ndefense related, not related to our security needs in fighting \nterrorism--of $105.8 billion.\n  In short, on five different occasions in the last 9 months we have \nvoted on the floor of the Senate or in the Budget Committee to add new \nspending that, when it is added up, is some 15 times more expensive \nthan repealing the death tax permanently, and yet our colleagues who \nvoted for each and every one of these increases in spending now say, \nwell, we could afford to spend all of this money but we cannot afford \nto stop forcing families to sell off their farms and their businesses \nand the accumulated value of the life work of their parents.\n  That represents misplaced priorities. We have colleagues who could \nname 100 taxes that ought to be increased, who could name 40 tax \nreductions that should be taken back, but they cannot name a single \nGovernment program that we could live without or we could reduce.\n  At its root, this issue boils down to one simple choice. We will hear \nmany arguments today, but it comes down to a simple choice. The people \nwho do not want to make the repeal of the death tax permanent believe \nit is worth forcing people, at the death of their parents, to sell off \ntheir life's work to give over half of it to the Government, even \nthough it is all aftertax income. They have already paid taxes on it \nonce.\n  The opponents of making the death tax repeal permanent believe it is \nworth forcing businesses to liquidate farms, to shut down, equipment to \nbe sold, jobs to be destroyed, because they believe that having that \nmoney in Washington so they can spend it is worth it. Those who want to \nmake the death tax repeal permanent do not believe that. Those who want \nto make the repeal of the death tax permanent believe we would be \nbetter off as a nation--we would be richer, freer, happier, and the \nworld would be fairer--if, when families work and save and sacrifice \nand pay taxes on every dollar they earn in their lifetime and they \nbuild up a business, farm, or estate, that their death should not be a \ntaxable event.\n  We will hear a discussion today that says, OK, we are willing to do \nthis for some. We know it is bad for some people, but we want to pick \nand choose as to who has to pay this death tax. The position of those \nwho want to repeal the death tax permanently is a position that we \nbelieve the tax is immoral. We believe it is wrong. We think, whether \nsomebody's estate is worth $700,000, or whether they built a business \nthat has 200 employees and that has tools and capital and land and \ntrucks and equipment worth $10 million, we believe, if they built a \nbusiness worth $10 million, that destroying that business to bring $5.5 \nmillion of that to Washington so we can spend it does not represent a \ngood choice in public policy. After all, it is their money. They built \nit. They accumulated it. They sweated and saved and sacrificed for it.\n  That ultimately is the issue. We believe it is wrong to tax death. We \nbelieve it is wrong when people build up assets and build a business \nfor government to then destroy it.\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\n  I showed data yesterday indicating more than 70 percent of small \nbusinesses that are founded by a family member do not survive into the \nsecond generation; 87 percent do not survive into the third generation. \nAccording to the NFIB, the No. 1 reason is the death tax.\n  It is time to fix this provision of the Tax Code. We are going to \nhave an opportunity to do that. There will only be one real amendment. \nThere are two amendments that give political cover. There is one \namendment I will offer that is exactly the same language the House \npassed, and if we adopt it, it will go to the President and he will \nsign it into law. That is the issue. There is one real repeal, as my \ncolleague from Arizona says.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Just so we know where we are, I know there was time during \nthe quorum attributed to both sides. How much time remains on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-one minutes remain in opposition and \n56\\1/2\\ minutes remain for the proponents.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me make two quick points. The first has \nto do with the question of who pays the estate tax or the death tax. We \nknow it is not the person who died. We know it is the people who have \nthe estate and who are required, therefore, to, in many cases, actually \nsell a business in order to generate the cash to pay the tax.\n  Who are the estate tax filers and what occupations do they hold? I am \ngoing to quote from official Internal Revenue Service reports. In the \nlast analysis of the IRS of people's occupation and sex in filing \nestate tax returns, published in the Statistics of Income Bulletin, \nsummer of 1999, pages 72 to 76, the IRS reports:\n\n       For males, the largest group of filers at 27.7 percent were \n     administrators, upper management and business owners. The \n     second largest group at 12.3 percent were schoolteachers, \n     librarians, and guidance counselors. For females, the largest \n     group of estate tax filers at 14.1 percent were educators. \n     The next largest group at 9.6 percent were in clerical and \n     administrator support occupations.\n\n  A significant number of the total of estate tax filers were \nscientists, sales people, entertainers, airline pilots, military \nofficers, and mechanics. That is according to the IRS.\n  There is a vision of some fat cat sitting on a yacht someplace that \nwe are going to stick and get a lot of money from to run the Federal \nGovernment. We know the Federal Government's collections of estate \ntaxes are only 1 percent, slightly more than 1 percent of total revenue \ncollections. Who is that money coming from? The largest group of women \nwere educators. The next largest were clerical and administrator \nsupport people. They are airline pilots, scientists, salespeople, \nmilitary officers, mechanics. I can understand the category of \nentertainers. But, remember, those entertainers pay a lot of income \ntax, too. And the second largest group of males is schoolteachers, \nlibrarians, and guidance counselors.\n  Do we want to punish these people because they have been lucky enough \nto have been born into a family in which their father or mother was \nable to accumulate some kind of an estate? This is perverse tax policy.\n  As I said this morning, the primary problem is that the businesses \nthat have the value are not easily liquidated to generate the money to \npay the tax. It is not as if when someone dies there is a lot of money \nin a shoe box and Uncle Sam taps you, as the heir, on the shoulder and \nsays, I would like half of that, 50 percent. That is not what happens.\n  Ordinarily what happens is there is a business. We talked this \nmorning about the Boone County Lumber Company in Columbia, MO. They \nhave a lot of money tied up in lumber that they bought that they hope \nto sell--in trucks, in forklifts, in warehouses, and so on. That is \nequipment that enables 30 people to have a job. When the owner of that \nbusiness dies, his family is going to have to make a decision. They do \nnot have the money to pay half of the value of that business to Uncle \nSam. The salaries that people take out are $48,000, $60,000, some \napproaching $100,000, and in some cases more than that, but most are \nthe salaries of any other small business. And bear in mind, half the \nsmall businesses in this country are women owned. These salaries do not \ngenerate a whole lot of capital by which you can pay an estate tax. The \nonly way you can get the money to pay the estate tax is by selling the \nbusiness on which the estate tax is based. The estate tax doesn't say, \nHow much money did you have left over at the time of death? The estate \ntax says, What is the value of the company or the business or the farm \nthat you are running? The value of that business is based on the value \nof the equipment and the land, and so on, most of which are probably \ngoing to be financed and therefore probably already heavily leveraged. \nBut that value determines what has to be paid to Uncle Sam--half of it. \nThat is why the estate tax is particularly perverse, especially because \nyou have to do the liquidation right after the time of death.\n\n  There is an effort by our colleague from North Dakota, who has laid \ndown a second-degree amendment here--to ``improve on the existing law'' \nwould be the way I think he would characterize it. He does this by \nproviding that the exemption we provide in the law, that goes to $3.5 \nmillion, would go to $4 million, as I understand it; and for small \nbusinesses and farms it would become an unlimited exemption.\n  Certainly the sentiment behind that is laudable. The problem is it \nsimply will not work. How do we know that? Because we know it currently \ndoes not work. The law currently provides methods for small business \npeople and family farms to get an exemption from the estate tax. The \nexemption today is $1 million. It is going to go up in the future. The \nSenator from North Dakota would make it an unlimited exemption. But the \nproblem is even unlimited exemptions are worth exactly nothing if you \ncannot qualify. In other words, there is a door you have to get \nthrough. There is a gate you have to get through. You have to stay on \nthe other side of that or none of this matters, and that is the problem \nwith the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  In the business, people referred to it as QFOBI, and I am going to do \nthat for the purposes of brevity here, but it is technically the \nfamily-owned business exclusion. That is the provision of the existing \nlaw. There are actually two different sections under which people who \nhave a small business or farm and who want to be exempted for part of \nthe estate tax will try to qualify. But as I said, if you can't qualify \nunder this provision, it doesn't matter how big the exemption is, you \nare out of luck. The problem with this QFOBI is it is much too \ndifficult and too complex for most people to be able to qualify. I will \ngive you an idea.\n  For the calendar year 2000, 108,322 estate tax returns will be filed. \nOf course, only 1,470 made the QFOBI election; in other words, about 1 \npercent of the total.\n  By the way, that number is actually a little higher than in some \nprevious years. In 1999, for example, the total number of estate tax \nreturns for which the exemption was requested was 173. In 1998, that \nnumber was 889. My colleague from Texas pointed out that only 32 people \nhave ever qualified for a combination of both. But even take the larger \nnumber we have for the tax year 2000; that is 1,470, and that \nrepresents about 1 percent of the total of the estate tax returns \nfiled.\n  If the percentage of people filing estate tax returns is as low as \nour Democratic colleagues for the most part say it is--and although I \nwill contest it, let's assume for the moment they are right--it is \nmaybe about 2 percent of all taxpayers; and if of that 2 percent only 1 \npercent of them qualify for this small business or farm exemption, then \nthe amendment of the Senator from North Dakota helps a grand total of \ntwo one-hundredths of 1 percent of people filing tax returns--two one-\nhundredths of 1 percent. The fact is, it doesn't even help that many \npeople because QFOBI is recognized as very treacherous for somebody to \nget involved in.\n\n  A representative of the American Bar Association testified before the \nWays and Means Committee that the provision was simply too complicated \nto be effective. A professor of law at Temple noted that very few \npeople would try to meet the qualification because of its complexity. \nThe NFIB, which represents a lot of these people, testified\n\n[[Page S5401]]\n\nthat qualifying for the family-owned exclusion currently is difficult, \ncostly, and complex. Studies by numerous organizations and scholars \nroutinely find that family businesses spend exorbitant amounts of \nrevenue on lawyers, accountants, and financial planners in order to try \nto do this.\n  The reason I say even two one-hundredths of 1 percent is a high \nnumber is that the reality is, if you try to qualify for QFOBI, you are \ngoing to find yourself face to face with the friendly IRS.\n  The reason is the IRS will look at every one of these filings. They \nwill contest a significant number of them. As a matter of fact, in the \nyear 2000 there were 149 cases pending, which represents about 10 \npercent of the total number that were filed at that time--the total \nnumber of estate tax returns filed at that time. There are an equal \nnumber of cases in the administrative process. You first have to go \nthrough the administrative process, and then you will actually have \nyour case taken to court.\n  What happens when the IRS challenges these? The IRS wins. As of the \nlast time we have statistics, the IRS had won 67 percent of the cases.\n  So if you have the courage to try to qualify under this QFOBI \nelection, understand you are going to have the IRS question the value. \nIt is going to be an administrative appeal. At least 10 percent of the \ncases are going to be in court. And you are going to lose two-thirds of \nthe time.\n  That is why the group of lawyers that works on these kinds of things, \nthe section of the American Bar Association which handles estates and \ntaxes, has recommended to their lawyers that they not try to help \npeople qualify because it is too risky from a malpractice point of \nview. They have recommended that this particular section be repealed.\n  The bottom line is that it doesn't matter whether you have a $1 \nmillion exemption or a $3.5 million or a $4 million exemption or an \nunlimited exemption for small businesses or family farms; if you cannot \nqualify in the first instance, it does you no good. From what we can \nfind from IRS statistics, only two one-hundredths of 1 percent qualify. \nThat doesn't take into account the challenges by the IRS.\n  Let me just make one last point, and then I think there are others \nwho would like to speak.\n  I am not going to read to you the page after page of complex \nprovisions. It is a nightmare to read and understand. I am a lawyer. I \ndon't understand it. It takes a real expert to try to figure out how to \nmake this work and, as I said, the ABA itself has recommended to its \nmembers that they approach this with extreme caution.\n  One of the problems with the people who qualify is this. Let's assume \nyou are one of the lucky two one-hundredths of 1 percent who actually \nqualify and you have gotten through the IRS hurdles. What does this \nmean for you now that you have qualified? Are you home free? Not \nexactly. There is a 10-year period of time in which the IRS can--and I \nlove this term--``reach back'' and collect the tax from you.\n  There is a lot that can happen that could cause that to occur. If you \nhave trouble in your business, for example, and go bankrupt, that is \ntough; as far as the IRS is concerned, they can go back and collect the \nentire estate tax from you.\n  But here is what happens even if things go well. The IRS, if you \nqualify--believe me, this is the truth. It seems that it could not \npossibly be, but under the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota \nand the existing law, the IRS has a lien on your property, all of the \nestates that would be subject to the estate tax, for 10 years. And they \nhave a first position, which means: Good luck if you want to try to get \nfinancing for anything. Every small business finances its inventory, \nits machinery. We do not go out and buy a house and pay cash for it. We \nget a loan from the bank or from Fannie Mae, FHA or someone, and we \nfinance a home. That is the way small businesses finance their \noperations. But, good luck going to the bank when they know the IRS has \na first lien for a period of 10 years and the bank only has a second \nposition. That is a poor position to be in, and the bank will tell you \none of two things--either: Sorry, we can't lend you the money or: We \ncould lend you the money for 2 or 3 or more percent premium.\n  In other words, if you qualify for this provision, you are going to \nhave to pay a lot more money if you can get financing in order to \nfinance the continued operation of your business. Basically, it is a \nset up for failure. That is why most people do not even try to qualify \nfor it. Many of those who try cannot qualify for it. It is an \nextraordinarily complex and ineffective provision. Therefore, with all \ndue respect to my friend and colleague from North Dakota, his attempt \nto grant an unlimited exemption for small businesses and farms is \nfatally flawed. Very few, if any, of these small businesspeople or \nfarmers are going to be able to qualify. As a result, the amendment is, \nin fact, a nullity, and does nothing to help the very people who all of \nus would like to help.\n  I will relinquish the floor at this point and hope as the debate on \nthe amendment is concluded that I will have an opportunity to talk \nabout the comments that the Senator makes, and also to point out again \nthat the people who actually pay this tax are not the kind of people \nyou might envision but they are schoolteachers, airline pilots, \nmechanics, librarians, guidance counsellors, and the like, according to \nthe IRS itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, inform me of the time remaining on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota controls 56\\1/2\\ \nminutes and the time in opposition is 25 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my amendment is cosponsored by Senators \nDurbin, Carnahan, Corzine, and Stabenow.\n  Let me respond to some of the discussion we just heard. I have great \nrespect for my friend from Arizona. I have listened to him with great \ninterest in previous debates about repealing the estate tax. He \nbelieves passionately that we ought to get rid of the estate tax and \nmakes the case for it. But I was reminded when I heard his discussion \nof my amendment of Mark Twain who was asked once if he would be willing \nto engage in a debate. He said: Of course, I would--as long as I can \ntake the negative side. They said: We have not told you the subject of \nthe debate. He said: It doesn't matter. The negative side will take no \npreparation. It is easy. It is inherently easy to oppose things.\n  The way the opposition renders this amendment is almost indescribable \nto me. I am the one offering the amendment. But the interesting \ndiscussion that incorrectly describes this amendment needs some \ncorrection.\n  Let me begin by talking about why we are here and what this debate is \nabout. Then I will describe my amendment.\n  We are here because our country, a little more than a year ago, \ndecided on a new kind of fiscal policy. Those who seemed to think they \nknew saw surpluses for years and years ahead--surpluses as far as the \neye could see for the Federal budget. They said that because we have \nall of these surpluses that stack up in the future, let us cut taxes \nand let us do it right now. By the way, they said, let us cut the \nestate tax sequentially so in the year 2010 it will be completely \nrepealed.\n\n  It is true that the goofy kind of proposal finally offered and passed \ninto law takes the estate tax right up to the repeal in 2010, and then \nreinstates it in 2011. Historians will scratch their heads for some \nwhile when they evaluate what was done a year ago on estate tax.\n  Our colleagues who want to repeal the estate tax forever because they \nsaid we are going to have these large and continuing budget surpluses \nsay, although they wanted to reinstate it in 2011, they now want to \nmake that repeal permanent.\n  Of course, over a year later, things are different. We don't see \nsurpluses as far as the eye can see.\n  Yesterday, the Senate had to consider an increase in the debt limit. \nWhy? Because surpluses have turned to deficits. The country has an \neconomy that is in some trouble. We now have deficits for some years \ninto the future. Yet my friends on the other side of the aisle are \ncoming to the Senate saying: Oh, by the way. Our urgent priority is to \npermanently repeal the estate tax.\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\n  Let us evaluate what these priorities are about.\n  Do we have a priority, for example, to try to help people at the \nbottom of the economic ladder in this country--people who are working \nfor the minimum wage who haven't seen an increase for years and have \nseen the value of that minimum wage eroded? Do we have an obligation to \nthem? Is that a priority? No. It is not a priority for some. They do \nnot want that question on the floor of the Senate.\n  Do we have a priority to see if we can't do something about people \nwho do not have health insurance--over 40 million people who tonight \nmay find their child is sick, discover they do not have any money in \ntheir pocket or in their bank account to help take care of their child? \nDo we have a priority to deal with sick children and people who do not \nhave the capability of providing health insurance for their children? \nNo. That is not a priority for some.\n  How about schools? Are schools a priority?\n  I have spoken on the floor of the Senate many times about schools. I \ntoured a school populated largely by American Indians. But it is a \npublic school district. And a little girl in the third grade named \nRosie Two Bears looked up at me and said: Mr. Senator, will you be able \nto build us a new school?\n  Do you know why they needed a new school? Because there are 150 kids \nand two toilets and one water fountain. They were holding classes in a \nbasement room in a building that had been condemned long ago. Two or \nthree times a week they had to evacuate that classroom because sewer \ngas was backing up in the classroom. Rosie Two Bears wanted to know if \nher Senator could build her a new school. Incredibly, the answer is we \ndon't build new schools.\n  But the question is, Is education a priority for that young girl and \nothers around the country? Not for some--that is not on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  This isn't about helping people at the bottom of the economic ladder. \nThis is not helping to address the issue of health care costs, or lack \nof health care coverage, or lack of insurance for some American \nfamilies--nearly 40 million of them. This is not about improving \nAmerican schools. No. This issue is different than that. This issue is \nsaying, let us permanently repeal the estate tax.\n  How narrow is this? Let me describe the amendment I am offering and \nthat I offered last year which got 43 votes. Those who now speak loudly \nabout the need to repeal the estate tax voted against my amendment last \nyear.\n  My amendment said the following: It said, let us have a $4 million \nexemption per estate--$8 million for husband and wife. If you have \nfewer assets than $8 million, you pay no estate tax under any \ncircumstance.\n  My amendment also said, by the way, this issue that the other side \ncontinually says persuaded them to deal with the estate tax--that is, \nthe inability to pass a family farm or a small business from the \nparents to the kids--let us totally repeal the estate tax for the \npassage of a family farm or business. If it is family owned, the \nparents die, and the kids want to keep running it, I say don't \ninterrupt the transfer of that business. Let us not have the kids \ninherit a business and a crippling estate tax. Let us allow them to \ninherit the business exempt from the estate tax, if they want to keep \nrunning it.\n  This says no estate tax at all. Repeal it for the transfer of a \nbusiness from parents to children who want to keep running it.\n  It is very simple. We will do it in 2003. I offered that amendment \nlast year.\n  Those who come to the floor of the Senate and say they are persuaded \nto propose a permanent repeal of the estate tax because they care so \nmuch about family businesses and the transfer of family assets to the \nkids who want to run the business are the ones who voted against my \namendment. This amendment will provide that repeal next year. Their \nproposal would provide the repeal some 7 years later.\n  One wonders whether they care less about this issue and more about \nrepealing the estate tax for the wealthiest Americans. Or do they \nreally care about family businesses and family farms? If so, this is \nthe amendment to support.\n  Let me talk a little bit about privilege and those at the upper end \nof the economic ladder.\n  I think it is terrific that in this country people do well. In fact, \nwe have some innovative geniuses in this country who have done very \nwell. One-half of the world's billionaires live here, and good for \nthem.\n\n  But let me talk about the question of whether our priority at this \npoint--given the kind of Federal budget deficits we have and the kind \nof economic problems we have--ought to be to bring to the floor of the \nSenate a billionaire tax relief package. Because that is what this is. \nThis is all about, let's cut taxes for billionaires. And you can \ndescribe it however you want.\n  You can put all kinds of seasoning in it. You can stir it up, boil \nit; you can do whatever you want with it. Just strip it away, it is a \ntax cut for billionaires, when we have very big Federal deficits and \nwhen we have other priorities that some in this Chamber want to ignore.\n  Let me talk about some of these issues. Here shown on this chart are \npeople who are going to benefit from the proposal on the floor of the \nSenate to permanently repeal the estate tax. That is why I want to \namend it, so we don't repeal the estate tax for everybody.\n  The chief executive officers of our corporations in this country, in \n1980, made 42 times the amount of money that the average worker made. \nTwenty years later, they made 531 times the money the average worker \nmade. That is who is going to benefit from what the minority is \nproposing here today.\n  In 1981, the average compensation of the 10 highest paid CEOs in a \nU.S. corporation was $3.5 million. I come from a town of 300 people, a \nsmall high school class of nine. I happen to think $3.5 million is a \nlot of money. So is $3.5 million a year in compensation. That was 20 \nyears ago. Do you know what it is today for the 10 highest paid CEOs in \nthe country? It is $155 million a year.\n  That is who benefits from this tax cut. That is what this debate is \nall about. They say that these folks pay too much in taxes, so they \nwant an estate tax repeal even including the highest income earners in \nour country. And they will do that at the expense of all the other \npriorities that exist in this country.\n  I say, yes, let's repeal the estate tax for the passage of family-run \nbusinesses and farms. Let's provide an $8 million threshold for \nfamilies, below which you will pay no estate tax. But if you are \nfortunate enough to have tens and hundreds of millions and billions of \ndollars, I think it is important to understand a couple things.\n  One, most of that has never ever been taxed. Most of it comes from \nthe growth appreciation on assets and has never been subject to a tax. \nAnd, yes, I think your descendents ought to get a fair part of that. \nBut I also think this country ought to capture part of that and use it \nto invest in our kids, invest in education, invest in the solvency of \nSocial Security, invest in the solvency of Medicare, to strengthen this \ncountry. That is what I think ought to happen.\n  Let's talk about compensation just for a minute. I mentioned some of \nthe compensation that exists for individuals. I have a chart that shows \nthe 1-year compensation in the year 2000. These are the people, \nincidentally, who are the beneficiaries of this proposal. And I guess I \ndon't know of a time when I have heard people come to the floor of the \nSenate and say: I know we face a big budget deficit, I know our economy \nis in some trouble, I know we have other priorities--education, health \ncare, and other things--but our priority is to provide a tax cut for \nthe wealthiest Americans. These figures--$290 million, $225 million, \n$157 million--these are individual compensation numbers in the year \n2000 for people who ran America's corporations. These are the people \nwho will ultimately benefit from repealing the estate tax.\n\n  We have a lot of folks out there in this country who are working \nhard, trying to do the best job they can. Look, they are never going to \npay an estate tax. They are not going to have $8 million, as provided \nunder my amendment. But their proposal today is to say $8 million isn't \nenough of a threshold; we need to be able to exempt those who have $20 \nbillion, those who have $2 billion, those who have $500 million in \nassets, so none of those assets can ever be used to help America's\n\n[[Page S5403]]\n\nchildren, to invest in America's schools, to strengthen Social \nSecurity, to strengthen Medicare, and to do the other things we also \nknow are necessary.\n  So my amendment, as indicated, is very simple. It was described in a \ntortured way by my colleague from Arizona. He said: Well, you know, if \nyou try to exempt family businesses and family farms, you run into this \nweb of complexity. A web of complexity, he calls it. So the result is, \nwe have to exempt from the estate tax billionaires in order to solve \nthe issue of family farms and family businesses? I don't think so. I \nthink if you go into any store in the county, they call that a bait and \nswitch.\n  You come out to the floor of the Senate and say: Look, our mission is \nvery simple. Our mission is in support of family farms and small \nbusinesses. That is what we are trying to do, to get rid of the \ncrippling estate tax that exists on the transfer of a business or a \nfarm from the parents to the kids. I say, if that is your mission, then \nI am with you.\n  Let's repeal the estate tax for the transfer of that property. The \nkids want to run the business? It is fine with me. I don't think we \nought to shut the business down. I don't think we ought to load the \nbusiness with an estate tax debt. I think the parents ought to be able \nto move that business to the kids upon the death of the parents with no \nestate tax obligation at all. And that is what my amendment does.\n  No amount of arm waving in this Chamber can obscure the fact that we \nhave an exemption that is workable. It has only been in existence since \n1997, I might say. It was described as QFOBI, which is an acronym. We \nuse too many acronyms in this town. The fact is, if you have spent the \nlast couple of years of your career talking about protecting small \nbusinesses and family farms, and its passage to the kids, then don't \nvote against this amendment and say to folks back home: Oh, by the way, \nit was too complicated.\n  This amendment I offer does two things. It provides an $8 million \nunified credit threshold for a husband and wife, below which there is \nno estate tax. It is repealed for everybody below $8 million in assets, \nhusband and wife. And second, and most important to me, is that family \nbusinesses, regardless of size, if transferred to the kids--and if \nthose kids continue to run those family businesses--will be exempt from \nthe estate tax; and, no, not in 2010, but in 2003.\n  You see, the problem with the proposal offered by the other side, \nfirst of all, is they propose a complete repeal, but it just kind of \ndribbles along, as with most of their proposal; they just dribble it \nout over a period of time. If it is worthy to say, let's not interrupt \nthe transfer of a family business, so the kids can continue to operate \nit without an estate tax obligation--let's do it next year. If you \ndon't want to do it next year, then vote against our amendment, but \ndon't you go home and say you stood for family businesses and family \nfarms. Don't you dare do that, because voting against this amendment, \njust as many of you did last year--we got 43 votes in favor--voting \nagainst it is to say to folks back home: No, I want you to wait 7 or 8 \nyears for the relief that was offered permanently in this amendment for \nfamily businesses and family farms.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my friend from North Dakota yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator.\n  I rise to thank my colleague for this amendment. And I join him. I am \nvery proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment. I appreciate very much \nwhat he is doing.\n  It seems to me, as we have looked at this issue to find the right \nbalance, that this amendment is in fact the right balance. It says that \nwe will say to our family farmers and family-owned businesses--of whom \nwe have many in Michigan--that we want to make sure, after you have \nworked hard and your family has been able to develop a good business or \nfamily farm, that if you want to pass that along to your children, you \nwill be able to do that and that it not be jeopardized in any way. That \nmakes perfect sense to me. I support repeal for family-owned \nenterprises.\n  I think it also says that we are going to set a limit, we are going \nto set priorities for the country, so when we are talking about a \nbillionaire versus having the resources for seniors or families to be \nable to afford prescription drug coverage--which is also a tax, I would \nargue a significant tax, on our seniors and our families--or whether it \nis looking at the priority of educating our children, we are going to \nhave a balance, and those who are the top billionaires in this country \nought to contribute to national defense and the war on terrorism and \neducation and health care, and so on.\n  So I wonder. I would just ask my friend from North Dakota a question. \nIt is my understanding that our amendment would in fact exempt 99.5 \npercent of all of those who might pay the estate tax. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Michigan is correct. Well over 99.5 \npercent will no longer have to pay an estate tax. But even that is not \nenough for those who insist on complete repeal. Those who insist on \ncomplete repeal are saying--during a tough time, where we have Federal \nbudget deficits and other priorities that we can't fund--they are \nsaying: This is our priority. The top of the heap. Those at the very \ntop, the billionaires, the $100 million per year executives, that is \nour priority. We believe that our priority is to exempt those estates \nfrom an obligation.\n\n  The Senator from Michigan is right. Over 99.5 percent of estates will \nnot be subject to an estate tax.\n  When the Senator from Arizona was present, he said this issue called \nQFOBI, which is the method by which you value the assets of family-\nowned businesses, is totally unworkable. The Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities says that businesses can easily qualify for this \nspecial status as long as the family owns and operates the business and \nintends to continue to do so.\n  Let's say you have a $200 million family business, a big one. In my \njudgment, if it is family owned, it goes to the lineal descendants. If \nthey want to continue to operate it, no tax. We repeal the estate tax \nfor that transfer. If, however, there are not lineal descendants who \nwant to operate it--one lives in California and one in Florida, one in \nTexas--and they want to sell the assets, they have the same $8 million \nexemption that we would provide in this amendment.\n  The Senator from Michigan is correct. This affects very few estates. \nThey are only the largest estates, and that is what we are fighting \nabout.\n  We have people here saying: That is our priority, tax exemption, tax \nrelief for the highest income earners in our country at a time when we \nhave so many other priorities.\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I might again say to the Senator from North Dakota, \nI thank him on behalf of Michigan family farmers and small family-owned \nbusinesses, as well as large family-owned businesses, for putting \nforward what I believe is, in fact, just the right balance. We say to \nour family-owned enterprises, we want you, if you have worked hard all \nyour life, to be able to pass on that business, that farm to your \nfamily. We want to make sure you are not paying the inheritance tax. \nBut at the same time we say to middle-class families and seniors and \neverybody else in the country that we are going to make sure your \npriorities, those that affect the majority of Americans, will be funded \nbefore we, in fact, give a tax cut again to the top half a percent of \nthe public, the top billionaires of the country.\n  It is the right balance. It is the right set of priorities. I thank \nmy friend. I appreciate the opportunity to join with him in his \namendment.\n  How much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 35\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me take 5 minutes of it. Then I will yield to the \nSenator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, facts are persistent things. The good \nthing about fiction is you can always have it the way you want it. If \nyou make it up, it can always be good, if you are for it. It can always \nbe bad, if you are against it. But facts are persistent things.\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\n  In 1997, recognizing that we had confiscatory taxes on small \nbusinesses and family farms upon death but not being willing to repeal \nthe death tax, which our Democrat colleagues are not willing to do--the \nonly vote we are going to have today that would repeal the death tax or \nwould change the death tax, the only one that would go to the President \nto be signed today is the one I will offer--wanting to get credit for \nhelping without helping, we adopted a provision called 2057. That is \nthe closely held family business exemption.\n  Our colleague says: We will expand it so it will cover every small \nbusiness, every family farm.\n  It has been in effect for 5 years. How many farmers and ranchers do \nyou think have qualified for this protection in 5 years? In 5 years \nthat this provision of law has been in effect, only 33 farm and ranch \nfamilies have qualified.\n  This bill that is being offered as an alternative to the real repeal \nof the death tax is not about 33 families. It is about protecting 40 \nSenators by giving them a fig leaf when they vote against repeal of the \ndeath tax.\n  The plain truth is in 5 years of being in effect, this provision has \nafforded relief to 33 farmers and ranchers. And why? It is 17 pages of \nsingle-spaced requirements. It gives the government a lien against your \nproperty for 10 years. It sets up requirements like ownership of assets \nfor at least 8 years, when if you are growing chickens, they don't live \n8 years.\n  The bottom line is, this is absolutely unworkable and meaningless \nexcept for fewer taxpayers than we are going to have Senators vote \nagainst repeal of the death tax.\n  I go back and make my point: Our colleagues know this is an issue \nthat Americans care about. They desperately want to spend the money we \nare collecting by making people sell their farms, sell their businesses \nupon the death of the founder in order to give the government 55 cents \nout of every dollar they have accumulated in their lifetime. But rather \nthan repeal the tax so that this absolute tragedy and theft could stop, \nthis outrage could end, they are offering basically a proposal that has \nproven to be unworkable.\n  When it gets down to the bottom line, the question before us is a \nvery simple one: Do you think it is worth making people sell their \nbusiness, sell their farm, sell off the product of their life's work to \ngive government 55 cents out of every dollar they have accumulated, \neven though every dollar they have accumulated they have paid taxes on, \nso that Government can spend that money? Or do you think it would be \nbetter to let people keep the money and eliminate the situation where \ndeath is a taxable event? That is the question before us.\n  There is only one real repeal. I have been around the track before. I \nhave seen it. I know what is going to happen here. We are going to have \na bunch of people who are going to vote to sustain this point of order \nso that even though we have a majority who want to repeal the death \ntax, we won't be able to do it today. But they are going to vote for \nthese proposals where only 33 farmers and ranchers in 5 years have \nqualified, and they are not outside the 10-year window. They may not \nend up qualifying.\n  They are going to go back home and say: Look, I wasn't against \nrepealing the death tax. I just was against their repeal of the death \ntax.\n  There is only one real repeal, and that is the one that passed the \nHouse.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Gramm, and my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, for their \ntremendous effort in working on eliminating the death tax.\n  I rise in opposition to the Dorgan amendment and in support of the \nGramm amendment which is the provision that was passed out of the House \nof Representatives last week. Fundamentally, if we want to help farmers \nand ranchers, if we want to help small businesspeople, we need to kill \nthe death tax. It is a sham to put in qualifiers and provisions so that \nsuch a small number of small businesspeople can qualify instead of \neliminating the tax altogether.\n  What we need to do is to kill the death tax. This unfair tax has been \na concern of mine for some time. I have previously introduced my own \nlegislation to eliminate the death tax. I was pleased to support the \nrepeal of the death tax as part of last year's tax relief package. But \nthose cuts simply do not go far enough.\n  One of the tenets of a fair tax system is that income is taxed only \nonce. I know this argument has been made a number of times by my \ncolleagues. These small businesspeople, farmers and ranchers, families \nare subjected to a tax that is initiated at the time of tragedy in the \nfamily, an event when somebody passes away. This is money on which the \ntaxpayer has already paid taxes. Income should be taxed when it is \nfirst earned or realized. It should not be repeatedly taxed by the \ngovernment.\n  The death tax simply violates this tenet. The way I see it, it comes \ndown to one question: Should death be a taxable event? I emphatically \nbelieve the answer is no.\n  People who work hard and save throughout their lifetime should be \nable to expect that the products of their labor will go on to help \ntheir family, not go on to fund some politician's pet project.\n  This issue of the death tax really hits home for me. Family farms and \nsmall businesses are two of the groups most affected by the estate tax. \nI grew up on my family's ranch in Colorado, and I owned a small \nbusiness before I came to Washington. So I truly understand the \nconcerns of those who live in fear of the impact that this tax will \nhave on their legacy to their children.\n  The estate tax has resulted in the loss of family farms and family \nbusinesses across the Nation. Many people work their entire lives to \nbuild a business that they can pass on to their children. When these \nhard-working businessmen and farmers pass away, their families are \noften forced to sell off the business to pay the estate tax.\n  I see this as an affront to those who try to pass on the fruits of \ntheir life's work to their children. America was founded on \nentrepreneurship and hard work, and a high death tax serves to stifle \nboth.\n  The people affected by this tax are not necessarily wealthy. Many \nsmall businesspeople are cash poor but asset rich. For example, the \nowner of a small restaurant might have $800,000 of assets but not much \ncash on hand. Her children will still have to pay an excessive tax on \nthe assets.\n  The produce wholesaler, who has invested all of his revenue in trucks \nand storage, might have more than $700,000 in assets. That does not \nmake him a cash-wealthy man. Yet he is still subject to this so-called \n``tax on the wealthy.'' In too many situations the heirs must dismantle \nor sell a family business simply to pay the taxes. This isn't right.\n  The death tax also impacts employment and the economy. When a family-\nowned farm or a small business closes, the workers lose their jobs. \nConversely, leaving resources in the economy can create jobs. In fact, \nin a 1995 Gallup Poll, 60 percent of business owners reported that they \nwould add more jobs over the coming year if the death tax were \neliminated.\n  Additionally, the estate tax is a disincentive for Americans to save \ntheir earnings. The government has created a number of tax breaks and \nother incentives for those who save their money: 401(k)s and IRAs--to \nname a few. Yet the estate tax sends a contradictory message. \nBasically, it says, ``If you don't spend all your savings by the time \nyou die, the government will penalize you.'' This tax is no small \npenalty, either. We are talking about some very high tax rates.\n  The death tax also represents an unjust double taxation. The savings \nwere taxed initially when they were earned. Then, when the saver passes \naway, the government comes along and takes a second cut. There is no \ngood reason for the current system--other than the government's desire \nto make a profit.\n  The current death tax law has a greater effect on the lower end of \nthe scale than the higher. Wealthy people can afford lawyers and \nplanners to help them plan their estate. Those at the lower end of the \nestate tax scale are often unable to afford sophisticated estate \nplanning. So the current law also makes the tax somewhat regressive, \nwhich is not fair. This is particularly\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\ntrue given the uncertainty of the tax due to phase in and sunset dates.\n  Planning and compliance with the estate tax can consume substantial \nresources. The National Association of Manufacturers has reported that \nmore than 40 percent of its members have spent at least $100,000 on \ndeath tax planning. For three out of five members the annual compliance \ncosts are more than $25,000. This is money that could have been better \nspent to expand the business and create new jobs--rather than dealing \nwith the death tax.\n  The estate tax only raises 1 percent of Federal revenue, yet it costs \nfarms, businesses, and jobs. No American family should lose their farm \nor business because of the Federal government. I support full permanent \nrepeal of the Federal estate tax.\n  I urge my colleagues to end this unfair system and join me in \nsupporting permanent repeal of the death tax.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am happy to stand as a cosponsor of \nthe amendment by Senator Dorgan and Senator Carnahan of Missouri. \nPeople who are following this debate in our Chamber and by C-SPAN must \nwonder what we are doing today. We are talking about tax cuts, tax \nbreaks, tax relief.\n  Can you think of a more popular issue or subject for us to entertain \non the floor of the U.S. Senate? Forget for a moment that we are in \ndeficit, that we are taking billions of dollars out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund because of our last tax decision and events that \nhave intervened. Forget that for a moment and just concentrate on tax \nrelief for America.\n  If you would go out on the street corner in Springfield, IL, or in \nChicago, which I represent, or in Texas or in North Dakota, and say to \nthe first five people walking by: If Congress is going to consider tax \nrelief and tax cuts, what do you think they ought to concentrate on? I \nguarantee you not a single soul will come up to you and say: What they \nought to concentrate on are the multimillionaires who may pass away and \nowe some money to the Federal Government; that is the thing that keeps \nmy family up at night. We are worried about that possibility--that \nsomeone who is worth millions of dollars may end up paying some money \nto the Government.\n  No. Most people would say: I will tell you what bothers me, Senator. \nI cannot figure out how to pay for my kids' college education expenses. \nWhy don't you make that deductible? That would help my family and would \nhelp our country. That makes sense, doesn't it?\n  If you went into the store on the corner and said to the \nbusinessperson at the store: What do you think is a good tax relief \nmeasure for Congress to consider? They might say: I am not sure how you \ndo it, but can you help me pay for health insurance for my wife, \nmyself, and my employees? It is killing me, going up 25, 30 percent a \nyear. There is another interesting idea for tax relief.\n  Then you go to the other corner and stop by a senior citizen \ngathering and say: Do you have any ideas for something we can do by way \nof tax relief? They will probably say: Senator, can you do something \nabout the high cost of prescription drugs in this country? We cannot \nafford to fill the prescriptions the doctors give us.\n  There you have it--three proposals you are likely to find in any city \nor town in America to deal with real American family problems, such as \npaying for a college education, paying for health insurance, affording \nprescription drugs. You might ask yourself, of all the possibilities, \nwhy is Congress focusing instead on tax relief for the wealthiest \npeople in the country and ignoring the tax relief that the average \nperson in America would like to see us enact? The reason is because the \nspecial interest groups have been at work.\n  First, they hired the pollster who decided to stop calling it \n``estate'' tax and start calling it a ``death'' tax. People think that \nis terrible that you are going to tax someone for dying. Well, look at \nthe Senate floor here. Look at the other side. The poster says: \n``repeal the death tax.'' So they caught on. From now on it is no \nlonger the estate tax, it is the death tax.\n  And then they said you have to convince everybody in America that \nthis is a tax they have to worry about. Forget for a moment that it is \nonly a handful of people who ever pay the Federal estate tax. I went to \nO'Hare Airport a few months ago when we were in the middle of an \nearlier debate on this issue. This is a true story. The baggage handler \nfor United Airlines who took my bags at the sidewalk said to me: \nSenator, would you do something about this death tax? I almost said to \nhim: Sir, there is no way in your lifetime, even if you win the \nlottery, that you are likely to ever pay the Federal estate tax. What \nyou ought to think about is getting your kids through college, health \ninsurance, prescription drugs for your mom and dad. Those are the \nthings that will affect your life.\n  They have done very well here. They have convinced the average person \nin the street that the Government is standing by the funeral home \nwaiting to slap a lien on the car of the widow. It just is not true.\n  Let me tell you something else they are arguing. They are arguing \nthat this is a tax that is destroying farmers and small businesspeople, \nthat they are taking away a farm that has been in a family for \ngenerations because of the estate tax.\n  I wrote a letter to the Illinois Farm Bureau and the Farmers Union \nlast year and said: Can you give me one example of a farm in the State \nof Illinois--just one example--of a farm family who lost their farm \nbecause of the Federal estate tax? No; none, zero; not one example. \nSenator Dorgan and I came together with Senator Carnahan and said: \nLet's go after real estate tax reform that solves any problems we can \nenvision. I salute Senator Dorgan for his leadership because he said: \nWhy don't we just flat out exempt any farm, any business that is going \nto be transferred from one family member to the next? Let's just say \nthey will not pay any estate tax. That puts it into the argument that \nthis is confiscating businesses and farms.\n\n  The amendment is very simple. It is very straightforward. Guess what. \nIt takes effect next year. It is immediate. So all of those who vote \nagainst the Dorgan amendment are saying, postpone this and for 7 years, \nleave businesses and farms in the lurch, if there is one, when it comes \nto estate tax liability.\n  Senator Dorgan put together this amendment, which I cosponsored, \nwhich says farms and businesses which pass to lineal heirs--children--\nare not going to pay any estate tax. That is as clear as it can be, and \nit goes into effect immediately.\n  Then he says: Let us increase the exemption for other estates from \nwhat will be about $1 million to $4 million for individuals, $8 million \nfor married people. What would that cover?\n  Let's assume you bought a home that has dramatically appreciated in \nvalue. I have seen it in Illinois, Washington, California, you name it, \nand you have an estate that is left over that has a value of over $1 \nmillion. The Dorgan-Durbin-Carnahan amendment will exempt your estate \nfrom paying any Federal taxes, $4 million for an individual, $8 million \nfor a couple.\n  Yet the Republicans have said that is not nearly enough. Madam \nPresident, you know who they are protecting? It is not a farmer. It is \nnot a businessperson. It is not a person who has really done pretty \nwell in life. It is the superrich.\n  The Senator from Texas called the estate tax an absolute tragedy and \ntheft--theft. The Senator from Colorado then said: Why should death be \na taxable event? Let me ask a question: Why should work be a taxable \nevent? People who get up every morning and struggle in the workplace at \ntheir job pay income taxes. We pay taxes on sales, on income, and other \nitems in our society so we will have enough money to make sure the \nDepartment of Defense can defend America, so there are hospitals, \nhighways, and schools that add to the quality of life of our country.\n  I will tell my colleagues what we are going to do: If the Republicans \nhave their way and eliminate the estate tax for the superrich in \nAmerica, they are going to put a greater burden on taxing work in \nAmerica. They will push more\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\nof that burden right down to the working person, the average working \nfamily. That is not fair. It is totally unfair.\n  If this Senate is going to address real tax reform, we should at \nleast be fair in the way we address it and not make certain that the \nwealthiest people in this country are always the first to benefit from \ntax relief. This debate ignores the average person, the average family, \nand the average business and farm in America.\n  This debate is about protecting the superrich who have their voices \non the floor of the Senate and in the hallways right outside all lined \nup. They come here in their Gucci loafers and their fine tailored \nsuits, and they put in these amendments to protect the superrich.\n  Meanwhile, day in and day out, the average person, the average family \nin America works hard and worries about paying the bills. Why in the \nworld are we doing this?\n\n  To call this an absolute tragedy and theft is to ignore the fact that \neliminating the estate tax on the wealthiest people in America will \ncreate a theft on our Treasury, it will create a theft on the working \nfamilies of this country.\n  Do my colleagues want to know what the highest tax priority ought to \nbe in our country? The highest tax priority ought to be on working \nfamilies, and we are not doing that today. We are ignoring working \nfamilies. We are trying our best to preserve the very best for the \nwealthiest of our country.\n  I am happy to support this amendment. I also want to indicate, we \ntook a little survey since 1990 of all the times the estate tax issue \nhas come to the floor of the Senate. It goes on for hundreds and \nhundreds of occasions.\n  We have a chance today with the Dorgan amendment to do something that \nfinally puts this to rest. We do it in a sensible way. We do not raid \nthe Treasury and we do not say 10 years from now we are going to \njeopardize the Social Security trust funds so we can give a favor to \nthe wealthiest people in this country.\n  It is interesting, when this debate got underway, some of the \nwealthiest people said: Stop, I don't need your tax relief; I am doing \njust fine, thank you. That does not dissuade those on the Republican \nside of the aisle from pushing this idea and saying: If we are going to \ngive any kind of break in America, it should go to those well off.\n  I have been reading what has been going on in terms of corporate CEOs \nwho are waltzing away with millions of dollars from these corporations \neven when the corporations are failing. These are people worth tens of \nmillions, hundreds of millions of dollars, the very people the repeal \nof the estate tax is designed to protect. Do you have a lot of sympathy \nin your heart for some of these CEOs who have falsified their business \nrecords, who have been guilty of the worst corporate irresponsibility? \nMy sympathy goes with the working families, and my support goes for \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Texas. I say \nto my colleague from Illinois, if the wealthiest people say not to \nbother repealing the death tax, it is probably because it does not \nbother them. A lot of the wealthiest people do not really worry about \nthe death tax. If you have enough money, it does not matter what you \nwould pay. Most of them can spend hundreds of thousands and millions of \ndollars to avoid the death tax.\n  By and large, the people who are paying the death tax are not the \nvery wealthy. They are hard-working people, many of them educators, as \nmy colleague from Arizona has pointed out. But there are an awful lot \nof farmers and small businesses.\n  I have spent a good deal of my time in my service in the Senate \nlistening to farmers and owners of small businesses. In fact, that is \nwhere I get most of my ideas. That is where we got the idea to \nstrengthen the regulatory relief for small businesses and to provide \nthe assistance we give to farmers to open up markets abroad.\n  We have talked about regulatory relief, and we have provided a number \nof areas of tax relief, but one of the issues that is the top priority \nfor the farmers and the small businesses in my State is getting rid of \nthe death tax. These are not the wealthiest people. These are people \nwho fear that what they have worked hard to save, to put away, to leave \nto their children, is going to be taken away by the tax collector.\n  This morning we had a news conference. We were joined by Brad Eiffert \nof Columbia, MO. He owns Boone County Lumber Company. He and his \nbrother work in a business that their father started. They have a very \nsuccessful business with 30 employees. They have worked hard, and they \nhave a great deal of equipment used in their business.\n  They want to continue the business after their father passes on, but \nthey have found that, because of the investment in the equipment, they \nwill have to pay a tremendous estate tax. So now each year they take \nout of that business almost $60,000 for insurance premiums to pay the \ntax man. This is money that could be going to the employees, it could \nbe going to buy new equipment, or it could be going to build the \nbusiness in many ways. They really want to get rid of the death tax.\n  Farmers I have talked with have told me that they have spent over \n$100,000 in lawyers fees and accountants fees trying to figure out how \nto get around the tax. The lawyers get the money, the accountants get \nthe money, and they hope that the Federal Treasury will not get the \nmoney. They have to spend a lot of money, that they should be putting \nback in their farm, to figure out how to avoid this tax.\n  So what they avoid does not come to the Treasury, but there is a \nheavy planning cost on how to get away from paying the estate tax that \nis paid by small businesses and farmers.\n  Before us we have an amendment which says we are going to expand \nsection 2057 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Qualified Family-Owned \nBusiness Interest exclusion, QFOBI, I guess is what it is called. My \ncolleagues propose to make it bigger, better, longer, and stronger, but \nin 2000 only 1.3 percent of family-owned businesses applied for this \n2057 exemption.\n  There are people saying we are going to allow you to save small \nbusinesses and farms from the estate tax through this provision, but \nthe provision does not work. In short, a flat tire cannot be made to \nroll simply by making it bigger. This 2057 exclusion is too complicated \nto provide widespread relief to estates harmed by the death tax.\n  As my colleague from Arizona has pointed out, it is so complex that \nthe American Bar Association urges its tax lawyers not even to try it \nbecause it is so filled with traps and so many Catch-22s that they can \nget sued for malpractice if they try to use it.\n  In order to qualify, the business must constitute at least 50 percent \nof the estate's value. The decedent must have owned and been actively \ninvolved in the family business for at least 5 of the 8 years leading \nup to his or her death. Following the death of the owner, the heirs \nmust continue to participate in the business for at least 10 years.\n  But once the business is transferred, the estate tax deferred by \nreceiving this designation hangs over the business for at least 10 \nyears, and the IRS has a first position lien on the property. So the \nsmall business cannot borrow money without going to a loan with a \nsecondary position, if they can even get one. Moreover, such loans cost \nthem more.\n  If the business goes bankrupt and they cannot continue it, then the \nIRS goes back and gets the entire estate tax. One hundred percent could \nbecome due with interest. Not surprisingly, there are not many people \nwho are willing to play this kind of Russian roulette.\n  If this amendment were to become law, I can only imagine the \ninsurance premiums that would be required.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. We need to kill the estate tax and keep it dead and not let \nit spring back. That is what farmers and small businesses in my State \nwant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment \nalong with my good friends, Senators Durbin and Dorgan. Our amendment \nwill, as of January 2003, permanently exempt all small businesses and \nfamily-owned farms from the estate tax.\n  Let me repeat that because I do not want there to be any confusion. \nThe Dorgan-Durbin-Carnahan amendment will eliminate the estate tax \nburden on all small businesses and family-owned farms effective January \n2003.\n  The estate tax is having an impact that was never intended when it \nwas first enacted. Those in line to inherit family-owned businesses and \nfarms are having to sell them to pay the estate tax. That is not right. \nParents who work hard for their whole lives building up a business want \nto pass the fruits of their labor on to their children. The same is \ntrue of farmers. We want family farms to be passed through the \ngenerations. We want children to be able to farm the land farmed by \ntheir parents and possibly their grandparents before them.\n  The amendment that Senator Dorgan, Senator Durbin, and I are offering \ntoday would allow just that. It would ensure no family-owned business \nwould ever have to be sold to cover estate taxes. So perhaps one is \nasking: What is the difference between our amendment and Senator \nGramm's amendment? Well, there are big ones. First, Senator Gramm's \namendment does nothing for family-owned enterprises until 2011. Under \nthe Gramm amendment, they will have to continue to pay estate taxes for \nthe next 7 years.\n  Our amendment would end estate taxes on family-owned farms and \nbusinesses beginning next year. We have heard today concerns that the \nexclusion for family businesses is complex. I am more than willing to \nwork with my colleagues to improve the family business exclusion, and I \nwelcome their support for our proposal to truly protect family farms \nand businesses.\n  Our amendment would also relieve family-owned enterprises from the \nburden of estate planning. Since there would be no estate tax, there \nwould be no need for estate planning. Under Senator Gramm's amendment, \nthe full estate tax will remain in effect until 2010. So family-owned \nenterprises would still have to pay a lawyer and an accountant to \nprepare for the possibility that they may be subject to the tax.\n  The other key difference is that Senator Gramm's amendment would \npermanently eliminate the estate tax for multibillionaires. I do not \nbelieve this is good policy. The Gramm amendment would cost \napproximately $740 billion over 10 years and trillions of dollars in \nthe decades after that.\n  Ironically, the amendment would go into effect at the time the baby \nboomers will start to retire. So as the number of people drawing on \nSocial Security and Medicare starts to increase dramatically, the Gramm \namendment would be draining the funds necessary to support these \nprograms. At a time when we are running budget deficits and Social \nSecurity and Medicare funds are being used to pay for other programs, \nit is not wise to take any action that would threaten the solvency of \nthese programs.\n  Who would the Gramm amendment benefit? The tax cut passed last year, \nwhich I supported, eliminating the tax on estates of less than $3.5 \nmillion, and our amendment would extend this provision permanently. By \n2009, estates worth less than $4 million would owe no estate tax. There \nare very few American families who have to worry about having estates \nof more than $4 million. I only wish there were more of my constituents \nwho had this problem.\n\n  In reality, the very wealthiest Americans would benefit from the \nGramm amendment, but the programs that middle Americans rely on for \ntheir retirement security would be harmed, as would our ability to \nprovide a much-needed prescription drug benefit for seniors.\n  So the choice is clear. If we want to make sure that parents will be \nable to pass their businesses and farms down to their children and we \nwant to provide this relief right now, not in 2011, and we want to do \nthis in a way that does not threaten the long-term solvency of Social \nSecurity and Medicare, we should vote for the Dorgan-Durbin-Carnahan \namendment and against the Gramm amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 19\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from Texas has 6 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make a couple of additional \nobservations, and I suspect the Senator from Texas will wish to \nconclude his comments after which I will conclude mine.\n  The Senator from Texas said a while ago that facts are stubborn, and \nthat is true. Facts are also sticky. They tend to hang around a fair \namount.\n  Let me describe a few facts about this debate, and this issue. \nDespite all of the tap dancing around this issue, our amendment would \nsay to farms and businesses in this country that if you are passed to \nthe kids who will keep running it following the death of the parents, \nwe will repeal the estate tax for that transfer effective next year.\n  My colleagues have said we would like to repeal it as well, and \nrepeal a lot more for that matter, but we will do that 7 years from \nnow. We will start 7 years from now with our complete repeal.\n  If it is, in fact, a priority, why would they not do it effective \nJanuary 1 of next year?\n  In addition, we have heard some discussion about the fact that this \nfamily-owned business exclusion does not work. The fact is, it has been \nused a fair amount. It is fairly new, but it is interesting to me that \nthe proposal by the Senator from Texas and others last year to repeal \nthe estate tax also repealed in their legislation the family-owned \nbusiness deduction in 2004. They are the ones who decided that they \nwere going to repeal the family-owned business deduction in 2004.\n  What they also came up with last year, I suspect we will not hear \nanyone defend because it is almost the sort of thing that you are going \nto put in material for comedians.\n  They came up with a tax plan that says, We will gradually repeal the \nestate tax from now until the year 2010, at which point it is repealed. \nIn 2011, we will reinstate it. They are saying to the American people, \nby the way, if anyone has a notion of planning your death, make sure \nyou die in 2010 because that is the only year in the next 10 or so \nyears when there is a complete repeal of the estate tax.\n  I don't know what pencils they used. I don't know what assistance \nthey had or consulting advice they received when in a closed and dark \nroom someplace they decided to repeal the estate tax gradually over 10 \nyears and then bring it back in the 11th year. And, by the way, in \ndoing so, we will in 3 years----\n  Mr. KYL. I say to the Senator from North Dakota----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator from North Dakota suggested this was done in a \ndark room.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me say by unanimous consent, the room was not dark. \nThe room was not dark.\n  In addition to creating this comedic approach to tax relief, they \ndecided in 2004 they will repeal the family-owned business deduction. \nThose who say they are on the floor of the Senate to help family \nbusinesses and family farms are the very ones who stuck in their bill \nlast year a repeal of the family-owned business deduction in 2004. You \ncan make one of two points, but not all at the same time. You can say, \nas they say incorrectly, that the family-owned business deduction does \nnot work. If that is the case, they probably should have repealed \nimmediately. But they are saying it does not work so we will let it \ncontinue not to work and repeal it later. I suppose this is also great \nmaterial for comedy but a pretty poor excuse, in my judgment, for sound \ntax policy.\n  Strip away all of the leaves and ask the question, What are the \nissues? Simply, they are these:\n  I propose an $8 million unified estate tax exemption for a husband \nand wife. If you do not have assets equalling $8 million, do not worry, \nyou will never have an estate tax obligation. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, I propose a total repeal of the estate tax in 2003 for the \npassage of a\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\nfamily business or a farm to the kids who want to continue to run it. \nIf the parents die, and the kids want to run that operation, I say good \nfor them. The last thing in the world we want to do is interrupt that \nwith an estate tax obligation. It is repealed for such businesses, \nregardless of size. We do that January 1, 2003.\n  The proposal to repeal the entire estate tax means we are fighting \nover what is left, No. 1; and, No. 2, we are fighting over when we will \ngive relief to family-owned businesses and family-owned farms.\n  Last year, they decided to take away in 2004 the family-owned \nbusiness deduction. Now they are saying they are fighting to help \nfamily businesses.\n  A strange fight, I would say: Try to take away their deduction; you \ndid, in fact, in law, in 2004; and now you want to stage this so they \nget relief 7 years from today. If it is important, how about relief \nimmediately? How about saying if it is important for businesses and \nfarms to stand up and do it now? That is what my amendment does.\n  This is bait and switch. We all understand bait and switch and have \nseen it in stores from time to time. This is bait and switch in \nlegislation.\n  I will speak at the end about priorities because we have people \nsaying this is the most important thing for us. Yes, we have a big \ndeficit. Yes, we have economic trouble. But our most important priority \nat this point is providing a repeal of the estate tax for the largest \nestates in the country? I am talking about estates worth $500 million, \n$1 billion, $2 billion, $20 billion. That is the biggest priority? That \nis the highest priority we have in this country? We have Social \nSecurity issues, Medicare issues, education issues, a whole series of \nthings we ought to attend to, but the highest priority is providing a \nrepeal of the estate tax for the top estates in the country?\n  I think not. One of the priority ought to be to do what I do in this \namendment: Have a thoughtful exemption, $8 million, husband and wife, \nbelow which there will be no estate tax obligation any longer, under \nany circumstance, and allow almost immediately, on January 1 of next \nyear, the passage or transfer of a family business or family farm to \nthe descendants who want to run the business or farm without an estate \ntax obligation. That is my amendment.\n  Do not vote against this amendment and go home and say, by the way, I \nam the champion of the business and farm that is family owned. This is \nthe way to champion their interests if you want to repeal the estate \ntax obligation of the transfers, effective January 1.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call I am about to \nask for not be charged against either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the \ndisposition of the Dorgan amendment, which should be in the next 15 or \n20 minutes, the Conrad amendment be set aside and that Senator Gramm or \nhis designee be recognized to offer his first-degree amendment, as \nprovided under the parameters of the agreement governing H.R. 8; that \nupon the conclusion of the debate with respect to the Gramm or designee \namendment, the amendment be set aside, and the Senate resume \nconsideration of the Conrad amendment No. 3831, and there be 5 minutes \nof debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form; that upon \nthe use of time, the Senate vote in relation to the amendment; that \nupon disposition of the Conrad amendment, the Senate resume \nconsideration of the Gramm amendment, and there be 5 minutes of debate \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form; that upon the use of \ntime, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment without \nfurther intervening action or debate; and provided further that no \nother second-degree amendment be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the information of Members, we are going \nto have a vote very shortly. Then we will have an approximately 2-hour \ndebate on the Gramm amendment. Then we will have two votes following \nthat. That should end the debate on this matter, I hope, for the day--\nand for the year, maybe.\n  I have nothing more to say at this time. I think this is how debate \nshould take place. I have been very satisfied, and I think everyone \nshould be, with the tenor of the debate. The issue has been, and will \nfor the next 2 hours, put at issue, and I wish we had more debates such \nas this in the Senate. This is very high class.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 6 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. And Senator Dorgan?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 11\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am going to yield 3 minutes 20 seconds to my colleague \nfrom Arizona, and then I would like Senator Dorgan to use his time and \nthen I will conclude.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Nevada, except \nfor some recent comments made by the Senator from North Dakota when he \ntalked about a comedic approach and a bait-and-switch approach and \nasked the question: Why would we repeal the death tax and then \nreinstate it? The Senator knows full well why that was done. We did not \ndo it. Those on his side of the aisle were responsible for that.\n  The American people need to understand the reason is that, under the \nrule under which the Tax Reform Act of 1991 was taken up, we could only \nact for a 10-year period after which our actions were sunsetted. We \ndidn't want that. We wanted to make the death tax repeal permanent, but \nit was not possible because of opposition from the other side. That is \nthe answer to the question posed by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  When he asked us, why did you repeal the death tax and then allow it \nto be reinstated, the answer is: We did not; you did. Now you have a \nchance to fix it.\n  We all have a chance now to repeal the death tax permanently. This is \nthe time for people to stand up. Do we really want it repealed? Do we \nwant it repealed permanently? Or were we just kidding when this was \ndone last year?\n  A lot of Democrats and a lot of Republicans voted, not in a dark room \nbut in this Chamber, a year ago to repeal the death tax. They wanted it \nrepealed permanently. Only because of a parliamentary rule was that not \npossible. Now it is possible. This is our chance, and the only real \nrepeal is the Gramm-Kyl repeal.\n  The amendment of the Senator from North Dakota that we will be voting \non in just a moment is fatally flawed because, while it makes an \nunlimited exemption, you have to walk through a gate--in order to get \nthat unlimited exemption--that is closed. Very few, if any, small \nbusinesses or farms will be able to qualify. How do we know this? \nBecause the Senator from North Dakota uses the very same qualifying \nlanguage that is in the existing law.\n  From the IRS itself we have the numbers of people who qualify out of \nthe over 100,000 estate tax filers. Only a little over 1,000 qualified, \neven in the year with the largest number. In the first year in 1999, it \nwas 173 people. In that year, 173 estates would get this wonderful \nrelief proposed by the Senator from North Dakota. In 1998, it was 899 \npeople. In the biggest year, 1,400 people would qualify. Of those, IRS \nis winning two-thirds of the cases with respect to the valuation of the \nassets.\n  This is an amendment which has great promise and zero production. As \nthe Senator from Missouri said, you can't make a flat tire roll just by \nmaking it bigger. The Dorgan amendment\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\nshould be defeated because it cannot provide relief to anybody.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na paper on interest deductions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Qualified Family-Owned Business Interest Deduction\n\n       Under section 2057, certain ``qualified heirs'' may make an \n     election to deduct the value of certain family-owned business \n     interest from the gross estate. Currently this deduction is \n     $1.3 million. That means if the fair market value of the \n     estate is $10 million, subject to a 50 percent death tax, the \n     QFOBI would reduce the taxable portion of the estate to $8.7 \n     million subject to the same 50 percent tax.\n       There is a period of up to 12 years in which the IRS can \n     disqualify a QFOBI and impose estate tax plus accrued \n     interest, from the date of death until the recapture event \n     becomes due and owing immediately.\n       In general, QFOBI's problems can be simply stated. It is \n     unfair (and impractical) for Congress to draw an artificial \n     line as to who will or will not be subject to the death tax.\n       In other words, QFOBI attempts to draw a line so that some \n     small businesses and farms qualify for a complete exemption \n     from the death tax but others will not be able to avail \n     themselves of any death tax relief. In many cases, those \n     businesses that can spend the most money on death tax \n     planning will be more likely to choose this exemption (that \n     is, in truth, simply a giant loophole).\n\n\n                            summary of qfobi\n\n       1. To qualify (and stay qualified) for this deduction is \n     difficult.\n       The decedent was a citizen or resident of the United States \n     at the date of death.\n       The business interests are includible in the gross estate.\n       The business interests must have passed to or been acquired \n     by a qualified heir from the decedent.\n       The adjusted value of the qualified family-owned business \n     interests must exceed 50% of the value of the adjusted gross \n     estate (considered the most complicated requirement of \n     Section 2057 in comments by Professors Roger A. McEowen and \n     Neil E. Hart)\n       The business interest must be in a trade or business that \n     has its principal place of business in the United States.\n       The business interest was owned by the decedent during 5 of \n     the 8 years before the decedent's death.\n       For 5 of the 8 years before the decedent's death, there was \n     material participation by the decedent in the business.\n       2. To qualify for the deduction, the ``business interest'' \n     must be either an interest as a proprietor in an entity \n     which:\n       At least 50 percent of the entity is owned by the decedent \n     or members of the decedent's family;\n       At least 70 percent of the entity is owned by members of \n     two families, and at least 30 percent is owned by the \n     decedent or members of the decedent's family; or\n       At least 90 percent of the entity is owned by members of \n     three families, and at least 30 percent is owned by the \n     decedent or members of the decedent's family.\n       However, there are additional limitations to the general \n     rules regarding a ``qualified family-owned business \n     interest'':\n       (QFOBI) shall not include the following:\n       Any interest in a trade or business if its principal place \n     of business is located outside the United States.\n       Any interest in an entity if the stock or debt of the \n     entity (or a controlled group of which the entity is a \n     member) was readily tradable on an established securities \n     market or secondary market at any time within 3 years of the \n     date of the decedent's death.\n       Any interest in a trade or business (excluding banks and \n     domestic building and loan associations) if more than 35 \n     percent of its adjusted ordinary gross income for the taxable \n     year that includes the date of the decedent's death would \n     qualify as personal holding company income if such trade or \n     business was a corporation.\n       The portion of an interest in a trade or business that is \n     attributable to:\n       Cash and/or marketable securities in excess of the \n     reasonably expected day-to-day working capital needs, and\n       Any other assets (other than assets held in the active \n     conduct of a bank or domestic building and loan) that produce \n     or are held for the production of personal holding company \n     income and most types of foreign personal holding company \n     income.\n       3. To be a ``qualified heir'':\n       A person is a ``qualified heir'' of property if he or she \n     is a member of the decedent's family and acquired or received \n     the interest form the decedent.\n       The qualified heir must continue to materially participate \n     in the family business for next 10 years.\n       4. To ``materially participate''\n       The existence of material participation is a factual \n     determination (in other words open to aggressive challenges \n     by IRS and almost certain litigation), and the types of \n     activities and financial risks that will support a finding of \n     material participation will vary with the mode of ownership. \n     No single factor is determinative of the presence of material \n     participation, but physical work and participation in \n     management decisions are the principal factors to be \n     considered. Passively collecting rents, salaries, draws, \n     dividends, or other income from the trade or business does \n     not constitute material participation. Neither does merely \n     advancing capital and reviewing business plans and financial \n     reports each business year.\n       5. Forfeiture of QFOBI status and 10-year Recapture Period:\n       Section 2057 imposes an additional estate tax when there is \n     a taxable event. A taxable event occurs if, within 10 years \n     of the decedent's death and before the qualified heir's \n     death, one of the following events occurs:\n       The qualified heir disposes of any portion of his or her \n     interest in the qualified family-owned business, other than \n     by a disposition to a member of the qualified heir's family \n     or through a qualified conservation contribution under \n     section 170(h);\n       The qualified heir ceases to meet material participation \n     requirements (i.e., if neither the qualified heir nor any \n     member of his or her family has materially participated in \n     the trade or business for at least 10 year period;\n       The principal place of business of the qualified family-\n     owned business ceases to be located in the United States \n     (This includes bankruptcy or foreclosure!!!);\n       The qualified heir loses United States citizenship and \n     neither a qualified trust was created nor was a security \n     arrangement made.\n       As under section 2032A, the 10-year recapture period may be \n     extended for a period of up to 2 years if the qualified heir \n     does not begin to use the property for a period of up to 2 \n     years after the decedent's death.\n       6. Criticisms of QFOBI\n       Currently, we have a $1 million exemption that can not be \n     combined with the $1.3 million QFOBI deduction. Confronted \n     with all of QFOBI's complexities and pitfalls, taxpayers \n     simply choose to submit themselves to it in order to obtain \n     an additional $300,000 deduction. Less than three percent of \n     eligible small businesses have used it (don't have cite.) IRS \n     Economist Jacob Mikow documents in a letter that for filing \n     year 2000 a total of 108,322 estate tax returns were filed. A \n     mere, 1,470 of those returns made the QFOBI election.\n       Tax lien. For 10 years the IRS has a first position lien on \n     all of the business/farm assets, which means when the family \n     applies for an operating loan so it can ``materially \n     participate'', the bank has to take a second position. A \n     second position is considered an ``at risk'' loan and the \n     family then has to pay 2 to 3 points higher on their \n     operating loan every year for 10 years. This is probably the \n     biggest impediment to facilitating liquidity during the \n     consideration.\n       QFOBI does not exempt ``generation skipping tax'' (GST). So \n     a decedent can utilize QFOBI to leave his family business/\n     farm to his grandson (subject to all of the QFOBI constraints \n     and limitations) and not pay the death taxes, but the \n     decedent's estate would still have to pay GST tax of 50 \n     percent. Effectively this prevents taxpayers from utilizing \n     QFOBI to turn over the family business/farm to any one but \n     their sons and daughters, who may not be the best suited for \n     the job.\n       Ownership requirement is the last 5 out of 8 years prior to \n     death. There is not an exception for normal course of \n     business turn over, such as estates with heavy crops or \n     livestock or inventory values. This severely complicates farm \n     planning. For example, the life expectancy of a chicken is \n     probably less then 8 years much less the life expectancy of a \n     potato crop--So there is no ability to lose a chicken and to \n     replace a chicken and to be able to substitute the ownership \n     period.\n       Sales in the ordinary course of business create a recapture \n     event as there is not a safe harbor on the sale of a crop-\n     inventory or of livestock during the 10 material \n     participation requirement. So if you sold a widget or a \n     chicken or an ear of corn you would owe not only income tax \n     but estate tax.\n       50 percent ownership requirement has a lookback period \n     which includes gifts to spouses--so if you balanced an estate \n     to get both unified credits you could lose the QFOBI.\n       Recapture provision for over 10 years can \n     disproportionately hurt those businesses and farms that \n     suffer during an economic downturn. For example, in year one, \n     the business might be doing well, but seven years later must \n     file for bankruptcy protection, despite the fact that it \n     plans to reorganize and continue operations in the future. In \n     that event, the QFOBI would terminate and the death tax, plus \n     interest accrued for the past seven years would be due and \n     owing immediately. That fact alone might prevent the company \n     from successfully recovering from bankruptcy.\n       Cost, expense and uncertainty of setting up an QFOBI is \n     very high and never ending. The tax code is complicated \n     enough and we should work to reduce its complexity, not \n     pursue winners and loser type death tax reform.\n       ABA and many other non partisan institutions have urged \n     repeal of this provision and cautioned against its use, \n     suggesting that it may border on the line of legal \n     malpractice.\n       Look at how hard it had been for the opponents of repeal to \n     devise workable QFOBI legislation. No bills have been \n     introduced and we only today saw their proposal to try to \n     convince the American people that we can fix the unfixable.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me repeat those facts very briefly \nbecause facts are persistent things. In 1999,\n\n[[Page S5410]]\n\n104,000 American families filed a death tax return, with 45,000 of them \nended up paying a death tax. Only 889 qualified for the exemption that \nwould be expanded by this amendment.\n  In the last 5 years, of the people who would have qualified for this \nand all the other exemptions, only 33 of them have been farmers and \nranchers.\n  So as I said earlier, this amendment provides a political figleaf for \nSenators who are going to vote against a permanent repeal of the death \ntax and who are using this to cover themselves. It is going to provide \npolitical protection for more Senators than it is going to provide tax \nrelief for farmers and ranchers in America. Some 40 Senators will get \nthe figleaf of protection. Some 33 farmers and ranchers in 5 years have \ngotten relief from all of these provisions.\n  I think this is a clear choice. The Senator complains that the tax \ncut is temporary. Why? Because we did not have 60 votes; because the \nDemocrats opposed the President's tax cut in overwhelming numbers. They \nhad the ability to filibuster. The only way we could get the tax cut \nadopted was to use a procedure that required that the tax cut expire \nafter 10 years. Now the Senator from North Dakota is attacking us for a \nprovision that exists because the Democrats would have filibustered the \ntax cut.\n  When we voted, I assumed we meant to repeal the death tax. People \nsaid they did. Now we have come down to doing it. There is only one \nreal repeal. That is the amendment I am going to offer with Senator \nKyl. We are going to raise a budget point of order against this \namendment. It will require 60 votes to overcome it. The same point of \norder will be raised against our amendment. I urge those who voted for \nthe tax cut to vote to sustain this point of order so we can have a \nreal repeal, something for which they voted.\n  Second, I urge people who did not vote for the tax cut to look at the \nabsurdity of having a situation where 11 years from now this death tax \nis going to come out of the grave and prey on family businesses and \nforce people to sell off the life work of their family to give the \nGovernment a 55-percent tax on everything they have accumulated in \ntheir lives.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business is faxing me a letter \nright now opposing this amendment, saying it does not solve the \nproblem. I will have that letter printed in the Record. I have the \nletter before me. I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                      of Independent Business,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2002.\n\n         NFIB Releases Statement on Dorgan Death-Tax Amendment\n\n       NFIB Senior Vice President Dan Danner today released the \n     following statement about an amendment offered by U.S. \n     Senator Byron Dorgan (N.D.) that would not provide a full and \n     permanent death-tax repeal:\n       ``Senator Dorgan's amendment does not meet the one \n     requirement that NFIB members have demanded on this issue: a \n     full repeal of this onerous tax. The only proposal on the \n     table that will permanently and fully fix this problem is the \n     Gramm-Kyl amendment.\n       ``Senator Dorgan's approach operates on a false \n     assumption--that small-business owners can easily plan for \n     the death tax. History has proven that exemptions, half-\n     measures and carve outs just do not help real-world small \n     businesses. The existing `small business' exemption that was \n     enacted in 1997 has only helped 3 percent of those it was \n     intended to help. Senator Dorgan's amendment, which is based \n     on this same idea, will only bring us back to the same \n     roadblocks again.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I can have the attention of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a compilation of provisions of the so-called QFOBI tax provision \nthat illustrate how that is calculated and administered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Section 2057--Qualified Family-Owned Business Interests Deductions\n\n              (Prepared by Sirote & Permutt, May 9, 2002)\n\n\n                i. estates to which section 2057 applies\n\n       Section 2057 applies to an estate if:\n       1. The decedent, at the time of death, was a citizen or \n     resident of the United States;\n       2. The executor makes an election and files an agreement \n     consenting to the imposition of recapture tax;\n       3. The sum of the QFOBIs passing to qualified heirs, plus \n     the amount of includible gifts of QFOBIs exceed 50 percent of \n     the decedent's adjusted gross estate. In other words, the \n     following numerator divided by the following denominator must \n     exceed \\1/2\\.\n       a. Numerator.\n       (i) Aggregate the value of all QFOBIs that are included in \n     the decedent's gross estate and that are acquired by a \n     ``qualified heir'' from, or passed to a ``qualified heir'' \n     from, the decedent.\n       (a) A ``qualified heir'' is a ``member of the decedent's \n     family'' and also includes any employee who has been active \n     in the trade or business to which the family owned business \n     interests relates for ten (10) years prior to decedent's \n     death. (Note that this definition does not require that the \n     employee be employed by the family business itself.)\n       (b) A ``member of the decedent's family'' includes (a) an \n     ancestor of the decedent, (b) the spouse of the decedent, (c) \n     lineal descendants of the decedent, the decedent's spouse, or \n     the decedent's parents, or (d) the spouse of any descendant \n     described in (c).\n       (ii) Add ``adjusted taxable gifts'' and annual exclusion \n     gifts of QFOBIs given to family members, if such interests \n     are continuously held by the family member (other than the \n     decedent's spouse) between the date of the gift and the date \n     of decedent's death.\n       (a) ``Adjusted taxable gifts'' are taxable gifts made by \n     the decedent after 1976 that are includible in the decedent's \n     gross estate.\n       (iii) Subtract the amount of gifts of QFOBIs included in \n     the decedent's estate.\n       (iv) Subtract the cash or marketable securities that exceed \n     the reasonably expected day-to-day working capital needs of \n     the business.\n       (v) Subtract any personal holding company-type assets owned \n     by the business.\n       (vi) Subtract any of the indebtedness of the decedent on \n     property that is included in the decedent's gross estate, \n     except\n       (a) qualified acquisition indebtedness for personal \n     residences;\n       (b) debt if the proceeds were used to pay education or \n     medical expenses of the decedent, the decedent's spouse, or \n     the decedent's dependents; and\n       (c) debt up to $10,000 used for any purpose.\n       b. Denominator.\n       (i) Determine the value of the decedent's gross estate \n     without regard to Section 2057.\n       (ii) Subtract any indebtedness of decedent on property that \n     is included in the decedent's gross estate.\n       (iii) Add the amount of adjusted taxable gifts and annual \n     exclusion gifts of QFOBIs given to family members if such \n     interests are continuously held by the family member from the \n     date of the gift to the date of death.\n       (iv) Subtract gifts of QFOBIs included in the decedent's \n     gross estate.\n       (v) Add other gifts not included in c above and made by the \n     decedent to the decedent's spouse within 10 years of \n     decedent's death.\n       (vi) Add the amount of other gifts not included under c or \n     e above made by the decedent within 3 years of death. In \n     other words, add gifts covered by the annual gift tax \n     exclusion and any other non-taxable gifts made by decedent \n     within 3 years of death.\n       (vii) Subtract the amount of gifts otherwise includible in \n     the decedent's gross estate.\n       c. The numerator divided by the denominator must exceed \\1/\n     2\\ in order for Section 2057 to apply.\n       4. Material Participation Exists\n       a. The decedent of a ``member of the decedent's family'' \n     must have owned the qualified business interests and have \n     ``materially participated'' in the operation of the business \n     to which such interests relate for 5 of the 8 years prior to \n     decedent's death.\n       b. ``Material participation'' is determined on a factual \n     case-by-case basis that examines the type of activities in \n     which that person was involved, the financial risks \n     associated with these activities, and the mode of ownership \n     of the property itself.\n       c. A ``member of the decedent's family'' includes (a) an \n     ancestor of the decedent, (b) the spouse of the decedent, (c) \n     lineal descendants of the decedent, the decedent's spouse, or \n     the decedent's parents, or (d) the spouse of any descendent \n     in (c).\n       d. If the decedent becomes disabled or starts receiving \n     social security benefits, the 8 year period is the 8 years \n     immediately preceding the date of disability or the date of \n     the receipt of the first social security check.\n\n\n   II. ADDITIONAL TAX IMPOSED IF DECEDENTS HEIRS CEASE TO MATERIALLY \nPARTICIPATE IN THE QUALIFIED FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS OR DISPOSE OF THEIR \n                            INTEREST THEREIN\n\n       1. Section 2057 imposes an additional estate tax if, within \n     10 years after the date of the decedent's death, any one of \n     certain recapture events occurs, as follows: (1) an heir \n     receiving a QFOBI does not continue to materially participate \n     in the business for 5 or more years of any 8 year period in \n     the 10 years following the decedent's death; (2) the \n     qualified heir disposes of his or her interest to anyone \n     other than other than members of his or her family or through \n     a qualified conservation contribution; (3) the qualified heir \n     loses United States citizenship and does not hold his or her \n     interest through a domestic trust having at least one United \n     States trustee, or (4) the principal place of business ceases \n     to be located in the United States. With respect to a \n     qualified heir, ``material participation'' will be met if the \n     qualified\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\n     heir is a surviving spouse, minor child, student or disabled \n     heir who actively manages the business. Furthermore, a \n     qualified heir will not be treated as disposing of an \n     interest by reason of ceasing to be engaged in a trade or \n     business so long as the QFOBI interest is used in a trade or \n     business by any member of the qualified heir's family.\n       2. This additional estate tax is equal to the applicable \n     percentage of the adjusted tax difference attribute to the \n     QFOBI, plus interest at the underpayment rate for the period \n     beginning when the estate tax liability was originally due \n     and ending on the date the additional estate tax is due. The \n     adjusted tax difference attributable to the QFOBI is \n     calculated as the difference between the estate tax which \n     would have been due but for the election to deduct the family \n     owned business interest under 2057 and the actual estate tax \n     paid. The applicable percentage is determined with reference \n     to the year in which the recapture event occurred, as \n     follows:\n\n                                                  Applicable Percentage\nNumber of years after date of death:\n1 through 6.........................................................100\n7................................................................... 80\n8................................................................... 60\n9................................................................... 40\n10.................................................................. 20\n\n       a. The additional estate tax is a personal liability of \n     each qualified heir to the extent of the portion of \n     additional tax that is imposed with respect to his or her \n     interest in the QFOBI.\n       b. For example, Brother and Sister each inherited 50 \n     percent of the qualified family-owned business from their \n     mother. Their mother's estate saved $400,000 in estate tax \n     using 2057. Brother did not materially participate in the \n     business, but Sister did, thereby meeting the material \n     participation test to qualify under 2057. During year 8, \n     Sister sold her interest in the business to someone other \n     than a member of her family, causing a recapture event to \n     occur. Of the $400,000 tax savings, 60 percent or $240,000 \n     must be recaptured with interest. Brother and Sister each \n     owes half of the additional estate tax due.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are now told that this circumstance of \nhaving an estate tax repeal, engineered by my colleague from Texas and \nothers last year, that steps up a repeal over 10 years, repeals the \nestate tax, then brings it back into force in 2011, is something that \nthe Democrats made them do.\n  It reminds me of Flip Wilson; remember that? ``The Devil made me do \nit.''\n  The reason we have this comical circumstance of a bill last year, \nproposed by my colleagues over there, that intends to repeal on a \ngraduated basis the estate tax to a final repeal in 2010, and then \nbring it back into force in 2011, is not because someone on this side \nof the aisle made them do it. It is because their numbers didn't add up \nand they knew they didn't add up. That is why it exists.\n  After that bill was passed, people were asking the question: What \nkind of a Congress passes a piece of legislation that says, oh, by the \nway, there is only 1 year in which you can die in the next decade or so \nand be exempt from the estate tax; that is, 2010? If it is 2009, you \nare taxable. If it is 2011, you are taxable. Now we hear this old, \n``The devil made us do it.'' That doesn't quite fit.\n  C. Northcote Parkinson wrote Parkinson's law that I studied when I \nwas in graduate school. It is a fascinating set of laws.\n  He said at one point that in every organization there is at least one \nperson who is invariably 100 percent wrong. He said someone like that \ncan be valuable because then you will always know who will give you the \nwrong advice.\n  I am not going to suggest anything about my colleagues with that \nexcept to say this: There are occasions on the floor of the Senate when \nthe advice we receive is just flat wrong.\n  This question of trying to help businesses and farms that are owned \nby families to be passed on to the descendants--to the kids--to be able \nto continue operating them is an interesting one.\n  The only way we are going to immediately repeal the estate tax on \npassage of a family farm or business to the kids upon the parents' \ndeath is if we pass the amendment I offered today. That is the only \ncircumstance in which that is going to happen, on January 1, 2003.\n  My colleague from Texas will offer his proposal which will make it \nhappen over the next 7 years, but not now.\n  It is interesting. My colleague from Illinois talked about who the \nbeneficiaries are. After all, we say no husband and wife with assets of \nless than $8 million will ever pay an estate tax. That is in my \namendment. And no family business passed on to kids will pay an estate \ntax at all if the kids continue to run it. That is in my amendment. The \nquestion is, Who will benefit by defeating my amendment and embracing \nthe proposal by my colleagues from Texas and Arizona? Who will benefit?\n  My colleague from Texas has no doubt heard me from time to time refer \nto Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys, the famous Texas band in the \n1930s. In the lyrics in their song, the little guy picks the cotton and \nthe big guy gets the honey; the little honeybee sucks the blossom and \nthe big bee gets the honey.\n  This is about honey and money. And it is about the way it always \nworks somehow on the floor of the Senate.\n  Guess who benefits. It is not in most cases folks at the bottom of \nthe economic ladder, or even in the middle of the economic ladder, who \nare the beneficiaries. It somehow always seems to me that the proposals \nhere--especially this type of proposal--offer the circumstance where we \nsay, Let us provide a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans.\n  What are our priorities? Are our priorities education, strengthening \nAmerica's schools, investing in Social Security? Are our priorities \nstrengthening Medicare? Are they providing a tax cut for middle-income \ntaxpayers. Are our priorities providing a tax cut and deduction for \nbeing able to send your kid to college or providing health care \nbenefits for you and your workers and your business? Are those our \npriorities? No.\n  My colleagues say that is not a priority of ours. Those priorities \nmust take a backseat to the priority of providing estate tax relief for \nthe very wealthiest in America.\n  This isn't about being opposed to those who are wealthy. In my \nproposal in this amendment, there is a very substantial estate tax \nexemption of $8 million. If you are trying to pass a family business or \nfarm on to the kids who are going to run it, you are not going to pay \nan estate tax. That repeal is effective next January 1.\n  My colleagues say: No. We support this issue of helping farms and \nbusinesses, but we support helping them 7 years from now. We have used \nthat as the pole-vaulting contest to get to the point where we can \nrepeal the estate tax, but it is not so important to us that we believe \non January 1 of next year businesses and farms passed on to the kids \nought to have the estate tax repealed.\n  It is not that important to them. It is important to me. And I \nbelieve very much that we ought to pass this amendment. We voted on \nthis amendment last year. Times have changed, as you know. Things are \nquite different. My amendment last year got 43 votes.\n  Last year, just prior to this time, we were on the floor of the \nSenate, and we had estimated budget surpluses as far as the eye could \nsee. We had people on the floor of the Senate saying: We will have \nbudget surpluses year after year. Let us provide very large tax cuts.\n  Some of us said: Maybe we ought not do that. Maybe we ought to be a \nbit conservative. What if something happens?\n  Guess what happened. In a matter of 7 or 8 months we ran into a \nrecession, and then we had a war. The result is that our economy \nfaltered. These big surpluses turned into big deficits.\n  But it didn't mean a thing to those who are marching towards estate \ntax repeal. They are back here on the floor of the Senate as if nothing \nhappened. It is just as if they have missed the last year and our \npriority remains to try to lift the burden of taxes from those who are \nat the top end of the income ladder in this country. If you have $1 \nbillion, our priority remains that we believe in tax cuts for you, and \nwe are here to fight for you.\n  Is there anybody here who is willing to fight for the people at the \nbottom of the economic ladder? Is anybody proposing a tax cut this \nafternoon for middle-income taxpayers trying to send there kids to \nschool? I don't think so. That is not the priority.\n  That is why I hope we will pass our amendment. This amendment says, \nyes, let us provide dramatic increases in the exemption for the estate \ntax, and let us exempt the tax in the transfer of the family farms and \nbusinesses to the kids who want to run them; but let us not give up the \nopportunity for a couple hundred billion dollars in the\n\n[[Page S5412]]\n\nsecond 10 years that might be used to help America's kids and schools, \nhelp strengthen Social Security, help strengthen Medicare, and do the \nthings that will also make this a better country.\n  I hope my colleagues will understand that the only way to address \nthis issue of family farms and businesses that we have heard so much \nabout is this amendment.\n  One final point: My colleagues have talked about the family-owned \nbusiness deduction not working. It is interesting to me. In fact, they \nrepealed it in law last year. They said, let us repeal the family-owned \nbusiness deduction. That was their bill last year. They did it in 2004, \nwhich is a complete contradiction. If it didn't work, why wouldn't you \nrepeal it immediately? If it does work, why do you repeal it in 2004? \nIt does work, and they know it. They simply allege that it doesn't work \nso they can try to defeat this amendment and provide relief for the \npeople with the highest incomes at a time when this country is in debt \nand is going deeper in debt. Their proposal doesn't have as a priority \nto help on the other things that are important--health care, Social \nSecurity, education, and much more. We will get to those things by \ncasting some sensible votes this afternoon on this amendment.\n  Support this amendment, oppose the Gramm amendment, and do the right \nthing.\n  I yield the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as provided for in the unanimous consent \nagreement, I make a point of order under section 311 of the Budget Act \nagainst the pending Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the purposes of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) and the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 44, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 149 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Crapo\n     Helms\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 44, the nays are \n54. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the work that is being done. \nIn the interest of all colleagues, let me simply make sure that people \nunderstand that we have a debate on another amendment. Under the \nunanimous consent agreement, the debate can last up to 2 hours. It \nwould be my expectation, after completion of the debate on the next \namendment, the Gramm amendment, we will then vote on the Conrad \namendment and the Gramm amendment back to back. It is then my hope that \nwe can have a vote on a point of order that will take place either \nimmediately or shortly thereafter.\n  In the meantime, we are still discussing the matter of stem cell \nresearch and cloning and a unanimous consent request there, as well as \na hope that I have that we can move to terrorism insurance legislation. \nI just indicated to Senator Lott that it would be my desire to move to \nthe terrorism insurance legislation immediately following either the \ndebate on stem cell or the debate on the estate tax legislation.\n  So it is my intention to ask unanimous consent to move forward on \nboth of those issues. It is my understanding that some of my colleagues \nwish to have a little additional time. So before I propound a request \non either one of those issues, we will certainly be happy to \naccommodate the request of our colleagues. But I want people to be on \nnotice that it is our intention to file a unanimous consent request on \nterrorism insurance, as well as on the stem cell cloning debate. That \nis with an understanding that Senator Lott just noted. I had been told \nthere was some interest in filing cloture on the motion to proceed on \ndefense. Senator Lott has indicated to me that is not the case. So I \nwill not propound these requests with that understanding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have been working with the interested \nSenators on this issue of cloning, trying to see if we can get a \nunanimous consent agreement. We are continuing to do that.\n  With regard to the terrorism insurance bill, if we don't get an \nagreement on cloning, it is my hope that we can get an agreement to \nproceed with the terrorism issue. There are a couple of points that \nneed to be clarified, and we are discussing those now. We will, \nhopefully, get an agreement on one, or perhaps both, of those issues. \nWe will continue to work on that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I may have misspoke. I indicated there \nare going to be two votes at the end of two hours. That will complete \nthe debate on the estate tax issue: the completion of the debate on the \namendment now to be offered by Senator Gramm, and then the vote on the \namendment offered by Senator Conrad. We will determine what the course \nof business will be subject to the discussions underway on both \nterrorism insurance and the stem cell cloning debate as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3833\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Kyl, Senator Brownback, Senator Nickles, and Senator \nHutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n  The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \nBrownback, Mr. Nickles, and Mrs. Hutchison, proposes an amendment \nnumbered 3833.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n             (Purpose: To permanently repeal the death tax)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Permanent Death Tax Repeal \n     Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTATE TAX REPEAL MADE PERMANENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 901 of the Economic Growth and Tax \n     Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a) by striking ``shall not apply--'' and \n     all that follows and inserting ``(other than title V) shall \n     not apply to taxable, plan, or limitation years beginning \n     after December 31, 2010.'', and\n\n[[Page S5413]]\n\n       (2) in subsection (b) by striking ``, estates, gifts, and \n     transfers''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect as if included in section 901 of the \n     Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have sent to the desk the real repeal of \nthe death tax. This amendment is identical to the language that was \nadopted in the House of Representatives last week.\n  Current law phases in the elimination of the death tax and then, due \nto the limitations of the Budget Act, the death tax rises up out of the \ngrave in 2011 and starts destroying family businesses, family farms, \nand family dreams in 2011. What our amendment does is makes the repeal \nof the death tax permanent.\n  I want to touch on a couple of issues, and then I want to yield to \nsome of my colleagues who want to speak.\n  I remind my colleagues that when we passed the tax bill, we had 58 \nvotes. It would have taken 60 votes to have made the tax cut permanent \nby waiving the provisions of the Budget Act. We only had 58 votes. We \nhave this anomaly that the death tax rises out of the grave because we \nonly had 58 people who supported the tax cut.\n  I believe everybody who voted for that tax cut was committed to the \nprinciple that we were repealing the death tax. Today we have an \nopportunity--the first real opportunity--to achieve that goal.\n  I remind my colleagues that in the year that the repeal would go into \neffect, which would be 2011, we are projected by the latest \nCongressional Budget Office estimate to have a $450 billion surplus. \nOur Democrat colleagues say they would like to make it permanent, but \nwe cannot afford it. I remind my colleagues, when it would go into \neffect, under current estimates, we would have a $450 billion surplus. \nWhat they are really saying is they want to spend the money rather than \nletting people keep their farm, keep their business, keep their dream.\n  We have heard throughout this debate Member after Member get up and \nsay that this repeal will take money away from the Treasury and that \nthey are very worried about the debt and the deficit. Not once, twice, \nthree, four, or five times, but six times in the last 9 months we have \nincreased spending many times more than would be required to pay for \nthe repeal of the death tax.\n  In nonrequested, nonemergency funding in the emergency appropriations \nbill, items the President did not ask for, we spent four times as much \nas it would take to fund the repeal of the death tax next year.\n  In total, in the last 9 months, the same people who are saying we \ncannot afford to make this repeal permanent have voted for 15 times \nmore spending next year than the cost of repealing the death tax. These \nare the same colleagues who have 100 different taxes that ought to be \nincreased, 41 different tax cuts that ought to be taken back, but they \ndo not have one single idea about how we could control spending.\n  In reality, this is a very simple debate. When you cut through to the \nbottom line, it is a debate about priorities. Those who are opposed to \nmaking the tax cut permanent are basically saying: We are willing to \nforce people to sell their business and sell their farm, tax a family \nat the moment of death and take away the life work of their parents so \nthat Government can spend more money. That is what this is about.\n  Are you willing to take away somebody's farm, somebody's business, \nsomebody's dream so Government can go on spending as usual? I am not. \nThis is a clear-cut issue, and it is a question of right and wrong. It \nis not right for people to work a lifetime, pay taxes on every dollar \nthey earn, scrimp, save, sacrifice, plow that money into a business, \nplow it into a farm, work 12 or 14 hours a day, and then when they die \ntheir children have to sell their life's work to pay a tax on income \nthat has already been taxed. It is fundamentally wrong. This is a moral \nissue, not just a tax issue or an economic issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to make the death tax repeal permanent. \nIf the people who voted for the tax cut and if the people who voted for \nthe sense-of-the-Senate resolution earlier this year are saying we \nought to make the death tax repeal permanent voted for this amendment, \nwe would succeed.\n  I urge my colleagues to take away this tax on farms, ranches, \nbusinesses, and dreams by making the repeal of the death tax permanent.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Texas for sponsoring \nthis amendment. The Senate has passed the death tax repeal. We are \ntrying to make it permanent. In fact, it was a year ago this month that \nwe passed the bill that would provide urgently needed tax relief for \nAmericans, but now we want to finish this job and make it permanent so \npeople can plan for their futures.\n  Why is it important to permanently repeal this tax? Because it \npunishes people for saving. Everyone pays taxes on the money they earn, \nbut then we all have a choice: We can spend the money or we can save \nit. Some may choose to take a vacation or buy a new car. There is \nnothing wrong with that. That is their choice. It is their money. But \nothers will invest it for retirement, plow it into their family farm or \nranch, or invest it in the family business, creating new jobs and \nkeeping our economy going.\n  All of these people want to pass their savings to their children. In \nthe end, they have put off enjoying the money they worked hard to earn \nin order to build a more secure future for their children.\n  There is an old saying that the key to wealth is not how much you \nearn but how much you do not spend. These people chose savings over \nconsumption. This is something we should encourage and support, but \nwith the death tax, when they die, the Government takes up to 55 \npercent of what they saved. This is wrong, and Americans know it.\n  Three out of four voters would like to see the estate tax eliminated. \nThis overwhelming support exists because the American people understand \nthis tax is unfair, inefficient, and bad policy. More important, the \npeople of our country seek the American dream of improving their lives \nand the lives of their children, and they know this tax works against \nthat.\n  People who want to keep the death tax argue that it only affects a \nsmall percentage of the population, but they miss the point. It is not \na matter of how many are affected but whether it is right or wrong, and \nthe death tax is clearly wrong.\n  I told a story a few years ago about the family of David Langford of \nSan Antonio. It is not a story; it is true. Mr. Langford's mother \npassed away in 1993 and, as a result, he faced a tax liability of more \nthan $400,000 because two of the ranches that had been in their family \nfor over five generations had, of course, increased in value.\n  They had been in the family for over 100 years.\n  One happens to be in the hill country of Texas, which Texans know is \none of the most beautiful parts of our State and the prices have gone \nout of sight.\n  In order to pay the taxes and keep the ranches for his family, Mr. \nLangford had to sell his mother's house, his own house, and many \npersonal assets, as well as move into a small condominium and borrow \n$190,000. But that was not the end. The Langfords spent 5 years trying \nto reach an agreement with the IRS that would bring down the fair \nmarket value of the properties. They settled with the IRS for $415,000. \nThe Langfords had spent $70,000 in attorney's fees associated with \ndealing with the IRS.\n  So in 2001, to cover the costs, Mr. Langford had to sell the condo \nand one of the farms in McMullen County, a ranch that had been in his \nfamily for five generations.\n  Now the Langfords wonder if they will be able to pass the Kendall \nCounty property, the other farm which has been in the family for seven \ngenerations, to his children. He jokes that if he dies in 2010 his \nfamily can keep the ranch, but they will not be able to keep it if he \nlives past 2010.\n  This is not a joke. This is a situation families across America will \nface. We must eliminate the death tax so that regular people, such as \nDavid Langford, can pass on their treasures from their families to \ntheir children. I think his family has more than paid their fair\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\nshare to the U.S. Government, having to sell a farm that had been in \nthe family for over 100 years.\n  Then there is Debbie Gillan, who struggled to keep her family's ranch \nafter her uncle and father passed away, and now she wants to try to \nkeep it for her two sons.\n  Afton Pumps employs 60 people in Houston, TX. It is a small family-\nowned business, but it does not generate enough cash to cover the \npotential death tax liability to make it to the next generation. In \nfact, it is said that less than 50 percent of family businesses can \nsurvive the second generation, and less than 20 percent the third \ngeneration.\n  I ask the Senator from Texas if I could have an additional 2 minutes?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield the Senator an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If we are going to eliminate these family-owned \nbusinesses, it does not affect only the family, it also affects the \npeople who work at places such as Afton Pumps because if they have to \nsell to pay for death taxes or they have to sell the property, there is \na good chance those jobs are going to be eliminated, assuming they can \nsell it at all.\n  In fact, one of the really sad things is the death tax is really a \ntax on asset-heavy, low-producing properties because many times these \nheavy assets have to be sold. They have to be sold at fire sale prices \nso the true value is not gained from the property, and then one has to \ncome up with the money to pay the inheritance tax. It really is not a \nfair tax. It affects a lot of regular people, people in a situation \nwhere something was purchased at very low cost, but they have built it \nor their families have built it. They have a right to keep it. It was \nearned with the hard labor of their family, and they should be able to \npass it to their children.\n  I think this tax really came into being as extra income in time of \nwar, but it was never repealed because the Government got hungry for \nmore and more social programs. This is not a fair tax and we need to \neliminate it so the people of our country can plan for their children's \nfutures, so they will not have to do crazy things to try to protect \nproperty or businesses or assets that have been in their families for \ngenerations. This is not the American way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes of the opposition \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this is a very auspicious moment in our \nhistory, not just this debate in the Senate but the fact that we are in \nthe midst of a war with extraordinary demands, fiscal demands as well \nas demands of patriotism, on the country.\n  Yesterday we raised the debt limit. We are in a situation where there \nare efforts to fund worthy programs that are supported on both sides. \nFirst, of course, is national security, homeland defense, but also an \neducational proposal that the President championed. Yet at this time, \nwe are considering the total repeal of the estate tax.\n  A great deal of the discussion is rhetorical. I think it is useful to \npoint out some of the facts with respect to the estate tax. First, no \nestate less than $1 million is taxed at all today, which excludes the \nvast majority of Americans. In fact, if most Americans are asked what \nthey are worried about at the end of their days, it is not the estate \ntax. It is paying for long-term care. It is affording a nursing home \nwithout having to sell their home or dig deeply into their savings. \nThat is what most Americans worry about. They are not worried about the \nestate tax. Ninety-eight percent of estates pay no estate taxes at all.\n  In 1999, fewer than 49,000 out of 2.3 million estates--that is only \n2.1 percent--paid any estate taxes whatsoever. This percentage is \nprojected to drop as the exemption rises from $650,000 in 1999 to $3.5 \nmillion in the year 2009. Now, the estate tax repeal will benefit some \nAmericans, very few Americans, and the wealthiest Americans. Estates \nlarger than $5 million paid half of all estate taxes, and if we look at \nthe 467 largest estates, worth at least $20 million, they paid nearly \none-quarter of the estate taxes paid. So this is a benefit that will \nnot be fairly shared by all Americans. It will be significantly shared \nby very wealthy Americans.\n  Now it should be pointed out, too, that no estate tax is paid if a \nspouse survives. That spouse does not have to pay estate taxes. \nCurrently, as I indicated, an individual can pass along up to $1 \nmillion without estate taxes, and that increases to $3.5 million in the \nyear 2009, and a couple can pass along twice that amount because of the \nspousal rules.\n  Furthermore, only a small fraction of taxable estates consisting \nprimarily of family-owned small businesses or farm assets pay estate \ntaxes. This is a topic that receives a lot of rhetorical attention, but \nthe reality is this: In 1999, only 1.4 percent of taxable estates were \nfarm estates, and only 1.1 percent were small businesses. There are \nalready special provisions that are provided for these farms and for \nthese small businesses, such as allowing additional sums to be \nbequeathed tax free and also deferring payments on taxes for up to 14 \nyears.\n  Farm estates in 1999 pay only 0.7 percent of all Federal estate taxes \ncollected, and so this is not a crisis of sweeping proportions that is \nengulfing every farm in America--only very few farms, very wealthy \nestates. Even among these family-owned farms and small businesses that \nmight actually pay estate taxes, there is scant evidence the tax has a \nreal impact on their operations; that, in fact, they have to sell the \nfarm to pay the taxes or sell the small business to pay the taxes.\n  One thing that is important to note, a great deal of an estate is \nmade up of unrealized capital gains. The deceased bought property 50 \nyears ago very inexpensively. Today that property is worth a great \ndeal. Under the current system, the heirs get that property with a \nstepped-up basis and so if they choose to sell the property after they \nhave paid the estate tax or after they have been exempt from the estate \ntax, they really pay no capital gains whatsoever because significant \nportions of the property are unrealized capital gains on which no \ncapital gains tax has ever been assessed against the property.\n  There is another argument that is made by proponents, and that \nargument is the fact that repealing of capital gains will stimulate \neconomic growth in America, will increase savings, will increase our \noverall growth. A new report from the Joint Economic Committee and the \nDemocratic staff points out that these claims are exaggerated at best.\n  Repeal would affect very few families and have very little impact on \ntotal capital accumulation in the United States. The tax is very small \nitself, relative to family net worth. The gross value of taxable \nestates comprised only 0.3 percent of the total net worth of the \nhousehold sector, and the estate tax itself claimed less than 0.06 \npercent. That is what the estate tax claims in terms of the household \nsector of America. Repeal would have a small, uncertain effect on \nindividuals' private saving. There is no real indication that saving \nwill increase. In fact, it is likely or possible that consumption could \nincrease as people took estimated estate tax payments and decided they \nwere not due any longer under the proposed regime, they would be spent.\n  It is unclear whether this proposal will increase national saving. \nWithout increased national saving, we will not have the kind of \neconomic growth we want.\n  This repeal, if enacted, will dramatically and definitely affect the \nrevenues going not just to the Federal Government but to State \ngovernments. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates permanent repeal \nwould cost, in 2012 alone, $56 billion. Others suggest that estimate is \nrather conservative. There would also be comparable losses at the State \nlevel. At a time when we are seeing a deficit situation in the United \nStates, that deficit will be compounded by the loss of the estate tax. \nIt will result in a decrease in public and national saving. As a \nresult, we will not be stimulating the kind of growth we want, for many \nreasons, including the fact that the purported savings from compliance \ncosts might not be realized either, since most estates, most investors, \nmost people with property will continue, regardless of the estate tax, \nto plan for the disposition of their assets and engage legal\n\n[[Page S5415]]\n\ncounsel. The notion that we will save and streamline the cost of \nproviding for the future is not substantiated by the reality of what \npeople do every day.\n  Now, can we afford to repeal the estate tax? I don't think we can, \nparticularly in a situation where we are seeing the cost likely in the \nsecond decade to balloon to $750 billion.\n  We are considering in the next few weeks legislation both sides \nsupport. First, a pharmaceutical benefit for seniors. Will that cost \nbillions of dollars? Yes, it will. Where will that money come from? \nRight now, it is coming from the Social Security fund and Federal debt \nif we propose it and pass it. This will make our proposals much more \ndifficult to enact and fund. It is easier to enact than to fund a \npharmaceutical benefit. The Department of Defense is proposing a \nmissile defense system supported by both sides. They are reluctant to \ntell us what the life cycle cost will be over 20 years. Why? Because \nthose costs are likely to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. \nWhere do we get that money? We are in a deficit now. We will be in a \nworse situation if we pass the permanent repeal of the estate tax.\n  We have to recognize that each day we wake up, we encounter a new \nthreat to our national security. Two days ago, the FBI announced they \nseized a terrorist who was plotting to detonate a radioactive device in \nthe United States, causing us to ask fundamental questions: Are all of \nour university laboratories with isotopes fully protected? Are all of \nour reactors, academic and utility reactors, fully protected against \ntheft? That is not an inconsequential cost, but it is a cost we cannot \navoid. If we pass this, we will be in a more difficult position to meet \nthose responsibilities.\n  I urge we reject this approach and adopt the approach suggested by \nSenator Conrad that raises the exemption level, making it quite clear \nand obvious we are not going to penalize those smaller estates, we are \nnot going to penalize the proverbial and somewhat, in many cases, \nelusive family farms that are threatened by this estate tax. I hope we \ncan do that. I hope we reject this proposal and adopt the Conrad \nproposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Gramm amendment, \ntotal repeal of the estate tax.\n  Just yesterday, the Senate responded to the President's request to \nincrease the debt ceiling by $450 billion dollars. We are no longer \nretiring debt and reducing our indebtedness, we are increasing it. The \nsurplus is gone. The President's own budget advisors project deficits \nfor the foreseeable future. And yet, the President is calling on the \nCongress to permanently repeal a particular tax.\n  The cost of repealing the estate tax is not inconsiderable. The cost \nis $99 billion over the next 10 years. In the decade after, the repeal \nwould cost $740 billion. How are we going to pay for this? How is this \nmassive new cost going to be paid for? Are we going to run deeper \ndeficits? Are we going to take it out of the Social Security trust \nfund? And if so is it wise to drain this fund at the precise time that \nthe baby boom generation is expected to reach retirement age?\n  There is a war in case anyone has not noticed. It is going to cost \nmoney to wage it. And yet we are told that we must repeal the estate \ntax for the good of the country.\n  Every day we are getting reports that there will be cut backs on \nessential services. In places like DC, South Dakota, and many other \nStates children's school days have been shortened. Summer school \nclasses are being cancelled and after school programs are being \ncancelled. And yet there are those that think that the most important \nthing we can do as a country, an absolute priority that should prevail \nover all other priorities, is permanently repealing a tax that is payed \nby billionaires and multimillionaires.\n  At a time when we are tying to combat terrorism and we are struggling \nto educate our children and provide senior citizens with security in \ntheir retirement, when we are trying to maintain budget discipline that \nis so vitally important to our countries long term economic growth. \nPeople want to give, they do not want to take from their country at a \ntime like this.\n  Rarely do Members of the Senate find themselves so short of anything \nto say. I find myself dumbfound by this suggestion that we totally \nrepeal the estate tax. At other times I might have understood the \nmotivation. Just a year ago, we were talking about close to $6 trillion \nin surplus over the next 10 years, and if this proposal were brought \nbefore the Senate I might have disagreed or objected to it, but perhaps \na case could be made with $6 trillion of surplus, the days of a \nnational debt behind us, annual deficits no longer a debate, no longer \nan issue. With $6 trillion of accumulated surplus, there might be room \nwithin that surplus for $740 billion of tax expenditures.\n  In light of everything that has occurred in the last year, I am truly \ndumbfounded that we would suggest today that this would even be a close \nvote. That we would be talking about removing from the wealth of our \nNation over the next 20 years close to $800 billion to satisfy a tiny \nfraction--I mean a tiny fraction--of the American public in light of \neverything else that has occurred, is truly dumbfounding.\n  My State, the State that Senator Lieberman and I represent, is often \nreferred to as one of the most affluent States in America on a per \ncapita income basis. One might think in this particular case that I was \nprobably the recipient of a large volume of mail or e-mails, \nconversations, asking me to vote for the total repeal of an estate tax.\n  In light of the fact that the people who will benefit the most, the \nlargest number of people as a percentage of the people, would come from \nthe State I represent--I represent 3.5 million people in the State of \nConnecticut. Out of 3.5 million people whom I represent in the State of \nConnecticut, 980 people would actually have gross estates that would \nsubject them to the estate tax as it is presently written. My \ncolleagues are certainly aware, I hope the American public is, that we \nhave essentially reformed the estate tax in this country to the point \nthat it only now touches a very tiny percentage of the American public.\n  So here in one of the most affluent States in the United States on a \nper capita basis--the State I represent--with a population of 3.5 \nmillion people--there are only 980 estates that have gross incomes that \nwould subject them to this tax.\n  When you factor in the exemptions--for spouses, who do not pay estate \ntax, for family-owned farms and businesses--the number in Connecticut \ncomes down to 73--73. You start out with 980, but if you take in the \nexemptions that we have written in we are talking about 73 estates, in \nthe wealthiest State in the Union. And the pricetag, over 20 years, is \nalmost $800 billion.\n  Maybe people find the word ``dumbfounding'' to be a little harsh, but \nI do not know what other word you could use than that one, when you \nconsider how much wealth they are going to remove when we need so much. \nHere we are, a year after the accumulation of great surpluses, already \ntalking about a deficit this year in the neighborhood of $100 to $120 \nbillion, maybe more before we are done.\n  Right now no one argues with those numbers. That is this year. The \nPresident has already announced there will be deficits in every year of \nhis Presidency over the next 3. In fact, many suggest that deficits \nwill now continue for at least 10 years.\n  So here we are back where we were at the beginning of the 1990s, \nbuilding up that national debt with annual deficits. In the midst of \nall of that, 9-11, where we must now respond, as has been said so often \nby every Member of this Chamber, by the President and others, the world \nhas changed for us fundamentally. It will never be the same again \nbecause of what happened on that date.\n\n[[Page S5416]]\n\n  We are taking steps now, investing resources to make our country \nstronger, to see to it that we have better protections here at home and \nabroad. It is an expensive undertaking to do so. In the midst of this \nexpensive undertaking--while simultaneously we also want to invest in \nthe educational needs of our Nation, provide for prescription drug \nbenefits, do what we can to make sure Social Security and Medicare will \nbe there when people need them, invest in the transportation \ninfrastructure which is critically important, a farm bill which we were \ntold was absolutely essential, you go down the list of the things we \nknow we need to invest in to make this country strong and viable--along \ncomes a proposal that will take 3,500 estates in this country and allow \nthem to get a tax break at the expense of everyone else in America. And \nthe cost is roughly $99 billion in the first 10 years or so, and after \nthat, according to the estimates I have seen, $740 billion. Add the two \nand the price tag is in the $800 billion range. I find it interesting \nthat moments ago we had an opportunity to pass an amendment that would \nhave provided relief to small family farms and businesses for a price \ntag that is substantially less than a full repeal, and yet many of the \nSenators who argue that they would like to provide estate tax relief to \nfamilies and businesses voted no on the amendment.\n  I do not know how we can go home to our constituencies at a time like \nthis, when we are worried about whether or not we are going to have an \nintelligence agency, a domestic policing operation, and a \nreorganization of Government. We are debating in these very hours how \nwe are going to do that, knowing full well it will cost us dearly to do \nthat right--seeing that we have defense structures, seeing that first \nresponders have what they need, God forbid we have another tragedy like \nwe did on September 11. And in the face of all that, I have to explain \nwhy it is we are going to provide a total repeal of a proposal--offered \nby Teddy Roosevelt, by the way. This was not an idea that came out of \nFranklin Roosevelt, it came out of his cousin, Theodore Roosevelt, the \ngreat Republican Progressive President, who argued an estate tax was \nnot only a viable and intelligent revenue source but also had some \nsocial benefits.\n  I don't think it ought to go without mention that some of the \nwealthiest people in this country are arguing strongly against the \nGramm amendment, strongly against the total repeal. People such as \nWarren Buffett, one of the brightest financial minds in this country, \nargued strongly against this. John Kluge, who built one of the great \nfortunes in this country, who was a wonderful genius, argued against \nthis particular proposal. You go down the list. The Gates family argued \nagainst this proposal.\n  I have received five letters--five, out of 3.5 million people in my \nstate, some of the most affluent constituents who are represented in \nthis body at all--saying we ought to totally repeal the estate tax. \nEven the wealthiest people in this country, who would be the \nbeneficiaries of this, are asking us not to do this. This is fiscally \nunwise. It is going to cost us dearly.\n  I was elected to this body 21 years ago. I remember what it was like \nin the early 1980s. I remember what David Stockman said after he left \noffice. David Stockman, for those who have forgotten who he was, was \nthe Director of the Office of Management and Budget under Ronald \nReagan. He argued for significant tax cuts in the early 1980s. They \npassed, of course. We all know what economic havoc was caused during \nthe 1980s when we had mounting deficits and a national debt that almost \nquadrupled in the space of 10 years. David Stockman, to his credit, \nwrote a book called ``The Triumph Of Politics.'' I don't have it with \nme today, but I urge the younger generation to read it. Remember the \nadmonition, if you want to avoid repeating mistakes, read a little bit \nabout previous mistakes, study history. David Stockman recites chapter \nand verse about the mistakes made with a proposal we couldn't afford.\n\n  Pat Moynihan, then-chairman of the Finance Committee, argued for \nyears that what was done was basically to manufacture a deficit. I \nsuspect this is more about doing that than it is about providing tax \nrelief; more about manufacturing a deficit, regardless of the \nconsequences of that. Then, when people pay higher interest rates on \ntheir home mortgage rates, student loan rates, car payment rates, and \neverything else you can think of where an interest rate is involved, \nthen that is considered irrelevant. If we can build up enough of a \ndeficit, then we will not be able to invest in education, in health \ncare. Forget about arguing whether or not we ought to do it, we will \nnot be able to afford to do it.\n  I suspect that may be the motivation here and not providing a tax \nbreak for 980 of my constituents under the best of circumstances. I am \ntold there are actually 73 estates, when you get through with all the \nexemptions, 73 estates that would actually be affected by this \nproposal.\n  I join with those who urge our colleagues today that, if we are \nreorganizing our Government differently to respond to what has happened \nhere in the last year, if we have seen our surplus evaporate because of \nevents that have occurred, investments we have had to make, if we must \nthink differently about everything else we are doing, should we not \npause and think differently about this? We should take steps to protect \nthe family farms and small businesses from an estate tax that \noverreached, but just a few moments ago an amendment that would have \ndone that was defeated. But what we are talking about now are just a \nhandful of estates that would be asked to make contributions to our \nestate tax revenues. I urge Members to pause and think carefully here \nbefore committing our country to this kind of financial obligation, \nwhich we will spend years trying to recover from, in my view.\n  In the 1990s, of course, when we came up with a balanced budget \nproposal, there were those who predicted dire consequences. We saw a \nnation eliminate the national debt, eliminate the deficits. A lot of \npeople can claim responsibility for participating in that result: \ncertainly the private sector, the technology sector particularly; \ncertainly Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Chairman who managed the \nFederal Reserve Bank with such brilliance; certainly President Clinton \nfor being the Chief Executive Officer of the country and promoting a \nbalanced budget approach that carried the thinnest of margins in both \nthis Chamber and the other.\n  Nonetheless, we found ourselves with a financial footing that people \nonly dreamed about a decade earlier. What a great gift was given to \nthis new administration. In fact, the President himself talked about it \nwhen he gave his State of the Union Message. In his first State of the \nUnion Message, he spoke about why we are going to be doing the things \nwe can do, it was because we had accumulated a sufficient surplus in \nthis country. What a wonderful legacy it was going to be to invest in \nthe things we needed to do.\n  Now, because the recession lasted longer, because of 9-11, obviously, \nbecause of an unwise tax cut last year that went into place, we now \nfind ourselves in a situation where we are going to have deficits every \nyear of this administration's duration, and we are going to compound \nthat by taking $840 billion off the table over the next 20 years at a \ntime when we could be investing that money to make this a stronger and \nbetter country--just to take care of a small handful of people.\n  What I would like to know is why are we not here talking about a tax \ncut that would say to working families, if you are sending your kid to \ncollege you ought to get some breaks on doing that, to make it easier \nfor you to invest in your son's or daughter's educational future? Why \naren't we talking about some relief there? Why aren't we talking about \nsome relief from the FICA taxes for people? Here we are down here \nspending 6 hours debating whether or not 3,500 estates nationally, are \ngoing to get total repeal of an estate tax.\n  I think it is unwise. I don't think it is warranted at all.\n  I will end where I started. I am dumbfounded that this Chamber would \neven consider this proposal in light of the challenges, the risk, and \nthe dangers we face as a nation--that we would make this kind of a \njudgment at a time when we are going to need all the resources we can \nprovide for the well-being of our own people.\n\n[[Page S5417]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, while the Senator from Connecticut is here, \nlet me respond to the concern, or his expression that he is dumbfounded \nthat we would even be considering this amendment.\n  We passed this repeal already. I know the Senator from Connecticut \ndidn't vote for it but a majority of us did--Democrats and Republicans. \nIt passed in the House of Representatives, and the President signed it. \nThis is not something extraordinarily odd that we are doing. This has \nalready passed.\n  The problem, as the Senator knows, is that under the rule in which it \nwas considered, everything we did in the tax reform bill sunsets at the \nend of 10 years. As a result, the repeal of the estate tax comes in 10 \nyears. The question for those of us who helped pass this legislation--\nthe majority in the House and Senate, and the President--is, Did we \nreally mean to repeal the estate tax?\n  What I understand the Senator to be saying when he says he is \ndumbfounded is that at a time when he says we need the money, we would \nbe making permanent that which we intended to make permanent but \nwouldn't make it permanent before.\n  I suppose it is a legitimate question, if he is saying we should \nrevisit what we did before. I take it that is what he means. He just \nvoted, as did the Senator from Rhode Island, who spoke earlier, for an \namendment that costs more than the Gramm-Kyl amendment. The Dorgan \namendment, according to the Joint Tax Committee's calculation, costs \n$110 billion in the 10 years, which is substantially higher than the \nGramm-Kyl legislation.\n  I am a little confused about the point with respect to fiscal demand. \nThere are fiscal demands. The ones mentioned by the Senator from Rhode \nIsland--drug benefits, missile defense, and so on--are all in the Bush \nbudget. Those are things we are paying for; they are provided for in \nthe budget.\n  The budget was established on the basis that we had repealed the \nestate tax. The question was, Would it be made permanent? It is not as \nif great circumstances have changed. We do have the war on terror, that \nis true. I don't think any of us is going to deny that if we need to \nfund the war on terror, we will. We have already passed a supplemental \nappropriations bill to do exactly that.\n  It is odd to argue that the 1 percent of Federal revenues that are \ncollected by the estate tax are critical to the functioning of the U.S. \nGovernment in light of the trillions of dollars that we spend--that \nsomehow or other we can't get along without this so-called estate tax.\n  That is the real question. I think Senator Gramm was right earlier \nwhen he said what it really boils down to is a philosophical debate \nbetween those who do not want to allow people to keep their own money \nbut believe the Federal Government needs that money, on the one hand, \nand those of us who believe this is an unfair tax and the Federal \nGovernment can get along without the money.\n  There is another point. I have made it before. Most of us appreciate \nthe fact that when we cut taxes, in the long run it actually improves \nthe fiscal picture for the Government because more taxes are generated \nby a more vital economy. I cited yesterday the economists who made the \ncase that reducing taxes will allow more job creation, more capital \nformation, and a better economy. In fact, there would be about $40 \nbillion of growth in the economy if we were able to repeal the tax \ntoday.\n  The other point made was that very few estates pay the tax, that it \nis only for the rich.\n\n  This morning I read--and I will just briefly reiterate--who it is who \npays the tax. Estates don't pay the tax, people pay the tax. Who are \nthese people? This isn't the opinion of the Senator from Arizona, this \nis the IRS. They have the statistics on who actually pays.\n  In the most recent report entitled ``Statistics Of Income Bulletins, \nSummer of 1999''--pages 72-76, if you want to look it up--here is what \nthe IRS says. Here is who pays. It is divided between males and \nfemales. The largest group of filers of estate tax--27.7 percent--were \nmen, administrators, upper management, and business owners. You could \nassume that. But the second biggest group--12.3 percent of filers--were \nschoolteachers, librarians, and guidance counselors. These are these \nfilthy rich people from whom we have to take money--school guidance \ncounselors, schoolteachers, and librarians.\n  How about the female estate tax filers? The largest number--14.3 \npercent--were educators.\n  If I were a member of the teachers union, I would be down here \nsupporting the Gramm-Kyl amendment to make repeal of the death tax \npermanent because the largest group of women who file estate taxes are \neducators. These are the people who actually pay the estate tax. The \nfirst person who accumulated the wealth is dead. He hasn't paid the \nestate tax. His heirs paid the estate tax. Who are these people? Among \nwomen, the second largest group, of 9.6 percent, are in clerical and \nadministrative support occupations.\n  When you put it all together, here is what the IRS says: A \nsignificant number of estate tax filers were scientists. We really \nought to penalize those scientists. They do not do us any good. \nSalespeople, airline pilots, military officers, and mechanics. The last \ncategory I can understand--entertainers. Of course, we get a lot of \nmoney from entertainers. And we should. I don't know why they should be \npenalized any more than anyone else.\n  Scientists, sales people, airline pilots, military officers, \nmechanics, teachers, guidance counselors, and librarians are the people \nwho pay the estate tax.\n  Maybe their dad was fortunate in life to be able to work hard, save \nmoney, and accumulate some wealth. But their dad's dream probably was \nthat they would have a better opportunity in life than he did. He \nprobably sacrificed a lot to be able to leave them some money.\n  These are the people we are penalizing. We are not penalizing, by and \nlarge, some fat cat out on a yacht somewhere. According to the IRS, we \nare penalizing schoolteachers, airline pilots, and guidance counselors. \nThat is whom we are penalizing.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island made a point on which I really want to \nfocus. He was absolutely half right. Unrealized capital gains, the \nappreciation in value of an asset which is not taxed as income, because \nyou don't sell the property and, therefore, have to file an income tax \nreturn--you bought some stock, and over the years you keep it, and it \ngains in value, significantly unrealized capital gains. Until you sell \nit, you don't pay any tax.\n  Under the current law, a billionaire got rich by investing in some \nstock. He never sold any of it. It acquired great value. He dies. His \nwife inherits that. The way it works today is, because there is an \nexemption for spouses, she pays no estate tax on it. The next day, she \nsells it. Do you know what her capital gains tax is? Zero. Do you know \nwhy? Under current law, there is what we call a step-up in basis. That \nproperty acquires an original basis as if it were the day of death \nrather than 20 years ago when the dead person bought the asset. When it \nis sold, there is no gain because the value begins with this much \nhigher value--the stepped-up basis. If you sell it the next day, there \nis essentially a 1-day gain on it. In other words, there is virtually \nno capital gains tax. That is the current law.\n  That is what opponents are defending. That is why I say the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island was right. This is wrong. But does the proposal of \nthe Senator from North Dakota, which we will vote on next, do anything \nabout that? No. Does the existing law, if we don't make it permanent, \ndo anything about that? No. It is the Gramm-Kyl amendment that fixes \nthat problem.\n  This is what isn't understood by many of our colleagues. We don't \nsimply repeal the death tax. We substitute for the death tax the \ncapital gains tax. And we eliminate the step-up in basis, except for an \namount which would be equivalent to the exemption today, which is about \n$5.6 million. Nobody would pay a capital gains tax who would also be \nexempt from the estate tax.\n  But except for that amount of stepped-up basis, there is no step-up \nin basis. If the person who died and bought the stock years ago bought \nit for, let us say, $1,000, that is the original basis. Let us say it \nis now worth $1 billion. All right. Subtract $1,000 from\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n\n$1 billion, and that is the gain. That is on what they pay the capital \ngains tax. This is the proper way to tax unrealized capital gains. That \nis why our proposal really does not cost that much more, if you \ncalculate it properly, than the existing law.\n\n  When you eliminate the death tax and replace it with a capital gains \ntax, you have substituted good tax policy for the current bad tax \npolicy.\n  Death should not be a taxable event. We do not plan on that. We do \nnot like that. It is not something that we cause to happen. It is like \nhaving your house burn down and collecting an insurance payment. We \ndon't treat that as ordinary income because we realize you did not want \nyour house to burn down. Even though you got an insurance payment for \nit, you should not have to pay that tax on that as ordinary income.\n  It should be the same with what your father leaves you when he dies. \nYou should not pay a death tax on that. What you should do is, when you \nsell that property, pay a capital gains tax on it, going back to its \noriginal value. That is how you tax unrealized capital gains.\n  Now, just two final points.\n  The Senator from Connecticut said only a small percentage of people \nare affected. That is not really true. There is truly a very large \npercentage of people affected, even though the number of people who \nactually pay the estate tax is relatively small.\n  Let's take the average small business. I don't know what the size of \nthe average small business is, but let's say it employs 50 people, just \nto use a number. Let's say you have an average family of four, plus \nother indirect beneficiaries, and so on. So instead of saying one \nperson pays the estate tax, it affects all of the members of the \nfamily, and it affects all of the people in the business. There are \ntwice as many people adversely affected as to who actually pays the \ntax. And in addition to the tax collected by the Government, an almost \nequal amount of money is paid by people to lawyers and accountants and \nfor insurance to try to minimize their estate tax liability. So it is \nactually twice as much as people believe it is.\n  I wonder. The bill that we considered before this bill had to do with \nhate crimes. Proponents of changing the hate crimes law acknowledged it \naffected a very few number of people. But the effect on them was \nsignificant, they said, and it was unfair that they would be treated as \nthey were treated and, therefore, we needed to do something about this. \nIn other words, this is a minority of people who are treated unfairly, \nand we need to have the Federal Government step in and do something \nabout that.\n  So, on the one hand, my colleagues on the Democratic side of the \naisle are very concerned about a very small number of people, but when \nwe bring to the floor the question of the death tax and its unfairness: \nOh, we don't need to worry about that; that only affects a few people. \nWell, when something is unfair, and seriously wrong, it doesn't matter \nhow many people it affects; we need to do something about it.\n  The interesting thing to me is that 60 percent--this is a Gallup \npoll, and there are some polls that go up to 80 percent--at least 60 \npercent of the American people agree the death tax should be repealed--\nnot reduced, not have the exclusions made larger, but should be \nrepealed. And the interesting thing to me about that number is two-\nthirds of those people believe it should be repealed even though it \nwill never have any affect on them.\n  In other words, they recognize it is not a large percentage of people \nwho are adversely affected by the death tax directly, but they \nrecognize it is unfair.\n\n  To me, that says more about the American people than just about \nanything I can think of, when they say: Even though you have more \nwealth than I do, it is not fair for the Government to take half of it \nfrom your kids when you die. Therefore, even though it doesn't help me \nany, I am going to stand up for your right to be treated fairly. And I \nsupport the permanent repeal of the death tax.\n  To me, that is a very good indication of the fact that the American \npeople have a sense of fairness. And even though they are not directly \nbenefitted by something, they are willing to support the elimination of \nthat unfairness.\n  Final point. The suggestion we have already taken care of the small \nbusinesses and family farmers and, therefore, we don't need to \npermanently repeal the death tax. We have been through that in debate \nearlier today. We have not taken care of the small businesses and \nfamily farmers. Unfortunately, as I said, something like two one-\nhundredths of 1 percent of taxpayers have ever qualified for the \nexclusion that would take care of them under this provision. And even \nthen, the IRS is going to come after you. And the IRS wins two-thirds \nof the cases that are brought. It is not a fact that small businesses \nand farms have been taken care of and excluded from the impact of the \nestate tax.\n  So who pays? Average Americans because the wealthier person, \nremember, died. And the question is, Is it fair to make them pay?\n  Do we need the money? The things that have been discussed are in the \nbudget. We can always find more things to spend money on. The question \nis, Should you leave money in the hands of Americans who can build our \neconomy, create jobs and wealth, or should we make the decisions for \nthem by spending the money here in the Government?\n  I think it boils down to that, and when we have this vote, we are \ngoing to be asking one simple question: For those who voted for the \nbill last year to repeal the estate tax, did they mean it or not? If \nthey meant what they said, they will vote for the Gramm-Kyl amendment, \nwhich is the real repeal. It makes the repeal of 1 year into a \npermanent repeal. That is what the American taxpayers and American \npeople thought we did. It is what we intended to do. And today it is \nwhat we can do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Gramm-Kyl amendment.\n  I now yield 5 minutes to my colleague from the State of Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Arizona \nfor his outstanding leadership on this issue. And he has been the \nleader on this.\n  I was struck by one statement the Senator from Arizona made in which \nhe said the American people, according to all the polls--and we all \nknow this--overwhelmingly support the elimination of the death tax, \neven though most of them realize they will never be impacted by it. It \ndoes say a lot about the American people. It also says an awful lot \nabout the unfairness of this tax; that is, the underlying tax.\n  That is the basic issue at stake in the debate we are having. Is this \nthe way we want to tax or not? It is not about whether or not we are \ngoing to lose money for the Federal Treasury or not. We may or may not. \nIt is not about whether we can reduce the number of people impacted by \nthis unfair tax by expanding exclusions and lowering rates.\n  It is fundamentally about, Is this the right kind of tax to impose on \nthe American people? The American people realize and recognize it is \nunfair for a person, a small businessperson, a farmer, for any American \nto work decade after decade, saving and investing, making decisions \nthat reward their family, building something for the future, building \nsomething for future generations--someone, a businessman, a farmer, an \nindividual paying property taxes, paying sales taxes, paying income \ntaxes, year after year, and decade after decade--and then, at the point \nof death, at the event of death, you see the Federal Government reach \ninto the grave and take half of everything that person worked for. I \nthink the American people, rightly, have concluded that is unfair.\n  As the Senator from Arizona also pointed out, the decision about the \nunfairness and about the need to eliminate this tax was already made. \nIt was made by this body. It was made by the House. It was made by the \nPresident over a year ago--a year ago June 7. The decision was: It is \nunfair. Let's repeal it. Let's eliminate it.\n  Because of arcane Senate rules, it could not be permanently \neliminated. We could not do that last year. But we can do that now. The \ndecision then that it was the right thing to do to eliminate it--that \nwas made last year--we need now to say we really meant that.\n  It has already been very rightly pointed out that this is not a tax \nthat\n\n[[Page S5419]]\n\naffects only a few. It is not just a few fat cats we are talking about. \nWe are talking about literally millions of Americans.\n  According to the Treasury Department, more than 120,000 individuals \nfiled death tax returns in the year 2000 alone. But that does not tell \nnear the story because not only are there employees and family members \nwho are impacted, but it is also the case that about twice as many \npeople sell their businesses or sell their property early, before they \ndie, so the death tax is not going to be a burden on their family. So \ninstead of 120,000 individuals, you literally have doubled that, and \nsuddenly you are talking about half a million people, plus their \nfamilies and their employees who are impacted. This is not a tax that \njust touches a few people.\n  In addition, even more Americans are forced to pay this tax, not to \nthe Federal Government, but to lawyers, to accountants, and to life \ninsurance agents. Privately held businesses get involved in estate \nplanning because if they don't, all they have worked for will be \neliminated. To ignore the death tax statute is suicide for a family \nbusiness.\n  Frankly, while the death tax is a terribly ineffective way to \nredistribute wealth, it is a very effective way to create and maintain \nan industry geared at avoidance.\n  This tax generates very little real income for the Federal Treasury. \nMy colleague has already pointed out that the Gramm-Kyl amendment, \nbecause of the way it handles untaxed capital gains and the way it \nchanges the step-up provisions in current law, any impact upon Federal \nrevenues will be far more minimal than that which has been estimated.\n  In addition, the death tax is a very inefficient way of gaining \nFederal revenue, for 65 cents of every dollar gained is paid out in \ncollection enforcement costs. Other studies have found not only are \nthousands of dollars going to attorneys and accountants and financial \nagents, but the average minority-owned business will spend nearly \n$28,000 a year on life insurance premiums to prepare for the death tax, \nand $9,000 on death tax planning.\n  Frankly, the 1.5 percent of Federal income that currently is \ngenerated by the death tax is so small that it would, to a great \nextent, offset the cost of administering and collecting and enforcing \nthe tax.\n  Beyond all of that, I return to the point with which I began. There \nare the practicalities that it generates little income, and a whole \navoidance industry has developed because of the estate tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I yield the Senator 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Beyond the practicalities, the underlying issue is, \nis it fair? Is it right? A bigger exemption does not solve the basic \nunfairness. A greater exclusion, lowering rates, none of that really \ndeals with the underlying issue. It is an unfair tax. It taxes success. \nIt taxes accomplishment. It taxes that which is the American dream. For \nthat reason, we need to get rid of it.\n  We don't need a mirage for the American people. We need it to be \nreal. We can make it real by supporting the Gramm-Kyl amendment.\n  I thank my colleague for the time and the opportunity to speak in \nfavor of his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I have a great deal of respect for my \ncolleagues who are arguing this point with extraordinary vigor and \nzeal. I have no doubt they absolutely believe that the wealth tax is \nwrong and should be abolished.\n  We ought to take a step back and put this debate into a bit of a \nreality check again, since there has been a lot said on the floor which \nmay be good argument points, good advocacy positions, but is not \nnecessarily connected to the reality that we face today as we are about \nto vote on this decision.\n  I don't usually come to the floor and quote the Wall Street Journal, \nbut I will today because if one were to look for a source that probably \nviews this issue more favorably to the position of my colleagues, they \nprobably couldn't find a publication that would be more inclined to \nsupport it. Certainly the editorial pages have done so, and there are \ncolumnists and others who make the argument.\n  I will enter into the Record a column that was written by one of the \nWall Street Journal's leading writers, a gentleman by the name of Alan \nMurray, no friend of taxation, who wrote an article, dated May 28, \n2002, entitled ``Senate Needs Reality Check Before Refunding Estate \nTax.''\n  If one reads this, they will get a better context than the sort of \ndisembodied one that occurs on the floor of the Senate where \nabstractions and generalities can be made for the sake of argument \nwithout really looking at what it is we are being asked to vote on.\n  Mr. Murray starts by saying:\n\n       Marie Antoinette had nothing over the U.S. Senate. In its \n     rush to permanently eliminate the estate tax, the nation's \n     ``deliberative body'' has apparently forgotten to deliberate \n     on the surging social trends of our time.\n\n  Mr. Murray goes on to make the following point:\n\n       The last two decades have led to a concentration of wealth \n     and income among the fortunate few in this country that \n     hasn't been seen since the gilded age.\n\n  When was the estate tax first proposed and who proposed it? President \nTheodore Roosevelt, himself a product of the gilded age, who understood \nintuitively that our country, founded on principles of equality, could \nnot afford to see vast disparities in wealth occur. Therefore, \nPresident Roosevelt, a Republican, proposed the estate tax, because he \nrecognized the threat that greater and greater accumulation of wealth \nthat separated the few from the many posed to our Nation.\n  Mr. Murray goes on to say that ``the 10 most highly compensated \ncorporate chief executives earned a total of $3.5 million in 1981,'' 21 \nyears ago. You take the 10 top CEOs in America. Were they doing a good \njob in 1981? They were doing a good job. But now 21 years later, the 10 \nmost highly compensated CEOs in our country make $155 million, almost \n45 times the 1981 figure. Are they doing a job 45 times better than \nthey did 20 years ago? The argument would be hard to make.\n  Secondly, we are currently in a situation where our market, the \nengine of economic growth, has been shaken by revelations about the \nbehavior and conduct among these same highly paid corporate executives. \nWe know, just to take one example, Mr. Skilling, the former CEO of \nEnron, would benefit to the tune of $55 million if the estate tax were \nrepealed. How would that be paid for because the money is not fungible? \nIf you do away with the estate tax, then you will have to eliminate or \ncut something. There are a lot of things that probably could be looked \nat to be cut. How about the Social Security tax payments of Americans? \nIt would take 30,000 Americans earning $30,000 a year, paying their \ntaxes, to make up for the $55 million that Mr. Skilling would \nbenefit. I don't think that passes the fairness test. I don't think \nthat is really the kind of choice we should be making in this body.\n\n  Third, as Mr. Murray points out, every single day we are told our \nNation is at war. I believe that. I represent New York. We were \nattacked when America was attacked. I have spent more time than I ever \nwish to recall working and being with the victims of that horrific \nattack.\n  In the past, whenever our country has been at war, we have been \ncalled upon to sacrifice. Particularly, the affluent have been called \nupon to sacrifice because, as Theodore Roosevelt pointed out, you are \nso fortunate to live in America; there is not a place better devised in \nthe entire history of the world to be successful, to become rich. And \nthe rich, God bless all of us, they actually take more advantage of our \nsystem than anybody else. They are really lucky, fortunate, blessed to \nbe in this country.\n  The inheritance tax was created to finance the wars of the 19th \ncentury. The notion of repealing it, when we are under constant threat, \nwhen we have to spend billions of dollars to protect ourselves in ways \nwe never had to think about before, strikes me as bizarre. We have \nvoted on the floor of the Senate\n\n[[Page S5420]]\n\nfor billions of dollars to protect our borders, our ports, our \nairports, our food, to be prepared against bioterrorism. I went to the \nWhite House this morning for the President's signing of the \nbioterrorism bill. It costs money to get the vaccines and do everything \nwe need to do to protect ourselves and our children.\n  The idea that, instead of calling upon the most fortunate among us, \nwe would at this point in our Nation's history, rather than reform, \nrepeal the estate tax flies in the face of what we have historically \ndone. Why aren't we on the floor of the Senate asking that we close the \nloophole for the corporations that take advantage of the good times of \nbeing in our Nation and move their headquarters offshore so they don't \nhave to pay any taxes? Unlike everybody else who works for a living, \nthey want to avoid taxation. Yet they are more than happy to take \nadvantage of our country's protection, security, and markets.\n  What is wrong with this picture? Well, I agreed with Mr. Murray that \nwe have to look at this and inject some reality into it. I have not \neven gotten to the budget deficit. Last year we had a budget surplus, \nand I listened to the debate and, honest to goodness, you can take \ntranscripts from 1981 and put them right next to transcripts from 2002; \nit is the same rhetoric: slash the taxes and you will see more revenues \ncoming in. That is what we were told in 1981. And in 12 years we \nquadrupled the debt of our Nation. Last year we were told again to \nslash taxes and we will have even greater surpluses. Now we are back \ninto deficits, we are spending the Social Security surplus, and we are \nspending the Medicare trust fund surplus.\n  It is pretty hard to explain how we are in debt and in deficit and we \nwant to make it even worse, which of course shifts the burden not on \nthe rich but on everybody else. If we were going to be talking about \nrepealing taxes, there are taxes that affect far more Americans and \nreally have an impact on the kind of lives that Americans lead. We \ncould make the expanded childcare tax credit permanent. We could make \nthe new 10-percent tax bracket permanent. We could pass the college \ntuition tax deductibility, which would be a huge benefit for most \nAmericans--particularly middle-income Americans.\n  Instead, we are debating the wealth tax. It is hard to understand why \nwe are having this debate, except, with all due respect, my colleagues \nbelieve it is absolutely the most important issue we can be discussing \nat this time.\n  Now, to be sure, the uncertainty posed by the tax cuts that were \npassed last year is a problem. But the reason they were passed in the \nform that they were passed is because the numbers would not work any \nother way and we were hoping to defy the laws of arithmetic.\n  Many of us believe that raising the taxable limit is a good idea. We \nbelieve that reform is significantly possible without repeal. \nResponsible, affordable reform could save money, as well as continue \nboth the principle and reality of providing a check on the kind of \nestates that Theodore Roosevelt and his relative Franklin Roosevelt \nwarned us about.\n  If one looks at all of the issues that we are confronting right now, \nI just hope we are going to take a deep breath and stop and say: \nCircumstances have changed since last spring. We don't have a surplus \nanymore. We are back into deficits. We are bleeding red ink. We have \nbeen attacked on our own shores. We have to fund our defense. We have \nto make sure our men and women in uniform, who are fighting for us in \nAfghanistan and elsewhere, are given every single piece of equipment \nand new technology that they deserve. We have to make sure our \nfrontline soldiers, our police officers, our firefighters, the first \nresponders, get the resources they need.\n  And then we have longer term issues. We have all kinds of \ninfrastructure problems we have to deal with that an individual cannot \npay for on his or her own. We have to make sure our bridges and tunnels \nare safe.\n  In a few weeks, we are going to debate what to do with nuclear waste. \nThere is going to be a big issue about the safety of transporting it on \nour barges, along our waterways, on our railcars, and on our trucks. I \nam getting letters from rural parts of my State saying their bridges \nare not in good shape. So how can we do that?\n  In our cities, our sewer systems and our wastewater treatment systems \nare not up to the kind of standards they should for ordinary treatment \nof waste and the provision of clean water, and now we have to worry \nabout terrorism. So there is a list of pressing needs that will make us \nsafer and stronger in the future. Repealing the estate tax is not on \nthat list.\n  Let me also say a few words about who it actually affects. I know my \ncolleague from Connecticut was on the floor because he looked at the \nsame statistics that are available to all of us. As he pointed out, he \nhas 73 filers who were affected by the estate tax. We hear a lot about \nwhat happens to family farms, and I looked for any evidence I could \nfind, and I know the Farm Bureau was asked to provide such evidence of \nany farm, anywhere, that had been lost because of estate taxes.\n  Neil Harl, an Iowa State University economist, conducted that search \nand is quoted in an article in the New York Times last year. He said it \nis a myth. Since most farms in New York are worth less than a million \ndollars, even under the current law they are not going to have to pay \nestate taxes; and when we reform it and raise the limits, they \ncertainly are not going to do so.\n  I talked to one farmer and he said: I dream for the chance to have a \nfarm worth enough that anybody would think I had to pay the estate tax.\n  There is a lot of mythology and ideology that is being discussed in \nterms of the repeal of the estate tax, but I guess it really does come \ndown to what are our priorities. If our priority is eliminating \nbillions of dollars of tax obligations from the very richest people, \nthen this is the vote for us. But if it is to protect our Nation's \nfiscal condition and get back on a path of fiscal responsibility, get \nback to where we are paying down our debt, not increasing the debt \nlimit as was voted for yesterday, getting out of deficits, putting the \nmoney back into the Social Security trust fund, making sure we are \nprepared for the retirement of the baby boomers, dealing with health \ncare, prescription drug benefits, the needs that both underinsured and \nuninsured people face to ensure they have health care when they need \nit, paying for that prescription drug benefit we promised our seniors, \nmaking sure we continue to fund our education policy so that we have \nthe qualified teachers in every classroom, we have the equipment and \nthe resources that every schoolchild deserves to have, then this vote \nis not for us.\n  There are a lot of priorities at which we have to be looking. \nRepealing the estate tax would cost about $100 billion this decade, but \nin the next decade when people like me are starting to retire, then we \nare looking at a cost of $740 billion. It is hard to imagine from where \nthe money to provide for Social Security and Medicare will come.\n  The Jeff Skillings of the world and the other corporate executives \nwho have a lot of money to start with--much more than any limit on the \nestate tax that we could imagine--why, they would be laughing all the \nway to the bank.\n  I know a lot of Americans think they fall under the estate tax, and I \ngive credit to the repealers who have turned Teddy Roosevelt on his \nhead, have ignored the manifesto signed by several hundred of our \nwealthiest Americans, people such as William Gates, David Rockefeller, \nGeorge Soros. They all said: Don't repeal it; reform it, but don't \nrepeal it; it is bad for our country. I heard Warren Buffett, one of \nAmerica's richest businessmen, say: It is bad for my family. I had to \ngo out and earn my money the old-fashioned way. I do not want the kind \nof idle rich that has never been part of the American scene. That is \nsomething we did not want to have, and we turned away from it.\n  The truth is, we do not have a death tax in America. There is no such \nthing as a death tax. People do not pay taxes at death. We have an \nestate tax, which is really a wealth tax that is based on people having \na certain level of assets.\n  Currently, it is $1 million. Many of us want to increase it \nsignificantly. At the present time, it affects less than 2 percent of \nthe estates in our country. If we raised it to $3 million for an \nindividual and $6 million for a couple and then in 2009 took it to $3.5 \nmillion for\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\nan individual and $7 million for a couple, we would have three-tenths \nof 1 percent of estates subjected to any tax.\n  I also support setting a maximum rate of 50 percent. Then we really \nwould be aiming at the Gateses and the Soroses and the Rockefellers and \nthe people who have inherited a lot of wealth with an estate tax, and \nthey still would have tens of millions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to speak. I \nask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal and New York Times \narticles to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 28, 2002]\n\n         Senate Needs Reality Check Before Refunding Estate Tax\n\n                            (By Alan Murray)\n\n       Marie Antoinette had nothing over the U.S. Senate. In its \n     rush to permanently eliminate the estate tax, the nation's \n     ``deliberative body'' has apparently forgotten to deliberate \n     on the surging social trends of our time.\n       So let me provide a refresher course:\n       (1) The past two decades have led to a concentration of \n     wealth and income among the fortunate few in this country \n     that hasn't been seen since the gilded age. Kevin Phillips, \n     whose new book ``Wealth and Democracy'' puts all this in a \n     historical context that should chill the spines of senators \n     preparing to vote ``yes,'' notes that the top 10 most highly \n     compensated corporate chief executives earned a total of $3.5 \n     million in 1981. That rose to $155 million in 2001--almost 45 \n     times the 1981 figure.\n       (2) The nation is now experiencing a crisis of confidence \n     in these same highly paid corporate executives. Americans \n     tolerated sky-high CEO pay because they thought it reflected \n     the market value of talented managers--just as Michael \n     Jordan's pay reflected his draw at the box office. But \n     recently, the public has gotten graphic evidence that, in \n     some cases at least, CEO compensation had more to do with \n     greed, deception and even downright fraud. The proliferation \n     of stock options, which accounts for most of the huge \n     increase, was supposed to align the interests of corporate \n     managers with those of the shareholders. It did, it seems, \n     but in the wrong direction. Instead of working to make \n     shareholders rich, some executives were manipulating their \n     shareholders in order to make themselves rich.\n       (3) The nation is at war. And in this country, wars always \n     have been times of sacrifice, particularly among the \n     affluent. The inheritance tax was created to finance the \n     wars of the 19th century. The notion of singling it out \n     for elimination in the midst of the current effort goes \n     against more than 150 years of American history.\n       Notice that I haven't mentioned the budget deficit. That's \n     because on this score, at least, the Senate deserves some \n     credit. They are talking about singling out the estate tax, \n     at a cost of $99 billion from 2002 to 2012, in order to avoid \n     the whopping $373 billion price tag of the House bill that \n     would make all the provision in the president's tax cut \n     permanent.\n       But in making this choice, the Senate should justify it. \n     Why deepen the deficit to pay for permanent repeal of the \n     estate tax, if you aren't willing to pay for permanent repeal \n     of marriage tax relief ($16 billion), a permanent extension \n     of the new 10% tax bracket ($79 billion), an expanded child \n     tax credit ($35 billion), or various forms of assistance to \n     people trying to pay the high cost of higher education ($5 \n     billion)? All those tax cuts go to ordinary Americans \n     struggling to raise families and educate their kids.\n       The Senate's answer? Let them eat cake.\n       This is not a partisan matter. If estate-tax repeal didn't \n     have substantial support among Democratic Senators, it \n     wouldn't have a chance, given the need for 60 votes to \n     overcome a filibuster. There are already eight or nine \n     Democrats, including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max \n     Baucus, who have indicated their support. Estate-tax lobbying \n     groups are working fervently over the holiday to win a few \n     more.\n       Also, this isn't an ideological matter. The House \n     Republicans are the ideologues; they'll vote for any tax cut \n     that comes down the pike. Senators, in their pragmatism, bear \n     the burden of explaining why they have chosen this tax cut \n     above all others.\n       To be sure, the estate tax cut enacted by Congress last \n     year is, in its current form, an atrocity. It would repeal \n     the tax for one year at the end of the decade, and then, to \n     satisfy Senate budget rules, reinstate it in 2011. This would \n     lead to some ghoulish estate planning, creating an incentive \n     for heirs to keep dad alive until 2010, and then pull the \n     plug by New Year's Eve.\n       But that is hardly a good argument for permanent repeal. \n     Nor is the oft-heard refrain that this helps farmers and \n     small-business people who want to keep their enterprises in \n     the family. Those folks account for less than 10% of total \n     estate-tax revenue, and could be accommodated with measures \n     falling far short of total repeal.\n       The only good news here is that Senate Majority Leader Tom \n     Daschle still has a good chance of holding enough of the \n     Democrats to keep the measure from getting 60 votes. If he \n     succeeds, he'll be accused, again, of obstructionism. But \n     this time, he'll be saving Senators of both parties from \n     excessive catering to big campaign contributors, and from \n     putting themselves squarely on the wrong side of history.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n               Focus on Farms Masks Estates Tax Confusion\n\n                        (By David Cay Johnston)\n\n       Wellsburg, Iowa.--Harlyn Riekena worried that his success \n     would cost him when he died. Thirty-seven years ago he quit \n     teaching to farm and over the years bought more and more of \n     the rich black soil here in central Iowa. Now he and his \n     wife, Karen, own 950 gently rolling acres planted in soybeans \n     and corn.\n       The farmland alone is worth more than $2.5 million, and so \n     Mr. Riekena, 61, fretted that estate taxes would take a big \n     chunk of his three grown daughters' inheritance.\n       That might seem a reasonable assumption, what with all the \n     talk in Washington about the need to repeal the estate tax to \n     save the family farm. ``To keep farms in the family, we are \n     going to get rid of the death tax,'' President Bush vowed a \n     month ago; he and many others have made the point repeatedly.\n       But in fact the Riekenas will owe nothing in estate taxes. \n     Almost no working farmers do, according to data from an \n     Internal Revenue Service analysis of 1999 returns that has \n     not yet been published.\n       Neil Harl, an Iowa State University economist whose tax \n     advice has made him a household name among Midwest farmers, \n     said he had searched far and wide but had never found a farm \n     lost because of estate taxes. ``It's a myth,'' he said.\n       Even one of the leading advocates for repeal of estate \n     taxes, the American Farm Bureau Federation, said it could not \n     cite a single example of a farm lost because of estate taxes.\n       The estate tax does, of course, have a bite. But the \n     reality of that bite is different from the mythology, in \n     which family farmers have become icons for the campaign to \n     abolish the tax. In fact, the overwhelming majority of \n     beneficiaries are the heirs of people who made their \n     fortunes through their businesses and investments in \n     securities and real estate.\n       The effort to end the estate tax--which critics call the \n     death tax--gained ground when the House of Representatives \n     voted Wednesday to reduce the tax and then abolish it in \n     2011. The bill faces an uncertain fate in the Senate.\n       The estate tax is central in the debate over taxes, not \n     only because the sums involved are huge but also because to \n     both sides it is a touchstone of national values. To those \n     seeking to abolish it, the estate tax is a penalty for \n     success, an abomination that blocks the deeply human desire \n     to leave a life's work as a legacy for the children. It is \n     also a complicated burden that enriches the lawyers, \n     accountants and life insurance companies that help people \n     reduce their tax bills.\n       To its supporters, on the other hand, the estate tax is a \n     symbol of American equality, a mechanism to democratize \n     society and to encourage economic success based on merit \n     rather than birthright.\n       Yet for all the passion in the debate, the estate tax does \n     not always seem broadly understood.\n       While 17 percent of Americans in a recent Gallup survey \n     think they will owe estate taxes, in fact only the richest 2 \n     percent of Americans do. That amounted to 49,870 Americans in \n     1999. And nearly half the estate tax is paid by the 3,000 or \n     so people who each year leave taxable estates of more than $5 \n     million.\n       In fact, the primary beneficiaries of the move to abolish \n     the estate tax look less like the Riekenas and more like \n     Frank A. Blethen, a Seattle newspaper publisher whose family \n     owns eight newspapers worth perhaps a billion dollars.\n       ``Being ever bloodthirsty, the I.R.S. will start with the \n     highest value it can on my estate,'' said Mr. Blethen, the \n     55-year-old patriarch of the publishing family. The figures \n     for his share will probably be several hundred million \n     dollars, more than half of which would go to the government. \n     Mr. Blethen is trying to avoid almost all those taxes through \n     a plan also used by other wealthy families, but if he does \n     not succeed his sons' interest in the business will be wiped \n     out, he said.\n       Estate taxes are paid by few Americans because they are not \n     assessed on the first $1.35 million of net worth left by a \n     couple. Amounts above this are taxed at rates that begin at \n     43 percent and rise to 55 percent on amounts greater than $3 \n     million. As the Riekenas and the Blethens have learned, there \n     are many legal ways to reduce the value of one's wealth for \n     estate tax purposes. So even for the largest estates, the tax \n     averages 25 percent.\n       Family farmers are often cited as victims. As Senator \n     Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa hog farmer and chairman of the \n     Senate Finance Committee, put it, ``The product of a life's \n     work leaches away like seeds in poor soil.''\n       Yet tax return data show that very few farmers pay estate \n     taxes. Only 6,216 taxable estates in 1999 included any \n     agricultural land and equipment, the I.R.S. report shows. The \n     average value of these farm assets was $440,000, only about a \n     third of the amount that any married couple could \n     leave untaxed to heirs. What is more, a farm couple can \n     pass $4.1 million untaxed, so long as the heirs continue \n     farming for 10 years.\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\n       In Iowa, the average farm has a net worth of $1.2 million. \n     Loyd A. Brown, president of Hertz Farm Management in Iowa, \n     which runs more than 400 farms in 10 states, said that while \n     he didn't know of anyone who had lost a farm because of the \n     estate tax, he thought Congress should either eliminate the \n     tax or increase the amount that could be inherited untaxed.\n       Just 1,222 estates in 1999 had enough in farm assets to \n     make the farm property alone subject to estate taxes. But \n     these farm assets amounted to one-tenth of these estates, \n     suggesting that the tax applies mostly to gentleman farmers \n     and ranchers, rather than to working farmers like the \n     Riekenas, whose fortunes are tied up in their farms.\n       As the Riekenas were surprised to discover, avoiding the \n     estate tax was easy. Their lawyer developed a simple plan \n     that involved making gifts to their daughters and buying life \n     insurance to offset any estate taxes that might be due if the \n     parents died before most of the farm had been turned over to \n     their daughters.\n       There is a real cost, of course--payments to the lawyer and \n     for the insurance. And in any case the paucity of affected \n     farmers does not end the debate. Patricia A. Wolff, the Farm \n     Bureau's chief lobbyist, said the organization made estate \n     tax repeal its top priority because, while it has not \n     surveyed its members, she was confident ``the majority of \n     farmers and ranchers believe that death taxes are wrong and \n     that it is wrong to tax people twice on what they earn.''\n       But Mr. Riekena and all two dozen other farmers interviewed \n     across central Iowa--every one a Republican--said that while \n     they favored increasing the amount that could be passed to \n     heirs untaxed, they did not support the repeal proposed by \n     President Bush and other leaders of his party. A few \n     snickered or laughed when asked whether the estate tax should \n     be repealed to save the family farm.\n       But Senator Grassley himself opposes the estate tax, in \n     large part because he thinks that while a decision to keep or \n     sell an asset is an appropriate trigger for a tax, death \n     should not be.\n       He added another reason: ``I do not think that the function \n     of government is to redistribute wealth.''\n       Indeed, that seems to be the fault line in the debate: \n     should the government play Robin Hood with estates?\n       ``If you worked hard and put your money away, you paid tax \n     on it as you went along, so it's yours and you should be able \n     to pass it on to your children without the government \n     penalizing you,'' said R. Elaine Gunland, who grows grapes in \n     Fresno, Calif., and whose family may owe estate taxes when \n     she dies.\n       Mr. Blethen, the fourth-generation publisher of a newspaper \n     started in 1896 with $3,000, says he speaks for many others \n     in supporting repeal of the tax in the name of preserving \n     family businesses.\n       ``I firmly believe that family-owned businesses are the \n     heart and soul of the country,'' said Mr. Blethen, who has \n     created a Web site called deathtax.com.\n       Mr. Blethen says the estate tax benefits publicly traded \n     companies at the expense of family-owned businesses. The \n     reason is that the public companies can often buy family \n     businesses at a discount because the owners did not raise the \n     cash to pay estate taxes and must sell quickly at fire sale \n     prices.\n       Mr. Blethen said some of the seven smaller papers his \n     family bought in Washington and Maine came from families that \n     had not planned carefully for the estate tax and decided it \n     was easier to cash out.\n       ``If you like corporate culture, and think America needs \n     more of it, then you love the estate tax,'' Mr. Blethen said. \n     ``I think this march toward corporatism is not healthy and we \n     lost innovation, jobs and charitable giving.''\n       Mr. Blethen said the estate tax also discouraged major new \n     investments in family businesses late in the life of the \n     primary owner because such investments consumed cash that \n     might be needed at any time to pay estate taxes.\n       He said the estate tax also ``forces you into irresponsible \n     gift making'' to heirs. He felt compelled to give half the \n     future growth of his fortune to his two sons when they were \n     not yet kindergartners even though he had no way of telling \n     whether the boys would turn out to be industrious, as they \n     did, or scalawags.\n       Despite his fierce opposition to the estate tax, Mr. \n     Blethen does not support President Bush's current plan to \n     repeal the tax because it would also exempt from capital \n     gains taxes the profits on assets passed to heirs when those \n     assets are sold. ``That's not fair,'' Mr. Blethen said.\n       He said Mr. Bush's proposal would have the perverse effect \n     of encouraging the sale of family-owned businesses, because \n     heirs would see death as their chance to sell tax-free and to \n     diversify their portfolios, instead of continuing to bear the \n     risks of holding a single enterprise.\n       Mr. Blethen thinks that rather than taxing an estate, taxes \n     should apply when a business is sold. ``YOu want to defer \n     those capital gains and let them grow so large that the \n     family will keep the business to avoid the capital gains \n     taxes,'' he said.\n       The debate does not divide neatly among rich and poor. \n     Since February more than 800 wealthy Americans have joined in \n     a public appeal to keep the estate tax. They argue that \n     repealing the tax would further enrich the wealthiest \n     Americans and hurt struggling families. They also argue that \n     financial success should be based on merit rather than on \n     inheritance.\n       Warren E. Buffett, George Soros, Paul Newman and William H. \n     Gates Sr., father of Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates \n     III, are among the most prominent in that group, which also \n     includes many people with holdings of just a million dollars.\n       Mr. Buffett said the estate tax fosters economic growth by \n     encouraging Americans to rise based on merit, not \n     inheritance. ``If you take the C.E.O.'s of the Fortune 500,'' \n     he said in an interview, ``and put in the eldest son of every \n     one of those who ran the place in 1975, the American economy \n     would not run as well as letting the Jack Welches, who \n     started out with nothing, rise to the top of General \n     Electric.''\n       Back in central Iowa, Mr. Riekena had another reason. He \n     said Washington was focused on the wrong issue when it came \n     to saving family farms.\n       ``For most farmers around here, the estate tax is not high \n     in their minds,'' Mr. Riekena said. ``What we need are better \n     crop prices.''\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, rather than one day raising the debt \nlimit without any plan to get us out of debt, except continuing to \nbelieve in the god of supply-side economics, which did not work so well \n20 years ago, and instead of repealing the wealth tax without any plan \nfor dealing with our problems, like a war and Social Security and other \nsignificant issues we confront, I hope we will opt for the more \nresponsible way of reforming the estate tax and make it clear that the \nreality check in this body demonstrates clearly we cannot afford it. It \nwould be the wrong decision, and we have other priorities that we need \nto get about the business of addressing. I thank the Chair. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, before yielding, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record two editorials from the Wall Street Journal, \ndated June 10, 2002, and February 22, 2001, both of which demonstrate \nsupport for the permanent repeal of the death tax.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 10, 2002]\n\n                         The Death Tax Senators\n\n       We are about to find out how many of the 12 Senate \n     Democrats who voted for tax cuts last year really meant it. \n     They'll get the chance to provide their sincerity when the \n     Senate takes up a vote to make repeal of the death tax \n     permanent, perhaps this month. Last Thursday, 41 of their \n     Democratic counterparts in the House joined the 256-171 vote \n     to make this punitive tax disappear forever.\n       Majority Leader Tom Daschle first tried to forestall a \n     Senate vote, because he knows a clear majority favors passage \n     there too. But he was forced to give in recently in return \n     for some concessions on the energy bill. So now he's trying \n     to hold off Senate passage with a filibuster that requires 60 \n     votes before it can get to President Bush's desk. Supporters \n     of permanent repeal figure they have at least 58 votes, and \n     Mr. Daschle has been twisting arms to block what is the will \n     of many even within his own party.\n       Almost every Republican voted for repeal the first time \n     around, though Vim Jeffords has since sold his vote for dairy \n     subsidies. Liberal Rhode Island Republican Lincoln Chafee, is \n     also in doubt, as is John McCain, who voted against President \n     Bush's original tax cut and moves further let by the month; \n     maybe the Arizonan should consider truth-in-advertising and \n     jump to Team Daschle.\n       The complete gang of 12 Democrats who voted for the tax cut \n     last year is listed in the table nearby. Six are up for re-\n     election this November, and to their credit three of those \n     running have already said they'll vote for repeal. It's \n     probably no coincidence that all three are running in \n     conservative states carried by Mr. Bush in 2000 and all of \n     them face more than token competition this year.\n       Two others running in November, New Jersey's Bob Torricelli \n     and Louisiana's Mary Landrieu, have already flip-flopped and \n     announced intentions to vote against permanent repeal. Their \n     excuse is that things are different now that the country is \n     facing budget deficits and wartime expenses. But it's far \n     more likely that they've changed because their re-election \n     opposition has since all but collapsed. Mr. Torricelli was \n     especially fond of just about any tax cut in his taxophobic \n     state, until Justice declined to indict him for accepting \n     illegal gifts and he concluded the New Jersey GOP couldn't \n     muster serious opposition.\n       One vote still in the balance is Missouri's Jean Carnahan. \n     She faces a strong challenge this fall from Republican Jim \n     Talent, who has made the death tax a central issue in his \n     campaign. She's doing a remarkable dodge and weave, claiming \n     to favor repeal for small businesses and farms but she is \n     undecided on the repeal that passed the House. Sounds to us \n     as if she's waiting for orders from Mr. Daschle; if he \n     doesn't need her for his filibuster, he'll give her a pass to \n     vote yes and remove the issue for November.\n       One virtue of this death-tax debate is that is reveals \n     what's really at stake in this November's Senate races. If \n     Mr. Daschle retains\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\n     his Democratic majority, further tax cutting is dead. But if \n     Republicans pick up a mere one seat, for a 50-50 split, \n     they'll be able to organize the Senate with the help of Vice \n     President Cheney's vote and tax-cutting becomes possible \n     again.\n       Mr. Daschle gave his Bush-state Democrats a tax-cut pass \n     last year, but the perversity of Senate budget rules meant \n     the tax cuts end after 10 years. This is crazy tax policy, \n     since it increases uncertainty and would amount to the \n     largest tax increase in history in 2010 if the law isn't \n     changed.\n       It is absolutely insane in the case of the estate-tax \n     repeal; the death tax declines slowly over the next seven \n     years, disappears entirely in 2009, but then snaps back to \n     its confiscatory 55% pre-Bush rate on January 1, 2010. So \n     forget about rational estate planning. Far from the tax on \n     the uberrich that Dems claim it is, only 5,200 of the 116,500 \n     tax returns filed in 1999 were for estates worth more than $5 \n     million. In any case, the main argument for repealing the \n     death tax isn't economic, but moral. It's unjust for the \n     government to double tax away, at death, the fruits of a life \n     of work and thrift.\n       The death-tax repeal vote is also about truth in politics. \n     A year ago these Senators voted to repeal the death tax, but \n     only with a wink and an asterisk that it would all come back \n     after 10 years. No wonder voters are cynical about \n     politicians. The next death tax vote will separate the \n     cynical from the sincere.\n\n\n                             The Gang of 12\n\n       A dozen Democratic Senators voted last year for the \n     temporary repeal of the death tax.\n     Against\n     John Breaux (La.)\n     *Mary Landrieu (La.)\n     *Robert Torricelli (N.J.)\n     For\n     *Max Baucus (Mont.)\n     *Max Cleland (Ga.)\n     Dianne Feinstein (Calif.)\n     *Tim Johnson (S.D.)\n     Herb Kohl (Wis.)\n     Blanche Lincoln (Ark.)\n     Ben Nelson (Neb.)\n     Zell Miller (Ga.)\n     Undecided\n     *Jean Carnahan (Mo.)\n\n     *Up for re-election this year\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 22, 2001]\n\n                            A Tax on Virtue\n\n       Maybe you have to be a billionaire to appreciate the \n     argument for keeping the estate tax.\n       A newspaper ad signed by Bill Gates Sr., George Soros, \n     David Rockefeller and more than 200 other money-bags has just \n     warned that repealing the estate tax ``would have a \n     devastating impact on public charities.'' We live in strange \n     times indeed when the ethical case for keeping a tax rests \n     upon a collection of fat cats talking about the things they \n     will do to avoid paying it.\n       Of course, they don't really have an economic argument. \n     Anyone who looks at the numbers knows that the death tax \n     amounts to only about 1% of all federal revenues. But that \n     figure doesn't begin to get at the actual and opportunity \n     costs involved in collecting it. When the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation looked into the issue two years back, it found these \n     costs staggering: punishing savings, encouraging consumption \n     and costing almost as much in compliance as it takes in.\n       What about the moral argument? Everyone knows about sin \n     taxes--taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, etc. Well, a death tax \n     is a tax on virtue. It's tax on those who've worked hard, \n     saved well and in most cases have already paid taxes on their \n     wealth at least once and probably twice.\n       It is also responsible for a whole tax-avoidance industry, \n     which takes in millions itself from the 200 well-heeled \n     individuals in Sunday's ad. Put simply, if you really are \n     rich enough you can have your cake and pass it along to your \n     heirs too. But if you can't afford to pay the legions of \n     estate lawyers, trust fund accountants and life insurance \n     underwriters, your heirs will be forced to sell off what \n     you've worked so hard to build up to pay off the IRS man \n     waiting outside your funeral for his take.\n       So if the death tax really isn't all that significant for \n     the government, why the opposition to getting rid of it? the \n     answer is that the death tax was never about money. It is \n     about envy and the corrosive philosophy it feeds. This is the \n     philosophy Senator Tom Daschle invokes when he talks about \n     Americans in terms of those whose tax cuts will let them buy \n     a Lexus and those who supposedly will get no more than a \n     muffler. The death tax is their favorite, the name of the \n     game being to stoke the flames of resentment among the 98% of \n     Americans who don't pay this tax against the 2% who do.\n       Their problem is that the public isn't buying. No matter \n     how they are worded, polls show Americans instinctively \n     understand there is something rotten about a government that \n     would confiscate half of what you've worked hard to build \n     up. This month a McLaughlin & Associates poll reported \n     88.5% of Americans saying the death tax is unfair, and \n     nearly as many favoring its abolition. A Zogby/O'Leary \n     report clocked in with 86% declaring the tax is unfair. A \n     Portrait of America survey from last July even had 59% of \n     Gore supporters wanting the tax killed. Given that the \n     vast majority of Americans know that the death tax won't \n     affect them personally, opposition to the tax is a pretty \n     strong statement about ideas of fairness and morality.\n       Within the Bush Administration there are murmurs about \n     giving up on abolishing the estate tax in the hopes of \n     getting the President's other cuts through, and there have \n     already been some defections in the GOP ranks. This would be \n     a grave miscalculation. In his acceptance speech in \n     Philadelphia in August, George W. Bush said that his own \n     position was based on the ``principle'' that ``every family, \n     every farmer and small businessperson should be free to pass \n     on their life's work to those they love.'' In the next breath \n     Mr. Bush stated that ``on principle'' he also couldn't see \n     why anyone ``in America should have to pay more than a third \n     of their income to the federal government.''\n       These are good, sturdy principles for President Bush to \n     stand on. In the election one of the defining differences \n     between George Bush and Al Gore was that the former \n     understood you don't make poor people better off by making \n     rich people poorer. You help poor people by giving them a \n     stake in the system that makes rich people wealthy. In the \n     past only the wealthiest Americans have really been in a \n     position to give their children and grandchildren advantages \n     by transferring wealth. But a booming stock market and the \n     growth of 401k plans means that American families of even \n     modest incomes might leave a legacy for their children. \n     Billionaires might not understand this, but ordinary \n     Americans clearly do.\n       Within this context the death tax should be seen for what \n     it really is: the flag of convenience for the Beltway's class \n     warfare brigade. They know all too well that if they can't \n     sell envy on an inheritance tax, they can't sell it at all. \n     The real danger for the President is a halfway measure that \n     would deprive him of victory and foster a reputation as a \n     tinkerer rather than a reformer. ``The only way to eliminate \n     the unfairness of the death tax,'' says Rep. Jennifer Dunn, \n     sponsor of last year's legislation, ``is to end it once and \n     for all.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, let me make a couple comments before the \nSenator from New York leaves. We passed legislation recently to help \nthe victims of terrorism, including New York City and Oklahoma City, \nand we reduced their estate tax. I think we exempted estates basically \nunder $8 million and said if they have an estate over $8 million, it \nwould be 18 to 20 percent which, in my opinion, is what the maximum \ndeath tax should be.\n  I heard my colleague say there is not a taxable event on death. I \nhappen to disagree. If someone dies, it is a taxable event under \ncurrent code. Some of us are trying to say a taxable event should not \nbe when somebody dies, but when the assets are sold and sold \nvoluntarily, that means the people initiated a transaction and know \nwhat the tax will be.\n  Current law is when someone dies, it is a taxable event. They tax the \nestate up to 50 percent. My colleagues want to exempt estates of $3 \nmillion or $4 million, maybe $7 million if it is a couple and they both \ndie at the same time, but we want half of it after that. The Conrad \namendment is not 50 percent, it is 55 percent, if you have a taxable \nestate between $10 million and $17 million.\n  Fifty-five percent is over half; 50 percent is half. That is a lot. \nWhy should the Federal Government be entitled to take half of \nsomebody's property if they happen to have an estate of $20 million?\n  How is it right to say to New York City and Oklahoma City--your tax \nrates should be 20 percent for victims, but everybody else has to pay \n50 percent? If somebody has three or four restaurants or they have a \nvery large ranch or a nice successful real estate business they are \nbuilding and growing and their kids want to continue it and we fail to \npass the Gramm amendment, we are basically saying that a tax $3 million \nis enough and maybe $7 million if combined. We are asking the Federal \nGovernment to come in and take half. This family exclusion proposal, \nwhich was not adopted earlier, would not work.\n  I am embarrassed for my colleagues to say they believe in free \nenterprise but free enterprise up to an estate of $3 million, and above \nthat the Federal Government gets half; that the Federal Government \nshould confiscate half the property because somebody passes away.\n  We are saying: No, let's not have a taxable event at death; rather, \nlet's have a taxable event when the property is sold. And when the \nproperty is sold, you pay the 20 percent capital gains\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\ntax. This eliminates lots of legal time and expenses trying to avoid \nthis unnecessary tax.\n  Somebody said: What about the Rockefellers? They do not pay the \ntaxes; they set up foundations. That is what Mr. Gates is doing. That \nis what the very wealthy people do. They do not pay this tax. The \npeople who pay it are the people who have the farm, the ranch, the \nsmall business and somebody dies unexpectedly--I know because it \nhappened to my dad--and Government comes in and says: We want half.\n  Unfortunately, if we adopt the Conrad amendment, the Government will \ncontinue taking half. I think it is unconscionable. We should reduce \nthe rates, not just increase the exemption. This only applies to 1 or 2 \npercent. We should cut the rates to 20 percent, cut it to a voluntary \ntransaction, cut it to a capital gain. Then we have solved the problem; \nwe have eliminated the problem.\n  This is a terrible tax and it is unfair. We are making countless \nthousands of people not grow their business, not expand because they \nknow they are going to be compiling problems for the future. Why build \nand expand if you are going to be giving half to the Government and \nmaybe causing all kinds of litigation for your children? Why double, \nwhy build, why expand, why grow? I know many people who have worked \nhard to made enough to get along and live a comfortable life. This tax \nshould not ruin these years of hard work.\n  We should change this tax, and do it by adopting the Gramm-Kyl-\nNickles amendment. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this \namendment and oppose increasing the exemption and then sock it to them \nand have the Federal Government take half the estate if it happens to \nbe over this deductible amount.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to support permanent repeal \nof the estate tax. Permanent repeal of the estate tax will help boost \nMontana's economy and will help boost America's economy, create jobs, \nand protect the heritage of our farmers and ranchers.\n  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I was proud to help \nwrite last year's tax cut, which included a number of good changes to \nthe estate tax, including increasing the unified tax credit and \nrestructuring the rates.\n  Now it is time to go further. As the law currently stands, the estate \ntax will be fully repealed in 2010.\n  It will return to 2001 levels the next year, 2011. Let us use some \ncommon sense. Estate tax is a prime example of a tax that dampens \nefforts to create more jobs in Montana and across the country, and that \nis what this is all about, creating more jobs.\n  My State is a small business State, an agricultural State, a State of \nfamily-owned farms and ranches, a place where main street businesses \nare still family owned. It is important to Montanans to be able to pass \non their businesses, their farms, their ranches, to their sons and to \ntheir daughters.\n  I support the Gramm-Kyl amendment to eliminate the sunset of the \nestate tax, to permanently repeal the estate tax, to free up money to \nhelp families, family-owned businesses, farms, and ranches. Permanent \nrepeal of the estate tax will allow families to better plan \nparticularly for the continuity of their estates.\n  Our family-owned businesses, farms, and ranches are the backbone of \nmy State. I do not know another State that is a more small business \nState than mine. It is also the backbone of America, I might add--small \nbusiness.\n  Family-owned businesses are our country's heritage, and it is up to \nus to protect that heritage. Full, permanent repeal is the right thing \nto do for our farmers, for our ranchers, for hard-working small \nbusiness owners. It is the right thing to do for the Nation, and most \ncertainly permanent repeal is the right thing to do for Montana.\n  I urge the Senate to support permanent repeal of the estate tax for \nthis generation and generations to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, on the two previous amendments, we have \nafforded the authors of the amendments the ability to close the debate. \nWe would like to preserve that right for ourselves in this debate on \nour amendment. So what I would like to do is to ask those on the other \nside who want to come and speak to do it, so we can take our remaining \ntime to use at the end to close out the debate.\n  There is no rule that says it has to be done that way, but when we \nclosed out the debate on the Dorgan amendment, he had the last 11 \nminutes. When we concluded the debate on the amendment of the senior \nSenator from North Dakota, he closed out that debate. So if we could do \nit that way, we would like to do it. It seems reasonable to us. If \nanybody objects, obviously we can talk about an alternative.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as you know, for as long as I have been \nin Congress, my belief is that no American family should be forced to \npay over half of their savings, their business, or their family farm in \ntaxes when they die. No taxpayer should be visited by the undertaker \nand the tax collector at the same time.\n  With the President's support we have helped those families we care \nabout, this Senate voted by a wide majority to help those families who \nare being crushed under the expensive responsibilities of estate tax \nplanning and estate taxes. I have heard the concerns of the people in \nIowa and the American people, and this Congress voted to repeal the \n``death tax.''\n  Now, the Democrat leadership wants to take that all away. Once again \nthey want to take more then half of a family's assets because someone \nhas died. The Democrat leaders just want to spend your money. Well, \nfolks, that is not right. Death is not a taxable event.\n  We have the chance today to make death tax repeal permanent. We have \nheard from the brave men and women who fought World War II, they fought \nfor democracy and then came home to help fuel the economy that created \nthis wealth. They are dying by the thousands everyday, now they want \nthe death tax to die forever. That means for the first time, American \ntaxpayers, who are good Americans, who saved and invested in savings \naccounts and stocks and bonds will be treated equally with all other \ntaxpayers. It means, that for the first time, American farm families \nand the owners of small businesses will not have to jump through hoops, \nhold their breath, and pray they did it right, subject to audit, in \norder to know they will not have to pay death tax.\n  Last year we repealed the death tax, effective for anyone dying after \nDecember 31, 2009. If not for budget constraints we would have repealed \nit sooner, but at least today we can vote to make the repeal permanent. \nWe will be able to start a new decade with no death tax to burden the \nfuture generations. By repealing the death tax we will save thousands \nof family-owned businesses and in turn saving the jobs of hundreds of \nthousands of employees when family businesses are faced with death tax.\n  We have heard the American people, we have reformed and repealed the \ndeath tax. I urge all of my fellow Senators to repeal the sunset so \ndeath tax will be dead once and for all. Beware of all these Democratic \namendments that try to once again make the law murky and complex. Keep \nit simple and fair--repeal the sunset. Make death tax repeal permanent.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the estate tax, better \nknown as the ``death tax,'' is an onerous tax that should be \neliminated. A recent poll revealed that 77 percent of the voters \nbelieve that the tax is unfair.\n  This tax is slowly destroying family businesses by slowing growth. \nAnd it is unfair that families who have worked their entire lives to \nbuild a successful family farm or business should be penalized.\n  Individuals who look forward to leaving something behind for their \nchildren should not be punished by confiscatory, anti-family taxes.\n  In fact, after years or even generations, children are often forced \nto sell the family farm or business just to pay the tax. This is both \nunfair and unconscionable.\n  However, not only is it the children who must suffer the loss of the \nfamily business, but the workers and their children who suffer when \nthey lose their job because the business they've been working at is \nliquidated to pay the death tax.\n\n[[Page S5425]]\n\n  But it doesn't stop there. The local community, particularly small \ntowns, suffer as well because their customers can no longer afford to \nbuy their products after having lost their job.\n  The estate tax is outdated, it raises little money, and it imposes a \nlarge cost on the economy.\n  In 1999 the estate tax generated about $24 billion. However, it is \nestimated that administrative costs to enforce the tax are over $36 \nbillion.\n  A recent analysis by the Heritage Foundation found that the U.S. \neconomy would average nearly $11 billion per year in additional output \nif this tax were abolished.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers states that 40 percent of \nit's members had spent more than $100,000 on attorney and consultant \nfees related to death tax planning. In addition 3 out of 5 members pay \nat least $25,000 a year to prepare for the death tax.\n  A 1998 study by the Joint Economic Committee found that if the death \ntax was repealed, as many as 240,000 jobs would be created and \nAmericans would have an additional $24.4 billion in disposable personal \nincome.\n  A February 2000 study by the National Association of Women \nEntrepreneurs found that the death tax has a negative impact on female \nentrepreneurs.\n  According to the study, business owners found that female \nentrepreneurs spent, on average, nearly $60,000 on death-tax planning.\n  So who pays the death tax?\n  We all do. We pay it through lower wages and fewer jobs. In high-\nunemployment regions or rural areas such as the North Country of New \nHampshire and elsewhere, the death tax destroys badly needed jobs \nbefore they are created.\n  We pay it through the destruction of our communities. In hundreds of \nAmerican towns, small family-owned businesses are struggling to survive \nagainst the competition provided by large corporate retailers.\n  Home Depot doesn't pay the death tax. The family-owned hardware store \ndoes. The death tax accelerates the transfer of wealth from the owners \nof small businesses to the owners of large, public corporations.\n  And we pay it through slower growth and less wealth. Study after \nstudy shows the death tax reduces savings, lowers investment, and \nrestricts the capacity of the economy to grow. The death tax literally \nconfiscates capital, the lifeblood of any economy. That means lower \nincomes and fewer opportunities for ourselves, as well as our children.\n  Death tax supporters argue we cannot afford to repeal this tax. All \nthe evidence suggests just the opposite. We cannot afford to continue \nthis destructive tax.\n  So who's left holding the bag, the middle-class.\n  This tax is unfair and it is anti-family. We must repeal this tax \nnow. I strongly urge passage of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first let me rise to disagree with my \ncolleague, the chair of the Senate Finance Committee. In the State of \nMinnesota, in 1999, there were 636 families who paid the estate tax. If \nwe pass the Conrad amendment, which says for a family we are targeting \n$7 million, we will have exactly 36 families left in our State who will \nbe paying this tax.\n  We had the Dorgan amendment that said if someone is going to be a \nfamily farmer or have a small business, and they are going to pass it \non, and one is going to take over the farm and the small business, they \nare exempt. That is what it is all about when it comes to fairness.\n  Instead, what we have is a proposal that I yesterday labeled win/win \nor lose/lose, dependent upon one's values and priorities. If one \nbelieves they should bleed the economy over the next 20 years to the \ntune of a trillion dollars, and all of those benefits will go to \nmultimillionaires and billionaires, and at the same time have to raid \nthe Social Security trust fund--we just raised the debt ceiling $450 \nbillion, and some of my colleagues who voted against it are voting for \neliminating this tax. So if they believe the benefits should go to the \ntop of the top of the top, and in addition they want to bleed this \neconomy to the tune of a trillion dollars over the next 20 years so we \nwill not be able to live up to our Social Security obligations, we will \ntake it out of the Social Security trust fund; we will not have the \nmoney for affordable prescription drug coverage; we will not make the \ninvestment in the health and skills and intellect and character of \nchildren; we will not invest in education; there will be nothing for \naffordable housing; we will not be able to do anything about deplorable \nconditions in nursing homes. If they believe this and believe there is \nnothing the Government can or should do, this is win/win.\n  I said it yesterday. This is lose/lose for the people of Minnesota. \nThis is lose/lose for probably 99.99 percent of the population. This is \nlose/lose for people who believe we should have tax fairness, that we \nshould target these breaks to small businesses and family farmers. This \nis lose/lose for people who believe there is a role Government can play \nwhen it comes to the improvement of people's lives and that we have an \nimportant challenge before us: Affordable prescription drugs, good \neducation, investment in our schools, our children, making sure Social \nSecurity will be there for people. These are the priorities.\n  This proposal is very clear in what its ultimate goal is, which is \nabove and beyond massive tax unfairness. It will so erode the revenue \nbase and will prevent any initiative in these areas: Prescription drug \ncoverage, education, health care coverage, affordable housing. By \ndefinition, it is fiscally irresponsible. So on both counts, it is a \nmassive subsidy, an inverse relationship to need.\n  All together, 36 families in Minnesota will not be helped if we go \nforward with the Conrad proposal. If we had gone forward with the \nDorgan proposal, every family in Minnesota but 36 families would be \nhelped. This proposal is so skewed toward the top of the top of the top \nand at the same time undercuts our ability to make any of the \ninvestments we need to make to do better as a nation.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote against the Gramm proposal and will \nvote for the Conrad amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the estate tax is bad for businesses. It \nis bad for workers and new job creation. And it is bad for our \ncommunities who are watching their local, family-owned businesses get \nswallowed up by large corporations. Therefore, I wish I could have \nsupported the estate tax repeal amendment debated today.\n  For the last 7 years, I have worked to address the problems with the \nestate tax. I introduced legislation in 1995 to reform the estate tax, \nand I voted for the 1997 tax bill that made it easier for family farms \nand small businesses to transfer their assets to the next generation. \nIn 2000, I cosponsored legislation by Senator Jon Kyl and former \nSenator Bob Kerrey to repeal the estate tax. I voted for similar \nlegislation later that year. I believe the Kyl-Kerrey bill made a \ncritical contribution to the estate tax debate. It was a middle ground \nthat essentially substituted an estate tax when an asset is transferred \nat death with a capital gains tax when an asset is sold. In my opinion, \nthat is a fair approach.\n  For me, estate tax repeal is about protecting and creating jobs, \nstrengthening locally owned businesses, and protecting the environment. \nWhen a business owner spends thousands of dollars each year on estate \ntax planning, that is less money the owner invests in employees and the \nbusiness. When family businesses are sold, they are often purchased by \nlarge corporations, not by other locally owned businesses. When timber \nlots or farms are sold, there is a good chance that land will be eaten \nup by strip malls or other development, and not kept as open\n\n[[Page S5426]]\n\nspace. For the reasons I just outlined, a vote for repeal would have \nbeen the easy road to travel today.\n  My constituents did not elect me to the Senate to take the easy road. \nThey elected me to make tough decisions. As much as I believe the \nestate tax is a bad tax, I believe passionately that we have a \nresponsibility to balance the government's books. Just as the estate \ntax hurts businesses and jobs, so does chronic deficit spending by the \nFederal Government.\n  During the last 2 days, some of my colleagues have argued for \npermanent estate tax repeal. Not one of them has told me how we will \npay for it. Last year's tax cut blew open the budget while not making \nestate tax repeal a high priority. Our budget problems were made worse \nby the recession and September 11 terrorist attacks. Clearly, we are in \na different place than we were 2 years ago.\n  The country deserves a debate on how we balance estate tax repeal--or \nother aspects of last year's tax law--with our other obligations. We \nmust address our homeland security needs, whether it is strengthening \nairline and port security, improving operations at our borders, or \nmaking sure our troops in the field have the training and resources \nthey need. Our constituents are also demanding action on issues that \nwere important prior to September 11. Health care is a crucial issue \nfor individuals and families, and to the businesses who support estate \ntax repeal. In addition, we cannot lose sight of long-term investments \nin education, job training and infrastructure. Given what is at stake, \nwe do a disservice to the American people if we simply tell them they \ncan have it all. We have to make choices, and last year the \nadministration and Congress chose not to make estate tax repeal a \npriority.\n  While I could not support the estate tax repeal amendment offered by \nSenators Gramm and Kyl, neither could I support the amendments by my \nDemocratic colleagues. While well intentioned, I believe the nation has \nmoved beyond whether we should repeal the tax. To me, it is not a \nquestion of if, but when we repeal the tax and how we pay for it. The \nalternative amendments offered today would have taken us backwards.\n  Today is not the last time we will debate estate tax repeal. Between \nnow and the next estate tax vote, I believe Congress and the \nadministration need to reach agreement on a basic budget framework that \nmakes room for estate tax repeal. Unless we repeal the estate tax in \nthe context of a budget agreement, we will just be playing politics \ninstead of making real progress\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly support permanent estate tax \nreform. Though I do not support completely repealing the estate tax for \nall estates, I do believe that we should significantly expand the \nunified credit to exempt the great majority of estates from taxation, \nand we should do so on a permanent basis. We should also include an \nindexing provision to ensure that the unified credit does not become \nobsolete and burdensome again, as happened over the past several \ndecades.\n  But we should make these changes in a fiscally responsible manner. We \nshould do so without adding to the already enormous budget deficits \nthat were largely the result of the tax bill that was enacted last \nyear.\n  Our budget position is poor, and it is getting worse. Last year, \nCongress passed a fiscally irresponsible tax cut that has shoved us \nback into the deficit ditch. Congress then added to our woes by passing \nan unfunded stimulus package filled with special interest tax breaks, a \nfarm bill that unnecessarily benefits the largest and wealthiest \nproducers, and just last week, following the action of the House of \nRepresentatives, the Senate passed a supplemental spending bill, also \nunfunded, and also apparently filled with special interest provisions \nof questionable value. Each of these actions will only further \naggravate our budget problems.\n  Now, proponents of estate tax repeal are asking us to enact \nlegislation that will add even more fuel to the deficit fires. Rather \nthan offering a fiscally responsible measure, with provisions that \noffset the cost of repeal, the proponents are content to add to our \nbudget deficits, and our already massive federal debt.\n  In effect, the proponents suggest that we should repeal the tax on \nthe wealthiest estates, and let the Social Security trust funds pick up \nthe tab.\n  I regret that this is also the case with some of the alternative \nproposals as well--proposals much closer to the kind of estate tax \nreform I support. The choices being presented to the Senate are not \nacceptable. As much as I would like to see a permanent solution to this \nquestion, I do not support raiding Social Security to achieve it.\n  When I was first elected in 1992, we faced an annual budget deficit \nof $340 billion, and projected deficits of roughly the same size for \nmany years to come. Thanks to the fiscal restraint we demonstrated in \nthe 1990s, and especially to the deficit reduction package we enacted \nin 1993, we saw a virtuous cycle of lower budget deficits and increased \neconomic growth. The result was that we eliminated the budget deficits \nand actually began paying down some of the federal debt that was racked \nup during the 1980s.\n  We need to return to the fiscal restraint that worked so well during \nthe 1990s. And first and foremost, that means paying our bills. The \nestate tax repeal is not funded. It digs our deep budget hole even \ndeeper, and we should reject it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the estate tax needs to be reformed, but \nit should not be repealed. Repealing the estate tax would benefit only \nthe extremely wealthy at an exorbitant cost to the American people. We \ncan help small businesses and family farmers by reforming the estate \ntax. That is the choice before us.\n  Let's start with a few facts. Ninety-eight of every 100 people who \ndie face no estate tax whatsoever. Only the richest 2 percent of \nAmericans do. Estates worth in excess of $5 million paid about 51 \npercent of the estate tax in 1998. This tax does not oppress the \nchildren of multi-millionaires, they still inherit millions. But it \ndoes provide us with funds for investment in the public good. It is \ncompletely appropriate that the wealthiest estates contribute some \nportion in taxes to help create opportunities for others to reach their \nfull potential.\n  Repealing the estate tax would make the rich richer at a heavy cost \nto the rest of us. Between 2013 through 2022, permanent repeal of the \nestate tax would cost us $740 billion. That is $740 billion we could \nuse for homeland defense, investments in education and infrastructure, \nand to provide the funds to save Social Security and Medicare.\n  It is true that a few small businesses and family farms are subject \nto the estate tax. But of the 2.3 million people who died in 1998, just \n1,418 of those had more than half of their estates in a family-owned \nbusiness or farm. We can and should exempt many of these families from \nthe estate tax through responsible reform.\n  Furthermore, while the estate tax affects a relatively small number \nof wealthy Americans, it can have a detrimental effect on small \nbusinesses and families who live in areas that have high property \nvalues, such as Silicon Valley. Under current law, the first $675,000 \nof one's estate is exempted from Federal tax. In some parts of \nCalifornia, however, where median home prices exceed $500,000, \nmoderate-income individuals must content with taxes paid only by the \nwealthiest residents in other regions.\n  I strongly support helping these families by reforming instead of \nrepealing the estate tax. The reform I supported and that Senator \nDorgan introduced would make estates of up of $4 million--and $8 \nmillion for couples--exempt from the estate tax. And it would \npermanently repeal the estate tax for family-owned farms and \nbusinesses. That is real reform that benefits those who need the help, \nnot another giveaway to the richest among us.\n  Instead of focusing our efforts on making the very wealthy wealthier, \nwe should be working on helping hard-working Americans and investing in \nmeeting their needs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in January 2001, the Congressional Budget \nOffice projected an on-budget surplus of $3 trillion over the decade. \nOne year later, the projection is for a $242 billion on-budget deficit. \nThe largest single reason for that stunning change is not the cost of \nthe war on terrorism nor the recession, it is the $1.7 trillion cost of \nthe President's tax cut. The administration's proposed budget this year \nwould make the existing crisis far\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\nworse, dramatically expanding the deficit to nearly $1.5 trillion. The \nSocial Security trust fund would be used to cover an on-budget \nshortfall every year through fiscal year 2012.\n  Just yesterday, at the urging of the administration, we voted to \nraise the debt limit by $450 billion. That increase will only carry us \nuntil next spring. The Treasury Department has already said that we \nwill have to raise the ceiling on government borrowing again early next \nyear. Despite the overwhelming evidence, it seems that some of our \ncolleagues across the aisle remain oblivious to the connection between \nthe larger and larger tax cuts they espouse and the growing deficits \nthat inevitably result.\n  Why, in this time of budgetary crisis--when the war on terrorism is \nmaking making new demands on our resources, and when the enormous cost \nof the retirement of the baby boom generation is looming just over the \nhorizon--should we be considering another large tax cut for the \nwealthiest taxpayers? There is no good answer.\n  Permanent repeal of the estate tax is unaffordable. In the first \nyear, full repeal will cost $56 billion. Over the decade beginning in \n2012, the estimated revenue loss to the Treasury is $740 billion.\n  Permanent repeal of the estate tax is unfair. While it benefits only \nthe wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers, each year it will consume \nbillions of dollars which are needed to finance Social Security and \nMedicare benefits for millions of retirees.\n  Permanent repeal of the estate tax is unnecessary. Currently, all \nestates under $1 million are exempt from the estate tax. That exemption \nwill rise to $3.5 million under existing law. At that point, only the \nlargest one-half of 1 percent of estates will be subject to the tax. \nMaking that higher exemption level permanent will protect the vast \nmajority of the family farms and family owned small businesses. Their \nestate tax will be zero.\n  Permanently repealing the estate tax, as our Republican colleagues \nproposed, would be the triumph of reckless ideology over fiscal \nprudence. It would jeopardize our ability to meet the Nation's most \nfundamental responsibilities in future years.\n  In the Bush administration's budget, in a section titled ``The Threat \nto the Budget from the Impending Demographic Transition,'' it states: \n``In the years that follow [2008], the population over the age 62 will \nskyrocket, putting serious strains on the budget because of increased \nexpenditures for Social Security and for the Government's health \nprograms which serve the elderly--Medicare and increasingly Medicaid.''\n  The resources which will be lost to the Treasury by repeal of the \nestate tax are essential to financially strengthening Social Security \nand Medicare. Dedicating the revenue from the estate tax to the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds would go a long way to securing those \nprograms fro future generations of senior citizens. Over the next 75 \nyears, revenue generated by the current estate tax would be equivalent \nto nearly 40 percent of the shortfall in the Social Security Trust \nFund. Those dollars should go where they are needed most--to preserve \nthe promise of Social Security for future generations of retirees.\n  While the advocates of permanent estate tax repeal are reluctant to \nadmit it, this vote is really about the financial future of Social \nSecurity and Medicare. Repeal would be a windfall for the wealthiest \nfew at the expense of our ability to keep Social Security and Medicare \nstrong for all seniors. Do we choose to commit hundreds of billions of \ndollars to cover the cost of estate tax repeal or to maintain Social \nSecurity and Medicare for future retirees?\n  In the year 2000, nearly 40 million Americans received Social \nSecurity retirement benefits. With the retirement of the baby boomers, \nthat number will steadily grow. By 2010, it will exceed 50 million. In \ncomparison, fewer than fifty thousand of the largest estates paid any \nestate tax in 2000. That was just 2 percent of decedents. With the \nincrease of the estate tax exemption to $3.5 million by 2009, the \nnumber of estates paying tax will be further reduced to about 10,000 a \nyear. Just one-half of 1 percent of estates will be subject to the \nestate tax.\n\n  Which group needs our help more--the 50 million men and women \ncounting on Social Security or the heirs of the 10,000 wealthy \ndecedents with multi-million dollar estates? I believe the answer to \nthat question should be clear to all.\n  Those who most passionately decry the ``unfairness'' of taxing multi-\nmillion dollar estates are strangely silent about the unfairness of \njeopardizing the retirement benefits of low-wage workers or the \nunfairness of forcing elderly widows to choose between food and \nmedicine. Which of these injustices should move the Senate to action?\n  Many bogus claims have been made to distract attention from the real \nfairness issue. Those advocating permanent repeal claim it is ``double \ntaxation.'' In fact, a major portion of the assets in these multi-\nmillion dollar estates are unrealized capital gains which are never \ntaxed. Those favoring repeal assert the Federal Government takes more \nthan half of all the assets in these estates. This too is incorrect. \nThe Congressional Research Service analyzed the Federal estate tax \nburden on estates that were subject to taxation in 1999 and determined \nthat the effective rate was just 12.4 percent. On the largest estates, \nthose over $20 million, the effective rate was 17.6 percent. These are \ncertainly not unreasonable rates to ask the richest men and women in \nthe Nation to pay.\n  There appears to be a consensus in the Chamber to permanently exempt \nestates up to $3.5 million from taxation. That feature is common to all \nthe proposals. I support it. So, in essence the debate is whether the \nFederal Government should tax estates larger than $3.5 million. Do \nthose who have been given the most--the heirs to these fortunes--have a \nspecial obligation to help the less fortunate members of the American \ncommunity? That is the real fairness question before the Senate today.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on H.R. 8, the Death \nTax Elimination Act. I want to take this opportunity to explain my \nopposition to making permanent the repeal of the Federal estate tax.\n  Last year, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n2001 (P.L. 107-16) repealed the Federal estate tax by 2010. It \naccomplished this by gradually raising the ``unified credit'' which is \nthe amount of the estate exempt from taxation, from $675,000 in 2001, \nto $1 million in 2002; $1.5 million in 2004; $2 million in 2006; and \n$3.5 million in 2009 and finally repealed the estate tax by 2010. \nHowever, the estate tax will be reinstated in 2011 as it exists under \ncurrent law. The Death Tax Elimination Act removes the sunset on repeal \nand makes the repeal of the estate tax permanent from 2010 onwards with \nno cap whatsoever.\n  I am concerned that repeal of the estate tax would provide massive \nbenefits solely to the wealthiest and highest income taxpayers in the \ncountry. A Treasury Department study found that almost no estate tax \nhas been paid by lower and middle-income taxpayers. But taxes have been \npaid on the estates of people who were in the highest 20 percent of the \nincome distribution at the time of their death. It found that 91 \npercent of all estate taxes are paid by the estates of people whose \nannual income exceeded $190,000 around the time of their death.\n  During this time of increasing deficits, we should also be mindful of \nthe very high cost of providing those benefits and our ability to pay \nfor them. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that removing the \n2010 sunset and making permanent the repeal of the estate tax would \ncost $99 billion between 2003 and 2012. But more than half of this cost \nor $56 billion would occur just in 2012. The long-term costs of \npermanent repeal are much larger. In the decade after 2012, permanent \nrepeal would result in a revenue loss of $740 billion assuming that the \ncost which the Joint Tax Committee estimates for 2012 will remain the \nsame after 2012, when measured as a share of the economy.\n  Another concern I have is that repeal of the estate tax will cause a \nsignificant decline in charitable giving. I fear that eliminating the \nestate and gift tax would remove an enormous tax incentive for the \nwealthy to make charitable gifts. The research on the effect of the \nestate tax on charitable giving has consistently shown that levying \nestate taxes increases the amount of charitable bequests. A recent \nstudy found\n\n[[Page S5428]]\n\nthat eliminating the estate tax would reduce charitable bequests by \nabout 12 percent overall.\n  Taking these issues into account, instead of repeal of the estate \ntax, I support increasing the ``unified credit'' to allow up to $5 \nmillion worth of assets to be exempt from taxation. I believe this cap \nis a reasonable amount. For example, according to data from the IRS, \nmore than 93 percent of taxable estates in 1999 were valued at less \nthan $5 million. Farm and family-owned business assets accounted for \nless than three percent of the total value of these estates in 1999. In \nmost estates that are taxable and include a business or farm, the \nbusiness or farm does not even constitute the majority of the estate. \nIn fact, the American Farm Bureau Federation has acknowledged that it \ncould not cite a single example of a farm having to be sold to pay \nestate taxes. These facts belie the argument that we must repeal the \nestate tax to save family businesses and farms to assure that they do \nnot have to be liquidated to pay estate taxes.\n  Responsible estate tax reform, instead of outright repeal, would \nensure that small and family-owned businesses and family farms will not \nbe taxed out of business in the event of the death of an owner or when \npassed along to the owner's children. Responsible reform would \nalleviate individuals and businesses from being forced to spend time \nand money on estate planning.\n  Even some of the Nation's wealthiest taxpayers such as Warren Buffet, \nChairman of Berkshire Hathaway, and Bill Gates, Sr., father of the \nbillionaire Microsoft founder, have gone on record as opposing the \neffort to repeal the estate tax. And in calling for the inheritance tax \nin his 1906 State of the Union Address, President Theodore Roosevelt \nsaid, ``The man of great wealth owes a peculiar obligation to the \nState, because he derives special advantages from the mere existence of \ngovernment.''\n  We have no idea what our financial or economic situation will be ten \nyears from now. We may be at war. We may be in the process of putting \nSocial Security on a sound financial footing. We may want to have the \nflexibility to provide significant tax relief for lower and middle-\nincome taxpayers. Other unforeseen issues may arise. The point is that \nwe must think beyond the horizon. Making the repeal of the estate tax \npermanent fails to take these new circumstances into account.\n  We will need resources to deal with national security, general \ngovernment funding, the coming baby boom retirement and the rising \ncosts of Social Security and Medicare, and responsible tax reform that \nbenefit lower- and middle-income taxpayers. But we must fund these \npriorities within our constrained budget situation. Reforming the \nestate tax rather than committing ourselves to full repeal is the more \nsustainable and responsible approach.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to address the Gramm/Kyl \namendment to H.R. 8, the estate tax repeal bill.\n  I want to first say that I am philosophically opposed to the estate \ntax, and have long expressed my belief that it is an unfair tax that we \nshould ultimately do away with.\n  In addition to threatening owners of small businesses and family \nfarms, the estate tax acts to stifle investment in businesses, and is a \ndisincentive for those who want to save so that they can pass assets on \nto their children and grandchildren. However, to vote in favor of \nrepeal today, under our current circumstances, runs counter to another \nof my deep philosophical beliefs: fiscal responsibility.\n  Last year I voted to support the President's tax cut package, which \nprovides $1.3 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade. My support for \nthat bill was partially determined by the estate tax relief provisions \nincluded within it. When I voted in favor of that bill, we were \nprojected to benefit from some $5.6 trillion in budget surpluses over \nthe coming decade, enabling us to provide significant relief to \nAmerican taxpayers while also protecting the Social Security trust fund \nand programs in health, education, and numerous other areas.\n  Needless to say, that outlook has changed dramatically in the past \ntwelve months. The economic slowdown, combined with major new expenses \nassociated with providing for homeland security and fighting the war on \nterror, have put a major strain on the federal budget, requiring \nCongress to exercise a degree of fiscal responsibility not seen during \nthe late 1990's.\n  Despite the threat of a budget deficit of over $125 billion this \nyear, and projected deficits stretching through the end of the decade, \nHouse Republicans have made clear their intent to push through a \npermanent extension of all of the tax cuts included in the President's \nbill last year. The first of those extensions, and the one that we are \nconsidering today, is a permanent repeal of the estate tax.\n  Yet there could not be a worse time to consider full repeal of the \nestate tax than right now. The latest estimates project full repeal of \nthe estate tax will cost the federal government over $740 billion \nbetween 2011 and 2020. Although it is my hope that we will be able to \npermanently extend the repeal at an appropriate time before it is set \nto expire in 2010, we are in no position today to do that and cope with \nmajor outlays for defense and homeland security, as well as threats to \nfunding for Social Security and Medicare.\n  Earlier today, I voted in support of Senator Dorgan's amendment as a \ngood compromise on this issue, and because it goes a long way toward \naddressing one of my major concern with estate tax: that it puts \nfamily-owned businesses and farms at risk of sale or closure simply \nbecause heirs are forced to sell in order to pay the estate tax bill.\n  In addition to permanently extending an increased unified credit of \n$4 million per individual and $8 million per couple, Senator Dorgan's \namendment provides relief to small business and family farm owners who \nsuffer the most under current law by providing an unlimited exemption \nfrom the federal estate tax to small business owners and farmers. This \nwould ensure that this tax no longer threatens anyone wishing to pass \non a family-owned business to his or her heirs.\n  Under current law, the unified credit is set to increase to $3.5 \nmillion by 2009, but the Qualified Family Owned Business Interest \nexemption will expire in 2004, removing what few safeguards are in \nplace to protect those whose assets are tied up in family-owned farms \nor businesses.\n  I am particularly concerned about protecting these businesses because \nof the relatively high value of California farm land. The value of an \norange grove in Ventura, CA may be as high as $15,000 per acre due to \nlocal development pressures, compared with a price of $1,500-2,000 per \nacre for corn-growing land in a mid-western state.\n  As a result, even a medium-sized California farm of 400 to 500 acres \nmay be liable for a hefty estate tax bill, especially when the value of \nfarm buildings and other capital investments are factored in.\n  The estate tax may make it impossible for a family farm to be passed \ndown from generation to generation. No one should be forced to sell the \nfamily farm just to pay the estate tax.\n  Small business owners are equally at risk, and those who own and \noperate capital-intensive businesses must bear an exceptional burden. \nWhile the issue of small business liability under the estate tax has \noften been represented as affecting a tiny minority of Americans, in \nfact there may be many small business owners who sell or transfer their \nbusinesses in expectation of their heirs having to pay the tax.\n  Additionally, the sale of family-owned businesses, particularly to \nlarger conglomerates, threatens the jobs of thousands of Americans who \nare employed by those businesses. Even those businesses that can cover \ntheir tax liability may have to take on a large debt burden that \nthreatens their competitiveness and delays efforts to expand or grow \nthe business.\n  The Dorgan amendment would have resolved this problem by uncapping \nthe Qualified Family Owned Business Interest exemption entirely, but it \nalso would have raised the individual exemption to $4 million in 2010. \nBy providing this much-needed relief, the amendment would have limited \nestate tax liability to a tiny fraction of wealthy Americans who have \nlarge holdings of marketable assets.\n  Regrettably, the Dorgan amendment did not pass, and we are faced with \nan unfortunate choice between full repeal\n\n[[Page S5429]]\n\nand the limited relief passed as a part of the President tax package \nlast year.\n  I very much look forward to a time when the Senate can vote for full \nrepeal of the estate tax with a clear conscience, knowing that a vote \nto repeal the estate tax is not a vote against fiscal responsibility. \nTo vote for full repeal today would be to turn a blind eye to such \nresponsibility, and to move forward guided only by the kind of \nirrational optimism that was so readily propounded only a year or two \nago.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. One year ago, America had a projected budget surplus of \n2.7 trillion dollars over the next 10 years.\n  The stock market was soaring.\n  The question before us was one that most leaders could only dream of: \n``What should we do with our prosperity?''\n  At that time, the debate was focused on tax cuts, how much, for whom, \nand could we also provide for America's unmet needs?\n  Nine months ago yesterday, more than 3,000 innocent men and women \nlost their lives to terrorism.\n  In the months since, an anthrax attack and recent disclosures have \nrevealed holes in our homeland security. The collapse of Enron has \nraised questions about our system of corporate governance and we are \nsoon to begin perhaps the most dramatic restructuring of government in \nhalf a century.\n  All of this has occurred against the backdrop of massive demographic \nchanges that will transform the face of our nation for decades to come.\n  In 2008, the first of the Baby Boomers will begin retiring. By 2015, \n50 million seniors will be drawing benefits from Social Security. \nPrescription drugs are becoming a more and more vital part of American \nhealth care, and we need to find a way for Medicare to help pay for \nthem.\n  At the same time we're facing a senior boom, we're also facing a \nyouth boom. School enrollments are already at record levels, and will \ncontinue to rise every year for the next 8 years.\n  So here is where we are: The surplus is gone.\n  The Treasury is borrowing money and spending Social Security funds to \npay for the daily functions of government.\n  We have just passed a bill to allow America to take on even greater \ndebt. The baby boomers are preparing to retire.\n  More children than ever are moving through our schools.\n  Investors have had their confidence in American business shaken.\n  We are in the midst of confronting new--and previously unimaginable \nthreats to our nation.\n  We are at war.\n  The question facing America is no longer, ``What should we do with \nour prosperity?'' The question now is: ``How do we protect our \ncitizens, strengthen an ailing economy, prepare for the future, and win \nthis war against terrorism?''\n  I believe history will judge this Congress by how well we answer that \nquestion.\n  And I believe every action we take should keep those four key goals \nin mind.\n  Today, we are debating, once again, what seems to be the Republican \nParty's only solution to all of these problems--more tax cuts.\n  Specifically, we are debating a permanent repeal of the estate tax, \nan idea that could not be more at odds with the priorities of the \nnation at this critical time.\n  It is bad public policy. It is unfair. It will undermine Social \nSecurity, depress American philanthropy, hurt state budgets, and make \nit more difficult to meet every other challenge we face.\n  And I want to be especially clear that there is a vast difference \nbetween fairly protecting family farms and small businesses on one \nhand, and blindly destroying our fiscal balance on the other.\n  Repealing the estate tax will cost $99 billion over the next decade, \nand $740 billion in the decade after that.\n  Most of that will come from the Social Security trust fund. If you \nlook out over the next 75 years, the cost of repealing the estate tax \nwill account for nearly 40 percent of the entire shortfall in the \nSocial Security Trust Fund.\n  And who benefits? The wealthiest two percent of American estates. By \n2009, it will be the wealthiest one half of one percent of all estates.\n  What we're talking about is diverting the Social Security \ncontributions of millions of American workers to fund a massive tax cut \nfor the most fortunate of the fortunate few.\n  And sometimes it's the fraudulent few.\n  Yesterday, Senator Conrad had a chart here on the floor showing \nJeffrey Skilling, a former CEO of Enron, stands to gain $55 million \nfrom the repeal of the estate tax. That $55 million will be composed of \nthe Social Security contributions of 30,000 working Americans earning \n$30,000 a year.\n  We've been hearing a number of arguments in favor of estate tax \nrepeal from our Republican colleagues, so let me just take a minute and \naddress a couple of the issues they raise.\n  They argue that the estate tax forces the sale of family farms and \nbusinesses. Some agriculture organizations have said that it is \nimportant to repeal the estate tax, but when asked if they could cite \nwhen asked if they could cite a single example of a farm lost because \nof estate taxes, they couldn't name one, not one.\n  As Neil Harl, an Iowa State University economist who has studied the \nissue extensively, said simply, ``It's a myth.''\n  And here's why: in Iowa, the average farm is worth $1.2 million. In \nSouth Dakota it's just over $500,000. Family farms simply do not fall \nvictim to the estate tax.\n  The same goes for family businesses. In the few cases where family \nbusinesses are subject to the estate tax, it is usually because that \nbusiness is just one part of a larger estate.\n  But just to make sure that family farms and small businesses aren't \nhurt, we're proposing an alternative that will exempt virtually every \nfamily farm and small business from the estate tax.\n  Family farms and small businesses define us as a nation. We've never \nseen it demonstrated that they are being broken up by the estate tax, \nbut, just in case, we're going to see to it that they never will be.\n  Others have argued that the estate tax is un-American, that it is a \npenalty for success. The history of the estate tax shows the exact \nopposite is true.\n  Not only does the estate tax encourage economic success based on \nmerit rather than birthright--it is a demonstration that those who have \ndone well by this nation have a special obligation to contribute to its \ncontinued success--and its defense.\n  In his 1906 State of the Union, President Theodore Roosevelt, a \nRepublican, proposed the estate tax to help finance the war debts of \nthe 19th century, saying, ``The man of great wealth owes a peculiar \nobligation to the State, because he derives special advantages from the \nmere existence of government.''\n  To single out the estate tax for elimination in the midst of this \ncurrent war goes against the intent, and the history, of this policy.\n  Those arguments may be false. But there are some powerful and \ndisturbing truths about making the estate tax repeal permanent.\n  In the short term, it costs $99 billion.\n  Just yesterday, we passed an increase in the debt limit in part so we \ncould meet the new security demands we're facing in an increasingly \nuncertain and threatening world.\n  If giving a handful of multi-millionaires and billionaires another \ntax break requires a choice between more debt and less security--that \nshould be a clear signal that the price is simply too high.\n  In the longer term, we will feel the full brunt of this repeal at \nexactly the time the baby boomers begin to retire. We know that, 10 \nyears from now, we are going to need some fiscal flexibility to start \npaying the retirement benefits to the biggest retirement population \nthat's ever passed through the system, and yet some want to succumb to \nfiscal irresponsibility at precisely the time we can least afford it.\n  We have all heard the old saying, ``When you find yourself in a hole, \nstop digging.''\n  Well, it is time for us to stop digging a deeper hole, and start \ngetting serious about the problems we face.\n  Last March, a farmer named John Sumpton, from Frederick, SD, came to \ntestify before the Senate Finance Committee.\n\n[[Page S5430]]\n\n  ``Mr Chairman,'' he said, ``I am not an expert on tax law, but I know \nabout family farmers. They are my friends and neighbors. They are not \nworried about estate taxes, because, for the most part, they don't have \nto pay them. They are worried, however, about the prices they receive \nfor their crops and livestock, about good public schools for their \nkids, about local community services, paying for prescription drugs, \nand being able to pay their bills in retirement. And, of course, they \nare always worried about the weather.''\n  He continued: ``I fear we may not be able to do the things we want \nand need for our communities if we repeal the federal estate tax. To \nme, it doesn't seem responsible to eliminate the estate tax for \neveryone, including billionaires, when they don't need the help. A more \ntargeted approach that helps families better address this issue now, \nwhile retaining more resources for other needed public investments to \nimprove our future, seems a more practical and appropriate course of \naction.''\n  John Sumpton is right.\n  And I hope the Senate will heed his sensible advice.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding me this \ntime.\n  As did a number of my colleagues in the Senate, I served as the \nGovernor of my State before I was privileged to come to the Senate. As \na Governor of my State, I was a supporter of tax cuts. We cut taxes for \n7 years in a row. In fact, we eliminated the gift and inheritance tax \naltogether. While we cut taxes 7 years in a row, we also balanced the \nbudget 8 years in a row. We also were able to slow the growth of debt \nin our State. We earned ourselves a AAA credit rating for the first \ntime in Delaware history.\n  Others have spoken to the equity and the fairness of eliminating \naltogether the estate tax. I will leave those arguments to those who \nhave already spoken. I simply want us to keep this in mind. There is an \nold theory called a theory of holes. It goes something like this: When \nyou find yourself in a hole, stop digging.\n  To have voted yesterday to raise the debt ceiling by another $450 \nbillion and then to turn around and cut taxes in a way that will only \nincrease our indebtedness is a matter of concern to me and ought to be \nto all. Our Republican friends are right: We cannot simply be opposed \nto cutting taxes in ways that perhaps are unfair in this case and turn \naround and simply vote to increase spending.\n  I had a good long conversation with one of our Republican colleagues \non the phone last night about this body and about our propensity to \nspend ever more money for defense, for homeland defense, more money for \nsocial programs, good social programs, and at the same time, voting to \ncut taxes. It does not add up. I do not know how to stop it.\n  I want to put down a marker today and say it is something that is not \na sustainable policy, and one I hope we will not continue.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. WELLSTONE). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to speak strongly in opposition to \nthe Gramm amendment. I am in the group of folks who believe we need \nreform, not repeal. There are some positive things we should do with \nrespect to the estate tax. However, I find it terribly difficult \nknowing the meritocracy of America that I think provides opportunity to \nall, that we are voting to create something that is against the \nprinciples and buildup of aristocracy, contrary to at least the America \nI understand.\n  I believe that is why we have seen many people who have benefited so \nmuch from our society because they have been able to live in a free \nAmerica where they had access and equal opportunity and a public \neducational system, infrastructure that worked positively for folks, \nthat they feel very strongly there is a responsibility to give back by \nthose who have been blessed with their lives.\n  Quite frankly, it is one of the things that helped in my own life. I \nthink about the schoolteachers in the rural community in which I grew \nup who gave me the access to the American promise. I believe America is \nabout meritocracy, not aristocracy. It is about community, and \ncommunity-wide interests--not just the interest of the few.\n  We have heard the statistics about how narrow a slice of America \nbenefits from this action. This is a period of sacrifice in America, \nwhen we are asking men and women to go overseas to protect us. We are \nasking others to sacrifice on our investments in education and our \nprotections in the environment and all kinds of things that make sense \nin a choice situation, to go in a direction where the few are benefited \nto the exclusion of the many. This is very difficult.\n  I would be remiss if I did not bring it up in the context of \nsomething about which I deeply care; that is, protecting the integrity \nof our Social Security and Medicare systems. People will say there are \nother choices on spending. But we have a very clear choice where we \nprovide for those who benefited the most from the American system to be \nable to use our Social Security funds and Medicare funds that we raise \nand directly expend it on something that, in a period of sacrifice, is \nhard to understand--why our priorities and why our choices are here.\n  This is a moral issue about priorities in this Nation, making sure we \nare funding special education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time for debate \non this matter be extended 10 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I close debate on our side by pointing out \nthat we are not making these decisions in a vacuum. We have to consider \nthe fiscal condition of the country when we make any spending decision \nor any additional tax cuts.\n  The fact is, last year we were told we had trillions of dollars of \nsurplus over the next 10 years. Now we see those surpluses are gone. \nThey have evaporated. Instead, we are going to be running massive \ndeficits--this year, a $320 billion deficit.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma said it would be unconscionable to keep \nthis tax. I think it would be unconscionable to drive this country into \ndeeper deficit and deeper debt. That is precisely what the amendment of \nour colleagues on the other side does. It is very clear the cost of \nestate tax repeal explodes in the second decade. Not only does it cost \n$100 billion in this decade, every penny of which is coming out of the \nSocial Security trust fund, but in the second 10 years, it costs $740 \nbillion right at the time the baby boomers start to retire, right at \nthe time there will be unprecedented demands on Social Security and \nMedicare and, God forbid, on the needs of the defense of this Nation.\n  This is the most irresponsible amendment offered on the floor of the \nSenate this year. It would gut the fiscal condition of this country \nwhen we know it is already teetering.\n  Instead of repeal, we ought to reform this tax. Yes, the estate tax \nbites at too low a level. So I recommend in my amendment we give an \nexemption of $3 million for an individual, $6 million for a couple, \nbeginning next year. For 2009 and thereafter, the exemption increases \nto $3.5 million for an individual, $7 million for a couple. This saves \nhundreds of billions in the second decade and saves huge amounts of \nmoney in this decade, as well. By 2009, only .3 of 1 percent of estates \nface any estate tax liability under my amendment.\n  In this decade, there is a big difference between these two \napproaches, the cost of the Republican proposal is $99.4 billion; the \ncost of my proposal is $12.6 billion.\n  Under my proposal only .3 percent of estates in this country are \nsubject to tax. Not only is it a question of affordability, it is also \na question of fairness. Again, my colleague from Oklahoma says it is \nunconscionable to ask the wealthiest among us to contribute to the \nfiscal health of the Nation. I don't think it is unreasonable.\n  President Theodore Roosevelt, one of the greatest Republican \nPresidents, did\n\n[[Page S5431]]\n\nnot think it was unreasonable. President Abraham Lincoln, one of the \ngreatest Republican Presidents did not think it was unreasonable. I \nthink it is unreasonable to say to the American people that we ought to \ngive Mr. Skilling, who ran Enron, a $55 million tax cut and finance it \nby asking 33,000 Americans, earning $30,000 a year, to put all of their \nSocial Security taxes into the pot so we can give Mr. Skilling a $55 \nmillion tax cut.\n  I do not think that is fair. Not only do I not think it is fair, the \nAmerican people do not think it is fair. In a poll released today by \nthe Fair Estate Tax Coalition, they showed that 58 percent of the \nAmerican people favor reform over repeal. Mr. President, 37 percent \nfavor repeal, 58 percent favor reform.\n\n  It is very interesting; in this poll what they found, under Federal \nbudget priorities, is the people of this country overwhelmingly say \nstrengthening Medicare and Social Security is No. 1, 38 percent; \nincreasing spending for education, 33 percent; giving seniors a \nprescription drug benefit, 29 percent; increasing funding for \nchildren's health, 18 percent; retiring the national debt, 16 percent; \ncutting taxes, 16 percent.\n  What tax cuts do they favor? And that is only 16 percent of the \nAmerican people who say that is their priority; eliminating the estate \ntax is the bottom of the barrel. They prefer cutting taxes for \nmoderate- to low-income Americans, eliminating the marriage penalty, a \ncapital gains tax cut; dead last is eliminating the estate tax.\n  This is a fundamental question. Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Theodore \nRoosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin Roosevelt supported inheritance \ntaxes because without them this country would move further from \ndemocracy and closer to aristocracy.\n  This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the heritage of America. \nMeritocracy, not aristocracy; reform yes, repeal no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time do we have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes, twenty-five seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Why don't I take 10 minutes, and I will give my colleagues \n10 minutes.\n  Let me just begin by sort of straightening a little history out. The \ndeath tax started in America through a Stamp Act on wills when we had \nan undeclared war with France. It was repealed right after the tensions \nwith France ended but was reimposed during the Civil War. Abraham \nLincoln did not impose a death tax because he wanted to take away \npeople's inheritance in America. He imposed it, along with a lot of \nother taxes before we had an income tax, to try to save the Union. It \ntoo was repealed when the war was over.\n  We reimposed the death tax during the Spanish-American War, and \nrepealed it when the war was over. Finally, it was imposed during World \nWar I. We had a battle between the President and the Congress over the \nLeague Of Nations. It ended up not being repealed, and it still plagues \nus today. That is the history of the death tax.\n  Let me also say to my colleagues that this is an old issue and it is \nan old issue between the two great political parties. In 1981, when \nRonald Reagan came to Washington, part of his tax cut was to raise the \nexemption--the amount of wealth in your business or your farm or your \nestate you could protect from taxes--from $175,000 to $600,000. The \nsame arguments made by the same Democrats were made at that time. They \nsaid it was wrong to raise the exemption to $600,000. Had they \nprevailed 20 years ago, the exemption would be $175,000 today.\n\n  Ten years ago, Congressman Gephardt and Congressman Waxman proposed \nlowering the exemption--that is, the amount of your farm or your \nbusiness or your estate that you could pass to your children without it \nbeing taxed--from $600,000 to $200,000.\n  Our colleagues basically admit this is a cancer on the economy--but \nthey only want to take part of it out, not all of it out. The problem \nis, 10 years ago members of their party were trying to lower the \ndeductible and raise the tax. We want to take the whole cancer out \nbecause we believe it will come back if we do not.\n  Finally, in 1997--which is not that long ago--32 Democrat Members of \nthe Senate voted against raising the exemption to $1 million.\n  We have had a lot of talk today about rich folks and who is rich and \nwho is not rich. Sometimes it is awfully hard to tell. But I do want to \nuse this figure. Iowa is a farm State. They have 80,000 farms. It is \nestimated that 30,000 of those farms today are valuable enough that if \nthe owner of the farm died, their children would have to pay a death \ntax. That is almost 40 percent of the farms in Iowa.\n  Look, there are some people who are bothered by the fact that some \npeople become successful in America and make money. I am not one of \nthem. If someone became very rich, started a business in College \nStation, had 200 employees, had $10 million worth of machines and plant \nand equipment and trucks, and they died--our Democrat colleagues say \nthey are rich. But is America richer if we take $5.5 million from them, \nmake them sell the business, sell the trucks, sell the equipment, make \ntheir children do all that to give the Government $5.5 million in \ntaxes? Are we not better off leaving that $5.5 million at work in \nCollege Station than we are destroying that business and bringing it to \nWashington?\n  Sure, the family is rich. But is America richer or poorer by \ndestroying it? Can we build up one family by tearing down another? I do \nnot think so.\n  I mentioned earlier in the debate--I want to mention it again--I have \nbeen bequeathed only one thing in my life. My Great Uncle Bill, my \ngrandmother's brother, died and left me in his will a cardboard \nsuitcase. I am proud to say I still have it today. It had yellow sports \nclippings from the 1950s in it. If they had been baseball cards, I \nwould be a rich man today.\n  If all my relatives I know of left me everything they own, I do not \nbelieve I would qualify to pay the estate tax.\n  So why do I feel so strongly about repealing the death tax? For the \nsimplest of all reasons--it is wrong. It is wrong. It is not right, no \nmatter whether somebody is Bill Gates or Dicky Flatt, who owns a print \nshop in Mexia, TX, and who never gets that blue ink off the end of his \nfingers. It is wrong, when they die, to make their children sell off \ntheir life's work to give Government 55 cents out of every dollar they \nhave accumulated in their lives. They work, they save, they scrimp--\nDicky Flatt gets up early in the morning, he works on Saturday. \nEverything he owns he plows back into that business. He sent his \nchildren to Texas A They have come back into the business.\n  Dicky's daddy worked there, his momma worked there, he works there, \nhis wife works there, his son works there, his son's daughter worked \nthere, and they plow everything they can back into their business. I do \nnot know what it is worth. But I know whom it belongs to. I know who \nbuilt it.\n  How is it right, after they have done all that work, made all those \nsacrifices, scrimped and saved, lived far below the level they could \nlive if they chose to spend their money--why is it right to take it \naway from them just because they earned it? That is what this issue is \nabout. It is not about being rich versus being poor. It is about right \nversus wrong. It is wrong when people who pay taxes on every dollar \nthey earn, who have plowed it back into their businesses or farms or \nestates, to destroy all that when they die.\n  Death should not be a taxable event. It is hard enough to face dying, \nwithout having to know that your children are going to lose what you \nhave built.\n  Every day, people are spending billions of dollars to try to get \naround this tax. Talented people are retiring when they are 55 years \nold because they know the Government is going to take the fruits of \ntheir labor away from their children. People are selling off farms to \ntry to plan their estates. They are shutting down businesses to divide \nup the assets ahead of time so they do not have to pay the taxes, and \nAmerica is poorer for it.\n  We have heard a bunch of speeches from my colleagues. They believe \nwhat they believe. I believe what I believe. Who is to say who is \nright?\n  But I will say this. Over and over, we have heard people get up on \nthe floor and say we can't afford this. I would just like to remind my \ncolleagues that last Thursday--I hope I am not stretching their \nmemory--last Thursday we\n\n[[Page S5432]]\n\nspent $14 billion the President did not ask for, for nonemergency \nmatters. That is four times as much, over the next 2 years, as \nrepealing the death tax permanently would cost. So the same people who \nsay we cannot afford to make the repeal of the death tax permanent, \nthey could afford to spend four times that much last Thursday on \nunrequested programs, but they cannot afford it today.\n  When we passed the farm bill, they could afford to spend seven times \nas much as it would cost next year to repeal the death tax, but they \ncan't afford it today.\n  On the energy bill, they could spend more than enough to pay for it, \nbut they can't afford it today.\n  When we added all those riders to the trade bill, they could spend \nmore than it would cost next year to repeal the death tax, but they \ncan't afford it today.\n  When they wrote this budget, they asked for $106 billion of new \ndiscretionary nondefense spending. We have heard all of this talk about \nthe war and fighting the war. When they wrote this budget, they spent \n$106 billion more than the President asked for. Yet today they cannot \nafford to make the death tax repeal permanent.\n  It is a matter of priorities. It is a matter of what you think is of \na higher order.\n  What my Democrat colleagues, with very few exceptions, have said \nindirectly, without saying it just flat out, is the following: They are \nwilling to force people to sell off their businesses and farms to give \nthe Government the money because they want to spend it. They think that \nis more important than leaving those businesses and farms intact.\n  I believe they are wrong. I believe the American people believe they \nare wrong. I think this is something that we need to do. I commend it \nto my colleagues.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to my colleague from Arizona. I \nthank him for his leadership on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Texas for \nsponsoring this amendment and for making the arguments which I believe \nwill result in this body finally voting to making permanent what we \nvoted for just a year ago.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that 48 Republicans and 12 Democrats--\n56 of us in all--voted to repeal the death tax. There were two other \nRepublican Senators who were not here but would have voted to do that. \nThat is 58 of us. It passed in the House of Representatives. The \nPresident signed it into law.\n  By now we all know, however, that because of the rules under which we \noperate, all of the tax relief we provided sunset at the end of 10 \nyears.\n  It is for that reason only that we have to come back and revisit this \ntoday. The good news is we have a chance today to make what we did \nbefore permanent.\n  I submit that unless Senators want to say to their constituents, ``I \nwas just kidding when I voted to repeal the death tax,'' that those who \nvoted to repeal it before are going to have to vote to repeal it again, \nand this time to make it permanent, or else we will perpetuate this \nhoax.\n  I have heard a lot of talk about meritrocracy and aristocracy. I \nwould like to talk about the American dream.\n  I prefer to go back a couple of generations when immigrants came to \nthis country. They brought the ethic of hard work and savings and \ninvestment. By the way, investment means job creation. We all know \nthat. But they worked very hard because they wanted to be able to give \ntheir kids and their grandkids a better chance and more opportunity \nthan they themselves had.\n  That is what this country is all about. That is why people have \nsacrificed a lot--as Senator Gramm said, to be able to leave their kids \nsomething. That is the American dream.\n\n  When we talk about doing something for the rich, they are not \nlistening to the debate. The rich man died. He is not rich anymore. He \nis not even alive anymore. He died. So who pays the death tax? His \nkids, usually. Who are they? Are they rich people?\n  I have said this before. Let me say it again. This is from the \nInternal Revenue Service. These are the official statistics of the IRS. \nThey answer the question about who actually pays. They break it out by \nmen and women. This, by the way, is their latest statistics, Statistics \nof Income Bulletin, Summer of 1999, pages 72-76.\n  The largest group are men: 27.7 percent were administrators, upper \nmanagement, and business owners. That you would expect. That is only 27 \npercent.\n  Who is the next group? The second largest group of men, 12.3 percent, \nwere schoolteachers, librarians, and guidance counselors--these filthy \nrich who deserve to be punished. Maybe their dad had accumulated a lot \nof wealth. These are not rich people. But their dad is maybe giving \nthem an opportunity to invest some of that money, maybe, to start a \nsmall business of their own, or to do something more with it to create \njobs and to help make this American dream come true.\n  How about women? As we know, the majority of small businesses in this \ncountry are owned by women. For females, the IRS statistics say that \nthe largest group--14.1 percent--were educators and teachers. These are \npeople who are paying the death tax. These are the women who are paying \nthe death tax.\n  The next largest group--9.6--were in clerical and administrative \nsupport occupations.\n  If you want to analyze all of the occupations, a significant number \nof the estate tax filers were scientists, sales people, entertainers, \nairline pilots, military officers, and mechanics. These are the estate \ntax filers.\n  These are the people we want to punish. It is not fair. These people \ndeserve to be treated just as fairly as anybody else in this country.\n  Again, according to the Internal Revenue Service, in 1999, 116,500 \nestate tax returns were filed; 60,700 of those--in other words, more \nthan half--were filed by estates with values of less than $1 million. \nFor estates valued between $1 million and $5 million, 50,600 were \nfiled. That is just about all that is left. Above $5 million, there \nwere only 5,200 of those estates.\n  Even combined, the millionaires filing do not exceed the \nnonmillionaires filing.\n  The vast bulk of these, in other words, are by people who do not have \nthese multibillion-dollar kinds of patina, or even multimillion-dollar \nkinds of patina that people would like to create.\n  What kind of people are they? What is their money? The Senator from \nNew York talked about the salaries of all of these rich entrepreneurs. \nThey are paying income taxes on those salaries, I might add. We are \ntalking about the estate tax, the death tax--not income tax.\n  I talked this morning about Brad Eiffert who with his dad owns the \nBoone County Lumber Company in Columbus, MO. He doesn't make very much \nin salary every year. They do not have any cash to speak of because \nthey put all of their money back into the Boone County Lumber Company. \nThey go to the bank and borrow money to buy lumber which they sell. \nThey buy trucks and forklifts.\n  They do the same thing we do. We don't go out and buy a house with \ncash. We go get a mortgage loan from the bank.\n  For much of what they own they have borrowed the money. But they make \nenough money to pay themselves a salary to live on--the dad and the \nson--and to hire 30 people whose salaries they pay. That is 30 more \nfamilies that benefit. When the dad dies, Brad is concerned that he \ndoesn't have the cash around to pay half of the value of the estate. It \nis not his income that gets taxed. It is the value of the entire \nbusiness; that is, all of the lumber inventory, trucks, forklifts, the \nwarehouse, and the whole thing.\n  Take that whole value and he says: I don't have that much money to \npay half of that to Uncle Sam when my dad dies. Where am I going to get \nit? I can't borrow. I am fully leveraged. I have done the financing. I \nwill have to sell the business to pay the tax.\n  That is what this is all about. That is why it is so unfair.\n  Job creation--well, those jobs are gone. I suppose if you sell it to \nsomebody else and the idea is to prevent the accumulation of wealth, \nyou usually sell it to a large corporation. So instead of a family \nbusiness, you have some large conglomerate that may let\n\n[[Page S5433]]\n\npeople go and consolidate, or whatever. So much for the American dream. \nSo much for consolidation of wealth.\n  How would you say this money ought to be taxed, somehow or other? My \ncolleague from Texas already pointed out that income tax has been paid \non it.\n  But I don't think what our colleagues realize is, we don't just \nrepeal the estate tax, we substitute another tax for that, the capital \ngains tax, but with a big difference. Most of us agree that death \nshould not be a taxable event. You did not have any choice in the \nmatter, of the timing of it, how it happened, when it happened, and so \non. You do have a choice over when you sell something or don't sell it, \nand you know what the tax consequences are.\n  So when your dad dies, instead of the kids having to pay a tax on \nhalf of the value of his estate, and having to sell assets to do it, \nand so on, under our proposal the estate passes to the heirs. They take \nthe property. They do not pay the tax on death day. But when they sell \nany of it, they pay a tax. They pay a tax on the capital gains, and it \nis calculated on the basis of dad's purchase price. So that is how you \npick up the revenue.\n  Mr. President, 60 percent of the American people realize this is \nunfair, and three-fourths of them say they favor its repeal, even \nthough they would not benefit at all. They understand the unfairness of \nthe existing tax.\n  We now have an opportunity to make permanent what we passed before, \nwhich is the repeal of the estate tax, and to substitute for us the \nvery fair capital gains tax on the original basis of the property. That \nis what we have the opportunity to do. The House of Representatives has \npassed this measure. If we pass it today, it goes to the President, and \nhe can sign it. He has asked us to send it to him so he can sign it, to \nend this unfair tax and replace it with a fair tax.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Conrad amendment, to vote \nfor the Gramm-Kyl amendment, and to have a fair tax in the United \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3831\n\n  Under the previous order, there are 5 minutes of debate evenly \ndivided before a vote with respect to the Conrad amendment.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will speak first because I think Senator \nConrad deserves the right to close out on his amendment.\n  I think this issue has been pretty well debated. I agree with the \nDemocratic floor leader, Senator Reid; I think it has been a good \ndebate.\n  The Conrad amendment does not repeal the death tax. It improves \ncurrent law by speeding up the process and making a nominal change in \nit, but it still leaves the structure of the system in place where we \nhave a tax on death.\n  I believe it is fundamentally wrong, and I am unwilling to get into a \ndebate about at what income level it is wrong. I have never accepted \nthe thesis that what is right for one American is wrong for another \nAmerican based on their income. Right is right and wrong is wrong where \nI come from.\n  I want to repeal the death tax. The Senator from North Dakota does \nnot. That is what it all boils down to.\n  It has been said over and over, as many ways as you can say it, I \nstill remain amazed that people who consistently vote for new spending \nnever have money when it comes time to let people keep more of what \nthey earn. But rather than reiterate all that, let me sum up and say we \nare going to have an opportunity, after we vote on Senator Conrad's \namendment, to repeal the death tax. There is only one real repeal, and \nthat is the one I have offered with Senator Kyl.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Conrad amendment and to vote \nfor the Gramm-Kyl amendment.\n  I believe we will get over 51 votes. As you know, because a point of \norder will be raised against the amendment, we will have to get 60. I \ndon't know that we will get 60 votes today, but I believe we are taking \na step toward repealing the death tax permanently. And I am confident \nthat it will be repealed.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Conrad estate \ntax reform amendment and oppose the Gramm-Kyl estate tax repeal \namendment. I want to compliment equally both sides in this debate, \nhowever. They have brought before the Senate a clear question about the \ndirection of U.S. tax policy--a question that the Senate should \naddress. Should the very richest families in this country be able to \npass their entire fortunes onto the next generation tax free? In a time \nof re-emerging budget deficits, urgent homeland defense needs, and a \nslowly recovering economy, is a tax break exclusively for the very \nrichest among us a good idea?\n  That is what this debate is about. Unfortunately, we have heard more \nabout other issues then that very basic question of how we tax the rich \nand the not so rich in this country.\n  We have heard that the votes today are about repealing a tax on those \nwho inherit that causes the break-up of family businesses or farms. It \nis not. The Conrad amendment raises the amount of an estate exempt from \ntax to $3.5 million, $7 million for a couple, by 2009. In Wisconsin, \nthat will completely exempt all but 0.2 percent of estates from any \ntaxes at all. So we are not arguing over estate taxes on the local \ndairy farm or the small business operating on Main Street. We all agree \nthey should be totally exempt, and under all proposals we consider \ntoday, they are.\n  No, the question today is should we go further than exempting small \nbusinesses, medium-sized businesses, and most all farms--certainly all \nWisconsin farms--from the estate tax? Should we enact a tax break for \nvery richest families in this country--less than 1 percent of all \nestates in this country? Or should we save the hundreds of billions of \ndollars that that tax break will cost--and use it to defend our country \nbetter, pass tax breaks that help the middle class working family, or \nsimply pay down our huge debt? I can think of many uses for billions of \ndollars better than passing a tax break that will benefit those that \ninherit $15 million but do nothing for those who inherit $15,000, \n$150,000, or even $1 milllion.\n  The choice is clear. It is time to reform the estate tax and exempt \n99 percent of all families from any worry of taxes after death. It is \nnot time--and I am not sure it ever will be--to give a multi-billion \ndollar break to a very small number of very rich families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we should reform, not repeal, the estate \ntax because repeal is unaffordable, it is unfair, and it is unpopular.\n  First, on the question of affordability: The cost of eliminating the \nestate tax absolutely explodes in the second decade. It costs $100 \nbillion in this 10-year period. It costs $740 billion in the second \ndecade, right at the time the baby boomers retire, and when we know we \nalready are in deep deficit and adding to the debt.\n  Just yesterday we added to the national debt by $450 billion. Our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle would dig that hole much deeper.\n  My proposal is far more affordable. Instead of $99.4 billion in the \nnext 10 years, $12.6 billion.\n  The elimination of the tax is unfair.\n  One example: Mr. Skilling, the former head of Enron, would get a $55 \nmillion tax cut, paid for by the Social Security taxes of 30,000 \nAmericans earning $30,000 a year.

Under the previous order, H.R. 8 is returned \nto the calendar.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I opposed full repeal of the \nestate tax, but I supported a commonsense compromise to cap the estate \ntax exemption at a reasonable level for all families, and eliminate the \ntax completely for family farmers and small business owners.\n  Full repeal of the estate tax is hugely expensive, it will cost \nnearly a trillion dollars over the next 20 years, it is grossly unfair \nbecause it benefits only the tiny number of Americans who pay the \nestate tax under current law. In fact, in 1999 only 636 Minnesotans \npaid any estate tax what so ever. Only 36 of those estates were valued \nat $5 million or more. This is simply not a burden that falls on many \nfamilies.\n  In contrast, many rely on Social Security. Over 740,000 Minnesotans \ncurrently receive Social Security. The vast majority of these are \nretired seniors, others are severely disabled. For many it is their \nonly source of income. I find it outrageous that colleagues are \nproposing to use the Social Security surplus, which nearly a million \nMinnesotans rely upon, to give a massive tax break to the heirs of a \nhandful of Americans.\n  Nationally, only 1.6 percent of all estates were made up with \nsignificant small business assets, and only 1.4 percent had significant \nfarm assets. This means that virtually all the estate tax is paid by \nextremely wealthy people who do not own farms or small businesses. It \nalso means that we could eliminate the estate tax for small businesses \nand farms and not engage in a massive raid on the Treasury.\n  Proponents of last year's massive tax cut portrayed the legislation \nas completely protecting small businesses and family farms from the \nestate tax. But as a cost saving gimmick, the law only does so for only \none year.\n  Business owners were used as pawns last year, and they are again this \nyear. Now they are frustrated trying to plan for their families' \nfutures around this scheme and they shouldn't have to be.\n  I supported a commonsense compromise that would have capped the \nestate exemption at a reasonable level, $8 million for a married \ncouple, lifting the burden of the estate tax from 98 percent of \nestates, but maintaining the tax for large, wealthy estates.\n  In addition, the Dorgan amendment would have totally exempted family-\nowned small business and farm assets from the estate tax if the family \nof the current owner wishes to continue to operate the business or \nfarm. Because this relief would have been permanent, business owners \ncan plan their affairs with confidence and security. And this complete \nrepeal for businesses and farms would be effective next year, unlike \nthe republican proposal where family business owners would have to wait \nuntil 2010.\n  In an ideal world I would have written the Dorgan amendment \ndifferently. I would strengthen the family-owned business provision to \nensure than only smaller business and farms, with 200 employees or less \nwould qualify for this exemption. But I voted for the Dorgan\n\n[[Page S5435]]\n\namendment because it is still far better than full repeal. It retains \nthe estate tax for the ultra-rich, but would protect small business \nowners and family farmers. And it would save hundreds of billions over \nthe next 20 years compared to full repeal.\n  Let me also point out one final irony in this debate. I mentioned \nyesterday the bizarreness of colleagues voting against raising the debt \nlimit, and then in the same day turning around and supporting a bill \nthat would raise the national debt by hundreds of thousands more.\n  Today's irony is that this is supposed to be a debate about small \nbusinesses, but my friends on the other side are opposing the Dorgan \namendment that gives permanent relief from the estate tax from small \nbusinesses and family farmers right now--compared to 7 years from now \nunder the Gramm approach. Let me repeat that, my colleagues on the \nother side say they are for the small business owner. They say they are \nfor the family farmer. Yet they are opposing immediate relief for small \nbusiness owners and farmers. Why? To protect their tax breaks for \nbillionaires.\n  Small businesses and farmers are the pawns in this debate. They have \nliterally been used by those who want to give billionaires a tax break. \nI don't know if there is a single person in this body who would oppose \ngiving permanent, targeted estate tax relief to small business owners \nand family farmers. I think it could pass 100 to 0. But it didn't \nbecause if the supporters of full repeal let the small business owner \nget relief then they lose this issue. And they won't get repeal for \nbillionaires. And they would rather have the issue to campaign on, and \nthey aren't going to let the little guy on Main Street get his tax \nbreak unless they can get it for the fat cat on Wall Street.\n  The Dorgan amendment should be an eye opener for small business \nowners and farmers. It betrays the real agenda behind full repeal of \nthe estate tax. It's not about the little guy. It is not about the \nshopkeeper, the farmer, the contractor, the wholesaler. They are the \nhostages in this debate.\n  I will not jeopardize Social Security--which tens of millions of \nAmericans rely upon for their retirement--to grant tax breaks to the \nheirs of multi-millionaires and billionaires.\n  We cannot afford to give a few lucky Americans a tax free inheritance \nof hundreds of millions or billions of dollars and protect the tens of \nmillions of Americans and over 740,000 Minnesotans who rely on Social \nSecurity.\n  But we can afford to shield small estates, small businesses, and \nfamily farms from the estate tax at the same time we safeguard the \nretirement security of all Minnesotans. That is what I voted to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5435-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. REID.

I further ask that Senator Brownback or his designee be \nrecognized to immediately offer a cloture motion on his bill, to be \nfollowed by Senator Hatch or his designee offering a cloture motion on \nhis bill. I further ask unanimous consent that no amendments or motions \nto commit be in order to either bill and there be the following \nlimitations for debate with respect to both bills: 3 hours equally \ndivided between the two sponsors or their designees on Friday; 4 hours \nequally divided in the same fashion on Monday, June 17; 1 hour equally \ndivided in the same fashion on Tuesday, June 18; that following the use \nor yielding back of time, on Tuesday, the Senate proceed to vote on the \ncloture motion on Senator Brownback's bill and, notwithstanding the \noutcome of that vote, to be followed by an immediate cloture vote on \nSenator Hatch's bill; further, if cloture is invoked on either bill, \nthe Senate then resume consideration under the provisions of rule XXII. \nFinally, I ask unanimous consent that, if cloture is not invoked on \neither bill, then each bill be placed back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nappreciate my colleague from Nevada bringing this forward. I hope we \ncan work out a reasonable and prudent way to address what I consider to \nbe a critical issue--many people consider to be a critical issue in \nfront of the country. I say we still may be able to get to an agreement \nthat would get ample time and opportunity for the Senate to speak on \nthis timely legislation.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent for the following modifications to \nthis pending request. I ask unanimous consent that on Friday, June 14, \nthe Senate proceed to the bill just mentioned, introduced by Senator \nKennedy, Senator Hatch, and others, and that Senator Landrieu, myself, \nand Senator Hutchison be permitted to offer up to four relevant \namendments to the bill; further, I ask unanimous consent that these \namendments be in order notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, and \nthat no other amendments be in order to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Then I am afraid I must object and I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am, of course, disappointed. Many people \nworked long and hard to come up with this agreement. Senator Daschle, I \nbelieve, has fulfilled his commitment. As I understand it, the only \ndispute is to when the respective votes should occur, and I submit that \nshouldn't matter that much, but that is the unanimous consent agreement \nthat was propounded. Senator Daschle has worked with others long and \nhard. Maybe later we can work something else out.

Reserving the right to object, I ultimately will not \nobject, but I want to propose that the unanimous consent request be \namended to read as follows: I ask unanimous consent that at a time \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar \nNo. 252, H.R. 3210, and it be considered under the following \nlimitations, the only amendments in order be the following: A \nsubstitute amendment by Senator Gramm and myself, the text of which \nwill be printed in the Record upon the granting of the consent; three \nrelevant first-degree amendments to the substitute to be offered by \neach leader or their designees, and that no motions to recommit be in \norder; I further ask unanimous consent that, following a vote on or in \nrelation to the above-listed first-degree amendments and any debate \ntime, there be a vote on or in relation to the substitute amendment; \nfinally, I ask unanimous consent that when and if the bill is passed, \nthe Senate then insist on its amendment and request a conference with \nthe House on the disagreeing votes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to respond to the Chair, \nI would simply say this: We have been through this now for months. I \nhave been down here on a number of occasions, trying to get something \nthat we believe will expedite this very important legislation. We have \ntried one amendment on each side, two amendments on each side, three \namendments on each side. I think we finally got to five amendments on \neach side. I think the best thing to do is just get to the bill. It is \nan important piece of legislation and if it is as important as the \nmajor industries believe it is, we are\n\n[[Page S5436]]\n\ngoing to complete this bill in a reasonable period of time. So I do not \nconsent to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Is there objection to the \nrequest from the Senator from Nevada?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am not going to object. I just want to say we are \nbringing up a bill that was not reported by the committee of \njurisdiction. There has been an effort underway by many of us to try to \nreach a bipartisan consensus, and it may very well be that this is the \nonly route we can take. I happen to be one of the people around here \nwho believes that we should have passed the bill last year. I was for a \nbill.\n  I would like to say today that this is a hard way to do it, and it is \ngoing to mean we are going to have to do a lot of amendments on the \nfloor that we should have done in committee. I hope, therefore, that we \nare not going to find ourselves in a position where we are going to \nhave an effort to cloture the bill.\n  If the bill had come out of committee, if there were some kind of \nconsensus, then I think you could understand that, if people were \nraising extraneous amendments. But I am hoping we are going to have \ntime for debate. I think there will be a real possibility that we will \nhave to have maybe 10 or 12 or 15 real amendments on the subject, \namendments on which we will have to work our will. I hope we will not \nhave that process cut off with cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Further reserving the right to object, let me add to \nwhat the Senator from Texas has said. Ultimately I will not object, \neither. But both of us believe that we have put together a proposal \nthat should have been the base bill. I think I can speak for the \nSenator from Texas and myself: We have some direction from the \nadministration now as to what kind of legislation they might ultimately \nsign. I have in my hand a letter addressed to the Republican leader, \nsigned by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the Director of the National Economic Council, \nand the Council of Economic Advisers indicating that a bill that makes \nthe victims of terrorist attacks a subject of punitive damages and that \nopens up this whole area for further predatory lawsuits will not be \nsigned by the President. They will recommend to the President a veto.\n  I share the view of the Senator from Texas that the amendments to \nthis bill certainly ought to be germane to the subject. The amendments \nthat this Senator is going to offer will certainly be germane to the \nsubject. Just so everybody will know what the Senator from Texas and I \nhad put together, what we thought would be the best way to go as the \nbest bill that will be available to everyone, I ask unanimous consent \nto have two things printed in the Record: First, the letter signed by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, dated June 10.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2002.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The War on Terrorism must be fought on \n     many fronts. From an economic perspective, we must minimize \n     the risks and consequences associated with potential acts of \n     terror. No measure is more important to mitigating the \n     economic effects of terrorist events than the passage of \n     terrorism insurance legislation.\n       Last November 1, the Administration publicly agreed to \n     bipartisan legislation negotiated with Chairman Sarbanes, \n     Chairman Dodd, Senator Gramm and Senator Enzi. While the \n     House of Representatives quickly responded to this urgent \n     need by passing appropriate legislation, the Senate did not \n     act and has not passed any form of terrorism legislation in \n     the intervening seven months.\n       The absence of federal legislation is having a palpable and \n     severe effect on our economy and is costing America's workers \n     their jobs. In the first quarter of this year, commercial \n     real estate construction was down 20 percent. The disruption \n     of terrorism coverage makes it more difficult to operate, \n     acquire, or refinance property, leading to diminished bank \n     lending for new construction projects and lower asset values \n     for existing properties. The Bond Market Association has said \n     that more than $7 billion worth of commercial real estate \n     activity has been suspended or cancelled due to the lack of \n     such insurance. Last week, Moody's Investors Service \n     announced that 14 commercial mortgage-backed transactions \n     could be downgraded due to a lack of such insurance.\n       Without such insurance, the economic impact of another \n     terrorist attack would be much larger, including major \n     bankruptcies, layoffs and loan defaults. While we are doing \n     everything we can to stop another attack, we should minimize \n     the widespread economic damage to our economy should such an \n     event occur.\n       One important issue for the availability of terrorism \n     insurance is the risk of unfair or excessive litigation \n     against American companies following an attack. Many for-\n     profit and charitable entities have been unable to obtain \n     affordable and adequate insurance, in part because of the \n     risk that they will be unfairly sued for the acts of \n     international terrorists.\n       To address this risk at least two important provisions are \n     essential. First, provisions for an exclusive federal cause \n     of action and consolidation of all cases arising out of \n     terrorist attacks, like those included in the Air \n     Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, are \n     necessary to provide for reasonable and expeditious \n     litigation.\n       Second, the victims of terrorism should not have to pay \n     punitive damages. Punitive damages are designed to punish \n     criminal or near-criminal wrongdoing. Of course such \n     sanctions are appropriate for terrorists. But American \n     companies that are attacked by terrorists should not be \n     subject to predatory lawsuits. The availability of punitive \n     damages in terrorism cases would result in inequitable relief \n     for injured parties, threaten bankruptcies for American \n     companies and a loss of jobs for American workers.\n       It is also clear that the potential for massive damages \n     imposed on companies that suffer from acts of terror would \n     endanger our economic recovery from a terrorist attack. \n     Indeed, the added risks and legal uncertainty hanging over \n     the economy as a result of last September 11th are major \n     factors inhibiting a business willingness to invest and to \n     create jobs. It makes little economic sense to pass a \n     terrorism insurance bill that leaves our economy exposed to \n     such inappropriate and needless legal uncertainty.\n       The bipartisan public agreement reached between the \n     Administration and Chairman Sarbanes, Chairman Dodd, Senator \n     Gramm and Senator Enzi last fall provided these minimum \n     safeguards. We would recommend that the President not sign \n     any legislation that leaves the American economy and victims \n     of terrorist acts subject to predatory lawsuits and punitive \n     damages.\n       The American people and our economy have waited seven \n     months since our public agreement on legislation. The process \n     must move forward. Prompt action by the Senate on this \n     vitally important legislation is needed now.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul H. O'Neill,\n       Secretary of the Treasury.\n     Mitchell E. Daniels,\n       Director, Office of Management and Budget.\n     Lawrence Lindsey,\n       Director, National Economic Council.\n     R. Glenn Hubbard,\n       Director, Council of Economic Advisors.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We would like also to include the bill that Senator \nGramm and I had hoped would be the base bill that we took up, one that \nwe are confident the President would have embraced and signed. I ask \nunanimous consent that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. --\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Terrorism Risk Insurance Act \n     of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) property and casualty insurance firms are important \n     financial institutions, the products of which allow \n     mutualization of risk and the efficient use of financial \n     resources and enhance the ability of the economy to maintain \n     stability, while responding to a variety of economic, \n     political, environmental, and other risks with a minimum of \n     disruption;\n       (2) the ability of businesses and individuals to obtain \n     property and casualty insurance at reasonable and predictable \n     prices, in order to spread the risk of both routine and \n     catastrophic loss, is critical to economic growth, urban \n     development, and the construction and maintenance of public \n     and private housing, as well as to the promotion of United \n     States exports and foreign trade in an increasingly \n     interconnected world;\n       (3) the ability of the insurance industry to cover the \n     unprecedented financial risks presented by potential acts of \n     terrorism in the United States can be a major factor in the \n     recovery from terrorist attacks, while maintaining the \n     stability of the economy;\n\n[[Page S5437]]\n\n       (4) widespread financial market uncertainties have arisen \n     following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     including the absence of information from which financial \n     institutions can make statistically valid estimates of the \n     probability and costs of future terrorist events, and \n     therefore the size, finding, and allocation of the risk of \n     loss caused by such acts of terrorism;\n       (5) a decision by property and casualty insurers to deal \n     with such uncertainties, either by terminating property and \n     casualty coverage for losses arising form terrorist events, \n     or by radically escalating premium coverage to compensate for \n     risks of loss that are not readily predictable, could \n     seriously hamper ongoing and planned construction, property \n     acquisition, and other business projects, generate a dramatic \n     increase in rents, and otherwise suppress economic activity \n     and\n       (6) the United States Government should provide temporary \n     financial compensation to insured parties, contributing to \n     the stabilization of the United States economy in a time of \n     national crisis, while the financial services industry \n     develops the systems, mechanisms, products, and programs \n     necessary to create a viable financial services market for \n     private terrorism risk insurance.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     temporary Federal program that provides for a transparent \n     system of shared public and private compensation for insured \n     losses resulting from acts of terrorism, in order to--\n       (1) protect consumers by addressing market disruptions and \n     ensure the continued widespread availability and \n     affordability of property and casualty insurance for \n     terrorism risk; and\n       (2) allow for a transitional period for the private markets \n     to stabilize, resume pricing of such insurance and build \n     capacity to absorb any future losses, while preserving State \n     insurance regulation and consumer protections.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The authority granted under this \n     subsection shall continue during any period in which the \n     Secretary's authority under section 6(d) is in effect.\n\n     SEC. 6. TERMINATION OF PROGRAM; DISCRETIONARY EXTENSION.\n\n       (a) Termination of Program.--\n       (1)  In general.--The Program shall terminate at midnight \n     on December 31, 2003, unless the Secretary--\n       (A) determines, after considering the report and finding \n     required by this section, that the program should be extended \n     for one additional year, until midnight on December 31, 2004; \n     and\n       (B) promptly notifies the Congress of such determination \n     and the reasons therefor.\n       (2) Determination final.--The determination of the \n     Secretary under paragraph (2) shall be final, and shall not \n     be subject to judicial review.\n       (3) Termination after extension.--If the program is \n     extended under paragraph (1), the Program shall terminate at \n     midnight on December 31, 2004.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 9 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act the Secretary shall submit a \n     report to Congress--\n       (1) regarding--\n       (A) the availability of insurance coverage for acts of \n     terrorism;\n       (B) the affordability of such coverage, including the \n     effect of such coverage on premiums; and\n       (C) the capacity of the insurance industry to absorb future \n     losses resulting from acts of terrorism, taking into account \n     the profitability of the insurance industry; and\n       (2) that considers--\n       (A) the impact of the program on each of the factors \n     described in paragraph (1); and\n       (B) the probable impact on such factors and on the United \n     States economy if the Program terminates at midnight on \n     December 31, 2003.\n       (c) Finding Required.--A determination under subsection (a) \n     to extend the program shall be based on a finding by the \n     Secretary that--\n       (1) widespread market uncertainties continue to disrupt the \n     ability of insurance companies to price insurance coverage \n     for losses resulting from acts of terrorism, thereby \n     resulting in the continuing unavailability of affordable \n     insurance for consumers; and\n       (2) extending the program for an additional year would \n     likely encourage economic stabilization and facilitate a \n     transition to a viable market for private terrorism risk \n     insurance.\n       (d) Continuing Authority to Pay or Adjust Compensation.--\n     following the termination of the Program under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary may take such actions as may be necessary \n     to ensure payment, reimbursement, or adjustment of \n     compensation for insured losses arising out of any act of \n     terrorism occurring during the period in which the Program \n     was in effect under this Act, in accordance with the \n     provisions of section 4 and regulations promulgated \n     thereunder.\n       (e) Repeal; Savings Clause.--This act is repealed at \n     midnight on the final termination date of the Program under \n     section (a), except that such repeal shall not be construed--\n       (1) to prevent the Secretary from taking, or causing to be \n     taken, such actions under subsection (d) of this section and \n     sections 4(e)(4), 4(e)(5), 5(a)(1), 5(c), and (e) (as in \n     effect on the day before the date of such repeal), and \n     applicable regulations promulgated thereunder, during any \n     period in which the authority of the Secretary under \n     subsection (d) of this section is in effect; or\n       (2) to prevent the availability of funding under section \n     9(b) during any period in which authority of the Secretary \n     under subsection (d) of this section is in effect.\n       (f) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that he Secretary should make any determination under \n     subsection (a) in sufficient time to enable participating \n     insurance companies to include coverage for acts of terrorism \n     in their policies for 2004.\n       (g) Study and Report on Scope of the Program.--\n       (1) Study.--The Secretary, after consultation with the \n     NAIC, representatives of the\n\n[[Page S5439]]\n\n     insurance industry, and other experts in the insurance field, \n     shall conduct a study of the potential effects of acts of \n     terrorism on the availability of life insurance and other \n     lines of insurance coverage.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 9 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to \n     the Congress on the results of the study conducted under \n     paragraph (1).\n       (h) Reports Regarding Terrorism Risk Insurance Premiums.--\n       (1) Report to the naic.--Beginning 6 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, and every 6 months thereafter, each \n     participating insurance company shall submit a report to the \n     NAIC that states the premium rates charged by that \n     participating insurance company during the preceding 6-month \n     period for insured losses covered by the Program, and \n     includes an explanation of and justification for those rates.\n       (2) Reports forwarded.--The NAIC shall promptly forward \n     copies of each report submitted under paragraph (1) to the \n     Secretary, the Secretary of commerce, the Chairman of the \n     Federal trade Commission, and the Comptroller General of the \n     United States.\n       (3) Agency report to congress.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce \n     and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission shall submit \n     joint reports to Congress and the Comptroller General of the \n     United States summarizing and evaluating the reports forward \n     under paragraph (2).\n       (B) Timing.--The reports required under subparagraph (A) \n     shall be submitted--\n       (i) 9 months after the date of enactment of this Act;

PRESERVATION OF STATE LAW.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall affect the jurisdiction or \n     regulatory authority of the insurance commissioner (or any \n     agency or office performing like functions) of any State over \n     any participating insurance company or other person--\n       (1) except as specifically provided in this Act; and\n       (2) except that--\n       (A) the definition of the term ``act of terrorism'' in \n     section 3 shall be the exclusive definition of that term for \n     purposes of compensation for insured losses under this Act, \n     and shall preempt any provision of State law that is \n     inconsistent with that definition, to the extent that such \n     provision of law would otherwise apply to any type of \n     insurance covered by this Act;\n       (B) during the period beginning on the date of enactment of \n     this Act and ending at midnight on December 31, 2002, rates \n     for terrorism risk insurance covered by this Act and filed \n     with any State shall not be subject to prior approval or a \n     waiting period, under any law of a State that would otherwise \n     be applicable, except that nothing in this Act affects the \n     ability of any State to invalidate a rate as excessive, \n     inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory; and\n       (C) during the period beginning on the date of enactment of \n     this Act and for so long as the Program is in effect, as \n     provided in section 6 (including any period during which the \n     authority of the Secretary under section 6(d) is in effect), \n     books and records of any participating insurance company that \n     are relevant to the Program shall be provided, or caused to \n     be provided, to the Secretary or the designee of the \n     Secretary, upon request by the Secretary or such designee, \n     notwithstanding any provision of the laws of any State \n     prohibiting or limiting such access.\n\n     SEC. 8. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING CAPACITY BUILDING.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the insurance industry \n     should build capacity and aggregate risk to provide \n     affordable property and casualty insurance coverage for \n     terrorism risk.\n\n     SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS; PAYMENT AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Administrative Expenses.--There are authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Secretary, out of funds in the Treasury \n     not otherwise appropriated, such sums as may be necessary for \n     administrative expenses of the Program, to remain available \n     until expended.\n       (b) Payment Authority.--This Act constitutes payment \n     authority in advance of appropriation Acts, and represents \n     the obligation of the Federal Government to provide for the \n     Federal share of compensation for insured losses under the \n     Program.\n\n     SEC. 10. PROCEDURES FOR CIVIL ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) Federal Cause of Action.--\n       (1) In general.--There shall exist a Federal cause of \n     action for claims arising out of or resulting from an act of \n     terrorism, which shall be the exclusive cause of action and \n     remedy for such claims, except as provided in subsection (f).\n       (2) Preemption of state actions.--All State causes of \n     action of any kind for claims arising out of or resulting \n     from an act of terrorism that are otherwise available under \n     State law, are hereby preempted, except as provided in \n     subsection (f).\n       (b) Governing Law.--The substantive law for decision in an \n     action described in subsection (a)(1) shall be derived from \n     the law, including applicable choice of law principles, of \n     the State in which the act of terrorism giving rise to the \n     action occurred, except to the extent that--\n       (1) the law, including choice of law principles, of another \n     State is determined to be applicable to the action by the \n     district court hearing the action; or\n       (2) otherwise applicable State law (including that \n     determined under paragraph (1), is inconsistent with or \n     otherwise preempted by Federal law.\n       (c) Federal Jurisdiction.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, not later than 90 days after the date of the occurrence \n     of an act of terrorism, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict \n     Litigation shall assign a single Federal district court to \n     conduct pretrial and trial proceedings in all pending and \n     future civil actions for claims arising out of or resulting \n     from that act of terrorism.\n       (2) Selection criteria.--The Judicial Panel on \n     Multidistrict Litigation shall select and assign the district \n     court under paragraph (1) based on the convenience of the \n     parties and the just and efficient conduct of the \n     proceedings.\n       (3) Jurisdiction.--The district court assigned by the \n     Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation shall have \n     original and exclusive jurisdiction over all actions under \n     paragraph (1).

The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, I will be brief and I will \nnot object. I think we should go ahead and get an agreement to proceed \non this bill because there has been a lot of effort over a long period \nof time to try to work out some substance, some process for considering \nit, the numbers of amendments that would be offered. Having been \nthrough all of that, I think it is time we just go forward. We could \nnot get an agreement to limit amendments anyway. I believe there are \ngoing to be a lot of amendments that relate to the subject matter that \nwill be offered and we will have a good debate.\n  I do want to make two observations. There was a bipartisan bill. \nThere was a bill, I had the impression, that had been worked out with \nSenator Sarbanes, I thought Senator Dodd, and\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\nSenator Gramm at the committee level, although it was not reported out, \nthat would have had some limits on liability, but all of a sudden it \ndisappeared from the committee itself, went to some other venue, and it \ncame up with the substance as it is now. I do not think that is the way \nbusiness should be done around here, and every time it is done that \nway, which was the case, in my opinion, on the energy bill and on an \nagriculture bill, you get into a great big fracas and have a lot of \ntrouble.\n  But I think the issue is important. I am sure there are very strong \nfeelings for it and some against it.\n  But I emphasize the point that Senator McConnell made a moment ago. \nWe need this legislation passed because of the confidence it will \nprovide to this sector of the economy. But it will not be signed into \nlaw without some limits on liabilities. We cannot and we will not--and \nthe President will not--allow the plaintiff's lawyers of this country \nto get this kind of access to the Treasury of the United States of \nAmerica. I think everybody needs to understand that.\n  We should do this. We are going forward. But in the end we are not \ngoing to have a bill without limits on liabilities.\n  With that, I withdraw my reservation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in the days and weeks following September \n11, this Senate passed an unprecedented series of measures to help heal \nour wounded nation, protect America from future terrorist attacks, and \nbring to justice those who attacked us.\n  Those days were among the most difficult any of us has ever \nexperienced in our public lives. They were also some of our proudest \ndays as Senators--because we were united. Because we rose to a \nchallenge that few of us could have imagined until then.\n  Today--nearly 9 months after the terrorist attacks we have not yet \naddressed the growing inability of many businesses to purchase \nadequate, affordable terrorism insurance.\n  Democrats have made repeated good-faith offers to reach a bipartisan \nsolution to this difficult problem. This Senate could have passed a \nterrorism insurance bill months ago--and it could already be law. The \nonly reason it is not is because a small group of Senators in the other \nparty are determined to use terrorism re-insurance as cover to push \nthrough radical changes in our legal system that they know do not have \nsufficient support to pass on their own merits. They are holding \nterrorism insurance, and America's economic security, hostage to try to \nforce through an agenda that has nothing to do with September 11th, or \nwith the threat of future terrorist attacks.\n  Enough is enough. Last Friday, Senator Dodd introduced a good, \nbalanced terrorism insurance bill, S-2600. I am now calling up that \nbill to see where the votes fall. We need to stop playing politics with \nthis critical issue.\n  I want to thank Senator Dodd for the extraordinary patience and \nleadership he has demonstrated on this issue over so many months. I \nalso want to thank a number of our other colleagues--especially Senator \nSarbanes, Senator Schumer and Senator Reid--for their help in producing \nthis bill, as well as their many efforts to reach a bipartisan \nagreement on this matter.\n  President Bush has asked the Senate repeatedly to pass terrorism \ninsurance. So has the commercial real estate industry, the hotel \nindustry, and many other industries employing tens of millions of \nAmericans. Despite their requests, a small group of Republican Senators \nhas refused to let any terrorism insurance bill pass unless it includes \ntheir extraneous plan to dramatically overhaul major parts of America's \ncivil justice system.\n  At a time when we are hearing new warnings almost every day about the \npossibility, even the ``inevitability'' of more terrorist attacks--when \nour economy is struggling to shake off a recession, such political \ngamesmanship is inexcusable.\n  Before September 11th, terrorist attacks on America seemed \nunimaginable. Now, as a result of September 11th, such acts are \nbecoming un-insurable.\n  Consider a few facts:\n  A recent survey by The Bond Market Association shows that lenders \nhave placed on hold or canceled more than $7 billion in commercial \nmortgage loans because of ``the difficulty and expense'' of finding \nterrorism insurance coverage.\n  According to a recent study by Moody's, ``virtually all terrorism \ninsurance policies have some major gap, including carve-outs for \ncertain types of terrorism and 30 day cancellation clauses.'' These \npolicy gaps pose significant risks to investors.\n  The lack of terrorism insurance for commercial real estate is also \nhurting ``commercial mortgage backed securities'' bonds that are backed \nentirely by mortgages on commercial buildings. Investors in this $270 \nbillion market include pension funds, insurance companies and other \ninstitutions.\n  Moody's and Fitch recently placed 22 commercial mortgage backed \nsecurities transactions--backed by more than $9 billion in commercial \nreal estate loans, on a ``watch list'' for possible downgrade. In every \none of the 22 transactions on that list, terrorism insurance for the \ncollateral was either inadequate--or due to expire by this Fall.\n  In addition, major hotel companies employing thousands of Americans \nhave lost--or will soon lose--terrorism coverage. Businesses, museums, \nhospitals, gaming and sports facility owners, and builders all over the \ncountry are in similar straits.\n  While a few insurers have come together to offer very narrow \ncoverage, their policies they provide generally exclude coverage for \nnuclear, biological and chemical attacks--the very threats the \ngovernment warns us are most likely to be used by terrorists.\n  The growing gap in terrorism coverage threatens the stability of \nAmerica's economy.\n  The plain fact is: private insurers, alone, cannot close this gap. \nThe potential loss is simply too great for any one company or industry \nto absorb. The federal government must be a partner.\n  We've done it before. During World War II, the Government authorized \na program, administered by private insurers, which insured property \nagainst ``enemy attack.'' We need a similar effort today. That is what \nthis bill is about.\n  The Congress is working closely with the President to improve the \nphysical security of our nation. We should be no less vigilant in \ndefending America's economic security from the catastrophic losses \nassociated with terrorism. We must pass a terrorism bill. We cannot \nafford to let this critical measure be held hostage any longer by a \nhandful of Senators who want to use it to pass extraneous measures. The \nrisks to America's economic security is too great.\n  The President has made that clear. The market is making it clear. We \nneed to close the terrorism insurance gap now. No more delays. We urge \nour colleagues to join us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could just say a few words before my \nfriend from Connecticut who worked so hard on this legislation makes a \nfew remarks, the minority should understand that Senator Daschle has no \nintention of peremptorily moving to invoke cloture. I think there \nshould be a reasonable time for people to offer amendments. I also say \nthat we also have to work constructively on this legislation.\n  The fact is that we have as a result of what is facing this country \nlots of bills, not the least of which is the Defense authorization \nbill. We have to complete that before the July 4th recess. We are going \nto do that.\n  There is a lot of work to do. The majority leader has stated publicly \nthat this legislation is important. Senator Dodd has spent untold time \ntrying to work out an agreement. If everybody believes it as important \nas they say it is, then we should be able to get a bill.\n  I respectfully say to my friend, the Republican leader, that they \nhave a right to offer all kinds of amendments and any amendment they \nwant to dealing with liability, lawyers, and other things. But I hope \nif they lose, they do not cause us to not have a bill.\n  This bill is important to the real estate industry, the developers, \nand the people in the construction business. We have hotels, \nbusinesses, shopping centers, and they have all come to all of us. They \nbelieve this is important.\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\n  We are going to have a debate. One of the principal participants in \nthat debate will be the Presiding Officer, who was an insurance \ncommissioner of the third or fourth largest State in United States. He \ncertainly has had a view that a lot of us haven't had as to what \ninsurance is all about. We look forward to the debate with the Senator \nfrom Florida, and the debate generally. I hope it is as constructive as \nthe debate was on the estate tax. It was a good debate over the last 2 \ndays. When we have debates like that, it makes this body look good. I \nthink people look not at the result as much as how we are treating each \nother. Senators, we should be happy. I am happy with the result we had \nwith the estate tax. But the debate was good. People had a chance to \nvoice their opinions. I hope we do just as well on this important \nlegislation on terrorism insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority whip, \nSenator Reid, for propounding the unanimous consent request. I thank \nthe distinguished Republican leader for agreeing to allow this to go \nforward, and my colleague from Texas, and colleague from Kentucky, who \nhave had a longstanding interest in the subject matter, as many Members \nhave, including the Presiding Officer. And other Members have come to \nme over time with various ideas and proposals to be included as part of \nthe terrorism insurance package.\n  Let me say my good friend from Mississippi, the Republican leader, \nraised the issue about where we were. He is right. There was a time not \nso long ago--about 8 or 9 months ago--when we sat down and innocently \nthought that three or four Members sitting together could write \nsomething and then come to the floor, and people would say, You have \ndone a lot of work, go ahead. As oftentimes happens, it is not unique. \nWe thought we had put something together. We came to the floor and \ndiscovered that there were 97 other Members who had some ideas--not all \n97 but a good many had other thoughts about which they felt strongly.\n  I don't regret the effort that my colleague from Texas and I made \nwith Senator Sarbanes of Maryland. Senator Schumer was involved I think \nto some degree in all of that, and others as well. We made a good faith \neffort. We thought it would work. It didn't.\n  December 20, I think, was the date when there was a unanimous consent \nrequest to bring the matter up. There was an objection expressed at \nthat time. From then on, we have tried all sorts of ideas and \nvariations that would get us to a unanimous consent where we would have \na limited number of amendments to be brought up to try to focus on this \nbill. None of that worked.\n  We are now in a situation where we had a rule XIV on the bill on June \n7, and this evening we avoided a cloture motion, for which I am \ngrateful. That would have delayed consideration of this bill.\n  I am not going to debate the merits or demerits of the bill tonight. \nI see my colleague from Maryland, the chairman of the committee, is \nhere. He may want to be heard on this as well.\n  But this is an important bill. It isn't because I think it is. It is \nimportant because you hear from almost every major metropolitan area in \nthe country now that is feeling the real pinch of a slowdown as a \nresult of the inability and an unwillingness, for obvious reasons, of \nbanks to lend money to major real estate and construction projects \nwithout those projects having insurance on terrorism.\n  In the absence of getting that, which the industry is unwilling to \nwrite because they cannot figure out how to cost all of this--that is \nunderstandable as well from the business standpoint--a lot of these \nprojects are not moving. Jobs are being lost, and the economy is \nfeeling the effects of it.\n  That is a shorthand version of what is going on. It hasn't reached \nsuch proportion yet that it would stop any kind of economic growth. But \nit certainly, by every estimation, is having a negative impact on our \neconomic recovery.\n  Now we have put together the proposal. I know there will be \namendments offered. My hope is they will be relevant amendments so they \ndon't use this vehicle to bring up all sorts of extraneous matters.\n  We will try to limit the debate to some degree on the bill we are \nproposing and the one which I suspect will finally be adopted. Even if \nsome amendments are accepted, it will be substantially different from \nwhat the other body proposed.\n  Even if we complete our work here, there is a monumental amount of \nwork to be done to reach agreement with the other body. If we hope to \nget that completed at some point between now and over the August \nbreak--I hope earlier--we are going to have to finish this bill fairly \nquickly.\n  I urge Members who have an interest to come over and be heard. If you \ncan limit your time so we can have a good debate--I hope no one intends \nto filibuster on this bill. That would certainly be unwise, in my view.\n  We will try to produce a product that will get us to conference and \nfurther refinement, and resolve the issues so we can send it to the \nPresident of the United States for his signature; and, sort of cut this \nGordian knot that sits out there as a real choke point, if you will, in \nthe economic flow of our country. That is what this is at this point.\n  I thank again my colleagues for not objecting to the unanimous \nconsent request that we go to this bill. That is a good sign. I know \nthere is still a lot of difference. But I take that as an omen that we \nat least can bring up this matter and try to resolve these differences. \nI look forward to the debate tomorrow. I believe we will be here at 10 \no'clock tomorrow to start debate on bill, and make opening statements, \nif they need to be made, and then engage in, hopefully, a healthy but \nbrief debate and discussion on this important matter.\n  I see my colleague from Maryland here who may want to express some \nthoughts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I join my very \nable colleague from Connecticut in underscoring the importance of this \nlegislation and the problem with which it seeks to deal. It is one that \nwe have been wrestling with for a number of months.\n  I particularly commend the able Senator from Connecticut for his \nleadership on this issue. He has been indefatigable in focusing our \nattention on this matter and repeatedly insisting that we have to come \nto terms with this issue.\n  I am pleased that we are now going to be able to actually move \ntomorrow to the legislation and begin this important debate. I will \ndefer my comments on the substance of this legislation until tomorrow, \nuntil that debate begins.\n\n  But Senator Dodd has played a major role, an instrumental role, \nthroughout and, obviously, has played a large part in bringing us to \nthe point at which we are now, which offers us now the opportunity to \nfinally address this issue.\n  I understand, under the consent agreement, it is a wide open \nconsideration that lies ahead of us. I would urge my colleagues of the \nnecessity to show some restraint as we try to do that because we are \nunder, obviously, some very significant time pressures.\n  But I look forward to that debate and the opportunity to try to \naddress this issue on its substance. We have heard, of course, a great \ndeal from across the country about this matter.\n  I simply want to echo the able Senator from Connecticut in saying \nthat I hope we can consider this matter in a very positive and \nconstructive way. I know Members have different ideas on how we ought \nto go about it. We hope to be able to consider those in a reasonable \nand proper way and reach some conclusion, hopefully, in the near \nfuture.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a sad and \nincredibly important situation that happened last week involving \ncitizens from my State.\n  The war on terrorism claimed another victim.\n  This past week brought about the sorrowful conclusion to a long and \nharrowing ordeal for three inspiring people, two of whom are from my \nhome\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\nstate of Kansas. Gracia and Martin Burnham, and their fellow hostage, \nFilipino nurse Ediborah Yap, had endured more than a year in captivity \nat the brutal hands of the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf that has had \nlinks to the al-Qaida organization.\n  We all know the news reports, some of them almost by heart, of the \nattempted rescue by the Filipino military, who, based on the details \nthat I have, demonstrated heroism and bravery in the encounter. And the \nheart-rending deaths of Martin and Ediborah and the wounding of Gracia. \nBut today I want to remind all of us that while this may have been the \nend of their ordeal, it is not the end of their struggle, nor of ours.\n  The poet John Donne once wrote, ``No man is an island, entire of it \nselfe; any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in \nMankinde; and therefore never send to know for whom the bells tolls; it \ntolls for thee.''\n  September 11 was a wakeup call, but the bell still tolls. We must not \nlet it go unanswered.\n  Some people have proclaimed that terrorism is simply a symptom of \npoverty and despair. That it is, if you can believe this, the logical \nresponse to a life of misery. I have one question then: Why kill those \nwho are there to alleviate poverty, to lift despair, and to eliminate \nmisery?\n  Terrorism is not a symptom of poverty, despair and misery. It is a \ncause. It is the root cause. These men and women do not just attack the \nconcept of freedom and freedom-loving people everywhere, they terrorize \ntheir own people, they ravage their own country.\n  That is not logic, that is not strategy; that is evil. Yet, in the \nface of evil, people such as the Burnhams do not flinch. They have \nnever flinched. When the governments have left, the missionaries are \nthere. When the NGOs have left, the missionaries are there. When the \ncharitable organizations have left, the missionaries are there.\n  There are some goals too great, some missions really just too \nprecious, and so the missionaries are there. They keep going. They are \nalways there. And they accept the sacrifices of their work in order to \nstay true to their calling. Even Gracia Burnham,on the day she arrived \nhome to her children and her friends and family, seeing them for the \nfirst time in over 375 days, forcefully said, ``A very bad thing \nhappened to Martin and I when we were taken hostage, but we want \neveryone to know that God was good to us every single day of our \ncaptivity.''\n  It is a statement emblematic of the strength, courage and, most of \nall, faith of both of them, and of all missionaries worldwide, who \nevery day risk their lives to help others. In fact, the Burnham's story \nstarted out much like many others.\n  Martin first arrived in the Philippines in 1969 with his missionary \nparents. He returned to the United States after high school, met \nGracia, graduated from Calvary Bible College and the Wichita Aviation \nEducation Center, and then completed the New Tribes Mission training \nprogram, the New Tribes group out of Florida. Not surprisingly, he and \nGracia then returned to the Philippines, remaining there ever since. In \nfact, their three children, Jeff, Mindy, and Zach, were all born in the \nPhilippines.\n  And then, on May 27, 2001, while celebrating their 18th wedding \nanniversary, they were kidnapped.\n  It was not the marker of celebration they wanted--that of their love \nfor each other and for God--but rather that of the beginning of this \nincredible, horrible journey.\n  The blame for the year of suffering that Martin, Gracia, and Ediborah \nYap endured rests squarely upon the shoulders of the terrorist Abu \nSayyaf Group. They were offered peaceful means to resolve this \nsituation, multiple peaceful options. Yet this group insisted upon \nterror, murder, and rampage. They attacked Americans, and they attacked \ntheir own people. And they never hesitated to kill without compunction, \nwithout compassion, and without logic. Executing several prisoners, \nincluding another American that was taken hostage at the time as the \nBurnhams. Guillermo Sabero, a Californian, was beheaded by this same \nAbu Sayyaf Group.\n\n  Terrorists must understand every single U.S. citizen is important, \nthat an attack on an American anywhere in the world is an attack on \nAmerica itself.\n  Most of all, though, terrorists must understand--must be made to \nunderstand--that terrorism is never justifiable. Wanton violence that \nharms blameless men, women and children, unpredictable violence that \nstrikes fear into innocent hearts and minds is not, and never will be \njustifiable.\n  As Philippines President Gloria Arroyo said, ``The fight against \nterrorism is our fight. It is the fight of all of mankind against \nevil.''\n  The bell tolls for all of us. Duty beckons all of us.\n  And the call is simple. We must continue to support the effort to \neradicate the Abu Sayyaf Group and other terrorist organizations that \nthreaten the security of the Philippines and other peaceful nations.\n  Already, U.S. assistance to the Philippines has produced results. \nCivil action and humanitarian projects are improving living conditions, \nand specialized training has resulted in a more capable military. Even \nGracia Burnham noted, ``We especially want to thank the military men, \nthe Fillipinos and the Americans, who risk, and even gave their lives, \nin order to rescue us.''\n  As seen by this rescue, the Abu Sayyaf Group is on the run, but it \nneeds to be completely eliminated as a threat. I personally will \ncontinue to encourage any U.S. support requested by the Phillippine \nGovernment to assist them in their fight against terrorism and its \ncauses, and to urge my colleagues to do so as well. After all, the \nstruggle is not over, only this ordeal.\n  Just this morning, elements of the AFP, the Filipino military, were \ninvolved in a fierce battle with a group that calls itself the \nPentagon. It is a splinter group from the Moro Islamic Liberation \nFront. This group has held a south Korean businessman captive since \nFebruary 6, 2001. While defending their country from the scourge of \nterrorism, two Philipino soldiers were killed, and nine members of this \nextremist organization died. That was in this most recent firefight. \nMore deaths, and for what?\n  Let me be clear. The deplorable actions of the Abu Sayyaf Group \ncaused the deaths of Martin, Ediborah, and Guillermo. Let there be no \nequivocation on this point, the Abu Sayyaf Group is criminally culpable \nand must be brought to justice.\n  As we all know, terror begets terror, but justice produces justice. \nAnd a nation founded upon the rule of law has a special responsibility \nto share and enforce that vision.\n  This Friday, the Burnham family will be holding a memorial service \nfor Martin, not to mourn, but to celebrate his life. Today, I ask all \nof us to do so, to celebrate Martin, to remember his family, and to \nrecall our shared duty to ``provide for the common Defense'' and to \n``define and punish . . . Offenses against the Law of Nations.''\n  These may seem to be the worst of times, but, like the Burnhams, we \nare a strong, resilient, and, most of all, hopeful people, and we will \nprevail.\n  As it says in the Beatitudes:\n\n     Blessed are the merciful, For they shall obtain mercy.\n     Blessed are the pure in heart, For they shall see God.\n     Blessed are the peacemaker, For they shall be called sons of \n           God.\n     Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake,\n     For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n\n  God bless you, Martin Burnham.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5442-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5442-S5443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to a period of morning business with Senators allowed to speak \ntherein for a period not to exceed 5 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the House of \nRepresentatives yesterday passed unanimously\n\n[[Page S5443]]\n\nthe Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' \nBenefit Act of 2002, S. 2431.\n  Last month, the Senate passed unanimously my legislation to provide \ndeath benefits to the families of 10 fallen heroes of September 11. I \nagain thank Senators Campbell, Schumer, Clinton, Biden and Feingold for \ncosponsoring our bipartisan measure. I commend Representatives Manzullo \nand Nadler for their bipartisan leadership on the House companion bill, \nH.R. 3297, and I thank House Judiciary Committee Chairman Sensenbrenner \nand Ranking Member Conyers for their strong support as well.\n  Named for Chaplain Mychal Judge, who was killed while responding with \nthe New York City Fire Department to the September 11 terrorist attacks \non the World Trade Center, this legislation recognizes the invaluable \nservice of police and fire chaplains in crisis situations by allowing \nfor their eligibility in the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program. \nFather Judge, who was gay, was survived by his two sisters who, under \ncurrent law, are ineligible to receive payments through the PSOB \nProgram. This is simply wrong and must be remedied.\n  Indeed, Father Judge is among 10 public safety officers who were \nkilled on September 11, but who are ineligible for Federal death \nbenefits because they died without a surviving spouse, child, or \nparent. This bill would retroactively correct this injustice by \nexpanding the list of those who may receive public safety officer \nbenefits to the beneficiaries named on the most recently executed life \ninsurance policy of the deceased officer. This change would go into \neffect on September 11 of last year to make sure the families of Father \nJudge and the nine other fallen heroes receive their public safety \nofficer benefits.\n  In addition, this bill would retroactively restructure the Public \nSafety Officers' Benefit Program to specifically include chaplains as \nmembers of the law enforcement and fire units they serve, and would \nmake these chaplains eligible for the one-time $250,000 benefit \navailable to public safety officers who have been permanently disabled \nas a result of injuries sustained in the line of duty, or to the \nsurvivors of officers who have died.\n  Finally, I applaud the National Association of Police Organization, \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, and the American Federation of State, \nCounty and Municipal Employees for their strong support for this bill \nto honor public safety officers and their families.\n  This legislation provides much-needed relief for the survivors of the \nbrave public servants who selflessly risk and sacrifice their own lives \neveryday so that others might live. I look forward to President Bush \nsigning the Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety \nOfficers' Benefit Act of 2002 into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5443-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5443-S5446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SOLUTION TO MTBE PROBLEM\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, by now, most everyone in \nthe Nation has heard of the problems caused by MTBE (methyl tertiary \nbutyl ether). I am very pleased that S. 950, the Federal Reformulated \nFuels Act of 2002, reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, has largely been incorporated into the Senate energy \nbill, S. 517, passed by the Senate on April 25, 2002. I would like to \nthank all those who worked with me to negotiate this comprehensive \nsolution to the MTBE problem.\n  The legislative package provides Federal funding for cleanup of \nexisting contamination and for prevention of future releases of MTBE, \nwhile preserving the environment and protecting the country from \ngasoline price spikes and fuel shortages. I would like to engage in a \nbrief colloquy with the chairman of the committee so that we can \nprovide an overview of the problems caused by MTBE and how this \nlegislation solves these problems.\n  The problem that initially motivated the committee and the Senate to \nact on S. 950 and this issue in general is the existing MTBE \ncontamination of water resources. Leaking underground storage tanks \n(USTs) are the major source of MTBE releases. Section 832 of this \nlegislation authorizes $200 million from the Leaking Underground \nStorage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund for States to use for MTBE remediation. \nFor this limited allocation of funds, the legislation waives the LUST \nrequirement that the contamination be linked to an UST. Once in the \nenvironment, MTBE separates from other gasoline components and can \nquickly move far away from the source. Since MTBE contamination is \ndifficult to trace, it is nearly impossible to establish a link between \nthe contamination and a LUST.\n  In addition to cleaning up existing contamination, we must prevent \nfuture leaks from USTs because MTBE, in volumes much lower than current \nlevels found in reformulated gasoline (RFG), may remain in gasoline for \nup to four years of enactment of this bill. To prevent future leaks, \nSection 832 of this legislation authorizes an additional $200 million \nfrom the LUST Trust Fund for States to use for activities to enforce \nexisting UST regulations.\n  There is still more to learn about remediation of MTBE. Section 832 \nof this legislation authorizes $2 million for conducting bedrock \nbioremediation research and establishing an information clearinghouse. \nThese authorized funds are intended to go to the Bedrock Bioremediation \nCenter (BBC) at the University of New Hampshire. Currently, the BBC \nconducts research on bioremediation of various contaminants in \nfractured bedrock. This additional funding will allow the BBC to learn \nways of cleaning up MTBE contamination in fractured bedrock and \nestablish an information clearinghouse so that the newly developed \nremediation techniques may be shared across the nation. Once MTBE \nenters fractured bedrock, it is nearly impossible to remediate and \nequally as difficult to track. MTBE may contaminate wells that are many \nmiles away from the original source. In simple terms, we can't get it \nout of bedrock and we can't tell where it will cause problems.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. As the Senator from New Hampshire, the ranking member \non the Environment and Public Works Committee, has pointed out, the \ncommittee acted to address existing contamination and to prevent future \ncontamination. There are many sources of MTBE releases, including \nleaking underground storage tanks, motor vehicle accidents, fuel \noverfills, backyard mechanics and many more. With the numerous \npotential sources, the only way to ensure prevention of future \ncontamination is to get MTBE out of gasoline. This legislation contains \nseveral provisions that work together to provide for quick reduction \nand eventual elimination of MTBE use in gasoline.\n  Section 834 eliminates the oxygen content requirement in Sections \n211(k)(2) and 211(k)(3)(A) of the Clean Air Act. These provisions \nrequire RFG to contain two percent oxygen by weight. To satisfy this \nmandate, refiners must blend either fourteen percent MTBE or 5 percent \nethanol into RFG. Elimination of the oxygen mandate will allow for a \nphase-down of the use of MTBE in RFG without requiring the use of \nethanol in every gallon of RFG in certain non-attainment areas. But, \nRFG will still be required to meet all other statutory and regulatory \nrequirements.\n  The elimination of the oxygen requirement also will allow refiners \nsupplying RFG to the Northeast and many other States to use \nconsiderably less MTBE in RFG prior to the beginning of the phase out. \nMTBE is currently 3 percent of the national gasoline supply. Most of \nthis is used in RFG areas, where MTBE volume in RFG is up to 15 \npercent.\n  The oxygen requirement is eliminated effective 270 days after \nenactment in order to provide time for EPA to put in place the anti-\nbacksliding provisions included under Section 834 of this legislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. In addition to elimination of the oxygen \nmandate, as the Senator from Vermont has indicated, this legislation \nrequires EPA to make a determination about the adequacy of any pending \nRFG petition to waive the oxygen content requirements of section \n211(k)(2)(B) for RFG. If EPA fails to act in the required time, the \npetition shall be deemed approved. Although this includes an opt-out or \nother request, EPA's failure to act results in automatic approval of \nthe petition only to the extent that the oxygen content requirement for \nRFG would be waived. No other RFG requirements are affected. This \nprovision only applies to petitions pending at the time of enactment of \nthis provision.\n\n[[Page S5444]]\n\n  The State of New Hampshire submitted to EPA a request to opt-out of \nthe RFG program and set state fuel standards that are identical to the \nFederal RFG specifications, excluding the oxygen mandate. The EPA is \ninstructed to interpret the New Hampshire RFG opt-out request as a \nrequest to eliminate the oxygen mandate. If the request is deemed \nadequate, either by EPA or by statute, the RFG sold and used in New \nHampshire will not be required to adhere to the oxygen content \nrequirement, effective immediately upon the adequacy determination.\n  The removal of the oxygenate requirement alone, however, is not \nenough to ensure the removal of MTBE from gasoline. Therefore, Section \n833 of this legislation contains a provision that prohibits the \nblending of MTBE in gasoline within 4 years of enactment. The 4-year \nperiod is intended to allow fuel refiners to phase out the use of MTBE \non a schedule that will not cause gasoline shortages or price spikes. \nThe absence of a mandatory statutory phase down schedule is intended to \ngive maximum flexibility to fuel refiners as they proceed to an MTBE-\nfree gasoline supply.\n  The reference to use of MTBE in new section 211(c)(5)(A) of the Clean \nAir Act is meant to cover use by all persons. It includes all persons \nin the motor vehicle fuel production and distribution system, as well \nas ultimate consumer of the fuel and producers of MTBE. EPA's \nregulation may include appropriate provisions to implement this \nprohibition.\n  The findings listed in this section are intended to clarify that the \nelimination of the use of MTBE is intended to protect water quality. It \nis important to note that health concerns are not the main cause for \nCongressional action, based on information to date.\n  There is an allowance for de minimus amounts of MTBE to be present in \ngasoline because MTBE is sometimes produced in trace amounts during the \ngasoline production process. The Administrator will make a \ndetermination on what level is appropriate, but the legislation \nprovides that it can be no more than .5 percent by volume.\n  Another provision gives States the authority to allow the use of MTBE \nin gasoline for sale and use within such State's borders. This \nprovision is intended to allow a State to use MTBE should the State \ndetermine that other problems, such as increased air pollution, price \nspikes, or fuel supply shortages, outweigh any adverse impact MTBE may \nhave on water quality. The regulations implementing this provision \ncould allow production and distribution in other States for intended \nultimate use in the notifying State, with appropriate safeguards to \nensure that the fuel containing MTBE ultimately is only sold or used in \nthe notifying State. Such rules, however, should not authorize \nproduction or use in a state that has banned MTBE and does not want it \nstored or handled there for fear of water supply contamination.\n  Section 833(d) is intended to hold harmless any legal recourse that \nthe States may have during the on-going litigation over the efforts to \nimpose or defend state MTBE bans or other legitimate actions to control \nor prohibit MTBE use or production.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The Senator has stated the essential point of this \nlegislation and these provisions in the energy bill, that is the \nelimination of MTBE to protect water supplies. Its removal from the \ngasoline supply could encourage the replacement of fuel volumes with \nmore toxic components, so section 834 of this legislation requires EPA \nto ensure maintenance of the toxics reduction over-compliance already \nachieved in RFG areas. EPA may comply with this requirement by amending \nthe existing Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSAT) rule by updating the \nindividual refinery RFG baselines from 1998-2000 to 1999-2000, and \nwhatever other appropriate changes are necessary. We are advised by the \nAgency that any such changes should be minimal.\n  The MSAT rule currently makes a distinction between baseline volume, \nthe average volume produced during the years 1998-2000, and incremental \nvolume, or additional volume above baseline volume. These categories \nare treated differently under the rule and under this legislation. \nUnder the rule, baseline volumes must adhere to new toxic reduction \nstandards based on actual survey data from 1998-2000 and incremental \nvolumes are held to the statutory or regulatory reduction, whichever \napply. Under this legislation, the baseline volumes must adhere to the \nupdated toxic reduction standard based on actual survey data from 1999-\n2000. Incremental volumes are treated the same as under the rule unless \nthe actual toxics levels in any PADD exceed the average 1999-2000 \nlevels. If there is an exceedance, EPA must revise the existing \nregulation to require incremental volumes of RFG, in addition to \nbaseline volumes, to adhere to the updated individual refinery \nbaselines.\n\n  The RFG program set statutory content and performance requirements. \nThrough regulatory authority provided by the Clean Air Act, EPA chose, \nin 1993, to adopt performance standards for toxic air pollutants and \nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs) rather than the prescriptive fuels \nformula allowed under Section 211(k)(3)(A). These performance standards \nrequired a 15 percent reduction in toxic air pollutants from baseline \nfuel starting in 1995 and maintained through 1999, and required a 21.5 \npercent reduction from baseline fuel beginning in 2000, as part of \nPhase II.\n  Motor vehicle emissions of toxics have been drastically reduced in \nRFG areas, though they are still a very substantial portion of the air \ntoxics inventory in many areas. Over-compliance with the toxics \nreduction goals in the Clean Air Act has been largely due to the \ndilution effect of the oxygenates MTBE and ethanol, relatively toxic-\nfree additives. RFG survey data suggest that refiners have achieved a \n27 percent or higher reduction in toxic air pollutants from the 1990 \nbaseline.\n  On March 29, 2001, EPA released a final strategy to further reduce \nair toxics emissions from motor fuels in an effort to comply with its \nresponsibility under Section 202(l) of the Act. The strategy identified \n21 mobile source air toxics (MSATs). It is intended to ensure that \nrefiners continue over-compliance with RFG and anti-dumping \nrequirements by maintaining their average 1998-2000 toxic emissions \nperformance levels for baseline volumes of RFG and conventional \ngasoline. For incremental volumes, refiners must adhere to the \nregulatory standard of a 21.5 percent reduction. The MSAT rule is \nintended to ensure that toxics over-compliance is maintained regardless \nof whether any oxygenates are used. The MSAT rule commits EPA to \nrevisiting additional fuel and vehicle MSATs controls in a 2004 \nrulemaking.\n  Section 834(b) supplements the air toxics provisions for RFG. \nCongress recognizes that EPA recently adopted regulations at 40 CFR \npart 80 Subpart J regarding air toxics performance of gasoline, \nincluding provisions for RFG. Congress intends that the regulations \nrecently adopted by EPA are adequate to implement new section \n211(k)(1)(B)(ii) and (iii), with the exception of the change in \nbaseline year from 1998-2000 to 1999-2000 and any resulting baseline \nchanges that may necessitate. The provisions in the current regulations \nfor setting baselines, baseline adjustments, deficit carry-over, and \nthe like should still all be appropriate under this new provision. \nWhile new baseline adjustments would not be allowed based solely on the \nnew provision, prior baseline adjustments would not be affected, except \nas called for with the change in the baseline years. For example, the \nexistence of a federal ban on MTBE would not automatically change any \npreviously granted adjustments, and would not provide grounds for any \nnew adjustments.\n  I would note that there is not wholehearted support for the MSAT rule \nat 40 CFR part 80 subpart J in Congress or in the States. The Northeast \nStates for Coordinated Air Use Management has filed suit against the \nAgency claiming that this rule is inadequate to protect public health \nin the Northeast and inconsistent with the requirements in section \n202(l) of the Clean Air Act. So, we have included a savings clause to \nbe very clear that Congress has not blessed this rule through the \ninclusion of these anti-backsliding provisions.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the existing RFG \nregulations set separate standards for fuel sold in Northern and \nSouthern RFG areas. Section 839 of the legislation we are discussing \nrequires EPA to revise\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\nexisting RFG regulations to apply the stricter Southern requirements in \nall RFG areas nationwide. This will provide the Northern RFG States, \nincluding New Hampshire, with less-polluting Southern RFG. In addition, \nthis provision will help to reduce the number of boutique fuels. This \nprovision does not alter the Administrator's current ability to make \nvolatile organic compound (VOC) adjustments for ethanol blends of RFG, \nlike the existing adjustment given to Chicago and Milwaukee.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Because of that change and the other congressional \nactions on MTBE and renewable fuels, there are likely to be significant \nchanges in the Nation's gasoline characteristics. Section 836 of this \nlegislation requires EPA to study and report on the changes in \nemissions of air pollutants and changes in overall air quality due to \nthe use of fuels and fuel additives resulting from this bill. This \nreport will provide information to evaluate the success of the \nprovisions of this legislation and should help identify problems that \ncan be solved by statute or regulation before they are serious.\n  Section 211(c) of the CAA provides the Administrator with regulatory \nauthority over fuels or fuel additives, if, in the judgment of the \nAdministrator, the fuels or fuel additives or emission products cause \nor contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to \nendanger the public health or welfare. This legislation adds authority \nto protect water quality, in addition to air quality. The bill requires \nthe Administrator to exercise this regulatory authority to prohibit the \nuse of MTBE. The bill also adds water quality as an environmental \nprotection criterion in Title II of the act.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. To address the inflexibility of the opt-\nin process for states that desire to use RFG to reduce emissions, \nsection 837 of the Energy bill allows Governors of States within the \nOzone Transport Region (OTR), to opt in any area to the RFG program. \nEPA must approve the request unless there is insufficient capacity to \nsupply RFG to the area. Currently, only ozone nonattainment areas are \nallowed to opt in to the program. This legislation expands the program \nto include all areas within the OTR States. This will give those \nstates, including New Hampshire, the opportunity to have one clean, \nMTBE-free RFG statewide. This provision is intended to provide cleaner \nfuel, address the boutique fuel problem, and help states achieve \nattainment.\n  The section addresses both the commencement and termination of the \nRFG requirements in areas in the OTR that opt-in to RFG under that \nprovision. The provision on termination of the RFG program in these \nopt-in areas is not intended to change or modify in any way EPA's \nauthority to adopt reasonable opt-out provisions under either section \n211(k)(6)(A) or (B).\n  This section includes a provision that allows a temporary delay of \nthe effective date of these requirements if there is insufficient \ncapacity to supply gasoline to a State that chooses to opt in new areas \nto the RFG program. If EPA, in consultation with the Department of \nEnergy, determines that expansion of the RFG program would result in \ninsufficient supply of gasoline in the State, the effective date of the \nnew opt-in areas may be delayed for a period of up to one year with the \npossibility of two more periods of up to one year each.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Section 838 of the legislation allows States to ask EPA \nto enforce any state-imposed fuel specifications that have been \napproved under processes established under Section 110 or Section \n211(c)(4)(C) of the Clean Air Act. Effective and consistent enforcement \nof State and federal environmental laws is very important. States \ncurrently have very limited budgets for enforcement activities. To \nensure full, faithful, and consistent enforcement of the state laws, \nthis provision provides the ability for States to access additional \nfederal resources for enforcement of state fuel specifications, once \napproved by EPA through the existing processes.\n  The section directs EPA to enforce certain state fuel controls or \nprohibitions in the same manner as if EPA had adopted the control or \nprohibition under section 211. This new provision is not intended to \nchange in any way the requirements for approval of a State fuel control \nor prohibition in a SIP, including the requirement that it be \nenforceable by the state. It is also not intended to limit EPA's \nenforcement discretion. EPA would have the same discretion in \nenforcement matters with respect to these state fuel controls or \nprohibition as it would with a federal fuel control or prohibition \nadopted under section 211.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. To avert air quality problems that might \narise through increased use of ethanol, pursuant to the renewable fuels \nrequirements, section 819(c) of the legislation allows States to \neliminate the RVP waiver for gasohol if such waiver will increase air \npollution in any area within the State. If a state determines the \nwaiver will cause air quality problems, the State may submit \nnotification, accompanied by supporting documentation, to EPA \nindicating that the stricter RVP limit must be applied to gasohol \nwithin the state. This provision will help new ethanol using states to \ncontrol evaporative air pollution emissions from gasohol.\n  This section includes a provision that establishes a temporary delay \nof the effective date of these requirements if there is insufficient \ncapacity to supply gasoline to a State that chooses to eliminate the \nethanol RVP waiver. If EPA, after consultation with the Department of \nEnergy, determines that elimination of such waiver would result in an \ninsufficient supply of gasoline in the State, refiners may be allowed \nto retain the ethanol RVP waiver for a period of up to 1 year with the \npossibility of two more periods of up to 1 year each.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. In order to prevent future problems similar to the MTBE \ndebacle, Congress is expanding EPA's existing authority to regulate \nfuel additives. The current provisions of the Clean Air Act provide a \nprocess for EPA and authorized States to regulate fuels and additives \nin order to protect air quality. This legislation amends that process \nby allowing fuel and additive regulation in order to protect water \nquality, as well. If this authority already existed, EPA and the State \nof California might have been able to address the MTBE problem before \nit became acute without Congressional action.\n  There is also an additional prophylactic provision that requires EPA \nto study the health, air quality, and water quality effects of fuel \nadditives and blend stocks that may be used as replacements for MTBE. \nThe bill specifically lists ETBE, TAME, DIPE, TBA, ethanol, iso-octane, \nand alkylates as additives to be studied.\n  The existing law allows the Administrator to require fuel producers \nto conduct tests to determine the health and environmental effects of \nfuels and fuel additives. This provision mandates that the \nAdministrator regularly require fuel and fuel additive manufacturers to \nconduct testing and supply information on the effects of those \nsubstances on public and environmental health.\n  Congress intends that the Administrator should use this authority to \nidentify and assess any adverse public health, welfare, or \nenvironmental effects from the use of motor vehicle fuels or fuel \nadditives or the combustion products of such fuels or fuel additives. \nThe Administrator should use the authority to assess threats to both \nair pollution and water pollution in order to effectively exercise the \nauthority in Section 211(c) as amended by this legislation.\n  The Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in Gasoline recommended that EPA \nand others accelerate ongoing research efforts into the inhalation and \ningestion health effects, air emission transformation byproducts, and \nenvironmental behavior of all oxygenates and other components likely to \nincrease in the absence of MTBE. This should include research on \nethanol, alkylates, and aromatics, as well as on gasoline compositions \ncontaining those components.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. In order to limit potential negative \nimpacts on gasoline prices and fuel supplies, the legislation \nauthorizes a total of $750 million over three fiscal years to promote \nproduction of other fuel additives. This funding is intended to provide \ngrants to merchant MTBE producers for retooling existing facilities to \nproduce other clean fuel additives, such as iso-octane, in order to \navoid any fuel shortages that may have otherwise resulted from the \nelimination of the use of MTBE.\n\n[[Page S5446]]\n\n  According to a report from the EPA, the impact of the Federal \nReformulated Fuels Act on the fuel supply could range from a one \npercent shortage to a one percent surplus. The report further stated \nthat, due to the transition assistance, the actual impact is more \nlikely to be on the surplus side.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The renewable fuels and MTBE provisions contained in \nH.R. 4, as passed by the Senate, constitute an agreement among many \ncompeting interests that is designed to get rid of MTBE and increase \nrenewable fuel use.\n  After the reformulated gasoline program went into effect in 1995, \nmany refiners chose to use MTBE to satisfy the minimum 2 percent oxygen \nrequirement of the program. Oxygenates reduce tailpipe emissions of \ncarbon monoxide and other ozone precursors and provide a clean source \nof high octane, thereby displacing such toxic gasoline octane enhancers \nas benzene, toluene, and 1,3 butadiene. After implementation of the RFG \nprogram, increasing detection of MTBE in ground water and surface water \nled California to establish a schedule to ban MTBE and 13 other States \nhave followed with their own MTBE bans.\n  It became clear that the combination of a phase out of MTBE in these \nstates and the continued existence of the two percent oxygen content \nrequirement for RFG could result in a potentially disruptive and abrupt \ntransition to ethanol in states that did not have a history of using \nethanol. To facilitate the ban of MTBE, and to provide greater \nflexibility in producing RFG, states and refiners requested Congress \nand the administration to lift the RFG oxygen requirement. At the same \ntime, ethanol producers saw a major opportunity for market growth and \nwere reluctant to support elimination of the RFG oxygen requirement.\n  To address the challenge of maintaining market growth for ethanol, \nproviding greater flexibility in making clean-burning gasoline, and \nreducing the use of MTBE, Senators Lugar and Daschle in 2000 introduced \nthe Renewable Fuels Act, S. 2503. That bill would allow States to waive \nthe 2 percent oxygen requirement and established a nation-wide \nrenewable fuels standard (RFS) to roughly triple the use of ethanol \nfrom current levels over 10 years. That RFS requirement would apply to \nrefiners, who would be able to generate, bank, and trade credits for \nthe use of renewable fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel. This \nmechanism was designed to increase the use of renewable fuels, provide \nmaximum flexibility in the use of those renewable fuels, while ensuring \nthat eliminating MTBE from gasoline supplies will not lead to greater \ndependence on foreign oil. As a result of the credit trading and \nbanking, refiners will use renewable fuels where and when it is most \neconomical to do so, and no State will need to use any particular \namount of renewable fuel.\n  That legislation also established that ethanol produced from \ncellulosic biomass, which is particularly energy-efficient and produces \nsuperior greenhouse gas benefits, would receive 1.5 credits for every \ngallon used. This should spur the establishment of new ethanol \nfacilities across the United States that will use wood waste, municipal \nsolid waste, switchgrass, and other innovative feedstocks.\n  In September of 2000, the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee passed legislation, S. 2962, which incorporated many of the \nelements of S. 2503, but Congress adjourned prior to enactment of that \nbill. The EPW Committee again took up the issue in September of 2001, \npassing legislation to allow states to waive the oxygen requirement, \nbanning MTBE, and providing additional resources for cleaning up MTBE \ncontamination, but not including a renewable fuels standard. As the \nSenator from New Hampshire mentioned earlier, that legislation, S. 950, \nwas largely incorporated into S. 517, the Energy Policy Act. A separate \nsection establishing a renewable fuels standard also was included in S. \n517. Subsequently, negotiations between the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, the Energy Committee, and ethanol, public health, \nenvironmental, and petroleum interests produced a compromise that \nreplaced the initial MTBE and renewable fuels provisions of S. 517.\n\n  During debate on the RFS, concerns were raised that it could lead to \ngasoline price increases. In response, Senators Murkowski and Daschle \nasked the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to evaluate the \npotential costs of implementing the RFS, as well as the other fuels \nprovisions in S. 517. The EIA found that the RFS would raise gasoline \nprices by less than 1 penny per gallon in RFG areas and less than one-\nhalf a cent per gallon nationwide. The EIA also noted that these were \nupper-bound estimates that did not account for the economic benefits \nthat would result from the credit trading and banking provisions. The \nAmerican Petroleum Institute estimated that the maximum cost increase \nfor a gallon of gasoline due to the implementation of the RFS would be \nless than one-third of a cent per gallon.\n  Concerns have also been expressed that requiring the nation to use \nmore renewable fuels could lead to supply shortages and price \nincreases. The evidence suggests that there will be abundant supplies \nof renewable fuels to meet the RFS. The RFS begins in 2004, requiring \n2.3 billion gallons of ethanol to be used in that year. According to \nthe California Energy Commission report on nationwide ethanol supplies, \nissued in August of 2001, there will be 2.7 billion gallons of ethanol \ncapacity in place by then, so renewable fuels supplies should be \nplentiful.\n  Nevertheless, additional consumer protections were incorporated into \nthe legislation. Under the bill, the Department of Energy is required \nto evaluate supply and logistics of transporting and blending renewable \nfuels. If problems are anticipated, the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency is instructed to reduce the level of \nthe RFS in 2004. In subsequent years, States that are concerned about \nrenewable fuels prices or supplies may apply to the Administrator of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency to reduce the RFS in whole or in \npart. State applications must be acted upon within 90 days.\n  The legislation creates a narrow prospective safe harbor from \nliability for defect in design or manufacture of a renewable fuel by \nvirtue of it being mandated by this legislation. To qualify for this \nlimited protection, manufacturers of such fuels must have evaluated \nthem for EPA with respect to their toxicity, carcinogenicity, air \nquality impacts, water quality impacts and they must be used in \ncompliance with any restrictions imposed by EPA. All other causes of \naction or damages available under applicable State or Federal law are \nunaffected by this legislation including, but not limited to, \nnegligence, duty to warn, personal injury, property damage, \nenvironmental damage, wrongful death, compensatory damages, and \npunitive damages.\n  The Senate passed its bill on April 25 and appointed conferees on May \n1. We should move quickly to begin this conference because there are \nmany difficult matters to negotiate. Fortunately, the compromise \nprovisions which we have been discussing relating to MTBE and renewable \nfuels appear to have broad support, judging from the votes in the \nSenate, and should be amenable to swift agreement among the energy bill \nconferees.\n  So, as I mentioned during the debate on S.517 as part of my summary \nof these provisions, this is not an ideal package, but it meets the \ntest of improving and protecting air and water quality and promoting \nrenewable energy.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I agree with the chairman \nthat this legislation is not ideal, but it accomplishes our main goal \nof remediation and prevention of MTBE contamination. I am pleased that \nthe House has appointed its conferees today and I hope that we can move \nthat conference to an expeditious conclusion maintaining the integrity \nof the compromise that we worked out here in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5446-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5446-S5447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SUPPORT FOR THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was deeply disappointed that the Senate \ndid not have enough votes to move forward on the hate crimes bill--even \nthough a clear majority of the Senate supports this important measure.\n  During the debate, many of my colleagues addressed the \nconstitutionality of this legislation, and the role that the Federal \nGovernment should play\n\n[[Page S5447]]\n\nwith regard to hate crimes. What speaks volumes to me about the \nimportance of this legislation--and the reason the Senate's inaction is \nso disappointing--are the stories. The people behind the numbers. The \nvictims and the survivors.\n  In the strong hope that we will revisit this matter in the near \nfuture, let me share some of these stories--some of the awful realities \nof the crimes we are talking about. The most recent happened just last \nweek in Riverside, CA.\n  Last Thursday, two gay men were stabbed repeatedly in the back \noutside a popular gay bar. One of these men, 40-year-old Jeffrey Owens, \ndied hours later. Michael Bussee, 48-years-old, managed to survive.\n  According to the media reports, both men had come to the bar to \ncelebrate a friend's birthday. After leaving the bar with their \npartners, Jeffrey Owens wanted to show everyone the pictures he had \ntaken on a recent trip to Joshua Tree National Park. When he went to \nretrieve the pictures in his car, a man approached Michael Bussee, \npunched him, and then stabbed him in the back. Noting the commotion, \nJeffrey Owens approached the perpetrator, and was stabbed four times in \nthe back. Before stabbing Jeffrey, the attacker screamed a homophobic \nslur.\n  Apparently, neither man knew how badly he had been hurt. Jeffrey \nOwens didn't even realize he had been stabbed until he stepped out of \nthe car at the county hospital in Moreno Valley, when his friends saw \nhis blood-soaked seat.\n  Jeffrey Owens died hours later, after two operations. Michael Bussee \nwas treated and released.\n  There are countless other stories I could share with you, but I will \nonly touch on a few of them here today.\n  On September 7, 2000, a Los Angeles resident was charged with murder \nand hate crimes for allegedly killing a 65-year-old Hispanic man, Jesus \nPlascensia, by running him over at least twice in a parking lot. \nAuthorities say she made comments about her hatred of Hispanics after \nshe murdered him and referred to him as ``dead road kill.''\n  On September 18, 2001, someone threw a Molotov cocktail through the \nwindow of a Sikh family's home in San Mateo, CA. The fuse was lit but, \ndue to some miracle, the firebomb did not explode as it hit the head of \na 3-year-old child in the house.\n  In Santa Barbara, CA, a 37-year-old gay man named Clint Scott \nRisetter was killed after an alleged arsonist poured gasoline over him \nwhile he slept and set him on fire. The perpetrator says he killed \nRisetter ``because he was gay,'' and because he had ``a lot of hatred \ntoward gay people.''\n  And the list goes on and on. These stories are what make this bill so \nvitally important.\n  This bill would extend current Federal hate crime protection--which \ncovers race, religion, color and national origin--to gender, sexual \norientation and disability. It would also make it easier to prosecute \nhate crimes at the Federal level.\n  It is an extremely important tool to help our already overtaxed State \nand local law enforcement by allowing Federal assistance, when \nnecessary, in the investigation and prosecutions of hate crimes.\n  It would provide Federal assistance to State, local and Indian law \nenforcement officials who have run up extraordinary expenses in \nconnection with their investigation and prosecution of hate crimes. It \nwould also provide training grants to help local law enforcement \nofficers identify, investigate, prosecute, and prevent hate crimes. \nFinally, it would allow the Justice Department to back up local law \nenforcement by removing arcane obstacles that prevent effective \nprosecution of hate crimes motivated by race, color, religion, or \nethnicity.\n  This bill has broad support from notable law enforcement agencies and \nstate and local leaders, including 22 state Attorneys General, the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriff's \nAssociation, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and \nothers. With this broad-based support, and with the need so clearly \nurgent, this bill should be immediately passed.\n  Two years ago we stressed the importance of passing hate crimes \nlegislation. We cited the examples of James Byrd, Jr., of Matthew \nShepard, and others. And we passed it.\n  Here we are, two years later, making the same arguments and \nconducting the same debates. This time, the victims have new names: \nmost recently, in my State of California, names such as Jeffrey Owens, \nMichael Bussee, Jesus Plascensia, and Clint Scott Risetter.\n  The time to act is now. It is my hope that we will pass this vital \nlegislation by the end of this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5447-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred June 1, 2001 \nin Modesto, CA. The home of an inter-racial couple and the couple's two \nchildren were threatened when someone threw a Molotov cocktail at the \ncouple's home. Police believe it was a hate crime, citing other \nevidence such as a watermelon thrown on the driveway, a box of grits, a \nfrozen bag of black-eyed peas, and a 40-oz. King Cobra beer.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5447-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5447-S5448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n LEGISLATION TO DENY U.S. TAXPAYER MONEY TO ARAFAT AND THE PALESTINIAN \n                               AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in support of \nmy legislation to prohibit any U.S. taxpayer money from ending up in \nthe hands of Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian authority.\n  Unfortunately, Yasser Arafat is not a partner in the peace process.\n  As long as the United States continues to provide money to the \nPalestinian authority through grants to non-governmental organizations, \nsome of that money will end up in the hands of those who wish to do \nharm to Israel.\n  We must stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel in the war against \nterrorism.\n  We must also send a clear message to Yasser Arafat and the \nPalestinian leadership that the United States will not tolerate \nterrorism against Israel.\n  Israel is a true friend and ally.\n  And, as a Nation, we share many of the same values--democracy, \nrespect for human rights, freedom of the press, a strong desire for \npeace and prosperity, to name but a few.\n  During the Camp David summit in July of 2000, it was Israel that was \nprepared to make tremendous concessions to ensure peace in the Region.\n  As we all know today, Arafat refused to reach a peace agreement, and \nwalked away from the negotiating table.\n  Yasser Arafat did not want peace because he needs the conflict for \nthem to stay in power.\n  Instead of peace, they chose terror.\n  My staff has compiled a list of terrorist attacks on Israel last \nyear. In 2001, 79 attacks cost 160 innocent Israelis their lives, and \nwounded another 1,200. Since then, of course, we have all seen the \ntremendous cost in human lives and misery from many more terrorist \nattacks on innocent civilians, and the resulting isolation of Yasser \nArafat and the civilized world's condemnation of the Palestinian \nauthority.\n  We dare not forget the level of terror visited upon Israel by \nPalestinian terrorists.\n  Arafat is using his own personal forces to attack Israel through \nsuicide attacks.\n  Furthermore, he is allowing Hamas and Islamic Jihad safe harbor in \nthe West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n  Hamas and Islamic Jihad are two of the most heinous terrorist \norganizations in the world, responsible for the deaths of numerous \ninnocent people.\n  Keep in mind, at one time, Arafat promised to get rid of these \norganizations.\n\n[[Page S5448]]\n\n  Arafat's promises are worth nothing.\n  It is wrong to ask American taxpayers to subsidize the Palestinian \nauthority when Yasser Arafat uses the resources of the Palestinian \nauthority to attack innocent men, women, and children in Israel.\n  We have seen video footage of the Palestinian people cheering and \ndancing in the streets after the September 11th attacks--many holding \nposters of Saddam Hussein.\n  Yet, while we have sanctions against Iraq, we are providing millions \nof dollars in aid to the Palestinian authority through non-governmental \norganizations.\n  We know well that any funds, even designated as humanitarian, free up \nmoney that Arafat can use for his army of human bombers.\n  If there is any doubt in anybody's mind that Yasser Arafat promotes \nterrorism, I would like you to consider the order on the official \nletterhead of the presidential bureau of the Palestinian authority/\nPalestine liberation organization, bearing the signature of Yasser \nArafat just 8 days after our country was attacked on 911, ordering $600 \nbe paid from the treasury of the Palestine authority to each of three \nterrorists. Two of them are senior activists of the Fatah terrorist \ngroup, and one of these, Ziad Da'as, is the head of the group behind a \nrecent deadly terrorist attack on a bat-mitzvah party in Israel. The \nIsraeli defense ministry says they recently captured this document at \nArafat's office in Ramallah.\n  Also, I ask my colleages to consider the order from Yasser Arafat to \nthe finance ministry of the Palestinian authority from January 7th of \nthis year. In this document, Arafat orders the disbursement of $350 to \neach of the 12 named Fatah activists. According to the Israeli Defense \nMinistry, who captured this document at Arafat's headquarters in \nRamallah, each of these 12 individuals are known terrorists, belonging \nto Fatah and or Tanzim. Arafat's approval is given in response to a \nrequest of Ra'ed Karmi, then the head of the Fatah and Tanzim Terror \nGroups, which perpetrated numerous murderous attacks on innocent \nIsraeli civilians since September 2000.\n  American aid to the Palestinian authority allows Arafat to focus more \nof his resources on attacking Israel.\n  We need to make sure no taxpayer money ends up in the Palestinian \nauthority.\n  My legislation would do just that.\n  As recently as April 7th of this year, Tim Russert on ``Meet the \nPress'' asked the Secretary of State to deny that Arafat is funding \nterrorism. Here Is what he said:\n\n       Russert: Israel says documents link Arafat and terrorism. \n     They seized documents and made them public, which linked the \n     office of Yasser Arafat with terrorist attacks carried out \n     against Israeli civilians and other targets. One of the \n     documents, said to be an invoice submitted by a leading \n     Palestinian militant group to a Palestinian official, among \n     other items, the invoice requested 20,000 Israeli Shekels, \n     $4,200 American, to buy electrical and chemical components \n     for the production of a month's supply of 30 bombs. It's an \n     invoice of terrorism, said Dori Gold, an advisor to Prime \n     Minister Sharon. [Mr. Secretary,] do you believe the \n     Palestinian authority harbors or supports terrorism?''\n\n  Do you know, what our Secretary of State replied?\n  Did he deny the authenticity of this document? He did not.\n  Did he deny that Arafat paid the bill? He did not.\n  Did he deny that our taxpayer dollars are thus funding the killing of \ninnocent men, women and children? He did not.\n  What he said was, ``It is a complex situation''.\n  There's nothing complex about it! Our tax dollars should never be \nused for terrorism. Period. End of discussion!\n  After our Nation was brutally attacked on September 11, President \nBush set a new direction in U.S. foreign policy.\n  He Said, ``From this day forward, any Nation that continues to harbor \nor support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile \nregime.''\n  By any honest assessment, Yasser Arafat both harbors and supports \nterrorism.\n  On the other hand, Israel is a good friend of the United States and \nthe only democracy in the middle east.\n  I repeat, we must stand unequivocally by Israel, and do everything in \nour power to support her.\n  The record is clear.\n  Israel is a friend of the United States, Yasser Arafat is not.\n  We can't expect Israel to negotiate with individuals who wish to \ndestroy Israel's very existence.\n  We must also ensure that we in no way support Arafat's oppressive \nregime by providing money to organizations affiliated with the \nPalestinian authority.\n  Every dollar that we send to the west bank and Gaza is a dollar that \ncould potentially be used to support terrorism.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to stand with me on the side of Israel \nand vote for my legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5448-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HUMAN CLONING PROHIBITION ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, earlier this week I modified my bill, the \nHuman Cloning Prohibition Act, S. 2076. I originally introduced this \nbill in an attempt to forge a consensus on what I thought was a \nstraight-forward concept, the banning of reproductive cloning or the \ncloning of a human being. When I introduced the legislation, I stated: \n``It is a simple bill, but it reflects my view and a view that is held \nby almost everyone. . . . My legislation makes it illegal to clone a \nhuman being and imposes strict penalties against anyone who violates \nthis prohibition.''\n  However, in recent weeks those who oppose my legislation have \ninterpreted the language of my bill in a manner that is not consistent \nwith the intent of the bill. They argue that my bill as originally \nintroduced would allow a cloned embryo to be implanted into the uterus \nand ``harvested'' at some point prior to birth.\n  I do not believe the language of my bill allows that, and it is \ncertainly not the intent of the bill. But, in order that no one can \nmisinterpret the intent of my bill, I am making an adjustment in the \nbill language. The revised language will define human cloning as \n``implanting or attempting to implant the product of somatic cell \nnuclear transfer, or any other cloning technique, into a uterus or the \nfunctional equivalent of a uterus.'' It makes it unlawful for ``any \nperson to conduct or attempt to conduct human cloning.'' The bill \nretains the strict penalties against violators that were present in the \noriginal version.\n  My legislation is silent on the matter of therapeutic cloning or what \nsome call ``regenerative medicine.'' I understand that this is a topic \nthat needs thoughtful discussion and debate. It is a subject that is \naddressed in other bills now before the Senate.\n  I respect those who support the Brownback bill and wish to prohibit \nwhat is called somatic cell nuclear transplantation or the cloning of \nstem cells. This is a difficult subject and there is plenty of room for \nthoughtful disagreement in the debate. But I don't believe that we \nshould prohibit the promising research that could lead to cures for \ndiseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease and more. \nI agree with Nancy Reagan, former President Ford, Orrin Hatch, and \nothers that this kind of regenerative medicine conducted under strict \nguidelines and controls can offer great hope to tens of millions of \nAmericans and can save lives.\n  The debate on that matter is left to other legislation. My bill \napplies only to the issue of prohibiting the cloning of a human being \nand I hope that this change in the language will no longer leave room \nfor those who are opponents to misinterpret or misunderstand its \nintent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5448-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5448-S5449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   ALEUTIAN CAMPAIGN OF WORLD WAR II\n\n Mr. STEVENS.

This campaign was \nthe only action actually fought on American soil during the war. The \nmen who served there endured not only the horrors of combat, but also \none of the harshest environments on Earth.

It illustrates \nthe strategic importance of the battles of Dutch Harbor, Attu, and \nKiska. Garfield has vivid descriptions of the long, hard campaign to \npush the Japanese off American soil.\n  I ask to print the aforementioned articles in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n             [From the Anchorage Daily News, June 3, 2002]\n\nMemories of War: Sixty Years Ago, Bombs Fell on Dutch Harbor and Turned \n                       Alaska Into a Battleground\n\n                          (By Gabriel Spitzer)\n\n       To Japan during World War II, the Aleutian Islands looked \n     into North America. It was on the Aleutians that the enemy \n     set foot on American soil for the first time since the War of \n     1812.\n       Sixty years ago, on the morning of June 3, 1942, 16 \n     Japanese fighters and bombers streaked eastward toward Dutch \n     Harbor, off Unalaska Island. Bombs rained down for about 20 \n     minutes on the Navy facilities there. The next day the \n     Japanese forces returned in greater numbers. By the end of \n     the second day, 35 American men were killed and 28 more were \n     wounded.\n       Johnnie Jenkins, a 25-year-old Navy mess cook, was in his \n     barracks the morning of June 3 when the explosions woke him. \n     He said he jumped from bed and threw on his clothes, one shoe \n     on and the other in his hand.\n       ``I stood in the doorway, and I saw a Japanese plane coming \n     in with a rising sun on it,'' said Jenkins, now living in \n     Anchorage. ``Lord, my heart started pumping and I was so \n     scared. I thought, this is it. I just froze right there.''\n       Jenkins, who is African-American, looked around for cover.\n       ``I saw a white fellow in a foxhole, and he stood up. I ran \n     over there. He said, `You can't come in here, I'm from \n     Alabama.' I said, `I don't give a damn where you're from. You \n     move on over!' And he did.''\n       One of the many civilians at Dutch Harbor was 22-year-old \n     shipwright Bob Ingram, now living in Fairbanks. Ingram was \n     getting ready for an ordinary day of work when the bombs \n     began to fall.\n       ``Somebody yelled `air raid'. We saw airplanes, quite a few \n     in the sky,'' he said.\n       ``Somebody said, there's been a number of men killed, and \n     they're going to need caskets. Now, if there's one thing you \n     don't need during an air raid it's caskets. But we wanted to \n     help. So we started to make caskets out of plywood, 2 feet \n     square and 6 feet long.''\n       As inviting as the Aleutians may have seemed on the map, \n     the Japanese quickly found them an inhospitable invasion \n     route. Often bathed in fog and pounded by frequent storms, \n     the islands proved difficult to scout and navigate. This, \n     coupled with American intelligence reports, led to victories \n     for the United States but not before Japan had occupied two \n     Alaska islands and drawn American forces into one of the \n     costliest battles of the Pacific theater.\n       Japan had little intention of actually invading the U.S. \n     mainland from the Aleutians. Instead, it hoped to occupy a \n     few islands in the North Pacific to solidify its naval \n     perimeter and protect itself from American incursions by sea \n     and air. It also hoped to pull America's might away from its \n     main objective, the South Pacific, Hawaii and perhaps \n     Australia.\n       The Dutch Harbor raid was a diversionary tactic, meant to \n     draw attention from Japan's assault on Midway Island, planned \n     to occur at the same time that American forces were \n     distracted by the attack on Alaska.\n       But unknown to the Japanese, U.S. code breakers had cracked \n     the enemy's top secret ``purple code'' and were able to \n     prepare for the attacks. U.S. soldiers at bases throughout \n     the Pacific were put on alert.\n       One of them was Marine Corps Pvt. Howard Lucas, stationed \n     on Kodiak Island.\n       ``We were ready for somebody to come up over the hill and \n     get us,'' said Lucas, 79, who lives in Palmer.\n       Lucas spent two weeks on alert 24 hours a day, manning an \n     antiquated World War I-era water-cooled machine gun.\n       ``It was scary,'' he said. ``But they never showed up. \n     Nobody knew what they were going to do, the Japanese \n     included, I guess.''\n       By the morning of June 3, the fog of war, both literal and \n     figurative, had wreaked havoc on both sides.\n       That day, planes on the Japanese carrier Junyo never \n     reached Dutch Harbor, grounded by weather. At the same time, \n     a radio message warning American forces of the impending \n     attack failed to reach its destination.\n       In the two days of bombing and the days immediately before, \n     the weather made a mockery of both sides' battle plans.\n       Historians estimate that both sides sustained more \n     casualties related to the weather than from actual combat. \n     American forces lost four times as many planes to weather-\n     related accidents as they did in battle.\n       Although U.S. casualties greatly outnumbered Japanese \n     losses at Dutch Harbor, by the end of the assault Japan was \n     on its heels. Its attack on Midway proved a major defeat, and \n     American intelligence had foiled Japan's naval ruse.\n       Rather than abandon the Aleutian campaign, Japanese forces \n     occupied the western islands of Attu and Kiska. On Attu, \n     1,200 Japanese troops surrounded and captured 39 Aleut \n     villagers.\n       On Kiska, the invaders found only a weather station \n     guarding the island. Still, scores of Aleuts and about a \n     dozen white Americans were captured in the attacks and spent \n     the rest of the war as prisoners in Japan.\n       Drafin Delkettie, one of the few living members of the \n     celebrated Combat Intelligence Platoon, Alaska Scouts, was \n     stationed on the island of Amchitka, about 40 miles east of \n     Japanese-occupied Kiska.\n       During that time, Delkettie, who lives in Anchorage, \n     experienced what the soldiers at Dutch Harbor felt.\n       ``They bombed and strafed us every morning at 10 a.m. and \n     every evening at 6 p.m. They never missed it by a minute. \n     Sometimes we played pinochle or something, waiting for them \n     to come,'' he said.\n       Which didn't make it a game. ``No matter where the bombs \n     are falling,'' he reflected, ``It's scary.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Anchorage Daily News, June 3, 2002]\n\n                War Came To Alaska . . . Sixty Years Ago\n\n       It was early on a Wednesday morning, that day of June 3, \n     1942, when war came to Alaska.\n       Sixty years have passed since then. The war has come and \n     gone. But the memories are seared deeply in the minds and \n     hearts of those whose lives were touched by the long fight \n     against enemies of freedom.\n       World War II began officially for the U.S. on Dec. 7, 1941, \n     with Japan's surprise air attack on Pearl Harbor in the \n     territory of Hawaii.\n       It was six months later that Japanese bombers delivered the \n     first bombs on the territory of Alaska, attacking Dutch \n     Harbor and nearby Fort Mears--timed to coincide with Japan's \n     assault on Midway, far to the south in the Pacific.\n       Today's anniversary of the start of the battle in the \n     Aleutian Islands--the only action actually fought on American \n     soil during the war--is a reminder that American soldiers, \n     airmen and sailors put their lives on the line to drive enemy \n     forces from Attu and Kiska.\n       One of those, Army Pvt. Joe P. Martinez of Company K, 32nd \n     Infantry, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for \n     gallantry above and beyond the call of duty.\n       Despite facing what the War Department called ``severe \n     hostile machine-gun, rifle and mortar-fire'' from both flanks \n     and from enemy forces protected by snow trenches ahead of \n     him, Martinez used his automatic rifle and hand grenades to \n     lead repeated charges up a rocky, knife-like ridge to a snow-\n     covered mountain pass.\n       Just below the rim of the pass, Martinez encountered a \n     final enemy-occupied trench and while firing into it was \n     mortally wounded. But soldiers following in his footsteps \n     then were able to capture the pass, described in the citation \n     awarding him the nation's highest medal as ``an importance on \n     the island.''\n       The war is decades in the past now. Old enemies have become \n     friends.\n       But Alaskans of today should never forget that in the \n     Aleutians, now a proud part of the 49th State, young \n     Americans gave their lives years ago to drive invading forces \n     from our land.\n       It's worthy of remembering on today's anniversary of that \n     first raid on Dutch Harbor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5449-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5449-S5450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EULOGY FOR REVEREND JAMES L. STOVALL\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, my State of Louisiana recently \nmourned the death of one of our most notable and renowned religious \nleaders, Reverend James L. Stovall, a minister of the United Methodist \nChurch for thirty years and the founder of the Louisiana Coalition \nAgainst Racism and Nazism. In 1989, fearful of the rise of former Ku \nKlux Klan leader David Duke, Reverend Stovall led the effort to bring \ntogether people of faith and other citizens to oppose the hatred and \nbigotry espoused by Duke and many of his supporters.\n  As a participant in the Louisiana Senate election of 1990 and the \ngovernor's election the following year, I can attest to successful \nefforts of Reverend Stovall and his Coalition in exposing for Louisiana \nand the world Duke's harmful and divisive racist record.\n  Those who did not know James Stovall might not have known that his \nrole in forming and leading the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and \nNazism was merely the culmination of a life and career dedicated to \nchampioning human rights and better relations among people of all \nfaiths, ethic backgrounds, and nationalities. As one of his daughters \nsaid to a newspaper reporter after his death on May 17, ``He had a \ngenuine sense of caring about\n\n[[Page S5450]]\n\npeople and a strong sense of right and wrong.''\n  James Stovall was born in Winn Parish, graduated from Centenary \nCollege in Shreveport and the Perkins School of Theology at Southern \nMethodist University. During the Second World War, he served this \ncountry as a chaplain attached to the Marine Corps. Following the war, \nhe returned to Louisiana where, for thirty years, he served Methodist \nchurches in Eunice, Baton Rouge, Lake Charles, Lafayette, Metairie, and \nMonroe. A strong believer in ecumenism, he was a leader in the creation \nof the Greater Baton Rouge Federation of Churches and Synagogues, and \nfrom 1976 to 1991, he served as executive director of the Louisiana \nInterchurch Conference.\n  Reverend Stovall served not only the church, but held several \npositions in State government. He was executive director of the \nGovernor's Office of Elderly Affairs from 1979 to 1980, chairman of the \nGovernor's Pardon and Parole Study Commission in 1976, and a member of \nthe Louisiana Commission on Human Rights in 1992.\n  At his funeral service in Baton Rouge, one of Reverend Stovall's good \nfriends, Dr. Lance Hill, who is executive director of the Southern \nInstitute for Education and Research at Tulane University New Orleans, \nshared a powerful story about his legacy. I would like to quote from \nthat eulogy at this time:\n\n       Many years ago Jimmie told me that John Wesley, the founder \n     of the Methodist Church, once noted that a man's achievements \n     in this lifetime are fleeting and insignificant; what is \n     meaningful is the shadow that he casts into the future. We \n     formed the Southern Institute for Education and Research at \n     Tulane University nine years ago to continue the work of \n     Jimmie Stovall and the anti-Duke coalition, but this time \n     through a proactive program that taught young people the \n     consequences of prejudice and the individual moral obligation \n     to speak out against the oppression of others.\n       The Southern Institute is very much Reverend Stovall's gift \n     to Louisiana. I told Jimmie years ago that we should have \n     named it the Stovall Institute, but people might think it was \n     a [football] clinic. Jimmie just laughed, but he knew what I \n     meant. The work of the Institute is part of Jimmie's vast \n     shadow cast into the future.\n       A few months ago, I returned to St. Catherine of Sienna, a \n     school in the middle of [David] Duke's old legislative \n     district. We had worked with the teachers and students there \n     for years. That day I watch 150 students mesmerized by the \n     story told by Eva Galler, a Holocaust survivor. The students \n     heard the story of Eva's leap from the train to Auschwitz; \n     the destruction of her family; the end of the world as she \n     knew it. Eva told them that this was not simply a story of \n     Jews and Nazis, it was a story of racism and hatred. It could \n     happen anywhere, anytime, and they had a moral obligation to \n     resist hatred at every turn.\n       I watched three young boys on the back row, sitting on the \n     edge of their seats, straining to see over the tall girls in \n     front of them. They were transfixed by Eva. And as Eva spoke, \n     I saw the soft, warm shadow of Reverend Stovall envelop the \n     children. These children, the next generation of leaders in \n     Louisiana, these children were his legacy. In this sense, \n     James Stovall achieved a kind of immortality that only the \n     best of us can ever dream of. We will miss him in body, but \n     he will always be with us in spirit.\n\n  I extend my heartfelt condolences to Reverend Stovall's daughters, \nsisters, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. In the midst of their \ngrief, I hope that they will be comforted to know that his important \nwork and the principles that guided him in that work will not soon be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5450-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING KELLY CAMPBELL\n\n Mr. ALLEN.

The students' projects \npresented at the White House are part of a larger group of 2,000 \nfinalists participating in the National History Day national contest at \nthe University of Maryland.\n  The National History Day Program engages more than one-half million \nparticipants annually in grades 6 through 12 in 49 states and the \nDistrict of Columbia. The program provides students the analytical and \nresearch skills that are useful in any area of their lives. Students \nresearch history topics of their choice related to an annual theme and \ncreate exhibits, performances, documentaries and papers, which they may \nenter in competitions at the district, State and national levels.\n  Kelly will present an exhibit entitled ``The 3 R's: Revolution, \nReform, Reaction and the Schools of the Freedman's Bureau.''\n  During my term as Governor of Virginia, we recognized that there are \nfundamental academic basics that our children must learn if they are to \nbe capable, responsible, and contributing citizens, and able to compete \nand succeed in the future. To ensure the success of our school \nchildren, we implemented high standards and accountability including \nhistory standards. We believed that Virginia's students should have the \nfundamental knowledge and understanding of their cultural and \nhistorical heritage that serves as a foundation for preserving a free, \nprosperous and decent society.\n  I congratulate Kelly and her fellow historians on their success and \nwish them the best as they compete against students from across the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5450-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENDING MELISSA BROWN, KAITIE COCHRANE AND LINDSAY JANS ON NATIONAL \n                              HISTORY DAY\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE.

To be ranked by the National History \nDay program among the 2000 students chosen to join the national \ncompetition is an impressive honor, and to be one of only 17 groups \nselected from over half a million participants to present at the \nNational Museum of American History is an incredible achievement \nindeed.\n  The National History Day Contest is the Nation's oldest and one of \nthe most highly regarded humanities contests for students in middle and \nhigh school. The experience that Kaitie, Lindsay, and Melissa have \ngained through their NHD project using primary resources and \nparticipating in hands-on activities will last them for the rest of \ntheir lives. The more than 9 million students who have participated in \nthe NHD program have gone on to careers in business, law, medicine, \nteaching, and countless other disciplines in which they are putting \ninto practice the thinking and investigative approach fostered through \nthe National History Day program. I want to thank these students for \nrepresenting Minnesota along with only thirteen other States at the \nNational Museum of American History today. The kind of leadership and \nperseverance Lindsay, Melissa, and Kaitie have exhibited will carry the \ntheme of this year's National History Day Contest, ``Revolution, \nReaction, and Reform in History,'' into the next generation.

These three students are three of only 34 \nchosen to present from over 2,000 National History Day finalists. The \nNational History Day contest annually receives more than a half million \nentries.\n  Trevor Bakker, of Holland West Middle School in Holland, MI, won for \nhis project titled ``A Pinch of Salt: Mahatma Gandhi's Nonviolent \nRevolution.'' From Rochester Adams High School in Rochester Hills, MI, \nAllison and Rachel Brown received recognition for their project called \n``Laying It On the Line: The United Automobile Workers' Struggle for \nLabor Reform.'' These projects reflect this year's National History Day \ntheme, ``Revolution, Reaction, Reform in History.''\n  Michigan has played a critical role in revolution and reform in our \ncountry. On December 30, 1936, the newly-formed United Automobile \nWorkers of America revolted against management with a sit-down strike \nin Flint to protest General Motors' decision to shift work to other \nfactories where the union was not as strong. Three months later, the \nstrike ended successfully with an agreement under which General Motors \nrecognized the union as the bargaining agent of the workers, inspiring \nthe growth of countless unions across the country.\n  In addition, Michigan was the home of Sojourner Truth, the great \nreformer for the issues of slavery and women's rights, over the last 20 \nyears of her life. And Michigan's unique ten-cent bottle refunds, \nimplemented in 1978 by the Beverage Container Act, represents a \nsignificant reform for the national issues of recycling and waste \nreduction.\n  These three young historians have poured months of research into this \nendeavor. Along the way they have sharpened their critical thinking and \nresearch skills while becoming bonafide experts on their respective \ntopics. Their time in Washington is sure to be an enriching experience \nas they observe some of the richness of American history up close.\n  I know my Senate colleagues will join me in congratulating Trevor, \nAllison, and Rachel for their tremendous accomplishment, and in hoping \nfor their continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5451-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NEW MEXICO STUDENTS' NATIONAL HISTORY DAY PROJECT\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

The achievement of these young scholars \nhas been recognized through the project's selection as one of the \nprojects that will be displayed at the National Museum of American \nHistory, today, June 12, 2002. Their project was chosen out of more \nthan half a million projects submitted by students across the nation as \nbeing an outstanding work that reflects this year's National History \nDay theme, ``Revolution, Reaction, Reform in History.'' Not only does \nthe work of these students capture the story of an important figure in \nhistory, it also goes beyond the story itself and brilliantly \ninterprets the effects Margaret Sanger had on American society in a \nvery useful way. Their ability to go beyond their research in this way \ndemonstrates the attributes of true scholars. Their work reflects an \nexcellent understanding of historical context, as well as intellectual \nand social setting. These students also demonstrate great intellectual \nmaturity by presenting the historical struggle of Margaret Sanger using \na variety of viewpoints that allow for a better reflection of history. \nIt is a great honor for these students, as well as for the entire state \nof New Mexico, to have their project displayed in the National Museum \nof American History in our nation's capital.

Its \n     work to reduce legal barriers to trade promotes the rule of \n     law, democratic institutions, and enhances political \n     stability and security in the region.\n       Once again, congratulations, and I wish the Center \n     continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5451-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO TWO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I would like to honor two \nstudents from my State of California: Heidi Bowerman and Katie Olson. \nThey have been selected to present their award winning projects at the \nNational Museum of American History on June 12, 2002.\n  The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History is \ncelebrating National History Day by reflecting on this year's theme: \nRevolution, Reaction, Reform in History. The program asks students to \nresearch history topics of their choice related to the year's theme, \nand then create exhibits, performances, documentaries and papers, which \nthey then enter in competitions at the district, State and national \nlevels. Heidi and Katie's projects were two of seventeen projects that \nwere selected out of more than half a million students across America.\n  Katie's exhibit is titled: ``Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.'' Katie attends \nSanta Rose High School in Santa Rosa, CA, and her teachers were Will \nDunn and Whitney Olson.\n  Heidi's performance is titled: ``Aristocracy to Communism: The \nRevolution that Reformed a Nation.'' Heidi attends Alta Sierra \nIntermediate School in Clovis, CA, and her teachers were Carole Smoot \nand Linda Linder.\n  I am so proud to have two accomplished young women representing the \nState of California in receiving this impressive award. Their \nachievements, along with the other student award winners, should serve \nas an inspiration to all students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5451-5", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5451-S5452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING KATHY SHORTT\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Kathy \nShortt, a teacher at Lebanon High School in Lebanon, VA, who is one of \neight finalists for the Richard T. Farrell Teacher of Merit Award for \noutstanding success in teaching history.\n  The Richard T. Farrell Award is presented each year to a teacher who \nemploys innovative teaching methods in and out of the classroom. The \nteacher must participate in the National History Day program, develop \nand use creative teaching methods that interest students in history and \nhelp them\n\n[[Page S5452]]\n\nmake exciting discoveries about the past, and show exemplary commitment \nto helping students develop their interests in history and recognizing \ntheir achievements.\n  Ms. Shortt is being recognized for her dedication to the National \nHistory Day program and her success at improving history education. She \nhas been involved in helping students participate in National History \nDay for 21 years and has presented at numerous workshops and acted as a \nmentor for other teachers for much of her career. She continues to have \nan impact on students even after they have left her classroom.\n  During my term as Governor of Virginia, we recognized that there are \nfundamental academic basics that our children must learn if they are to \nbe capable, responsible, and contributing citizens, and able to compete \nand succeed in the future. To ensure the success of our school \nchildren, we implemented high standards and accountability including \nhistory standards. We believed that Virginia's students should have the \nfundamental knowledge and understanding of their cultural and \nhistorical heritage that serves as a foundation for preserving a free, \nprosperous and decent society.\n  I commend Kathy on her selection for this award and applaud her \ndedication to her students and the improvement of the educational \nprocess. With dedicated teachers like Kathy Shortt, I know the students \nin Virginia and indeed, across America have a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5452-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SARA MOSS\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

A bill to amend section 507 of the Omnibus Parks and Public \nLands Management Act of 1996 to authorize additional appropriations for \nhistorically black colleges and universities, to decrease the cost-\nsharing requirement relating to the additional appropriations, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Miller, \nI am submitting legislation that is designed to facilitate historic \npreservation activities at historically black colleges and \nuniversities. Specifically, this legislation would amend section 507 of \nthe Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 to decrease \nthe cost-sharing requirement for those seeking Federal funds for \nhistoric preservation activities at historically black colleges and \nuniversities. I am proud to say that the legislation I am submitting \ntoday is a companion bill to H.R. 1606, submitted by Congressman James \nClyburn of South Carolina.\n  American history has been a constant, if not always consistent, march \ntoward an ideal. That ideal is equal opportunity for all.\n  In every generation, it's taken the work of pioneers to open the \ngates of the American community to people who had previously been \nexcluded. Pioneers have stepped forward when others would not to \ndefiantly state, in effect, that we as a Nation will not be defined by \nsurface characteristics. We will look deeper and try harder. The \npioneers have held us to our national promise, and reminded us that \nAmerica and Americanism are not about where you came from, what \nlanguage you speak, what religion you practice, or what you look like, \nbut about belief in basic ideals of responsibility, opportunity and \ncommunity.\n  Historically Black Colleges and Universities have been such pioneers \nfor generations, and they continue today to help America become its \nbest self.\n  Today, America has 103 historically black colleges and universities \nin twenty-two States and the Virgin Islands, which educate about \n300,000 undergraduate students and thousands of graduate, professional \nand doctoral students. In fact, 8 of the top 10 producers of African-\nAmerican engineers are HBCUs. 42 percent of all the PhDs earned each \nyear by African-Americans are earned by graduates of HBCUs.\n\n[[Page S5456]]\n\n  Despite playing such a central role in our economy, society, and \nculture, HBCUs have been physically eroding for years. In 1998, the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation reported that most of the \nHBCUs in the United States are showing serious signs of neglect. The \nTrust said that campus landmarks are decaying and college grounds are \nbadly in need of attention. And a 1998 General Accounting Office report \nestimated that in HBCUs nationwide, there were more than 700 historic \nbuildings in states of disrepair.\n  That's why I am proudly sponsoring Representative Clyburn's bill to \nprovide more restoration funding for historic sites at Historically \nBlack Colleges and Universities throughout the Nation.\n  These beautiful, architecturally significant structures are in most \ncases over a hundred years old, and were often built using the help of \nthe students themselves. Their architectural beauty is a sign of \nsomething deeper, the fact that they have served as critical portals of \nopportunity for African-Americans throughout our history. That's why \nthey deserve our strong protection and sensitive preservation.\n  I saw this firsthand. When I visited Allen University in South \nCarolina in April of this year, I went to Arnett Hall, a building that \nhad been transformed from an eyesore into a beautiful and stately \nfacility with the help of Federal funds, thanks to Representative \nClyburn. In the past, students and faculty would walk into the hall and \nget the message that we as a Nation were neglecting these historic \ntreasures.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nreduce the work hours and increase the supervision of resident \nphysicians to ensure the safety of patients and resident physicians \nthemselves; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Patient and Physician Safety and Protection Act of 2002, to limit \nmedical resident work hours to 80 hours a week and to provide real \nprotections for patients and resident physicians who are negatively \naffected by excessive work hours. This is a companion bill to \nlegislation introduced in the House of Representatives by \nRepresentative John Conyers.\n  It is very troubling that hospitals across the Nation are requiring \nyoung doctors to work 36 hour shifts and as many as 120 hours a week in \norder to complete their residency programs. These long hours lead to a \ndeterioration of cognitive function similar to the effects of blood \nalcohol levels of 0.1 percent. This is a level of cognitive impairment \nthat would make these doctors unsafe to drive, yet these physicians are \nnot only allowed but in fact are required to care for patients and \nperform procedures on patients under these conditions.\n  While the medical community has been aware of this problem for many \nyears, the issue has largely been pushed under the rug. Only recently \nhas the medical community taken a more serious look at the problem. In \nthe last couple of months, my office has worked with the Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges and teaching hospitals in New Jersey and New \nYork to address this problem and to try to find a workable solution.\n  As a result of these efforts and increased public pressure on the \nmedical community to address this quality of care and labor issue, the \nAccreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, ACGME, announced \ntoday new work hour recommendations. This is an important first step. \nBut while some of their recommendations are commendable, they would \nstill require residents to work in excess of 80 hours a week and 30-\nhour shifts. I look forward to working with the Council to adapt strong \nstandards that are not only recommendations, but are enforceable \nrequirements that truly protect patients and residents.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that not only recognizes the \nproblem of excessive work hours, but also creates strong enforcement \nmechanisms. The bill also provides funding support to teaching \nhospitals to implement new work hour standards. Without enforcement and \nfinancial support, efforts to reduce work hours are not likely to be \nsuccessful.\n  Let me again emphasize that the Patient and Physician Safety and \nProtection Act of 2002 will limit medical resident work hours to 80 \nhours a week. Not 40 hours or 60 hours. 80 hours a week. It is hard to \nargue that this standard is excessively strict. In fact, it is \nunconscionable that we now have resident physicians, or any physicians \nfor that matter, caring for very sick patients 120 hours a week and 36 \nhours straight with fewer than 10 hours between shifts. This is an \noutrageous violation of a patient's right to quality care. And, for \nmany patients, it is literally a matter of life and death.\n  In addition to limiting work hours to 80 hours week, my bill limits \nthe length of any one shift to 24 consecutive hours and limits the \nlength of an emergency room shift to 12 hours. The bill also ensures \nthat residents have at least one out of seven days off and ``on-call'' \nshifts no more often than every third night.\n  Finally, my legislation provides meaningful enforcement mechanisms \nthat will protect the identity of resident physicians who file \ncomplaints about work hour violations. The guidelines that the ACGME \nreleased today do not contain any whistleblower protections for \nresidents that seek to report program violations. Without this \nimportant protection, residents will be reluctant to report these \nviolations, which in turn will weaken enforcement.\n  My legislation also makes compliance with these work hour \nrequirements a condition of Medicare participation. Each year, Congress \nprovides $8 billion to teaching hospitals to train new physicians. \nWhile Congress must continue to vigorously support adequate funding so \nthat teaching hospitals are able to carryout this important public \nservice, these hospitals must also make a commitment to ensuring safe \nwork conditions for these physicians and providing the highest quality \nof care to the patients they treat.\n  In closing I would like to read a quote from an Orthopedic Surgery\n\n[[Page S5457]]\n\nResident from Northern California, which I think illustrates why we \nneed this legislation:\n\n       I was operating post-call after being up for over 36 hours \n     and was holding retractors. I literally fell asleep standing \n     up and nearly face-planted into the wound. My upper arm hit \n     the side of the gurney, and I caught myself before I fell to \n     the floor. I nearly put my face in the open wound, which \n     would have contaminated the entire field and could have \n     resulted in an infection for the patient.\n\n  This is a very serious problem that must be addressed before medical \nerrors like this occur. I hope every member of the Senate will consider \nthis legislation and the potential it has to reduce medical errors, \nimprove patient care, and create a safer working environment for the \nbackbone of our Nation's healthcare system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2614\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for improvements in access to services in rural hospitals and \ncritical access hospitals; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S5458]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nis designed to strengthen and improve the health care delivered to \nrural Medicare beneficiaries. The ``Rural Community Hospital Assistance \nAct of 2002'' ensures that our Nation's seniors will be able to receive \nthe same quality of inpatient care throughout the country, regardless \nof whether they live in New York City or Petersburg, AK.\n  The best insurance in the world is worthless if there is not a \nprovider or facility nearby to deliver quality health care. Right now, \nin communities across the country, many Medicare beneficiaries are \nunderserved because they have no access to care. This is wrong and \nintolerable. I remain committed to ensuring that all Americans, and \nespecially those in currently underserved rural communities, received \nthe care they deserve.\n  Unfortunately, a number of the problems facing rural health care \narise from the actions and construct of the federal Medicare system. \nIts historical one-size-fits-all approach to health care delivery and \nreimbursement has led to small community facilities that lack the \nability to make payroll, expand services, add new technologies, and \nguarantee comparable care to more urban providers.\n  In recent years, Congress has moved to even the playing field between \nurban and rural medicine. New classifications, such as Critical Access \nHospitals, have allowed these truly safety-net facilities to remain in \noperation and serve their community. But more work must be done.\n  In 1994, a new payment system for hospital inpatient services was \ncreated to bring efficiency and cost savings into the Medicare program. \nThe new prospective payment system paid hospitals a fixed amount before \nservices were provided, and severed the historical link between \nreimbursement and reasonable costs. In 2000, hospital outpatient \nservices were added to this payment system.\n  But what has this system meant for the small rural hospital that has \nonly a handful of beds and cares for a small number of patients? Quite \nsimply, lower volumes hurt the ability of rural hospitals to handle a \nprospective payment system. They have limited financial reserves, lack \navailable funds to make capital improvements and, especially in the \ncase of Alaska, have difficulty dealing with volume fluctuations that \nare often times tied to seasonal travel.\n  The ``Rural Community Hospital Assistance Act'' seeks to remedy this \nproblem and a few others that are facing rural America. This \nlegislation would proved enhanced cost-based reimbursement for critical \naccess hospitals. Cost-based reimbursement for inpatient and outpatient \nservices would include a ``return on equity'' to assist the small \nfacilities in addressing technology and infrastructure needs. It would \nalso provide an option for rural hospitals with less than 50 inpatient \nbeds to receive enhanced cost-based reimbursement for inpatient, \noutpatient, and select post-acute care services.\n  Hospitals are resorting to Critical Access status for financial \nreasons. Rural hospitals are facing a financial crisis. In fact, rural \nfacilities have a Medicare inpatient margin that is almost 10 \npercentage points lower than urban hospitals. And with these financial \nconstraints, they have often been forced to pass on facility upgrades \nand acquiring new technologies. Who suffers? The seniors who can't \nreceive the same state-of-the-art care simply because they aren't \nfortunate to live in a urban zip code.\n  This legislation is vital to the state of Alaska. Hospitals such as \nPetersburg Medical Center, Sitka Community, Valdez Community, Seward \nMedical Center, and Wrangell Medical Center will be able to modernize \nand expand services to their growing elderly population. Access and \nquality will increase. Seniors will reap the benefits.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that many Alaskan hospitals are \nnot on a road system. They are true safety-net facilities. If they are \nnot there, a need will go unmet.\n  We must work together to strengthen Medicare. I encourage my \ncolleagues to reflect upon the burdens placed upon rural hospitals and \nto consider this worthy bill. It is an incremental step towards \nleveling the playing field between rural and urban medicine. I urge my \ncolleagues to act swiftly upon this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the ``Rural Community \nHospital Assistance Act of 2002'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2615\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague, \nthe Senator from Alaska, to introduce the Rural Community Hospital \nAssistance Act. Senator Murkowski and I don't agree on a lot of issues. \nBut one thing we both care very deeply about is the health of this \nNation's rural hospitals. Rural hospitals provide essential care for \nmore than 54 million people. They provide essential inpatient, \noutpatient and post-acute care, including skilled nursing, home health \nand rehabilitation services. Minnesota has more rural hospitals than \nany other state in the United States with the exception of Texas. The \nhospitals of rural America are the heart of our health care system. In \nrural America, how far away you are from your community hospital can be \na matter of life and death.\n  But the health of our rural hospitals in 2002 is not good. Many are \nstruggling to survive. Rural hospitals have Medicare inpatient margins \nthat are 10 percent less than urban hospitals. Rural hospital total \nMedicare margins have declined significantly, falling to an average of \nnegative 3.2 percent since 1999, and even lower margins, negative 5.4 \npercent, for rural hospitals with 50 or fewer beds. Rural hospital \ncosts are increasing at a greater rate than urban hospitals. They can't \nsurvive on the Medicare prospective payment system that we've set up \nfor them. That payment system provides a fixed hospital payment \nestablished in advance of the provisions of services, rather than \nproviding reimbursement retroactively on the basis of costs. The \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) told the Congress last \nJune that the Prospective Payment System is not working for small rural \nhospitals. We set up that system to contain costs and save money. But \nwe can't have the kind of healthcare system that the people who live in \nthe small towns and on the farms of America deserve, if we try to \nfinance it on the cheap. This is about values. This is about \npriorities. This is about giving people who work hard all their lives \nthe healthcare they deserve.\n  I voted against the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 because I was worried \nthat it would lead to significant harm for our healthcare system. I was \nworried that it would hurt healthcare in our rural areas, in our \ncities, and that it would damage our healthcare safety net. \nUnfortunately, I was right and we have seen exactly the kind of \nproblems I warned about. But one good thing we included was the \nMedicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Act which set up ``Critical Access \nHospitals.'' The Critical Access Hospital (CAH) program provides cost \nbased Medicare reimbursement for qualifying rural hospitals with 15 of \nfewer inpatient beds. Small rural hospitals face unique circumstances \nthat require special consideration when developing Medicare payment \npolicies. Because of their small size, a median of 58 beds compared to \n186 beds for urban hospitals, rural hospitals have a much more \ndifficult time surviving within a prospective payment system. Rural \nhospitals have fewer financial reserves and greater volume fluctuations \nthan urban hospitals. They rely on Medicare as a source of revenue more \nthan other hospitals. They have to deal with isolation, high levels of \npoverty, and shortages of critical health care professionals, making it \nmuch more difficult for small rural hospitals to absorb the impact of \npolicy and market changes.\n  The Critical Access Hospital Program has done a good job. There are \n43 Critical Access Hospitals in Minnesota. But this program needs to be \nupdated and it needs to be extended and enhanced if we are going to \nrestore our rural hospitals to financial health. The Rural Community \nHospital Assistance Act will provide enhanced cost based reimbursement \nfor Critical Access Hospitals, and extend such reimbursement to post \nacute care services. It will permit and extend enhanced reimbursement \nfore geriatric psychiatric care. It will provide enhanced cost based \nreimbursement for ambulance services. It would also provide an option \nfor rural hospitals with less than 50 acute care beds to receive cost \nbased reimbursement for inpatient, outpatient, and ambulance services. \nThis is very important because so many rural hospitals with less than \n50 beds are struggling just to survive. It is essential that the doors \nof our rural hospitals remain open. I ask my colleagues to join Senator \nMurkowski and me in supporting this important legislation for rural \nAmerica.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 2616. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \nan Office of Men's Health; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this week in the United States we are \ncommemorating Men's Health Week. The National Men's Health Week Act was \npassed by Congress and signed into law in 1994. Since then Men's Health \nWeek has been celebrated each year as the week leading up to and \nincluding Father's Day. I was proud to be a cosponsor of that Act. \nToday, I rise to introduce the Men's Health Act of 2002, to establish \nan Office of Men's Health within the Department of Health and Human \nServices to promote men's health in America.\n  In this Nation, there is an ongoing, increasing, and predominantly \nsilent crisis in the health and well-being of men. Due to a lack of \nawareness, poor health education, and culturally-induced behavior \npatterns, the state of men's health and well-being is deteriorating \nsteadily. Heart disease, stroke, and various cancers, including \nprostate and testicular cancer, continue to be\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\nmajor areas of concern. We must address these issues with diligent \neducational efforts, prevention and treatment as we seek to enhance the \nquality and duration of men's lives. Improved distribution of \ninformation concerning the health challenges men face and the \nutilization of the appropriate preventive measures are imperative to \naddressing this need.\n  As a lifelong advocate of regular medical exams, daily exercise, and \na balanced diet, I feel strongly that an Office of Men's Health should \nbe established to help improve the overall health of America's male \npopulation. The bill I am introducing is similar to a bill introduced \nin the House of Representatives. I invite my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important measure. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2616\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Men's Health Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A silent health crisis is affecting the health and \n     well-being of America's men.\n       (2) While this health crisis is of particular concern to \n     men, it is also a concern for women regarding their fathers, \n     husbands, sons, and brothers.\n       (3) Men's health is a concern for employers who pay the \n     costs of medical care, and lose productive employees.\n       (4) Men's health is a concern to Federal and State \n     governments which absorb the enormous costs of premature \n     death and disability, including the costs of caring for \n     dependents left behind.\n       (5) The life expectancy gap between men and women has \n     increased from one year in 1920 to almost six years in 1998.\n       (6) Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer \n     in the United States among men, accounting for 36 percent of \n     all cancer cases.\n       (7) An estimated 180,000 men will be newly diagnosed with \n     prostate cancer this year alone, and 37,000 will die.\n       (8) The American Heart Association reports that heart \n     attack is the single biggest killer of American males. Men \n     are more likely to die of stroke and are almost twice as \n     likely to die of heart disease than are women. High blood \n     pressure increases the risk for stroke and heart attack and \n     men under age 55 are much more likely to suffer from high \n     blood pressure than are women.\n       (9) An estimated 7,600 men will be diagnosed this year with \n     testicular cancer, and 400 of these men will die of this \n     disease in 2002. A common reason for delay in treatment of \n     this disease is a delay in seeking medical attention after \n     discovering a testicular mass.\n       (10) Studies show that men are at least 25 percent less \n     likely than women to visit a doctor, and are significantly \n     less likely to have regular physician check-ups and obtain \n     preventive screening tests for serious diseases.\n       (11) Appropriate use of tests such as prostate specific \n     antigen (PSA) exams and blood pressure, blood sugar, and \n     cholesterol screens, in conjunction with clinical exams and \n     self-testing, can result in the early detection of many \n     problems and in increased survival rates.\n       (12) Educating men, their families, and health care \n     providers about the importance of early detection of male \n     health problems can result in reducing rates of mortality for \n     male-specific diseases, as well as improve the health of \n     America's men and its overall economic well-being.\n       (13) Recent scientific studies have shown that regular \n     medical exams, preventive screenings, regular exercise, and \n     healthy eating habits can help save lives.\n       (14) Establishing an Office of Men's Health is needed to \n     investigate these findings and take such further actions as \n     may be needed to promote men's health.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE OF MEN'S HEALTH.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title XVII of the Public Health Service \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 300u et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n\n\n                        ``office of men's health\n\n       ``Sec. 1711.

The Secretary, acting \n     through the Director of the Office, shall coordinate and \n     promote the status of men's health in the United States.''.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than two years after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, acting through the Director of the Office of Men's \n     Health (established under section 1711 of the Public Health \n     Service Act as added by subsection (a)), shall submit to \n     Congress a report describing the activities of such Office, \n     including findings that the Director has made regarding men's \n     health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5461-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5461-S5462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 283--RECOGNIZING THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF \n            DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS IN THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. McCain, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \nMiller, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Warner, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Cochran, \nMr. Helms, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Reid, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Lugar, \nMr. Brownback, Mr. Allen, and Mr. Sessions) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise, along with 21 of my colleagues, to \nsubmit a resolution commending the country and the people of Colombia \non continuing the tradition of democracy, with a plurality freely and \nfairly voting for President-elect Alvaro Uribe Velez and Vice \nPresident-elect Francisco Santos Calderon on May 26, 2002.\n  In Colombia, the evil hand of terror and suffering and fear and death \nhas been an everyday reality for too long. In 2000, over 44 percent of \nthe worldwide incidents of terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens and \nUnited States interests were in the country of Colombia. These attacks \npose a threat to Colombia, the stability of Latin America, the security \nof the Western Hemisphere, and the direct and indirect security of many \nUnited States citizens, businesses, and interests.\n  Yet, despite the constant threat and reality of violence in Colombia, \nthe\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\ncitizens and government of Colombia carried out democratic elections, \ndeemed by international standards to be free, fair and the express will \nof the Colombian people. As Latin America's oldest democracy, the \nlegacy of leaders elected by the people continues.\n  We desire to work closely with both President-elect Uribe and Vice \nPresident-elect Santos to reach our common goals of continued \ndemocracy, stability, peace, and the elimination of drugs, terrorism \nand corruption from our countries and our hemisphere.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution and the \ngreat democracy of Colombia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/12/senate-section/article/S5462-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3832.
