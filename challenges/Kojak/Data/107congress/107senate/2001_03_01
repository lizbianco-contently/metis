Mr. President, let me take a few moments this morning \nto discuss the merits of the energy bill which was introduced earlier \nthis week by a number of our colleagues. It is a bipartisan \nintroduction by myself, Senator Breaux, Senator Lott, and a number of \nother Senators who are on the bill.\n  I think it is appropriate to kind of focus in on reality. We have an \nenergy crisis in this country. It has been developing for a long time. \nIt does not solve anything to point fingers at where the responsibility \nis. The bottom line is how to address it, how to resolve it, and how to \nget this country moving again. We are looking at the stock market, \nshaking our heads. We are listening to Alan Greenspan. The predictions \nfor the economy are gloomy, and one of the causes, a significant cause, \nobviously, is the price of energy.\n  The price of energy has hit everyone in this body. If you live in \nWashington, DC, and you use gas, you know your gas bills have doubled. \nThat means you have had to take a greater percentage of your disposable \nincome to pay your gas bill. I will not go into gasoline prices which \nhave escalated over an extended period of time. But the American public \nand Members of this body have an opportunity, and I think have an \nobligation, to come up with some positive solutions.\n  We would like to think that energy is bipartisan. We all have the \nsame responsibility. We have different views on how to achieve a \nbalance. But I think there is a basic philosophical opportunity for \nsome self-examination because some folks suggest we can simply conserve \nour way out of this crisis. Factually, we cannot conserve our way out \nof this crisis. It is understandable as we reflect on where we have \ncome in the last 10 years. We are dependent on computers, air-\nconditioning. With a larger more affluent population, it simply uses \nmore energy.\n  We can be more energy efficient, but the reality is, as the CSIS \nstudy showed, we are going to be dependent on fossil fuels for the next \ntwo decades at an increasing percentage--somewhere from 86 to close to \n90 percent. We forget we are not the whole world. We kind of look at \nourselves and say, well, we set the pattern. But given the growth of \nThird World countries such as China, their consumption of energy \nsuggests that, as we look at the future, there is going to be more \npressure on conventional hydrocarbons. We have to look to alternatives. \nWe have to examine ways not to throw the baby out with the bath water, \nwhich is what some have suggested in criticism of this bill.\n\n  We have to recognize that for a long time we are going to be \ndependent on our conventional sources of energy, even though we have an \nabundance of coal and we have the technology to clean up our coal. \nStill, as we look for power generation relief, we don't look to coal \nanymore. There are a number of reasons for it. Obviously some coal has \nproblems. It has problems associated with Btu's; it has problems \nassociated with ash; it has problems associated with the chemical \nmakeup of the coal that requires removal of impurities. But the \ntechnology is there although the cost increases. We work in this \ncompetitive area on the cost of energy per Btu.\n  Sulfur in coal can be removed. We can have scrubbers on our stacks. \nBut we have to have a plan and an encouragement and in some cases \nassistance in developing this technology. We have this in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, 20 percent of our power--and I know my friend from \nNevada occasionally rises to the occasion concerning nuclear power--20 \npercent of the power in this country is generated by nuclear energy. \nYet we have not built a new plant in almost 20 years. You cannot build \na plant. It is not economic. We cannot address what to do with the \nnuclear waste. I am not here to promote nuclear energy, solely. I am \nsimply saying nuclear energy has a place in the mix of our energy \nproduction, just as coal does.\n  We have tremendous capacity and capability for hydro, particularly in \nthe Pacific Northwest, but the prospects for building new hydro plants \nare very remote. We are talking about taking dams down, but we don't \nhonestly evaluate what the tradeoff is. If we take down dams on the \nColumbia River, what is the result? We will lose the capability of \nbarge traffic moving huge tonnages on that river. What will we do with \nthem? We will put them on the highway; that is the tradeoff--oil.\n  Obviously, we are becoming more dependent on imported oil, 56 percent \ndependent. At what point do we sacrifice our national security effort \nby becoming increasingly dependent, and at what percentage does that \noccur? It is pretty hard to say. We are 56 percent dependent now. We \nwere 37 percent in 1973 when we had the Arab oil embargo. The \nDepartment of Energy says it is going to be somewhere in the area of 63 \nor 64 or 65 percent.\n  I was asked that question the other day by a reporter: You talk about \nour dependence. We have become used to it. At what point do we really \ncompromise our national security?\n  I thought for a moment. I said that in 1991-1992 we fought a war. We \nlost 147 lives. Is that sufficient? I think it is.\n  As we look to the future, we are going to continue to have a problem \nunless we relieve our dependence on imported energy sources, and \nparticularly oil.\n  How do we do that? We do it through a combination of ways, developing \nother known sources of energy, such as I outlined, and opening up new \nsources of domestic energy.\n  One of the interesting things about this bill is it focuses. It is \n300 pages, but it focuses like a lightning rod on one issue: opening \nANWR. Do we do it safely? Can we do it safely? Do we have the \ntechnology? Clearly we do. There is absolutely no question about that.\n  On the other hand, America's environmental community has rallied to \nthe cause to save ANWR, saying that we cannot do it safely. Somebody is \nwrong. But I can tell you what it has done. It has given the \nenvironmental community a cause. They need a national cause where \npeople cannot evaluate the issue for themselves because they will not \ngo up there. It increases membership and dollars.\n\n  Look at some of the colleges in the East: Save ANWR. There is no \nquestion of technology capability.\n  What we are facing here is very little focus on the energy bill in \nitself but great rhetoric. For example, the Sierra Club--may I ask what \nthe time agreement is?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator had until 10:15. It is \nnow 10:15, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add 10 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. That being the case, I ask everyone's time be advanced \naccordingly so no one loses any time because under the time agreement \neveryone has allocated time by the minute. I ask as part of that that \neveryone be advanced 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska has an \nadditional 10 minutes, and all other Senators' times will be moved back \n10 minutes from that previously agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada.\n  Let me spend a few minutes countering the allegations against this \nlegislation. The Sierra Club came out with a report saying the bill was \na giveaway for fossil fuel producers.\n  There is absolutely no incentive in this legislation for big oil. We \nfocus on maintaining a viable domestic industry, reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil, and ensuring our national security. The \nSierra Club release also calls for increased efficiency, renewable \nenergy, and more efficient, less-polluting powerplants. I wonder if \nthey have read the bill. We provided incentives for alternatives: \nfuels, renewable\n\n[[Page S1725]]\n\nenergy production, energy efficiency, just as they and we advocate.\n  Did they also ignore our new R program in the bill, and the \nincentives to use clean coal technology in existing and new \npowerplants? I doubt if they have read the bill.\n  The Sierra Club focuses on the need to improve fuel economy for cars, \nSUVs, and light trucks, and we agree. That is why our bill requires a \n3-mile-per-gallon improvement in the fuel economy of Federal fleets by \nthe year 2005. Why did we start with Federal fleets? We ought to start \nwith Government. That is where it belongs. Government should show the \nway. So we provided new incentives for the purchase of hybrid vehicles \nthat give double, even triple the gas mileage of today's cars. But they \nmust not have seen this because the Sierra Club just doesn't appreciate \nthe reality, that this is just not a bill that has one little portion \ncovering ANWR.\n  Regarding the provisions of the bill, I think, for the most part, if \nthe Sierra Club would sit down and read it, they would agree with it.\n  We have another group, the League of Conservation Voters, who, in a \npress release, have some polling data showing the public is against \nopening up the Arctic in Alaska. They say 66 percent of American voters \nsupport permanently closing ANWR to oil and gas exploration.\n  Isn't it funny what polls say. The Christian Science Monitor poll and \nthe Chicago Tribune poll say otherwise. The Christian Science Monitor; \n54 percent support opening the area; the Chicago Tribune; 52 percent \nsupport opening the area. Three out of four support increased oil and \ngas exploration in our country.\n  The League of Conservation Voters goes on to state:\n\n       America needs a sensible energy policy that places serious \n     emphasis on energy conservation and alternative fuels. . .\n\n  Title VI of our bill focuses on energy efficiency, conservation, and \nassistance to low-income families. Title VII of the bill focuses on \nalternative fuels and renewable energy.\n  Our tax provisions have several new incentives for energy-efficient \nhomes, appliances, vehicles, and for renewables.\n  As I indicated in my opening remarks, the Center for Strategic \nInternational Studies says, unfortunately, that we will remain \ndependent on fossil fuels for the near future. Shouldn't we direct our \nefforts towards developing technology to use these fuels more cleanly \nand more efficiently? We simply can't ignore our reliance on foreign \noil. As I indicated, it is expected to reach 70 percent by the year \n2002. We cannot ignore our coal at 52 percent of our electricity. We \ncan't ignore nuclear, which is 20 percent of our electricity.\n  Instead of a comprehensive approach, some environmental groups want a \nnational energy policy that requires massive shifts in our energy \nindustry. Elimination of fossil fuels entirely, thousands of jobs lost, \nhigher energy prices, and standard investment are not in their \nequation.\n  Our approach to an energy policy--the National Energy Security Act of \n2001--we think is the right approach. It is comprehensive. It is \nbalanced.\n  Obviously, in the hearing process we had input from all Members, and \nthe administration is yet to be heard. But we are trying to use the \nphilosophy of using the fuels of today to yield the technologies of \ntomorrow and ensuring clean, secure, and affordable energy in the \nfuture. I think this bill attempts to do that.\n  Let me leave you with one additional thought. We hear from many of \nthe opponents of ANWR that all we have to do is get an extra 3 miles \nper gallon out of our cars and we will get the same amount of oil as \ndrilling and opening up that area in our State. I question that claim. \nThe real issue is do you think everyone in America should trade in \ntheir cars and buy new vehicles. And there are about 132 million cars \nin America. That doesn't count the trucks and the buses. But if the \nAmericans have to go all out and buy new and efficient cars as \npseudoenvironmentalists want them to do, it will cost more than $2.6 \ntrillion. Since most Americans don't have $20,000 sitting around just \nwaiting to go buy a new car, they are going to have to finance that \ncar. That will probably raise the cost to more than $3 trillion. That \nseems to be their answer to Americans--get a new car and spend $3 \ntrillion. That isn't going to happen either.\n  I think everyone has a responsibility to make some positive \ncontributions to this legislation and recognize what is happening to \nour economy as a consequence of the scarcity of energy associated with \nthe higher prices and the fact that energy is, indeed, taking a larger \nshare out of everyone's budget and, as a consequence, affecting \ndramatically our economy.\n  Let's get serious, and let's do something meaningful about this.\n  I thank my colleague for the additional time. I appreciate the \ncourtesy, and at any time I will certainly respond.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, as \namended by the Senator from Nevada, the Senator from Nevada, Mr. \nEnsign, has control of the time until 10:40 a.m.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for 5 minutes following the statement of Senator Ensign.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/01/senate-section/article/S1725-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1725-S1727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LET NO NEVADA CHILD BE LEFT BEHIND\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, Nevada's slogan is ``Battle Born.'' And \nNevadans are proud to use that slogan. It is on our State flag. It \nreflects the firmness of purpose and the willingness to fight for what \nis right that is so much a part of the character of Nevadans. This is \nas true today as it was when our State entered the Union during the \nCivil War.\n  I am humbled to stand here in this Chamber where many distinguished \nNevadans have preceded me, giants like Pat McCarran, Alan Bible, Howard \nCannon, Paul Laxalt, and the man I succeeded, Dick Bryan. None of them \nforgot the unique culture of the West and their Nevada roots. The \nnature of the challenges may have changed over the years, but not the \nnature of the Nevadans fighting to overcome them.\n  In this era of globalization we are condemning our children, and our \nnation, to an uncertain future if we fail to confront a very different \nkind of threat--the intractable problems in our public schools.\n  Let me share some troubling statistics with you. If you compare our \nchildren to their counterparts in other nations, the most academically \nadvanced American high school seniors ranked 15 out of 16--second from \nthe bottom--on an advanced math test and 16 out of 16 on an advanced \nphysics test. This is unacceptable.\n  Our public schools are failing our children. And unless we address \nthis problem now--today--we will bear the consequences for a generation \nor more. Let's not forget: Today's students are tomorrow's leaders--in \nbusiness, technology, engineering, government and every other field. If \neven the brightest of our young people cannot compete in the classroom \nwith their colleagues abroad in math and science, how will they be able \nto compete with them as adults in the world of business? How can we \nexpect them to develop into the innovators America needs to maintain--\nand, yes, expand--her dominant role in the global marketplace?\n  We need to make sure every single student in America graduates with \nthe basic skills in communications, math, and information technology \nthat are necessary to excel in the New Economy. As a nation, we simply \ncannot afford to accept the status quo.\n  As a fourth generation Nevadan, I know the people of my State are up \nto the challenge of creating a better education system. But they need \nthe Federal Government to get out of their way so they can do it. We \nneed a results-based system, which gives States greater flexibility to \nspend Federal education dollars, while holding them accountable for \nstudent achievement.\n  Today, Federal funds for States and local school districts are not \nlinked to whether academic progress has been attained. The Department \nof Education simply doles out money in keeping with Washington-designed \nfunding formulas and grant proposals. There is no\n\n[[Page S1726]]\n\nincentive for innovation, and no penalty for failure.\n  President Bush wants to change this. He has proposed requiring \nfederally funded annual reading and math testing in grades 3-8 to \nensure student achievement and hold States accountable for the Federal \nmoney they receive. The test results will be the ruler by which the \nDepartment of Education can measure whether students are improving. \nThese results will also provide parents with the information they need \nto track the progress of not only their own children, but of the \nschools their children attend.\n  The question we are all struggling with is what to do if and when \nthis new system reveals that a particular school is failing to \nsuccessfully educate our children. Under President Bush's plan, if a \nschool is shown to be failing after three years (based on objective \nmeasures of student achievement), then a voucher will be given to \nparents whose children attend that failing school. The parents will \nthen have the power to say to school officials: Shape up--or my kids \nare shipping out.\n  Now, I am certainly open to real alternatives to vouchers that are \nnot driven by the anti-choice agenda of entrenched interests. However, \nI am not willing to sacrifice the well-being of individuals--our \nchildren--in order to preserve failing institutions. In my opinion, \nvouchers are an important part of the solution.\n  But to those who oppose them, let me challenge you--parents, \nteachers, administrators, alike--to come up with a better system that \naccomplishes just two things: First, it holds schools accountable for \nfailing our children; and second, it actually helps the students. \nTogether, we must find a way to save our children from being condemned \nto a virtual prison of poor literacy and numeracy which constrains \ntheir ability to succeed.\n  That means exploring all the options--from vouchers to charter \nschools--that can help level the playing field for our disadvantaged \nyoung people. For example, a new charter school will be opening in Las \nVegas this fall--the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy--which \nwill be committed to providing students access to technology on a daily \nbasis.\n  The principal, Mr. Wayne Tanaka, left Clark High School, my alma \nmater, to help found this revolutionary new academy. He did it because \nhe believed this focus would provide underprivileged students with a \nchance to excel in the classroom. And if they excel in the classroom, \nthen ultimately they will have the tools to excel in the 21st century.\n  While I am pleased President Bush has proposed an 11-percent increase \nin funding for Federal education programs, I am concerned Nevada \nstudents will not be receiving their fair share of that increase. \nCurrently, Nevadans get back only 41 cents for every dollar they send \nback to Washington, DC, for the education of their children. For years, \nthis return has lagged behind nearly every State in the Union. It is \njust not right.\n  The majority of Federal education dollars are allocated through Title \nI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Under Title I, \nNevadans received a little over $600 per eligible student in the year \n1999. Let's compare that to over $1,300 per student in Vermont.\n  I ask my colleagues, is this fair? Is a disadvantaged student in \nVermont that much more worthy of additional funds than a disadvantaged \nstudent in Nevada? Does this promote the idea of equal access to \neducation?\n  The theme of President Bush's education plan is ``no child left \nbehind.'' But under the current system children are getting left behind \nin fast growing States such as Nevada, and the President's plan does \nnot adequately address this problem.\n  Nevada has grown by 66 percent over the last 10 years and shows no \nsigns of slowing down. Under Title I, funding is based on the number of \nTitle I students in each State, but the Department of Education updates \nthese numbers only once every 4 years. And for Nevada, which has grown \nan average of 5 percent per year for the last 10 years, this has \ncreated an untenable situation.\n  Nevada school enrollment is increasing at three times the national \naverage, and Federal funds are not keeping pace. In Clark County, which \nis where Las Vegas is, we are forced to build one new elementary school \na month just to keep pace with the explosive growth. It is for that \nreason I am speaking with the White House and a number of my colleagues \nabout a new high-growth grant, which I hope to include in the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. This grant will benefit all \nStates with high growth rates, such as Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, \nFlorida, North Carolina, and other States, so that we can give real \nmeaning to the phrase ``no child left behind.''\n  Mr. President, I need my colleagues to understand what the students, \nparents, teachers, and administrators are faced with in my home State \nof Nevada. Every time I speak with them, I hear, time and time again, \nthat our State needs more of these Title I dollars. The high growth \ngrant is a means to provide high-growth States much needed relief \nwithout directly adjusting the current funding formula.\n  Ensuring that our children stay in school is one of my top \npriorities. I want to work with my colleagues on dropout prevention, \nparticularly with the senior Senator from Nevada, who has been a leader \non this issue. But what good does it do to keep young people in the \nclassroom if they are not being taught the basics of civic virtue, such \nas citizenship, justice, fairness, respect, responsibility, and \ntrustworthiness?\n  In addition to dropout prevention programs, we must also promote \ncharacter education programs that train our young people to be virtuous \ncitizens.\n\n  Our Nation's teachers are the key to solving many of our problems in \nour schools. And how can we require this of our teachers without the \nproper training or adequate pay?\n  I am encouraged that President Bush's education plan includes a new \ncommitment to professional development for teachers. This is critical \nto ensuring that our teachers are properly trained to teach our \nNation's children.\n  With all the talk about school construction and whether or not the \nFederal Government should or should not play a role in that activity, \nshouldn't we first ensure that our teachers are properly trained in the \nsubjects they teach? Our math and science teachers need better training \nin math and science. Our reading and writing teachers need better \ntraining in reading and writing. It is that simple. We cannot expect \nour teachers to succeed in imparting knowledge to our children if our \nteachers are not properly trained in the areas they teach.\n  Teachers and administrators must be permitted to take the necessary \nsteps to restore order in the classrooms. The Federal Government can \nwork with State and local school districts to ensure that teachers have \nthe freedom to discipline violent and disruptive students without the \nfear of lawsuits.\n  Our young people have a fundamental right to classrooms where they \nare free to learn and teachers are free to teach. That is denied them \nwhen a few chronically difficult children are allowed to poison the \natmosphere, and teachers are left with no resources to stop them.\n  We also need to end the cycle of social promotion. Social promotion \nforces teachers to deal with underprepared students while they try to \nteach the prepared. It gives parents a false sense of progress and \nleads employers to conclude that diplomas are literally meaningless. \nBut above all, the practice of social promotion dumps poorly educated \ngraduates into a society where they cannot perform in the workplace, \nnor care for their families, nor discharge their duties as citizens. It \nis not fair to those individuals who have been at the mercy of a flawed \nsystem, and it is not fair to their dependents and our society as a \nwhole.\n  I have been witness to the perils of social promotion. One of the \nheartbreaking experiences of my life was when I was sitting in a local \nlibrary with a fourth grader who could not read Dr. Seuss's ``Cat in \nthe Hat.'' This young boy, when he was 10 years old, could not read \nthese lines:\n\n       The sun did not shine. It was too wet to play. So we sat in \n     the house all that cold, cold, wet day.\n\n  This child is one of the lucky ones. His problem was caught \nrelatively early. He has since received help with basic reading and \nother academic and social skills, skills that he should have learned in \nthe first, second, and third\n\n[[Page S1727]]\n\ngrades. He is 13 now, and he is doing better. He has worked hard and \nmade progress. But despite his efforts, he is still struggling to catch \nup with his classmates because habits of social promotion shuffled him \nforward in a system before he was ready.\n  If we expect our students to be able to compete in the global \nworkforce, then we must provide them with the proper learning tools. \nPart of that answer lies in providing technology and the means to use \nit. Another part lies in better teacher training and higher teacher \npay. Another part lies in holding failing schools accountable, and \ngiving parents greater control over where and how education dollars are \nspent. And another part lies in more equitable funding. Together these \nindividual answers create a solution.\n\n  The 107th Congress has a unique opportunity to fundamentally change \nthe Federal Government's role in education. I am not satisfied with the \nstatus quo, and neither are Nevada parents. After 36 years, the system \nis ripe for change. On behalf of Nevada families, I intend to press for \nthat change.\n  I know that Nevadans have a fighting spirit to make our schools the \nbest in the country--a fighting spirit that has been passed on, \nstarting with our settlers, from one generation to the next. Our \nbattle-born State was formed by facing up to difficult challenges, and \nwe are up for the challenge of making sure that when it comes to \neducation, no child is left behind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Under the previous order, the senior Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/01/senate-section/article/S1727-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1727-S1728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING SENATOR ENSIGN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for more than 30 years, Senator Richard \nBryan and I served together in various public offices. We took the bar \ntogether. We became inseparable friends. We were known in Nevada--and \nare still known--as the ``Gold Dust Twins.'' So when Senator Bryan \ndecided to retire, it was a tremendous personal blow to me. I really \nmiss Richard.\n  But in life you move on. I feel so fortunate to be able to serve with \nJohn Ensign. John and I have known each other for a long time. His \nfamily, prior to 1998, were some of my biggest supporters. In 1998, of \ncourse, we ran against each other. It was an extremely close race, one \nof the closest races in the history of the State of Nevada, and, of \ncourse, in the history of the country.\n  It is easy to be gracious when you win; it is not so easy when you \nlose. It shows the goodness of a person as to how they are able to take \ndefeat. John Ensign could write a book on how people who suffer \nadversity should react.\n  Twenty-four years prior to that race between Reid and Ensign, I lost \na very close race in the State of Nevada. I didn't handle it nearly as \nwell as John Ensign handled his loss. I only wish I had handled the \nloss in 1974 the way John Ensign did in 1998. To his credit, not only \ndid he handle it, as my father would say, ``as a man,'' he handled it \nextremely well. Not only that, he came back and 2 years later was \nelected to the Senate. One reason he was elected as easily as he was is \nhow he handled the loss in 1998.\n  I am happy to be on the floor today at the time of the maiden speech \nof the junior Senator from the State of Nevada. I am sure his parents \nwere watching on C-SPAN, and I know how proud they are. His father is a \nvery quiet man. He goes to very few public functions. When he does, he \nis easy to find because he is always back someplace, usually alone, \nwatching his son. His mother is more in the mix of things, but I am \nsure they were watching this morning as their son delivered his first \nspeech on the Senate floor. I am sure they are very proud of John, as \nthey should be. He has been a real good son.\n  He is well educated. He is a doctor of veterinary medicine. He is \nsomeone who has been a successful businessman, both in the veterinary \nfield and also in the business field. More important than that, John \nEnsign has something his parents are more proud of than how he has \nsucceeded in his professional public life. They are more proud of how \nhe succeeded in his personal life. His wife Darlene and he have been \nextraordinary parents. I called John at home not long ago and Darlene \ntook the phone. I said: Could I speak to John; what is he doing? She \nsaid: He is on the bed playing with the kids. That is what dads are \nsupposed to be doing.\n  Mr. President, Mayor LaGuardia in New York City started a saying that \nwe all use now: There is no Democratic or Republican way of cleaning \nthe streets. That is true. In that same vein, there is no Democratic or \nRepublican way of handling the problems that come to us in the State of \nNevada, as they come to people in the State of Virginia. There is no \nstrictly Democratic or Republican way of fixing the problems in the \nState of Nevada.\n  John Ensign and I know that. That is why as soon as the election was \nover this past November he and I got together and said that we were \ngoing to set an example for the people of the State of Nevada. Everyone \nknew of the friendship of Richard Bryan and Harry Reid, but people were \ndoubtful how Harry Reid and John Ensign could represent the State of \nNevada. Were we simply going to cancel each other's votes and be mean \nspirited about how we reacted to each other?\n  We were not going to vote the same way all the time, but we decided \nwe would be gentlemen in the way that we handled the problems of the \npeople of the State of Nevada. We believed there was no reason we \ncouldn't become friends, just as Harry Reid and Richard Bryan were \nfriends. While we are only a few months into this relationship, we both \nfeel very good about it. We are on the road to setting an example for \nhaving the best bipartisan relationship in the history of the State of \nNevada. We are going to try to do that. We vow to work closely together \nto protect the interests of our home State and protect the interests of \nbipartisanship.\n  We are here now. The Senate is 50/50. It is not going to stay that \nway. We don't know how much longer, whether the Democrats are going to \ncontrol the Senate or the Republicans. Regardless of that, Ensign and \nReid are going to work together and have a good bipartisan \nrelationship.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Today Senator Ensign in his maiden speech talked about \nsubstantive issues. These are substantive issues he has talked about \nfor a number of years. He feels strongly about education and other \nmatters. I am very proud of his first speech. I can remember my first \nSenate speech. Presiding over the Senate that day was Senator David \nPryor of Arkansas. I gave a speech on the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights. \nThat is now law. I was very fortunate the man that ran the subcommittee \nthat had jurisdiction over this issue liked what I said. Chuck Grassley \nwas listening. He was also interested in this issue. Immediately I got \nbipartisan support for the legislation, and it became law.\n  I salute my friend John Ensign for his first speech. I look forward \nto many years of service to the State of Nevada by John Ensign. I look \nforward to many years of friendship between John Ensign and Harry Reid.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Nevada--I \ncall him that, too--he has welcomed me to the Senate. He has shown me \nthe ropes. As he discussed, we are going to work for the people of the \nState of Nevada because there are a lot of issues that affect our State \nthat are very unique to it. They are not Republican or Democratic \nissues. We have agreed to disagree on issues that we feel strongly \nabout that are national issues, and that is fine. We hope to also set \nan example for the rest of the Senate of how one can agree or not agree \nbut not be disagreeable.\n  I thank the senior Senator from Nevada. He is representing our State \nin the tremendous position he is in today. We in Nevada are all very \nproud of him. I thank Mr. Reid for attending my maiden speech on the \nfloor. I look forward to many great years of working together.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, as\n\n[[Page S1728]]\n\namended, the time until 11:17 shall be under the control of the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, Mr. Thomas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/01/senate-section/article/S1728-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1728-S1729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Nevada for their \nconversation. Certainly we have a lot of things in common with Nevada, \nmostly public lands. We don't have the gambling revenue, however.\n  I rise to speak a few moments today on energy and energy policy. \nCertainly, this is one of the issues President Bush has talked about, \nand we have talked about it for some time in the Congress, the lack of \na policy on energy. The President has asked Vice President Cheney to \ncome up with some ideas with regard to energy and an energy policy. I \nbelieve he is going to do that within the next month. I look forward to \nthat.\n  One of the important and interesting aspects of this working group \nVice President Cheney has put together is that it involves the \ndirectors of several agencies. That is extremely important. What we \nthought is, we have an agency called the Department of Energy, which is \nfine, but much of what is done with respect to energy is done in some \nother agencies, such as Interior, EPA, and Agriculture. It is extremely \nimportant that we have a high level group such as this that will bring \ntogether the differences that have evolved out of the various agencies.\n  We also are seeking to reactivate and continually activate an oil and \ngas forum in the Senate for those States that have particular interests \nin the production aspect of oil and gas and fuel. Obviously, everyone \nhas an interest in it. No one pays much attention to it when gas is $1 \nor $1.10 a gallon. When it gets to be $1.90, there is suddenly a lot of \ninterest in it. I understand that. Even in our State of Wyoming, where \nwe are maybe the energy center of the country our natural gas prices \nhave gone up, for heating, of course, in the wintertime. And then the \nCalifornia situation certainly has brought attention to it as well.\n\n  So I think even though we have sought to do this over the last \nseveral years, it is time we really focused in on having a national \nenergy policy. That will give some vision to what we expect and want to \ndo with regard to energy and, indeed, how we would do that. It is \ninteresting; I guess I wasn't aware of the impact high-tech has had on \nthe electricity consumption in California. You don't think of this \ncomputer sitting in front of you, Mr. President, which is using a lot \nof energy. But there are so many that are turned on that it has, \nindeed, had an impact.\n  What do we need to do with the energy policy? I guess we ought to \nbegin by saying, what do we want, expect, and need in terms of energy \nfor our economy, our families, our communities, to have the kind of \nlife we want to have? I think then we look at that demand situation. Of \ncourse, we have to take a look at how we are going to supply those \nneeds.\n  We are currently about 56-percent dependent on foreign sources for \nour Nation's supply of oil. It cost more than $100 billion last year to \nbring those things here. Our dependence has increased over the years. \nIt was about 36 percent in 1973 during the Arab oil embargo and 46 \npercent during Desert Storm. Now DOE projects that it will be about 65 \npercent by the year 2020--our dependency on foreign sources of energy--\nunless we change our situation.\n  So coupled with producing the product, I think there are some other \nthings that each of us would like to see. We have to do something with \nthe costs, see if we can level out costs. That is particularly \nimportant to us, really, those of us who are in the production field. I \nthink a year ago the wellhead price of natural gas was about $1.50, and \nof course that wasn't enough to even offset the costs. You had a little \nexploration, a little production, and really our economy in those areas \nwas kind of down, and all of a sudden it was like $9. So now there is a \nrush. We tend to have energy boom-and-bust cycles--not only for \nconsumers but for producers and for communities around the country. How \ncan we level that out some?\n  Diversity: I think we have to look at diversity. Certainly, there are \na number of sources of energy. Some are used more than others. I think \nwe need to have diversity.\n  The environment: As we produce domestically, obviously, we need to \ntake into account very seriously the protection of the environment. \nThere are new ways being discovered all the time as to how to do it. \nThere is horizontal drilling where you can reach out over thousands of \nsquare miles with a very small footprint.\n  Conservation: As we look at that, there are ways in which we can use \nenergy more efficiently than in the past.\n  So I hope we can do that on domestic production. We can do it, of \ncourse, in a number of ways. One of the ways, I am sure, that is most \nimportant is access. We were just listening to the Senator from Nevada \nand 87 percent of Nevada belongs to the Federal Government. Fifty \npercent belongs to the Federal Government in my State of Wyoming. So \nmany of the lands where there is access and there are designs for \nmultiple use--we haven't had the access to be able to explore and \nproduce in these natural resource areas. Access is something that is \nvery important to be able to do that. I suspect we will have to take a \nlook at some incentives, whether they be tax incentives or other kinds \nof incentives, to urge people to produce, of course. One of them that \nis always talked about that has a certain amount of merit is a tax \nreduction for small production wells. Wells get to the point that it is \nnot profitable to produce them but there is a good deal of resource \nthere. So to encourage them to do that would be useful, I am sure.\n\n  I mentioned diversity. Gas is a great resource, and we are going to \nuse a great deal of it. That is the problem we have, really, out in \nCalifornia. Of course, it is electricity, but to generate electricity, \nor want to, with gas. So you have to get gas there. But gas has a lot \nof opportunities to be used in many ways. I guess you could ask \nyourself, from a policy standpoint, should we be using gas almost \nexclusively in electricity generation when we could be using coal, for \nexample, of which we have great reserves, and for stationary \nproduction; perhaps that is an alternative we ought to consider.\n  We want to be certain that coal will be clean fuel; and it is clean \nnow, but it can be even cleaner if we use some research and continue to \nwork at doing CO2 and SO2 and doing some things \nthat we can do there.\n  Hydro: In the past several years, we have been in a situation where \npeople were seeking to reduce the number of dams that were there and \ntake away the production we have now. Hydro is a very efficient and, \nobviously, very clean fuel source. We can do that. I mentioned coal. \nCoal is one of our greatest resources, and we can do much with that as \nwell.\n  Nuclear: There is a good deal more interest in doing nuclear things. \nI think in Illinois, right now, nuclear plants produce 40 or 50 percent \nof the electricity. Now we have to find something to do with nuclear \nwaste. We haven't yet finished our Yucca Mountain proposition or some \nother things. Nor do we use it as they do in Europe, where they recycle \nand a great deal of their generation is done by nuclear. It is the \ncleanest in terms of air quality, as I understand it.\n  Renewables: We have some opportunities to increase the efficiency and \nmake more competitive the cost of renewables, whether they be wind, \nair, sun, whatever. I think that is something we are looking forward to \nin the future.\n  In addition to that, the markets for energy, of course, are not \ngenerally where the energy is produced, so you have to move it. Part of \nthe problem is, in California, nobody really wanted to build \ntransmission lines. They didn't want to provide rights of way to move \nfuel. Well, if you are going to have fuel, you have to move it there. \nAre there better ways perhaps to do it? Maybe so.\n  I think one of the things we want to look at here, because it is \ninterstate movement, is an electric transmission grid, so that there is \nan opportunity to move electricity perhaps even from Wyoming to \nCalifornia and that can be done.\n  So there are a lot of things that need to be done. I think they need \nto be set out, and we need to balance protection of the environment. \nObviously, nobody wants to overlook that. At the same time, you can \nmake it so restrictive\n\n[[Page S1729]]\n\nthat it is impossible to even produce it efficiently, cost effectively. \nThose are the kinds of things that I think very certainly need to be \nconsidered.\n  We have an act before us now. The chairman of the Energy Committee, \nSenator Murkowski from Alaska, has put together a bill. I happen to be \na cosponsor. It is a large bill that has to do with many of the things \nthat are involved. I suspect there will be some changes in it before it \nis finally passed. I think it is a start, and I am very proud of what \nhas been done there. It talks about protecting energy supplies, \nsecurity for increasing efficiency, and the certification of pipelines. \nIt has to do with technological research, advancing clean coal \ntechnology, alternative fuels, renewables, and conservation measures, \njust to name a few. It has to do with all kinds of things that would \nencourage us to have a clean, useful economic energy program in the \nUnited States to meet our needs.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

I amend my \nrequest to indicate that we would begin at 2 p.m. on Monday, March 5 \ninstead of 1 p.m.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, I \nfirst thank Senator Reid and the majority leader for their good-faith \ndiscussion. I say to the majority leader, it is my understanding--and \nit is his word, which, to me, is enough--that the agreement we have, \nwhich is fine with me now, is that we will get started early next week, \nMonday afternoon, and that the majority leader is absolutely committed \nand intends for their to be full debate; Senators can bring substantive \namendments out, and we will have a debate.

Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that all \nsponsors of S. 220 be considered as cosponsors on S. 420.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, next week we \nare going to get into some heavy lifting. This is a very important \nbill. There are a lot of amendments. For those in the press and others \nwho have been wondering why we haven't been doing things, it is \ndifficult early in the session to get to substantive matters. This is \ngoing to be some real substantive legislation. My friend from Minnesota \nhas indicated he has a number of amendments to offer and others do. I \nlook forward to some long days and a lot of good work next week on this \nbill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me respond in this way: At the beginning \nof a new session, particularly with a new administration, you do have \nto have time to get amendments or bills produced. They have to work \nthrough committees. The committees have to get organized before they \ncan begin reporting bills, plus a lot of time is spent on \nconfirmations. I am glad we are ready now, though, to go to serious \nlegislation.\n  Our colleagues should be on notice that the days probably will be \nlong next week, and we will be having votes throughout the day Tuesday, \nWednesday, Thursday, possibly even Friday. I can't project right now \nwhat will be required in that area. We may need to even go late in \norder to give Senators time to make their case on amendments and have \nvotes. It is time to do that. I appreciate the help we have had in \ngetting this bill ready for the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Leader, I am wondering if I could also ask--we have had \na number of inquiries from Democratic Senators--what is the rest of the \nday going to be like?\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me respond to that, Mr. President, in that I know we \nhave some requests from Senators who would like to make remarks. We are \nstill looking to see if there are additional nominations that might be \ncleared either by voice vote or recorded votes. We should have a fix on \nthat within the next couple hours. We will announce that. It is not \nexpected that we would have votes into the night or tomorrow. Whatever \nwe are going to do, we will do within a reasonable hour today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 p.m. shall be under \nthe control of the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am not using that full 30 minutes, \nso if anyone else wishes the floor, they should come down at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/01/senate-section/article/S1729-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1729-S1730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TEXAS INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate an \nimportant point in our history and that is the 165th anniversary of \nMarch 2, 1836, commonly known as Texas Independence Day.\n  Each year, I look forward to March 2. This is a special day for \nTexans, a day\n\n[[Page S1730]]\n\nthat fills our hearts with pride. On March 2, 165 years ago, a solemn \nconvention of 54 men, including my great, great grandfather Charles S. \nTaylor, met in the small settlement of Washington-on-the-Brazos. There \nthey signed the Texas Declaration of Independence. The declaration \nstated:\n\n       We, therefore . . . do hereby resolve and declare . . . \n     that the people of Texas do now constitute a free, sovereign \n     and independent republic.\n\n  At the time, Texas was a remote territory of Mexico. It was \nhospitable only to the bravest and most determined of settlers. After \ndeclaring our independence, the founding delegates quickly wrote a \nconstitution and organized an interim government for the newborn \nrepublic.\n  As was the case when the American Declaration of Independence was \nsigned in 1776, our declaration only pointed the way toward a goal. It \nwould exact a price of enormous effort and great sacrifice. My great, \ngreat grandfather was there, signing the Texas Declaration of \nIndependence. As most of the delegates did, he went on eventually to \nfight in the Battle of San Jacinto, and Texas would finally become an \nindependent nation.\n  He didn't know it at the time, but all four of his children who had \nbeen left back at home in Nacogdoches died trying to escape from the \nMexican troops who they feared were coming after them.\n  This was known as the ``runaway scrape,'' when the women and children \nin the Nacogdoches Territory fled toward Louisiana because they feared \nIndians and Mexican troops, and they were trying to go to safety. But \nthe rigors of the trip were very harsh and all four of their children \nwere dead when he returned.\n  Fortunately, he and his wife, my great, great grandmother, had nine \nmore children. But it is just an example of the sacrifices that were \nmade by people who were willing to fight for something they believed \nin. That, of course, was freedom.\n  While the convention sat in Washington-on-the-Brazos, 6,000 Mexican \ntroops held the Alamo under siege, challenging this newly created \nrepublic.\n  Several days earlier, from the Alamo, Col. William Barrett Travis \nsent his immortal letter to the people of Texas and to all Americans. \nHe knew the Mexican Army was approaching and he knew that he had only a \nvery few men to help defend the San Antonio fortress. Colonel Travis \nwrote:\n\n       Fellow Citizens and Compatriots: I am besieged with a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have \n     sustained a continual Bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded surrender at \n     discretion, otherwise, the garrison is to be put to the \n     sword, if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with \n     a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly over the \n     wall. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then I call on you \n     in the name of Liberty, of patriotism, of everything dear to \n     the American character, to come to our aid with all dispatch. \n     The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt \n     increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If \n     this call is neglected I am determined to sustain myself as \n     long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets \n     what is due his honor and that of his country--Victory or \n     Death.--William Barrett Travis, Lt. Col. Commander.\n\n  What Texan or otherwise can fail to be stirred by Colonel Travis' \nresolve. In fact, Colonel Travis' dire prediction came true, 4,000 to \n5,000 Mexican troops did lay siege to the Alamo.\n  In the battle that followed, 184 brave men died in a heroic but vain \nattempt to fend off Santa Anna's overwhelming army. The Alamo, as we \nall in Texas know, was crucial to Texas independence because those \nheroes at the Alamo held out for so long that Santa Anna's forces were \nbattered and diminished. Gen. Sam Houston gained the time he needed to \ndevise a strategy to defeat Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto \njust a month or so later on April 21, 1836. The Lone Star was visible \non the horizon at last.\n  Each year on March 2, there is a ceremony at Washington-on-the-Brazos \nState Park where there is a replica of the modest cabin where the 54 \npatriots pledged their lives, honor, and treasure for freedom.\n  Every year, in, on, or around March 2, I read Colonel Travis' letter \nto my colleagues in the Senate. This is a tradition started by the late \nSenator John Tower, my friend. This is a reminder to all of us of the \npride that Texans share in our history and in being the only State that \ncame into the Union as a republic.\n  I am pleased to continue the tradition started by my friend, Senator \nTower, because we do have a unique heritage in Texas where we fought \nfor our freedom. Having grown up in the family and hearing the stories \nof my great-great-grandfather and my great-great-grandmother and her \nheroism as well as his, it was something that was ingrained in us: \nfighting for something we believe is right and for maintaining the \nvigil for freedom throughout our country to this day.\n  It is very important we remember the people who sacrificed, the 184 \nmen who died at the Alamo, the men who died at Goliad later that same \nmonth, and those 54 men who met at Washington-on-the-Brazos putting \ntheir lives in danger as well by signing that declaration of \nindependence and becoming traitors for a cause. Their deaths gave birth \nto Texas independence, and we became a nation, a status we enjoyed for \n10 years before we entered the United States as a State.\n  I might add, we entered the Union by a 1-vote margin in the House and \na 1-vote margin in the Senate. In fact, we were originally going to \ncome into the United States through a treaty, but the two-thirds vote \ncould not be received in the Senate for ratification. Therefore, \nPresident John Tyler, for whom one of our great cities in Texas is \nnamed, introduced the resolution into Congress. He said: No, we will \npass a law to invite Texas to become a part of our Union. And that law \npassed by 1 vote in the House and 1 vote in the Senate.\n  I am very pleased Senator Tyler thought enough of us to ask us to \njoin the Union and fight for our ability to do that. We have \ncontributed a lot to the United States, and we are very proud of our \nheritage and the history of fighting for freedom that has been passed \nthrough the generations in my family, as well as in the families of so \nmany Texans.\n  I am pleased to commemorate our great heritage and the history of \nTexas--Texas the republic and Texas the State.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues \ncircumstances that should be evidenced in prompt action on the energy \nbill which has been introduced as a bipartisan bill by Senator Breaux \nand myself, Senator Lott, and a number of other Senators.\n  I have said for some time that we have an energy crisis in this \ncountry. Let me share some startling facts.\n  The majority of the Fortune 500 corporations in this country, \nreporting fourth quarter earnings, have indicated their earnings have \ncome in far less than projected as a consequence of the increased cost \nof energy in this country. There is a multiplier associated with that.\n  This has an effect on inventories, an effect on transportation, on \nvirtually every facet of our economy from buying furniture to big-\nticket items such as automobiles. Think for a moment that 50 percent of \nthe homes in this country are dependent on natural gas. The average \nbilling for energy for those homes has gone up 50 percent in the last \nyear. There is no end in sight.\n  We have a situation where companies that traditionally make \nfertilizer--urea, the technical name--and use natural gas in the \nconversion of the fertilizer are no longer making fertilizer. They are \nreselling their supply of gas because they have some relatively low-\ncost gas sources. We have aluminum companies in the Northwest that are \nno longer manufacturing aluminum. They have shut their aluminum \nproduction down and are reselling their electricity because they have \nlong-term contracts at favorable rates. In other words, it is cheaper \nto resell the power than it is to make the aluminum from the standpoint \nof return on investment. We have in Colorado copper mines that are no \nlonger operating as a consequence of the cost of power. More and more \npeople are becoming unemployed in these industries as a consequence of \na lack of an energy policy.\n\n  It is not my intent to point fingers because that doesn't get us \nanywhere. We have to recognize that we have a crisis, and we have to \nrecognize how we are going to get out of it. We are not going to get \nout of it by drilling our way out, nor are we going to get out of it by \nconservation. We are going to have to go back to the basics of our \nconventional energy sources, as well as the prospects for greater \ndependence on alternatives and renewables, and recognize the use of our \ntechnological capabilities to achieve a balance because our energy \nsupply is out of balance.\n  We haven't built a new coal-fired plant in this country since the mid \n1990s. Why? A number of reasons: Permitting, costs, the problems \nassociated with removing high sulfur, and the realization that we have \nhad to take many of our old coal-fired plants, which became inefficient \nand no longer could meet permits, out of the mix.\n  We haven't built a new nuclear plant in this country in nearly 20 \nyears. Why? It is not because we don't have the technology. Nuclear \ncontributes about 20 percent of our energy. It is emission free. The \nreality is that we have not been able to address what to do with our \nnuclear waste. We can't come to grips with the technology or with how \nor where we are going to dispose of it. As a consequence, nobody in \ntheir right mind would build a nuclear plant in this country. We talk \nabout hydro, but we have limited the hydro available. We are debating \nwhether to take some dams down, but there is a tradeoff. If you take \nthe dams down, you eliminate the ability to move traffic by barge, so \nyou put it on the highways.\n  So we have turned to natural gas as our preferred source of energy. A \nyear ago, natural gas was about $2.16 per thousand cubic feet; now it \nis $8 or $9, and it has been up as high as $10. The point is that we \nare pulling our natural gas reserves down at a very rapid rate. The \nrealization is, as we have seen in the California dilemma where they \nhave become dependent on outside energy sources within their State of \nabout 25 percent, the danger of becoming dependent on outside sources.\n  Let me conclude with a reference to oil, which is something I know \nsomething about. Currently, 56 percent of our oil comes from overseas, \nprimarily the Mideast. The CSIS study shows that for the next decade we \nare going to increase our dependence on hydrocarbons. That doesn't mean \nwe are not conserving more, or should not, or develop more \nalternatives. The realization is we are simply using more energy. \nSociety moves by computer and e-mail, by technology, and it is fostered \nby energy.\n  The picture I am painting today is not very pretty, but there is one \nmore facet of concern to this Senator from Alaska. When do we begin to \ncompromise our national security interests by increasing our dependence \non imported oil? I have said this in this Chamber on many occasions, \nand I will say it again.\n  If we look at our policy toward Iraq, a country we fought a war \nagainst in 1991 and 1992 to ensure that Saddam Hussein didn't invade \nKuwait and go on into Saudi Arabia and basically control the world's \nsupply of oil, isn't it ironic that since that time we have flown over \n20,000 sorties, enforcing the no-fly zone, and the cost of that to the \nAmerican taxpayer is difficult to calculate. You might say it is a \nPentagon energy tax, but it costs each one of us to enforce that no-fly \nzone.\n\n  The other day, the raids in the northern part of Iraq were carried \nout to destroy Saddam Hussein's technical capability that he developed \nwith his radar sensing system, which endangers our aircraft and our \npilots. If you look at that scenario--and I have said this before--we \nseem to have an arrangement where we buy his oil, 750,000 barrels a \nday, and we put it in our airplanes, and then we go bomb him. That may \nbe an oversimplistic statement, but I think it is fairly accurate.\n  What does he do with our money? He develops his missile capability, \nthe delivery capability, and his biological capability. At whom is it \naimed? Our greatest ally in the Mideast, Israel. So we have some \ninconsistencies.\n  I was asked the other day to explain at what point I thought we would \ncompromise our energy security interests by increasing our dependence \non imported oil from the Mideast. I thought for a while, and I \nresponded by saying: I guess we have already been there. We fought this \nwar and lost 147 lives. We have had 427 wounded. Now, the Department of \nEnergy says we are going to be close to 63-, 64-, 65-percent dependence \nin the early years of the 2007 period, or thereabout. If we are going \nto increase that, at what point are we really vulnerable to being held \nhostage by the Mideast, Mr. President?\n  What does that mean? Well, it means that since we have become so \ndependent on one source--the Mideast, which is a very unstable part of \nthe world--we face the reality of them controlling the price to the \npoint where they can pretty well dictate the terms of our addiction to \noil. They can do that simply by reducing the supply at any given time, \nand they have shown the discipline to do that. As a consequence of \nthat, they can increase the price.\n  The point of my discussion is to suggest to you that we should all \ncome to grips with the reality that this administration has to adopt an \nenergy policy with great dispatch. It has been estimated that the high \noil prices are reducing our U.S. economic growth by as much as 2 \npercent a year. Our lost GDP has been estimated at about $165 billion a \nyear. It is estimated that we are losing approximately 5.5 million jobs \nthat we would have had, had we had the availability of relatively low-\ncost energy.\n  The last point I want to make is as to our vulnerability. As I \nindicated in my opening remarks, we are not going to drill our way out \nof this, by any means. We are not going to conserve our way out. We \nhave to go back to the basics and get the balance. There is legislation \nintroduced in this body to put the\n\n[[Page S1732]]\n\none single area in North America where you are likely to find a major \noil discovery into a wilderness in perpetuity. I really question the \njudgment of that action in a time of supply shortage of the present \nmagnitude. To suggest that that arbitrary action is going to resolve \nour energy shortage is not only shortsighted but unrealistic.\n  If, indeed, this body chooses to open that sliver of ANWR--and I say \na sliver because it is just that--out of 19 million acres, an area of \nthe size of the State of South Carolina, we would propose to open a \nmillion and a half acres. The technology is in place, and we would have \na footprint of between 1,000 and 2,000 acres. Imagine that, an area the \nsize of the State of South Carolina. That is the sliver about which we \nare talking.\n\n  We have the technology to protect the environment, the ecology, and \nthe caribou. The answer is certainly.\n  This alone will not, by any means, resolve the energy policy, but it \nwill go a long way in two particular areas. If the oil is there in the \nabundance the geologists suggest, that one act will reduce our \ndependence on Mideast oil to less than 50 percent.\n  The goal of our energy bill--and its objective with which I think \nmost people will agree--is to reduce our dependence on foreign sources \nof energy by the year 2010. The question is, How do we do it? We \ndevelop domestic sources with our technology in the overthrust belt, \noffshore of the Gulf of Mexico, my State of Alaska. We expand our \nenergy sources by using technology to do it better.\n  To suggest this is the time to consider putting the wilderness off \nlimits is unrealistic and I think bad politics because each one of us \nis going to bear the responsibility to our constituents to explain why \nwe cannot get together on a workable, responsible energy policy, one \nthat addresses the merits of a balanced effort to lower the cost, \nincrease the productivity of our Nation, and do it with some dispatch.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a look at this bill. It is a 300-\npage bill. God knows why it has to be 300 pages, but nevertheless that \nis what it came out to.\n  Also, this bill is a composite of Republican and Democratic ideas. It \nis a bipartisan bill--Senator Breaux is one of the original \ncosponsors--and it attempts to promote alternative fuels, increase our \nconservation, and explore our own resource base and use our technology. \nAs a consequence, we should get on with the challenge ahead because the \nsooner we get on with it, the sooner we can rectify this terrible \nsituation that is beginning to throttle our economy, increase \nunemployment, and result in a situation where there is perhaps a \nsimilar exposure to that we have already seen in California.\n  California is striving for more energy as a consequence of not having \nproduced energy in a manner to keep up with demand. We are in that same \nsituation nationally.\n  I encourage my colleagues to review the legislation. I encourage them \nto communicate with us on changes and additions, and I encourage the \nadministration, which is in the process of developing their view of an \nenergy policy to do it with some dispatch because the rates are going \nup, the problem is getting worse, and the economic impact on our \nsociety and our businesses is evident, as I have already said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/01/senate-section/article/S1732-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, we will begin, following the President's \nState of the Union Address, hopefully a thoughtful and aggressive \ndebate about this country's fiscal policy including tax cuts, the \nbudget, and related matters.\n  These are very important issues. I wish to speak about some of them \ntoday, not from the standpoint of politics or polls, but more from the \nstandpoint of what I think the choices ought to be for this country's \nfuture. I know there is a heavy dose of politics surrounding all of \nthis. That is not my interest. I am much more interested in trying to \nthink through what would be good for this country, what is going to \nkeep us on track for the next 5 and 10 years to provide an economy that \nexpands and provides jobs and opportunities for our children and their \nchildren.\n  Having said that, I want to make a couple of comments to set the \nstage for where we are.\n  There are a lot of people who continually complain about this \ncountry, and it is hard to complain about this country with a straight \nface. This is the most remarkable place on the face of the Earth. We \nare the country that created a system of public education, saying to \nevery child in this country: You can go to school and be whatever you \nwant to be. We are not going to move you off in one direction or the \nother. Universal education.\n  It is us, our country, that has spawned an educational system that \nhas created the scientists, engineers, and the thinkers. We split the \natom and spliced genes. We have cloned animals. We invented the silicon \nchip and radar. We built television sets, the telephone, and computers. \nWe built airplanes and learned to fly them. We built rockets and flew \nthem all the way to the Moon. We cured small pox and polio. That is us; \nthat is what we have done in this country. What a remarkable place in \nwhich to live.\n  We are also a country that in all of my adult lifetime, and the adult \nlifetime of most of the people who serve in this Congress, have had two \nenduring truths underlining everything else we have done. One of those \ntruths is we were involved in a cold war with the Soviet Union, and \nthat affected virtually everything we did, including the choices we \nmade in this country in fiscal policy. The second enduring truth is we \nhad a budget that seemed to produce deficits that every year grew \nlarger and larger.\n  Those two truths which underlined virtually everything else we did in \nour lifetimes are now gone. There is no Soviet Union, there is no cold \nwar, and there are no budget deficits. Everything has changed, and the \nresult is a different kind of economy in this country in which we have \nsurpluses. The question is what to do with these surpluses.\n  My great concern as a policymaker, not from the standpoint of someone \nwho represents a political party, is that we not make the mistake we \nmade before.\n  Twenty years ago this country embarked on a fiscal policy advocated \nby a President who said we can do the following: We can double our \nspending on defense, because then we were in the middle of a cold war \nwith the Soviets; we can double our spending on defense; and we can \nhave a very substantial tax cut, and it will all add up to a balanced \nbudget.\n  In fact, it did not. It added up to trillions of dollars of Federal \ndebt that then marched toward $5.7 trillion of Federal indebtedness in \nthis country.\n  Let us not make that same mistake again. The author Russell Hoban \nsaid:\n\n       If the past cannot teach the present, if a father cannot \n     teach the son, then history need not have bothered to go on, \n     and the world has wasted a great deal of time.\n\n  Let us learn from the past. Let us learn the lessons of the past in \nfiscal policy.\n  What does that mean for us with respect to these surpluses and with \nrespect to proposed tax cuts and budgets?\n  Let me speak first about uncertainty. Nine months ago, Alan \nGreenspan--who is canonized in a new book, the American soothsayer, the \neconomist who knows all and sees all--said our economy was growing way \ntoo fast and he needed to slow it down. Think of that. Nine months ago \nour economy was growing too rapidly, according to Alan Greenspan and \nthe Federal Reserve Board. Nine months later, we are wondering whether \nwe might be nearing a recession. Certainly, the economic growth rate \nhas now dropped to near zero.\n\n  My point is this: If we can't see 9 months in advance, and the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S1733]]\n\nReserve Board could not, how can we then believe we can see 3 years, 5 \nyears, 7 years, or 10 years ahead in terms of economic prosperity that \nwould allow us to say there is enough surplus available to provide a \nvery large permanent tax cut without providing substantial risk that \nwill put this country right back in the same deficit ditch we were in \nfor so long? The answer is, we cannot provide that assurance.\n  This is faith-based economic forecasting, nothing more, nothing less. \nNo one knows what will happen in this country's future. We hope what \nhappens is continued prosperity, economic growth without a recession. \nThat is what we hope happens. But having both studied economics and \ntaught economics, I understand no one has repealed the business cycle. \nThere is inevitably an expansion and a contraction. We provide the \nstabilizers that tend to even those out just a bit, but no one has been \nable to repeal the business cycle. The uncertainty with respect to \neconomic forecasting ought to lead us to be cautious.\n  Now the President proposes a $1.6 trillion tax cut. The actual \nnumbers are closer to $2.6 trillion when you add up what needs to be \ndone in order to implement his tax cut. It is not a difficult \nproposition to say to the American people: What I would like to provide \nfor you is a tax cut. That is not difficult. Most people feel they are \novertaxed. Most people want a tax cut. I also feel most people want a \ncountry that produces an expanding economy with the jobs and \nopportunity that comes with it.\n  Let me describe what I believe makes this economy work. It is not \nlike the engine room of a ship of state where there are dials and knobs \nand levers and you have a bunch of folks with green hats who are down \nthere dialing these things up just right--tax cuts here, M1b over here, \nvelocity buddy over here, spending over here--and you get all the knobs \nand dials adjusted just right and the ship of state moves along \neffortlessly. That is not what moves the ship of state. It is \nconfidence.\n  When the American people have confidence in the future, they make \ndecisions and do things that represent that confidence. They buy cars, \nhomes, and they do things that move the economy forward, producing jobs \nand opportunity.\n  When they are not confident, they withhold those judgments. They \ndecide they can't afford to buy a car, they can't afford to buy a home, \nthey will defer this purchase and the economy contracts. It is as \nsimple as that, nothing more than a mattress of confidence upon which \nthe economy rests.\n  The reason it turned around in 1992 and 1993, after the 1993 economic \nproposal that passed by one vote in the House and the Senate, was \nbecause people finally felt the Congress was serious about putting this \ncountry on track and getting rid of the budget deficits that became the \ngrowing tumor in this country's annual budget. So people had confidence \nabout that and confidence in the future and we had this unprecedented \nlengthy economic expansion.\n  My fear is if we lock in place a tax cut that is enormously uncertain \nin terms of its consequences with respect to future deficits, that we \nwill lose the confidence of the American people.\n  Let me be clear, I believe there is room for a tax cut. That is not \nwhat is at debate here. Republicans and Democrats both believe there \ncan and should be a tax cut with this surplus. I also believe, however, \nthe tax cut ought not be of such a size that it threatens our economic \nexpansion. And I believe that a tax cut is part of a series of things \nthat represents priorities in this country's economy.\n\n  We should, with a surplus, not only provide a tax cut, but we should \nas a priority also begin to pay down the Federal debt in a significant \nway. If during tough times you run up the Federal debt, during good \ntimes you have a responsibility to pay it down.\n  So reducing the Federal debt, $5.7 trillion to be exact, that was run \nup during tougher times and during periods when fiscal policy was not \nworking, that ought to be paid down with part of that surplus. That \nought to be a priority. Then let's have a tax cut. Especially let's \nhave a tax cut that is fair.\n  Some say when you criticize the proposed tax cut offered to us by the \npresent administration as being unfair, you are engaged in class \nwarfare. Nonsense. It is well within our right to talk about what kind \nof tax cut ought to be proposed that is fair to all Americans.\n  Let me give an example. We have a range of taxes that are paid by the \nAmerican people every year. Roughly $1 trillion in individual income \ntaxes is paid by individual workers across this country. Roughly $650 \nbillion in payroll taxes is paid by people who are working on jobs \nevery day and every night across this country. The top 1 percent of the \nAmerican income earners pay 21 percent of the total federal taxes. But \nthe President has sent us a proposed tax cut that says the top 1 \npercent should get 43 percent of the tax cut.\n  Let me say that again: The top 1 percent of the income earners pay 21 \npercent of the taxes, and the President proposes they should get 43 \npercent of the tax cut. I say that doesn't make any sense. That is not \nfair. And others say, well, gee you are involved in class warfare. \nNonsense.\n  Sigmund Freud's grandson had something to say about this. He said: \nWhen you hit someone over the head with a book and get a hollow sound, \nit doesn't mean the book is empty. Facts are facts. Facts are sometimes \nstubborn. The proposed tax cut will have an overwhelming advantage for \nthe highest income earners in the country and provide far too little \nfor working families. That is just a fact.\n  There is kind of a breathless quality to those who advocate this tax \ncut of $1.6 trillion or actually $2.6 trillion. There is an old saying: \nNever buy something from somebody who is out of breath.\n  We should do a tax cut. But it should be part of a set of priorities \nof paying down the Federal debt; providing a tax cut that is fair to \nall Americans, especially working families in this country; and, third, \nalso recognizing there are other things we need to do that represent \npriorities.\n  What are those priorities? Among those priorities are to provide a \nprescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. We all know we need \nto do that. There isn't any question that if we had a Medicare program \nbeing created today, we would have a prescription drug benefit in that \nprogram. All of us have had the experience of someone coming up to us \nat a town meeting. I recall a meeting one evening in northern North \nDakota. A woman came up to me, probably close to 80 years old, and \ngrabbed me by the arm and said: Senator Dorgan and her eyes began to \nfill with tears and her chin began to quiver--I take several kinds of \nmedicine for heart disease and diabetes, and I can't afford them. I \ncan't pay the bills anymore. Yet I need that medicine to extend my \nlife. What do I do?\n\n  All of us have had that experience. We know we need to put a \nprescription drug program in the Medicare program. We know that ought \nto be a priority as well.\n  Education is a priority. We know what has made this country great, in \npart, is a public education system available to all children to become \nthe best they can be, wherever they are, no matter their circumstance \nin life. We know that has contributed to the significance of this \ncountry's growth and opportunity.\n  How do we do that if it is not a priority to say we want to fix \nschools that are in serious disrepair? We can help do that. We want to \nreduce class size. We know it is easier to teach children in a class \nsize of 15 kids than a class size of 32 kids. We know kids learn better \nin well-equipped classrooms rather than in some adjunct trailer in \nwhich you have stuck 30 kids with an inch between desks and a teacher \ntrying to deal with all of them. That is a priority, as well.\n  Another priority for me is family farmers. We have a great many \nfamily farmers in North Dakota struggling mightily to try to stay on \nthe farm. That is a priority. Grain prices have collapsed. Our farmers \nare told by the grain market that the food they produce has no value. \nWhat on Earth can we be thinking of? Has no value? Five hundred million \npeople will go to bed with an ache in their belly in this world because \nit hurts to be hungry, and a farmer harvests grain and hauls it to the \nelevator to be told, ``your food has no value.'' There is something\n\n[[Page S1734]]\n\ndreadfully wrong with that. This country would want, it seems to me, to \ncreate and maintain a network of family farmers for this country's \nsecurity interests, if for no other reason, but from my own view, we \nwant to do that because it enriches our country to have a broad network \nof food production all across our country. Yet families are discovering \nthey are losing their heritage on the family farm.\n\n  A friend of mine is an auctioneer. He said he was doing an auction \nsale one day, and a little boy came up at the end of the auction sale, \nand he had tears in his eyes. He was about 10 years old. He grabbed my \nfriend by the leg. He was very distraught. The auctioneer tried to \ncomfort him, and this little boy said to him: You sold my father's \ntractor.\n  He patted him on the shoulder, and he tried to comfort him some more, \nand the little boy said: I wanted to drive that tractor when I got big.\n  So that is a priority for me, family farmers.\n  My point is this. When we talk about having a budget policy, we \ncannot just have one central piece that says, here is what we want to \ndo, to the exclusion of every other thing. That is not what made this \ncountry a great country in which to live.\n  Those of us who believe strongly that we ought to have a balanced \nfiscal policy believe we should avoid the mistake we made in the past, \nand that is believing that numbers that inherently don't add up do add \nup. We know better than that. We all took math and algebra. We \nunderstand what adds up. This proposal that has come to this Congress \nwith a budget and a tax plan is well over $1 trillion short. It does \nnot take a genius to see that. It is well over $1 trillion short of \nadding up. Yet everyone will walk around here, pretending this adds up. \nYou would fail fourth-grade math believing that.\n  So first, it ought to add up--not for the purposes of helping one \npolitical party or another. That doesn't matter so much to me. It ought \nto add up for the benefit of this country's future. We need to keep \nthis country on track. We need to continue an economy that provides \njobs and opportunity ahead.\n  How will we do that? By encouraging and maintaining the confidence of \nthe American people that we are doing the right thing. Most of the \nAmerican people, I think, believe the right thing is, during good \ntimes, help pay down the Federal debt with some of that surplus: You \nran it up in tougher times; pay it down in better times.\n  Second, yes, have a tax cut and make it fair to everybody.\n  Third, yes, there are other priorities as well. Pay some attention to \nthem. If you want to talk about education, then pay attention to \neducation and make some investments that will make our schools better \nschools. If you want to talk about prescription drug prices and helping \nsenior citizens, then if both parties say let's do a prescription drug \nplan in Medicare, do it, and have the money to pay for it.\n  If you want to talk about the family farm and say it is important and \nis not just some little old diner that got left behind when the \ninterstate came through, if you really believe family farmers are \nimportant, then decide you want to do something for them and help them \nduring tough times. Those are priorities as well.\n  Simply put, my point is we have a lot to be thankful for in this \ncountry. Nobody lives in a better place on the face of this Earth. It \nis not an accident that we are here. As stewards of this country's \nlegacy and its future, we as policymakers need to come together and \nengage in some cooperation on these things.\n  I am not someone who believes if we break out into full-scale debate, \nthat is a bad thing for the country. People ask me from time to time, \nhow are you getting along with 50 Senators on the Democratic side and \n50 Senators on the Republican side? It is as if they are afraid we are \ngoing to have a debate. Look, a debate is what this country is about. \nThere is the old saying, when everyone in the room is thinking the same \nthing, nobody is thinking very much.\n\n  This entire body is about debate. There is nothing wrong with \naggressive, robust debate. In fact, that is the only way we get the \nbest of what everyone has to offer. So we are going to have some \nsignificant, aggressive debates. And we should. I hope at the end of \nthis debate good thinkers on all sides, from both political parties \nrepresented here in the Senate, will agree with me that it doesn't \nmatter what the polls say, it doesn't matter what the politics are; \nwhat matters is that we do the right thing to keep this country on \ntrack, that we do the right thing to keep this country growing and to \nhave this country provide the opportunities we want it to provide for \nour children and their children.\n  What we have inherited is not accidental. Those who came before us \nhave struggled mightily to do the right thing. In some cases, it wasn't \nthe popular thing but it was the right thing. We have a responsibility \nto accept this opportunity given to us to do the right thing as well.\n  I say to our new President, his Address to Congress, I think, dealt \nwith a number of significant and important issues. On some of them, I \nwill be supportive. On others, I will be a fierce opponent. But I hope, \nas we think through all of these issues, we can understand what the \npublic interest is--not the party interest.\n  The decisions we make in this Chamber could well affect this country \n5, 10, and 25 years from now. If we put this country on the wrong \ncourse and throw this economy back into growing, choking, heavy \ndeficits year after year after year, it will once again be one of the \nenduring truths of the political life and the public life of everyone \nwho comes after us in this Chamber; it will be one of the enduring \ntruths that serves as a backdrop for every other decision that is made \nfor the next 5, 10, and 25 years.\n  We were able, as I said when we started, to shed the yoke of those \ntwo enduring truths that cost us so much. The cold war? The Soviet \nUnion is gone. That was a backdrop for virtually everything we did for \nmany years. That is behind us. The growing budget deficits that \nrepresented a cancer in this country's budget--they are gone. They \naffected virtually everything we did in this Chamber for many years. \nThat is a blessing. Those enduring truths have changed.\n  So let us make decisions now that do not re-create those liabilities \nfor those who follow us. Let's make decisions that put this country on \ntrack to a much better and brighter future that is sustained for the \nlong term.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this afternoon I urge my colleagues to \njoin with Senator Conrad and myself and others who are sponsoring S. \n21, the Social Security and Medicare Off-Budget Lockbox Act of 2001.\n  I know this legislation came before the body last year and passed by \n60 votes, including 14 votes by my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle.\n  I think this legislation is particularly critical at this time given \nthe budget that the President has proposed to the Congress, and the \nfact that while he has indicated support for Social Security--although \nnot reserving all of it but he has talked about Social Security--he did \nnot mention reserving the Medicare trust fund. This is a critical issue \nfor me and all the people I represent. To leave the Medicare trust fund \nunprotected as we talk about investments and spending and how we are \ngoing to address tax cuts for the future is very dangerous.\n  This morning we had the opportunity in the Budget Committee to hear \nfrom our new Secretary of the Treasury. Again, he spoke about Social \nSecurity but did not indicate a commitment to protecting the Medicare \ntrust fund.\n  We have about $500 billion that needs to remain within the trust fund \nand be\n\n[[Page S1735]]\n\nprotected for the future. We all know that we are going to see within \nthe next 10 or 11 years additional strains on Medicare as those of us \nwho are baby boomers come into the system, and beyond. We have critical \nneeds in Medicare. We don't need to put $500 billion in the column that \nis open for spending or a tax cut. We need to place it on the side with \nSocial Security, in a lockbox--all of Social Security, all of Medicare \nin a lockbox--so we are guaranteeing that we are not touching a penny \nof either Social Security or Medicare.\n  When I first came to the Congress and was in the House of \nRepresentatives for 4 years, we were talking about trying to keep \nourselves moving to pay off our debt so we could finally say that \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds would not be used in the \nbottom line of the budget.\n  We heard people in both parties--in fact, again a vote was taken last \nyear to support this bill that has been reintroduced--and yet with all \nof that support, we now find ourselves in the position with a budget \nbeing proposed that does not add up, unless you add using Medicare \ntrust funds to the bottom line. I am gravely concerned about that as we \nlook to the future in Medicare.\n  We all want to see a tax cut. We may struggle and debate who ought to \nbe receiving the majority of that tax cut. My preference is that a lot \nof it go across the board and be targeted to the working class men and \nwomen and their families.\n  We all talk about deficit reduction and protecting Social Security \nand Medicare for the future. Unfortunately, while sitting in the House \nChamber on Tuesday night, I saw a proposal in broad terms that did not \nadd up. My fear is that will move us backwards rather than forwards as \nwe have been continuing to strengthen our fiscal position and our \neconomy.\n\n  We do not need to go back to the eighties and higher interest rates \nand high unemployment. In my great State of Michigan, those were tough \ntimes for families, small businesses, and family farmers that I \nrepresent. I am in no way interested in going back to those times with \nfiscal policies that do not add up.\n  I join with the President and with others who want to see tax cuts \nfor middle Americans. We can do that without spending Medicare and \nSocial Security. We can do it without putting ourselves back into a \nsituation where we are going into deficit spending.\n  I truly believe the people of the great State of Michigan want me to \nsupport a balanced approach that continues to pay down the debt and \nprotects Social Security and Medicare, and to provide tax relief across \nthe board that is focused on middle-income workers, small businesses, \nfamily farmers; and that we also are committed to a future that \nincludes investment in our children, in education, access to college, \nand making sure that health care, particularly prescription drugs, is \navailable for the people whom we represent.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to join with us in a proactive way to \nsupport S. 21. I hope we can get everyone in this Chamber to be a \ncosponsor of this bill which clearly sends a message across the country \nthat we want to work together to fashion a plan to keep our economy \ngoing and provide tax cuts, and that we not spend Medicare trust funds \nto do it.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting the lockbox for Social \nSecurity and for Medicare.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield my time. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the very lucky things we have around \nhere is the opportunity to listen to some very intelligent people \ngiving us their ideas on a lot of important subjects. Recently, I have \nhad the pleasure of listening to Chairman Alan Greenspan, who spoke \nbefore the Budget Committee a couple weeks ago. Yesterday, we had our \nbudget director, David Walker, speaking to the Centrist Coalition and \nalso had an opportunity to listen to Larry Lindsey, the President's \neconomic adviser, who used to serve on the Federal Reserve. I have \nlearned a good number of things from them that I think are very \nimportant for the discussions we have about the budget and how we deal \nwith the tax surplus that is confronting our country. As previous \nspeakers have said, we are no longer in a cold-war world; we are no \nlonger trying to get out of the budget deficit problem.\n  I think a couple things need to be clarified about some remarks I \nheard earlier. No. 1, it was not the tax increase of 1993 that got us \nout of the budget deficit situation. I served on the Budget Committee \nduring those, what I would say were very frustrating years--1993, 1994, \n1995. We went back and checked. Do you know something very interesting? \nIn spite of the fact that President Clinton and the then-majority \nDemocrats passed the largest tax increase in history, it did not do \nanything to lessen the deficits.\n  We went back and checked because the President's budget proposal, I \nthink for four straight budgets, proposed deficits of $200 billion a \nyear, roughly, as far as the eye could see.\n  There was no decrease in the deficit because they proposed to spend \nthe money. We raised taxes to deal with the deficit, but then they \nraised spending to cover up the tax increases.\n  So it was not until we got into those battles in 1995--and those were \ndifficult battles; I don't want to relive those days--but those were \nimportant battles because we finally made the point--with a Republican \nCongress and a Democratic President--that we had to start getting \nspending under control to get out of this deficit spiral that was \ndriving us further and further into debt. And we did it.\n  And we did something else, again, without the support of the \nPresident initially, and with some, but not a lot of, support from the \nother side of the aisle. We cut the capital gains tax rate. At the \ntime, CBO and others were saying: Oh, the capital gains cut is going to \ncost revenue to the Federal Government.\n  Some of us believe that when you cut taxes, particularly on an \noptional activity, such as selling property--which triggers capital \ngains--you can actually get more sales of property; that we could \nunlock some of the locked-in gains. We did, and capital gains revenues \nwent up significantly.\n  But lo and behold, something else very important happened. As we took \naway the disincentive to roll over old investments and put them into \nnew investments, we started investing them in something new called \ninformation technology, which enabled us to develop much more \nproductive ways of doing things. Lo and behold, the productivity of \nthis economy grew. When the productivity grows, that means we can get \nmore goods and more services--a better quality--without paying more, \nand we can pay better wages.\n\n  We also had welfare reform, which took significant portions of the \npeople off welfare and put them to work. Again, I am proud that the \nRepublican Congress was able to pass a bill three times--two vetoes--\nand then it was finally signed, and we got more people working.\n  So we were really generating things with our economy. We had good \njobs, and productivity was up. Our lucky streak ran out, probably back \nin September, as the indicators turned down. We are seeing signs that \nare not encouraging, that the business cycle may be going into a \ndownturn. But we believe that for the long term, this country is going \nto continue to grow. The budget projections of the CBO, and the blue \nchip indicators, suggest that even if we do have these budget \ndownturns, we still are probably going to have about a $5.6 trillion \ntax surplus over the next 10 years. It might be lower; it might be \nhigher.\n  Most likely, if we can continue to invest in productivity--the rate \nof productivity growth we have had in recent years--it will be higher. \nSo the question becomes, What do we do with that $5.7 trillion tax \nsurplus? David Walker says we ought to pay down all the debt as quickly \nas we can.\n  Chairman Greenspan used to say that, but now he has said: Wait a\n\n[[Page S1736]]\n\nminute, you can only pay down so much of the debt because a lot of it \nis in bonds and other long-term instruments that people are not going \nto want to sell because a lot of us have given savings bonds, and other \nthings, to our kids or people who have made long-term commitments to \nsaving. So we cannot get them all back.\n  So Alan Greenspan, when he testified before the Budget Committee, \nsaid it is time that we start reducing taxes. We need to continue to \npay down the debt in a steady, consistent, prompt manner, but do not \ntry to get rid of all of it, and start now with some tax relief.\n  So the President has come up with a proposal for that $5.6 trillion: \nTo use $2.9 trillion of it for Social Security and Medicare; to use \n$1.6 trillion to reduce the tax burden of those who are paying taxes; \nand set aside another $1 trillion for needed investments--actually, \nexpenditures that may come along, and that is after we have the \nordinary inflationary growth. So that is even after Government grows \nby, say, 4 percent in discretionary spending.\n  The one thing that everybody agrees we should not do with that \nsurplus is lock it in totally to more mandatory spending, entitlements, \nbecause that is what, according to David Walker, is going to break this \ncountry 20, 30, 40 years down the road, if we do not do something about \nit. We cannot continue to lock in automatic spending because you never \ncan get out of it; it is too difficult.\n  So the President said he wants to give a $1.6 trillion tax reduction. \nOur Democratic friends say: We want only $900 billion in tax reduction. \nThe President said: We are going to increase spending some. But \napparently--my guess is--my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwould want to spend the $700 billion difference between what they want \nas a tax reduction and what we want as a tax reduction.\n  Frankly, I think that is a bad way to go because our economy is \nsuffering right now under the highest income tax rates we have ever had \nin peacetime. Mr. President, 21.6 percent is what we pay in taxes now. \nThe only time it was higher was in 1944, at the height of World War II. \nThat tax rate is too high. It threatens to choke off the money flowing \ninto productivity, to businesses, to families, to make their own \ndecisions, to make their own investments. So I believe $1.6 trillion is \na reasonable figure. A portion of that must go to reduce marginal \nincome tax rates.\n  Just a few years ago, the top marginal rate was 28 percent. A lot of \npeople, if you poll them, will say: Yes, the Federal Government could \ntake 28 to 30 percent of a rich person's income, take it in taxes.\n  The President is only lowering the top rate to 33 percent, but he is \ngiving across-the-board tax relief to all Americans paying income tax. \nSix million people, the lowest income people paying income tax, could \nbe dropped off the rolls. For a family of four making $35,000 a year \nnow paying income tax, they would pay none. For a family of four making \n$50,000 a year, their income tax burden would be cut in half.\n  A question has been raised in this Chamber about progressivity. Are \nyou continuing to tax the wealthy more? The answer to that is yes. You \ndrop 6 million people off at the bottom; then you have the wealthy. \nAnybody who makes over $100,000 a year--we could say that is relatively \nhigh income--right now those people making over $100,000 a year pay \n61.9 percent of the total income taxes collected. After the Bush plan \nis fully implemented, they would pay 64.1 percent. They would be paying \na larger share, more than 2 percent more of the taxes. If we want \nprogressivity, President Bush's plan is important.\n  Why is it important? Because only with that tax reduction can we make \navailable the continuing investment in productivity that keeps the \neconomy growing. Individuals, small businesses are making investments \nin other companies and in their own companies. There are some 20.7 \nmillion small businesses in America taxed at personal rates. They are \nproprietorships, personal operations--a farm, a small store, a computer \nconsultant--or they are partnerships or sub S corporations. That means \nthe individual tax rate affects the business.\n  A few years ago, after the 1985-86 tax cut, they only had to pay 28 \npercent as a top rate on their income. They used that money to invest \nin new equipment, in new employees, to expand their business. Now some \nof them at some rates pay as much as 44 percent as a top rate in their \nbusiness. That is a significant cut in the amount of money that is \navailable to invest in business and expand productivity.\n  I asked Alan Greenspan: Why is it that marginal tax rate cuts are the \nbest thing we can do for the economy?\n  He said: For the long-term, the best thing you can do for the economy \nis to reduce marginal rates because reducing marginal rates puts more \nmoney into the investments we need--into technology, equipment that \nimproves productivity, provides better wages and better economic \nopportunity and more jobs.\n  That is basically the reason why the Bush tax plan makes a great deal \nof sense.\n  There are a lot of other ideas around here. I am sure we will have an \nopportunity to work on them. For the long term, if we want to keep our \neconomy growing--and I think we certainly do--we need a balanced \napproach that does as the President said: No. 1, reduces the debt as \nfar as it can; provides tax reductions that will be put into productive \ninvestment; and puts money into high priority items, items such as \neducation, items where we can see a real need.\n  We also need to reform Medicare, including prescription drug options \nfor seniors in assisting low-income seniors. We ought to get about \nworking to reform Social Security as well. As we do those things, \nleaving money in the private sector is the best way to make sure our \ncountry can progress.\n  There are those on the other side who say we are giving tax money \nback to the wealthy to purchase a Lexus. Frankly, we make a lot of cars \nin Missouri; we don't make the Lexus. If they have earned the money, \nthe question is, How much of that do you tax away? If they buy a Ford \nor a Chevy or a Dodge minivan, they are putting a Missourian to work. \nThat is not all bad. We could have that if we adopt a sound economic \nplan, a sound budget, and a responsible tax reform proposal. I believe \nthe President's proposal is sound.\n  We have heard statements made, a lot of statements, that the top 1 \npercent of the income earners only pay 20 percent or 21 percent of the \nincome tax. That is not true. They pay 34 percent of the income tax. \nThey would wind up paying more under the Bush plan. It does keep \nprogressivity as well as providing relief up and down the line.\n  I hope the American people will take the time to find out the truth \nabout the economics of the budget and this tax relief plan. I believe \nif they do, they will find that this is a plan that makes sense. It is \nbalanced. It meets the priority needs of the American people, and it is \nthe best recipe we have to see continued economic growth, good jobs, \nincreasing productivity, and a better way of life for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

Mr. President, in recent years in the State of Nevada we \nhave had two natural disasters that have been very traumatic. One was \nin Reno, one in Las Vegas, and both were floods. The majority of the \nnatural disasters that we have in America, are caused by water. There \nare earthquakes, of course, and there are fires, but most of our \nnatural disasters have to do with water.\n  As I just mentioned, in Las Vegas and Reno we had two devastating \nfloods. They both destroyed property. Thankfully the loss of life was \nfairly minimal, but there were lives lost, nevertheless, these floods \nwere devastating. Homes were washed away. Businesses were washed away.\n  The one highlight, as I look back, was the fact that the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, FEMA, was there and they did a wonderful \njob.\n\n[[Page S1737]]\n\n  They were there during the violent storms--the storm in Las Vegas and \nthe one in Reno.\n  I cannot stress enough how important FEMA was to the people of the \nState of Nevada. They move in quickly, set up first aid and relief \nstations, and constructed temporarily shelters. They set up a Federal \noffice where they would meet with people to talk with them about their \nlosses, whether or not there were emergency loans available.\n  After the worst was over, FEMA, through something called ``Project \nImpact,'' set up a disaster mitigation project. In effect, what it did \nafter the flood, was to help in Las Vegas to reduce Las Vegas' \nvulnerability to floods. Project Impact offers seed money to help \ncities all around the country allay the effects of natural disasters.\n  In Las Vegas, officials worked with State and local officials on \nwaste, to upgrade the sewer system, build ducts, install backlog valves \nto prevent flood waters from entering homes, and install barriers to \nprevent similar disasters from happening again. Project Impact has made \na real difference in Nevada.\n  The former mayor of Las Vegas, Jan Jones, said Las Vegas could not \nhave gotten through the floods without the assistance of project \nimpact.\n  I credit this project with helping hundreds and hundreds of Nevadans \nbounce back from a very difficult time.\n  Most recently, in fact yesterday, I was doing a radio program, \nNational Public Radio, with Juan Williams. The program was interrupted \nbecause of the earthquake that took place at about 11:15 a.m. in \nWashington State. At the time I was on the radio program and he did not \nindicate the severity of the quake.\n  Yesterday's earthquake survivors were fortunate that the quake \noccurred deep in the ocean, some 30 miles underground. Even though it \nwas almost 7 on the Richter scale, the loss of life was minimal. At \nthis point we only know of one person who died as a result of that very \nsevere earthquake. Several hundred have been hospitalized, and several \nof them are hurt badly, but the impact, because of where it occurred, \nwas lessened.\n  Project Impact is a program that works. In the State of Nevada, with \nthe money allocated to FEMA under Project Impact, the city is working \non bracing schools, water tanks, working on bookshelves--things like \nthat. The same is taking place, as we speak, in Seattle. Furniture and \ncomputers are being restored or repaired, and they have trained 1,600 \nhomeowners to shore up their own houses.\n  I give this brief background to indicate that I think this new \nadministration, wants to wipe out Government waste, they want to cut \nFederal spending, as we all do. I commend this administration for that. \nThey want to save whatever money they can and return it back to the \npeople in the form of tax cuts, and that is the right thing to do. But \nwith all the good Project Impact has done, it is hard to understand why \nPresident Bush has targeted this program for elimination in his budget.\n\n  In the budget proposal, the outline which was presented to Congress \nyesterday, the President canceled FEMA's Project Impact, saying that \nthe $25 million Federal-city program has not been effective.\n  I ask President Bush to reconsider. I am deeply concerned, because \nfrom the experience we have had in Nevada, this is a good program.\n  I am also very concerned that the President plans to cut overall FEMA \nspending by 17 percent. This is wrong. He is going to cut this program \nby about $400 million, forcing us to come back with a supplemental and \nput this money in anyway.\n  I do not know where the natural disasters are going to take place in \nAmerica today. I do not know where the floods are going to take place. \nI do not know where the fires are going to take place. I do not know \nwhere the earthquakes are going to take place. But they are going to \ntake place sometime during this fiscal year, and FEMA must have the \nmoney and resources to meet these emergencies.\n  When people are hurt, when people are afraid, we need to have the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency have the resources to take care of \nthese people. FEMA has done a remarkably good job. They have become so \nmuch better than they were.\n  I say that our President, must take a look at what his people have \nrecommended be done. This is the President's budget. He makes the \nultimate decision. But I want those people who are working with \nPresident Bush to take another look at this. We cannot--we should not--\neliminate $400 million from FEMA because, I repeat, even with the full \nfunding, it is very likely we are going to have to come back, as we do \nevery year, for more money for these emergencies.\n  Late yesterday, President Bush dispatched his new Director of FEMA, \nJoe Allbaugh, to the State of Washington. President Bush said Mr. \nAllbaugh would work with State and local officials to provide whatever \nhelp he could to the people of the State of Washington.\n  We have seen the pictures of Washington after the quake--the still \npictures in newspapers--and we have seen the disaster more vividly on \ntelevision. Seattle and other places in the State of Washington have \nvery serious problems, and Seattle is showing the Nation exactly why \nFEMA funding is necessary and the real impact some of these budget cuts \nwould have on our cities.\n  The State of Washington needs these moneys. Project Impact is a major \nreason that damage to Seattle was not more serious than it was.\n  So as we find ourselves in this tax and budget debate, these are the \ndetails we have to account for these emergencies.\n  I know Nevadans want a tax cut, and I know the people of Alabama want \na tax cut. In every State of the Union, people want a tax cut. Nevadans \nand all Americans have worked hard to ensure this surplus. We have \nworked hard and they have worked hard to get it. They deserve a major \ntax cut. It is time to reach a compromise to make sure they can receive \na fair tax cut, but it has to be one that pays down the debt and \nprotects Social Security.\n  We have to give people their fair share of a tax cut, but that does \nnot eliminate programs such as FEMA. It has to leave money so we can \nhave a prescription drug benefit. It has to leave money so we can do \nthe things we need to do regarding education.\n  So just as families plan for unexpected demands on their resources, \nwe have the responsibility to ensure that this Nation has resources to \nrespond to its emergencies, such as the floods I have talked about in \nNevada and this earthquake that took place yesterday in Seattle.\n  In the past, parts of our Nation have been devastated by unyielding \nwildfires and unforgiving hurricanes and earthquakes. Unfortunately, we \nwill have these emergencies.\n  I believe it is our responsibility to account for these inevitable \ncommitments. The best way to do that is by preparing for the worst, not \nby reacting when lives have been taken and property has been destroyed. \nWe need to be prepared, and we cannot be if we are going to cut Federal \nEmergency Management Agency funding by 17 percent. Certainly, we should \nnot cancel FEMA's Project Impact moneys. These moneys are very \nimportant.\n  As I said, with Seattle, Project Impact has helped make Seattle \nbuildings more earthquake resistant. Without this, problems in the \nState of Washington would even be worse.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

While the \nMemorandum of Understanding is not a part of the committee rules, it is \na mutual statement of the manner in which the committee will conduct \nits affairs for the best interests of all of the members of the \ncommittee and of the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the committee rules and of \nthe Memorandum of Understanding be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Rules of Procedure for the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n                                Affairs\n\n             (Adopted in executive session, March 1, 2001)\n\n\n              rule 1.--regular meeting date for committee\n\n       The regular meeting day for the Committee to transact its \n     business shall be the last Tuesday in each month that the \n     Senate is in Session; except that if the Committee has met at \n     any time during the month prior to the last Tuesday of the \n     month, the regular meeting of the Committee may be canceled \n     at the discretion of the Chairman.\n\n\n                           rule 2.--committee\n\n       (a) Investigations.--No investigation shall be initiated by \n     the Committee unless the Senate, or the full Committee, or \n     the Chairman and Ranking Member have specifically authorized \n     such investigation.\n       (b) Hearings.--No hearing of the Committee shall be \n     scheduled outside the District of Columbia except by \n     agreement between the Chairman of the Committee and the \n     Ranking Member of the Committee or by a majority vote of the \n     Committee.\n       (c) Confidential testimony.--No confidential testimony \n     taken or confidential material presented at an executive \n     session of the Committee or any report of the proceedings of \n     such executive session shall be made public either in whole \n     or in part or by way of summary, unless specifically \n     authorized by the Chairman of the Committee and the Ranking \n     Member of the Committee or by a majority vote of the \n     Committee.\n       (d) Interrogation of witnesses.--Committee interrogation of \n     a witness shall be conducted only by members of the Committee \n     or such professional staff as is authorized by the Chairman \n     or the Ranking Member of the Committee.\n       (e) Prior notice of markup sessions.--No session of the \n     Committee or a Subcommittee for marking up any measure shall \n     be held unless (1) each member of the Committee or the \n     Subcommittee, as the case may be, has been notified in \n     writing of the date, time, and place of such session and has \n     been furnished a copy of the measure to be considered at \n     least 3 business days prior to the commencement of such \n     session, or (2) the Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     determines that exigent circumstances exist requiring that \n     the session be held sooner.\n       (f) Prior notice of first degree amendments.--It shall not \n     be in order for the Committee or a Subcommittee to consider \n     any amendment in the first degree proposed to any measure \n     under consideration by the Committee or Subcommittee unless \n     fifty written copies of such amendment have been delivered to \n     the office of the Committee at least 2 business days prior to \n     the meeting.

The proxy shall be in writing and shall be \n     sufficiently clear to identify the subject matter and to \n     inform the Subcommittee as to how the member wishes his or \n     her vote to be recorded thereon. By written notice to the \n     Chairman of the Subcommittee any time before the record vote \n     on the measure or matter concerned is taken, the member may \n     withdraw a proxy previously given. All proxies shall be kept \n     in the files of the Committee.\n\n\n                           rule 4.--witnesses\n\n       (a) Filing of statements.--Any witness appearing before the \n     Committee or Subcommittee (including any witness representing \n     a Government agency) must file with the Committee or \n     Subcommittee (24 hours preceding his or her appearance) 75 \n     copies of his or her statement to the Committee or \n     Subcommittee, and the statement must include a brief summary \n     of the testimony.

The brief \n     summary included in the statement must be no more than 3 \n     pages long.

By written notice to the Chairman any \n     time before the record vote on the measure or matter \n     concerned is taken, any member may withdraw a proxy \n     previously given. All proxies shall be kept in the files of \n     the Committee, along with the record of the rollcall vote of \n     the members present and voting, as an official record of the \n     vote on the measure or matter.\n       (b) Vote on matters other than to report a measure or \n     matter.--On Committee matters other than a vote to report a \n     measure or matter, no record vote shall be taken unless a \n     majority of the Committee are actually present. On any such \n     other matter, a member of the Committee may request that his \n     or her vote may be cast by proxy. The proxy shall be in \n     writing and shall be sufficiently clear to identify the \n     subject matter, and to inform the Committee as to how the \n     member wishes his or her vote to be recorded thereon. By \n     written notice to the Chairman anytime before the vote on \n     such other matter is taken, the member may withdraw a proxy \n     previously given. All proxies relating to such other matters \n     shall be kept in the files of the Committee.\n\n\n                            rule 6.--quorum\n\n       No executive session of the Committee or a Subcommittee \n     shall be called to order unless a majority of the Committee \n     or Subcommittee, as the case may be, are actually present. \n     Unless the Committee otherwise provides or is required by the \n     Rules of the Senate, one member shall constitute a quorum for \n     the receipt of evidence, the swearing in of witnesses, and \n     the taking of testimony.\n\n\n                     rule 7.--staff present on dais\n\n       Only members and the Clerk of the Committee shall be \n     permitted on the dais during public or executive hearings, \n     except that a member may have one staff person accompanying \n     him or her during such public or executive hearing on the \n     dais. If a member desires a second staff person to accompany \n     him or her on the dais he or she must make a request to the \n     Chairman for that purpose.\n\n\n                      rule 8.--coinage legislation\n\n       At least 67 Senators must cosponsor any gold medal or \n     commemorative coin bill or resolution before consideration by \n     the Committee.\n\n             Extracts From the Standing Rules of the Senate\n\n\n                     rule xxv, standing committees\n\n       1. The following standing committees shall be appointed at \n     the commencement of each Congress, and shall continue and \n     have the power to act until their successors are appointed, \n     with leave to report by bill or otherwise on matters within \n     their respective jurisdictions:\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       (d)(1) Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, to \n     which committee shall be referred all proposed legislation, \n     messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to \n     the following subjects:\n       1.

Funding\n\n       A. Staff funding will be divided in equal portions for \n     Republicans and Democrats. This will be achieved by \n     increasing the funding allocation available for the Democrats \n     to the level equal to that which has been available for \n     Republican staff.\n       B. The funding for non-designated staff (the Chief Clerk, \n     the Deputy Chief Clerk, the Editor, and the front office \n     staff) would continue to be provided equally from funds \n     allocated to both Republicans and Democrats, as has been the \n     customary practice for the committee.\n       C. Additional funds for administrative expenses will be \n     divided equally.\n\n\n                            II. Office Space\n\n       Office space will be divided in equal portions for staff \n     for Republicans and Democrats, not counting the space \n     allocated for non-designated staff and the hearing room and \n     the anteroom to the hearing room.\n\n\n                     III. Subcommittee Organization\n\n       Subcommittees will be organized with regard to \n     jurisdiction, leadership, and membership, as agreed to by \n     vote of the Committee in accordance with Committee rules (see \n     attached).\n\n\n                             IV. Procedures\n\n     A. Witnesses at committee and subcommittee hearings\n       1. Every effort will be made to work cooperatively in the \n     identification of witnesses for each hearing. Republicans and \n     Democrats will be allowed to identify equal numbers of \n     witnesses (not counting administration or government agency \n     witnesses, or presidential nominees), both for full committee \n     hearings or any subcommittee hearings, and the Chairman of \n     the Committee or subcommittee holding the hearing will, \n     accordingly, issue invitations to all witnesses in a timely \n     fashion so as to meet the requirements of Senate rules to \n     give public notice of hearings at least one week prior to the \n     holding of the hearing.\n       2. In keeping with this understanding, the general \n     intention will be to keep the number of witnesses invited to \n     a level that can be comfortably accommodated in a single \n     hearing, including equal division of witnesses at each \n     hearing, recognizing that circumstances may sometimes arise \n     where an additional day or days of hearings would be \n     advisable.\n     B. Hearing topics\n       1. The specific topics of hearings, both for the Committee \n     and for subcommittees, will\n\n[[Page S1741]]\n\n     be developed by the respective Committee or Subcommittee \n     Chairman in consultation with the appropriate Ranking Member.\n       2. The topic of two hearings per month (either at the full \n     Committee or subcommittee level) may be designated by the \n     Ranking Member of the Committee, in consultation with the \n     Chairman of the Committee and relevant subcommittee, and such \n     designation will be made in a timely fashion so as to meet \n     the needs for scheduling, adequate notice of the hearing, and \n     identification of witnesses.\n       3. Point 2 will not apply to any matter that could be \n     placed on the Executive Calendar of the Senate, such as \n     nominations and treaties.\n     C. Agenda of committee business meetings\n       The agenda for business meetings of the Committee, or of \n     any subcommittee, will be developed by the Chairman in \n     consultation with the appropriate Ranking Member.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/01/senate-section/article/S1741-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE AGREEMENT COMPLIANCE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, yesterday, I led a group of 11 Senators in \nurging President Bush to ensure that there will be full funding for the \nCommerce Department's International Trade Administration efforts to \nmake sure that our Nation's trade agreements are fully implemented and \nfollowed by our trading partners. In the days leading up to the \nPresident's budget proposal, we were seriously concerned by reports \nthat there would be deep cuts in this program. Although it appears that \nthe fiscal 2002 budget does not include cuts, we continue to be \nconcerned that anyone would even consider such a damaging move.\n  This Nation has had a serious problem over the past two decades with \nmany of our most important trading partners who have not complied with \ncommitments made in trade agreements. The Japanese record, for example, \nof compliance with trade agreements is poor. We have brought disputes \nagainst the European Union at the WTO, and won those cases, yet the EU \nstill does not comply with its obligations. China has presented major \nproblems in implementing agreements on intellectual property rights \nprotection and on market access, and China's entry into the WTO will \nbring new and even more difficult challenges to our efforts to ensure \ncompliance.\n  It is critical that our Government agencies have the resources they \nneed to monitor compliance, and then to take the actions necessary to \nenforce the commitments made by other nations. Shortchanging those \nagencies means shortchanging the American farmer, rancher, worker, and \nbusiness owner. Further, when our trading partners fail to comply with \na trade agreement, it corrupts the negotiating process and leads to a \nloss of confidence in the entire trading system. We cannot allow that \nto happen.\n  Therefore, we 11 Senators are calling on the President to ensure that \nthe Department of Commerce, USTR, and other agencies responsible for \ntrade agreement compliance are fully funded to ensure that our trading \npartners follow the rules that they have agreed to follow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter we sent to the President be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                February 28, 2001.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Over the past twenty years, the United \n     States has negotiated hundreds of bilateral, regional and \n     multilateral trade agreements. Unfortunately, the record of \n     compliance by many of our trading partners is woefully \n     inadequate. In the case of Japan, for example, the American \n     Chamber of Commerce in Japan has concluded that barely half \n     of our major bilateral trade agreements were fully or mostly \n     successful. China's imminent accession to the WTO gives us an \n     unprecedented challenge in ensuring compliance with their new \n     commitments to open and liberalize the Chinese market.\n       In order to rebuild the consensus on trade in this country, \n     it is imperative that we demonstrate, to our businesses and \n     to our citizens, that the agreements we have concluded \n     produce results. Agreements without full compliance debase \n     the entire trade negotiating process. Ensuring compliance \n     must be a top priority for the United States.\n       Therefore, we are distressed by recent reports that the \n     proposal for fiscal 2002 funding for the Commerce \n     Department's International Trade Administration will not \n     provide sufficient resources for compliance activities. \n     Congress provided significant new funding to USTR and the \n     International Trade Administration to increase their \n     compliance capabilities in fiscal 2001. It would be a serious \n     mistake to reduce our government's ability to ensure that \n     trade agreements fulfill their goals and that our \n     manufacturers, farmers and ranchers, service providers, and \n     exporters benefit.\n       We urge you to ensure full budgetary support for these \n     critically important compliance efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n         Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman, Blanche L. Lincoln, Dick \n           Durbin, Dianne Feinstein, Ted Kennedy, Byron L. Dorgan, \n           Bob Graham, Max Cleland, Jack Reed, Patty Murray.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/01/senate-section/article/S1741-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DALE EARNHARDT\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, it has been almost two weeks since \nAmerican sports lost one of its greatest legends. On a Sunday, just \nlike any other Sunday, millions of NASCAR fans watched the concluding \nlaps of the Daytona 500 race. But February 18, 2001 is a Sunday that \neven those who were not at the race track, or glued to their \ntelevisions, will never forget. This was the day that we lost the \nperson who many say was the sport's fiercest competitor.\n  I am, of course, speaking of Dale Earnhardt, a man who was aptly \ndescribed as both ``NASCAR's greatest driver'' and ``the Intimidator.'' \nAs fans, friends and family continue to mourn his death, he is also \nremembered by labels such as ``devoted husband'' and ``loving father'' \nwhose fearlessness on the track was eclipsed only by the size of his \nheart.\n  Adults and children alike are searching for the reasons why their \nhero was taken from them. Dale Earnhardt brought these strangers \ntogether, week after week, as a family devoted to following his career \nand celebrating his many victories. He became part of our lives through \nsports broadcasts and the media. He was only months away from his 50th \nbirthday. He will not get to see his son follow in his footsteps and \nbecome a champion. But fans know that his devotion to the sport was so \ngreat that he was doing what he loved until the last moment.\n  A week after this tragedy, before all of the tears had dried, NASCAR \ncontinued with the racing season, but Dale Earnhardt was far from \nforgotten. The respect for this man was so great that drivers and \ncrewman, men who raced against him for years, wore black, red and \nsilver caps with Earnhardt's number three on them to honor their fallen \ncomrade.\n  No one was ready to let Dale Earnhardt go. A man who had such spirit \nfor the race of life as well as for the competition on the track will \nnot easily fade into the past. His spectacular career statistics will \ncertainly not let us forget and the way he lived his 49 years will be \nan even greater remembrance. He was admired in life and he will \ncontinue to be admired now that he has left us. He will continue to be \na role model for drivers and fans alike. Dale Earnhardt will always be \nwith us in our hearts, every time someone strives for greatness and \nevery time someone takes the checkered flag.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/01/senate-section/article/S1741-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1741-S1742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TESTING FOR DEOXYNIVALENOL IN BARLEY\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Indiana, the \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee, is aware that barley growers are \nconcerned about the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Grain Inspection, \nPackers and Stockyards Administration testing of deoxynivalenol, or \nDON, levels in malting barley. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator from North Dakota is correct. Identifying the \npresence of DON in malting barley is important because the presence of \nDON reduces the price producers receive for their barley. Malting \nbarley purchasers are affected because DON can affect the \ncharacteristics of the products they make with that barley.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Many malting barley growers believe that current GIPSA \nmeasurement standards are unacceptable. When the Congress reauthorized \nthe Grain Standards Act late last year, the Senator and I discussed \nthese measurement standards. The Senate suggests that the Federal Grain \nInspection Program Grain Standards division of GIPSA consider new \ntechnology that would allow for the more accurate measurement of DON in \nbarley.\n  Mr. LUGAR. We also suggest that GIPSA consider ceasing the use of the\n\n[[Page S1742]]\n\n``Optional Procedure,'' under which they measure to the tenth of one \npart per million, and use only the ``Standard Procedure,'' where \nmeasurements are rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/01/senate-section/article/S1742-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MARCH IS EYE DONOR MONTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues and the public that March is National Eye Donor Month.\n  National recognition of Eye Donor Month dates back to the very early \ndays of transplantation, when corneas were the only human transplants. \nNow, transplantations are common medical procedures by which people may \ngive, so that others can live better, fuller, healthier lives.\n  National Eye Donor Month honors the thousands of Americans who, over \nthe past 55 years, have each left behind a priceless legacy, their \neyes. Since the first transplant agency was founded in New York City in \n1944, sight has been restored to over half a million individuals by \nmeans of cornea transplantation.\n  Eye Donor Month is also about increasing public awareness of the \ncontinuing need for donors. Many people are still unaware of how easy \nit is to become an eye donor. All a donor needs to do is sign a card \nand announce to his or her family the intent to leave behind this \nspecial gift.\n  I am confident that if more Americans realized the true extent of the \nneed for transplants, many more would willingly donate their corneas, \nonce they can no longer use them. More than 46,000 Americans will need \ncornea transplants this year. Thousands of researchers will need donor \neye tissue to explore prevention and treatment of blinding diseases.\n  Our Nation's eye banks, non-profit agencies operating under the \numbrella of the Eye Bank Association of America, have done a heroic job \nof restoring sight to blind people. Today, cornea transplantation is \nthe most common transplant procedure performed, with an extremely high \nsuccess rate of nearly 90 percent.\n  This incredible success rate is due in part to a meticulous screening \nprocess that separates out corneas unsuitable for transplantation. \nThese may be used for research purposes in surgical training and \nmedical education. So, while each donated eye is put to good use, such \na selective screening process must be supported by a large number of \ndonations.\n  Right now, there are simply not enough donors. We must change that. I \nwant to encourage my colleagues to celebrate National Eye Donor Month \nby working closely with our Nation's eye banks to educate the American \npublic about how they can help others to see. Let us all aim to \nincrease the number of eyes available for transplantation, so that we \nmay illuminate the darkness for so many of our fellow citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/01/senate-section/article/S1742-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FEMA's PROJECT IMPACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I was dismayed and confused to learn that \nthe President's fiscal year 2002 budget proposal would eliminate the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, initiative, Project Impact. \nI draw my colleagues' attention to this nationwide program that works \nwith cities and counties to help reduce the destructive effects of \nnatural disasters because so many of their citizens have benefitted \nfrom these successful partnerships.\n  The very first Project Impact designated community was Deerfield \nBeach, FL, which joined in 1997 in response to the devastating effects \nof hurricanes. Another pilot community, Seattle, WA, uses Project \nImpact funds to ensure an earthquake-resistant community by \nretrofitting school buildings and bridges, identifying zones of \nvulnerability, training homeowners, and reinforcing hundreds of \nSeattle-area homes. Seattle formed neighborhood disaster teams and \nbrought in local businesses to help.\n  It is important to note that Project Impact is a major reason why \ndamage to Seattle during yesterday's earthquake was minimal. Only last \nApril, Seattle held its eighth ``Disaster Saturday'' at a school that \nhad been retrofitted with non-structural seismic retrofits as part of \nthe city's ``Project Impact's School Retrofit'' program. I share \nSenator Murray's appreciation for FEMA's work, as well as her concern \nover the proposed cancellation of this important disaster mitigation \nprogram.\n  Since its inception in 1997, nearly 250 community partners and 2,500 \nbusiness partners across the country have joined with Project Impact. \nIn my own State of Hawaii, all four counties are community partners to \nProject Impact. The 50th State is vulnerable to risks from hurricanes, \ntorrential rains and flooding, tsunamis, droughts, earthquakes, and \neven wildland fires. Urban areas like Houston, TX and Tulsa, OK, as \nwell as rural communities, like Fremont County, WY, largely rural area \nof about 38,000 residents, and Virginia's Central Shenandoah Valley \nPlanning District, have joined.\n  Kenai Peninsula Borough and Soldotna, AK are educating their citizens \nabout mitigation measures that can be taken to prevent damage from \nearthquakes, wildfires and floods. The city of Buffalo, which lies on a \nmajor fault, has joined Project Impact to help with earthquake \nmitigation, as well damage from snow storms and floods. A few months \nago, North Carolina was named the Outstanding Disaster-Resistant State \nin recognition for all the work that has been done in communities \nacross the State. In Colorado, a $150,000 grant to a coalition in San \nLuis Valley was leverage into a $268,000 Emergency Preparedness Fund. \nOther Colorado communities that have benefitted include Fort Collins, \nDelta and Clear Creek, Morgan and El Paso counties. In Elgin, IL, \nProject Impact helped start a pilot program to mitigate the effects of \ntornadoes.\n  Project Impact's full title is ``Project Impact: Building Disaster-\nresistant Communities.'' The initiative works by empowering communities \nto fashion hazard mitigation responses to local concerns and needs. \nFEMA helps communities carry out a detailed risk assessment and create \ndisaster resistant strategies. Communities turn these strategies into \npolicy by revising local building and land use codes and passing bond \nissues to construct prevention measures that will impact the entire \ncommunity.\n  Project Impact operates on three simple principles: preventive action \nmust be decided at local levels, private sector participation is vital, \nand long-term efforts and investments in prevention measures are \nessential. Project Impact takes resources from a Federal agency and \ngives it to the communities, helping them to become stronger and self-\nreliant.\n  Since its inception, Project Impact partners have revamped their \nlocal emergency management plans, elevated flood prone properties, \ndeveloped mobile demonstration models for hazard resistant construction \ntechniques and upgraded storm water drainage systems. In addition, \nProject Impact communities are encouraged to exchange ideas with each \nother. As former FEMA director James Lee Witt stated, ``. . . \nparticipants know that Project Impact empowers them to save lives, \nprotect property, protect their economies, livelihoods and save their \ncitizens from the heartache of disaster.''\n  Everything that I hear about Project Impact points to its successes. \nNASA, the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the \nHumane Society have all become Project Impact signatories in the past \nfew months. Although the President's budget proposal states that \nProject Impact has not been effective, it is unclear how that \nconclusion was reached. We should not eliminate a program without \nreviewing its successes or failures. In order to evaluate Project \nImpact, I am requesting that the General Accounting Office review the \nprogram and measure its performance. It is only right that there be an \naudit of this program, which so many communities believe is an \nimportant government partnership, before eliminating its funding.\n  FEMA estimates that for every dollar spent on disaster mitigation, \ntwo dollars are saved in disaster response and recovery. I sincerely \nhope that the Project Impact communities will not be left without any \nFederal assistance for disaster mitigation. Roger Faris, a Seattle \nhomeowner who thanked Project Impact for his home surviving Wednesday's \nearthquake without damage, said, ``This is one of these non-partisan \nsuccess programs that should have been expanded, not shut off.''\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/01/senate-section/article/S1743-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1743]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        OKLAHOMA SOONER WOMEN'S SOFTBALL 2000 NATIONAL CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nefforts of a dedicated public servant, Mr. John Craddock of Muncie, IN.\n  As the Director of the Bureau of Water Quality for the City of Muncie \nfor almost 30 years, Mr. Craddock has made a meaningful contribution to \nimproving the quality of life for the people in Indiana and the Nation \nthrough his work to improve water quality for our cities.\n  Mr. Craddock created the Bureau of Water Quality in 1972 and has \nserved as its only Director since its inception. He has transformed the \nriver in Muncie from a polluted waterway to a healthy and beautiful \ncenterpiece of the city.\n  Mr. Craddock's influence has reached well beyond the city of Muncie. \nHe has been internationally recognized as an authority on environmental \nmanagement of our rivers and streams. He has been asked by the Indiana \nDepartment of Environmental Management, the Indiana State Board of \nHealth, and the Environmental Protection Agency to help develop \nindustrial waste limits in state and federal laws and help set Indiana \nstream water quality standards.\n  During the past 10 years, Mr. Craddock has made approximately 575 \npresentations around the world, reaching more than 51,000 individuals \nwho can make a difference in the effort to ensure a fresh water supply. \nHe has been an active participant in United Nations conferences all \nover the world. His techniques and procedures in controlling industrial \nwaste and sewage overflow have helped influence the methods now being \nused in Japan, England, Canada, Europe, South America, and many Third \nWorld countries where he has shared his knowledge and experience.\n  Mr. Craddock has dedicated his life to the preservation of our \nworld's precious water resources. In addition to his service to the \nMuncie community, Mr. Craddock has been an outstanding representative \nfor Muncie, the State of Indiana and the United States during his many \nworld travels. Mr. Craddock also served his country in active duty in \nthe U.S. Coast Guard for 4 years.\n  Mr. Craddock is a remarkable public servant who has done so much to \nhelp strengthen our cities and communities.

HOOK\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am humbled today to honor the 1-\nyear anniversary of the passing of Steven A. Hook of North Providence, \nRI.\n  During his 44 years, Steven proved that having a disability does not \ndisable one from leading an active life. At the age of 14, Steve broke \nthe fifth vertebra in his neck in an automobile accident, which left \nhim partially paralyzed. Determined to walk again, Steven endured \nmonths of extensive therapy sessions, constantly pushing himself to new \nlimits. During this battle, Steven found an inner-strength, a strength \nthat would allow him to fight to empower people with disabilities.\n  Steven's desire to help those with disabilities led him to the PARI \n(People Actively Reaching Independence) Living Center in Pawtucket, RI. \nHe began his career there in 1980 as a volunteer peer counselor and \nthen program director. He was named executive director in 1997.\n  Steven was a crusader in implementing the landmark Americans with \nDisabilities Act of 1990 in Rhode Island's communities. He participated \nin two national training programs on the ADA. The programs were \nconducted by the National Council on Independent Living, Independent \nLiving Research Utilization and the Disability Rights Education and \nDefense Fund under a grant provided by the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission and the U.S. Department of Justice. He also trained and was \ncertified as a Rhode Island state mediator on Titles I, II, and III of \nthe ADA. Steven was a member of countless other state and local boards, \nmaking strong contributions to Rhode Island and its residents.\n  Today my heart is with Steven's family and friends, mourning the loss \nof a great citizen of Rhode Island and our Nation. Steven's dedicated \nservice on behalf of those living with disabilities should serve as \ninspiration for us all to give back to our communities. His life story \nshould serve as a reminder that no matter the obstacles, where there is \na will, there will always be a way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/01/senate-section/article/S1743-5", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1743-S1744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING DR. JOHN C. CHAPMAN\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr President, I rise today to recognize the \nremarkable accomplishments of Dr. John E. Chapman, who is today \nretiring as Dean of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Dr. \nChapman is not only one of the longest-serving deans in medical school \nhistory, but a man who has made a major contribution to medical \neducation in America and around the world.\n  I had the great honor of serving with Dean Chapman from 1986 to 1994 \nwhen I was a member of the Vanderbilt Medical School faculty. Even \nthen, his reputation around campus was legendary--for his compassion \nfor young people, for his scholarship of medicine and history, and for \nhis concern for the future of medical school education--a concern \noverwhelmingly apparent from even the most cursory glance around his \noffice.\n\n[[Page S1744]]\n\n  In addition to a bust of Winston Churchill, whom he met in 1946 when \na national debate competition coincided with the Prime Minister's \nfamous ``Iron Curtain'' speech, it housed a virtual museum of medical \nhistory. But perhaps the greatest evidence of his dedication to \nadvancing the state of American medical education was a small album \nfilled with the photographs of multi-generations of family members--\ngrandfathers, sons and grandsons whose degrees were all conferred by \nDr. Chapman.\n  In all, 3,317 men and women have received a medical degree from the \nman lovingly known as ``the patron saint of medical students.'' And Dr. \nChapman and his wife, Judy, made time for each of them, hosting parties \nfor them at their home, and attending all their many functions to \ncheerlead their cause. Indeed, I'm convinced, Mr. President, that \nVanderbilt's continuous Number One medical school rating based on \nstudent satisfaction would not have been achieved without Dr. Chapman.\n  But Dr. Chapman's influence was not confined to Tennessee. In \naddition to his leadership as the only three-term member of the \nAmerican Medical Association's Council on Medical Education, he chaired \nthe U.S. Medical Licensure Examination Committee--that oversees the \nexamination of all physicians seeking to practice in the United States, \nand was one of only a small handful of physicians to sit on the \ngoverning councils of both the AMA and the Association of American \nMedical Colleges. In 1994, he lent his expertise to the Senate in \ntestimony before this body on the state of medical school funding in \nAmerica.\n  Yet, not content to confine his efforts to one country, he reached \nout even farther, spearheading a medical student exchange program \nbetween Vanderbilt and the prestigious Karolinska Institute in Sweden. \nOther U.S. medical schools, following his lead, soon joined this \nremarkable program, causing the Karolinska Institute to hail his \nefforts as a ``conspicuous contribution to medical education \nworldwide.''\n  John Chapman has come a long way from the boy from the Missouri \nOzarks, who became the man who shook the hand of Winston Churchill in \n1946, to the physician who, in conjunction with Nobel Prize ceremonies \nin Stockholm, Sweden, received an honorary M.D. from the Karolinska \nInstitute, to the medical historian and scholar who represented the AMA \nin hearings before the Senate. But despite his many awards and \naccolades and international recognition, his most remarkable \naccomplishment remains his commitment to students. While the average \ntenure for a medical school dean is five years, Dr. Chapman served his \nstudents five times as long.\n  Yet while he leaves the office of Dean tomorrow after 25 years, he \nwill not leave Vanderbilt, but continue his commitment to students as \nAssociate Vice Chancellor of Alumni Affairs.\n  For more than one quarter of a century, Dr. John Chapman has been a \nbulwark of strength in the often turbulent sea of medicine and medical \neducation. Not only has medical education been his life's work, but \nhe's done it for so long and at such a high level that the magnitude of \nhis contributions to the entire field of medicine is both enormous and \nhistoric.

Karpowich of Springfield, VA, retires as a special \nagent with the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service, (NCIS), \nending some 30 years of Federal law enforcement service.\n  Mr. Karpowich began his service to his country in July 1971, as a \nmember of the U.S. Army's Military Police Corps. Following a brief \nstint as a uniformed officer with the U.S. Capitol Police Force, Mr. \nKarpowich was appointed a special agent with the Naval Investigative \nService, now known as the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, on July \n14, 1975, and embarked on a career that would span more than 25 years. \nHis history of assignments includes South Carolina, California, and in \nWashington, DC, as a field investigator, polygraph examiner, \ncounterintelligence manager, and inspector.\n  Among his many achievements with the Naval Criminal Investigative \nService, Special Agent Karpowich will long be remembered for his \ncontribution to its Polygraph Program. Under his responsible \nleadership, the NCIS Polygraph Program was considered among the finest \nwithin the Department of Defense, and he is credited with modernizing \nthe program with new personnel, equipment and techniques.\n  More recently, Special Agent Karpowich shared the wisdom of his \nexperience with the On-Site Inspection Agency, (OSIA), as the senior \nNCIS representative to its Counterintelligence Staff and lastly as the \nSenior Inspector with the NCIS Headquarters Inspections Directorate, \nseeking to ensure efficiency and integrity within the Service.\n  In closing, I wish to commend David Karpowich for his commitment to \nlaw enforcement and for his many years of outstanding service to our \nnation and, in particular, to the members of our armed services. I wish \nhim and his wife, Connie, Godspeed in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/01/senate-section/article/S1744-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT ON THE STATUS OF FEDERAL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION \n              ACTIVITIES--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 9\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred jointly to the Committees on Appropriations; \nand Judiciary.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 1053 of the Defense Authorization Act of 2001 \n(Public Law 106-398), enclosed is a comprehensive report detailing the \nspecific steps taken by the Federal Government to develop critical \ninfrastructure assurance strategies and outlined by Presidential \nDecision Directive No. 63 (PDD-63).\n  This report was drafted by the previous Administration and is a \nsummary of their efforts as of January 15.

A bill to give gifted and talented students the opportunity \nto develop their capabilities; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing, with nine of \nour colleagues, the Gifted and Talented Students Education Act. It is \nvital\n\n[[Page S1749]]\n\nthat we recognize the nearly three million students in the United \nStates who are talented and gifted and provide them with a challenging \neducation.\n  Our nation depends on students who will become the next generation of \nleaders in business, economics, the sciences, medicine, and education. \nOur lives will be enriched by the next generation of performing and \nfine artists. However, many of our gifted and talented students are not \nbeing challenged to their fullest ability at school and, as a result, \nare not performing at world-class levels. Worse, many of our top \nstudents lose interest in school and abandon their education \naltogether. If these gifted students are not adequately challenged, \nthey will direct their energy and gifts toward destructive and wasteful \nactivities and become a burden to society, instead of the most \nproductive contributors.\n  The Gifted and Talented Students Education Act will help to ensure \nthat gifted and talented students have the opportunity to achieve their \nhighest potential by providing block grants, based on a state's student \npopulation, to state education agencies. These grants will be used to \nidentify and provide educational services to gifted and talented \nstudents from all economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds, including \nstudents with limited English proficiency and students with \ndisabilities. The bill outlines four broad spending areas but leaves \ndecisions on how best to serve these students to states and local \nschool districts. The legislation ensures that the federal money \nbenefits students by requiring the state education agency to distribute \nnot less than 88 percent of the funds to schools and that the funds \nmust supplement, not supplant, funds currently being spent. \nAdditionally, rather than simply accepting federal funds for a new \nprogram, states must make their own commitment to these students by \nmatching 20 percent of the federal funds. The matching requirements \nwill help ensure that programs and services for gifted education \ndevelop a strong foothold in the state.\n  Currently, the only support talented and gifted students receive from \nthe federal government is through the successful research based Javits \nGifted and Talented Students Education Program. One well-known effort \nis Project CUE, a collaborative effort that included the College of New \nRochelle and School District 9 in the South Bronx, which serves \napproximately 32,000 mostly poor and minority students. The program was \ndesigned to institute high-level challenging content for elementary \nschool students, and to identify and nurture those students whose \ninterests and talents could be developed in mathematics and science. \nEvaluation of the project indicated a significant improvement in the \noverall academic achievement of those students identified as \npotentially gifted, as well as increases in school attendance rates. \nFurthermore, the project resulted in a twenty percent improvement \nschool-wide in science and math achievement, as measured in both local \nand statewide standardized tests. Just imagine how ALL talented and \ngifted students could benefit from consistent funding and support to \nimplement programs like the one in the South Bronx.\n  Mr. President, our nation's gifted and talented students are among \nour great untapped resources. We must help states and local school \ndistricts provide a challenging education for these students so their \nparticular gifts can flourish and be fully realized. It is my sincere \nhope that you and the rest of our colleagues will make this commitment \nto talented and gifted students this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Levin, and Ms. \n        Stabenow):\n  S. 422. A bill to provide that, for purposes of certain trade \nremedies, imported semifinished steel slab shall be treated as like or \ndirectly competitive with taconite pellets; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk. This is a \nbill Senator Dayton and I are introducing today, and we are joined by \nSenators Levin and Stabenow.\n  This legislation is a huge priority for Senator Dayton, and it is a \nhuge priority for me. This is not abstract legislation. This is all \nabout people whom we love and in whom we believe. This is about \ntaconite. This is northeast Minnesota, the Iron Rangers. This is about \nour State.\n  Senator Dayton and I are going to divide our time equally. I will \nfollow Senator Dayton.\n  Sometimes when we introduce legislation, it stays on the calendar, \nand other times we introduce legislation because we are determined in \nevery way possible to look for ways to pass it, to work with the \nDepartment of Labor administratively on trade adjustment assistance.\n  We are going to devote all of our efforts jointly to pass legislation \nand get some relief, some assistance for people who are going through \nsuch difficult times. I think our colleagues will support us in this \neffort. I yield the floor to Senator Dayton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Dayton.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today to join with my \nvery distinguished colleague and long-time friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, to introduce with him the Taconite \nWorkers Relief Act of 2001.\n  That this legislation is even needed is a great American tragedy \nbecause this hard and dangerous work of iron ore mining and taconite \nproduction has bred a very special type of person. In Minnesota, we \ncall them Iron Rangers. They are men and women who for generations have \nbeen hard-working, community-building, and patriotic Americans.\n  The bitter irony in the title of this legislation is that these men \nand women do not want relief; they want work. Unfortunately, over the \nlast 20 years, the trade policies of successive administrations have \nthrown thousands of them out of work, and they now threaten to \nextinguish the iron ore mining and taconite-producing industries in \nMinnesota entirely, as well as the basic steel-making industry \nthroughout this country.\n\n  Twenty years ago, this industry employed over 15,000 Minnesotans. \nToday, it is less than 5,000. Over 2,000 workers have been laid off in \nthe last 2 years, and 1,400 of them come from one company, LTV, which \nhas announced it is closing permanently.\n  It is bad enough that U.S. trade policies have allowed, and even \nencouraged, this economic and social devastation which has caused \nimmeasurable and unspeakable human devastation in northeastern \nMinnesota--broken lives, broken homes and families, severe depressions, \neven suicides. Yet adding the grievous offense to these terrible \ntragedies, the U.S. Government has also refused to allow these \ndisplaced workers the benefits, the job training, and other supports \nwhich Congress clearly intended when it passed the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Act.\n  In fact, the U.S. Department of Labor has consistently ruled that \ntaconite pellets were not in direct competition with imports of \nsemifinished steel or slab steel. That view is so ill-informed and \nabsurd that it would be laughable if it were not for the further damage \nit has caused these already seriously harmed men and women. That makes \nsuch rulings inexcusable and trade adjustment assistance denials \ninhumane and even immoral.\n  This legislation would make such denials illegal. It would establish \nthe obvious: that the imports of semifinished steel, in addition to the \ncontinuous import of foreign steel and iron ore, are directly causing \nthese job losses.\n  It establishes that the illegal dumping of these products are within \nthe province of the International Trade Commission which, I might add, \nis proven to be an ineffective protector of Minnesota industries and \nAmerican jobs.\n  This legislation, while needed to provide the assistance these \nworkers need and deserve, is by no means a solution to the much larger \nproblem of protecting this basic industry for the sake of our national \neconomy, for the sake of our national security, and certainly for the \nsake of these dedicated men and women in Minnesota and elsewhere in the \ncountry who want to go to work, who want to earn a living, who want to \ncontribute to the economic strength of this country and who, through \nmisguided policies, are now being denied the opportunity to do so.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Minnesota.\n\n[[Page S1750]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that some \nletters from steelworkers and their families--without using last names, \nBarry, David, Lisa, Cliff, Joanne, and Lenore--be printed in the \nRecord, along with a letter of support from John Swift, who is a \ncommissioner of IRRRB, Jerry Fallos, USWA, which has just been ravaged \nby the LTV shutdown, Vince Lacer, who is mayor of the city of Aurora, \nand Richard Rojeski, USWA Local 2705, Chisholm, MN, along with letters \nfrom Louis Jondreau, Cleveland Cliffs Union Coordinator, and other \nletters of support from other steelworker local presidents throughout \nthe range, along with a letter from David Foster, who is director of \nSteelworker District 11.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To: The Honorable Senator Wellstone and Senator Dayton.\n     From: Barry.\n\n       Gentlemen: I am writing this letter to you in support of \n     receiving Trade Readjustment Allowance for those that have \n     been displaced because of illegally dumped steel. I would \n     like to tell you a little about my situation and myself. I am \n     married with 3 daughters 2 cats and one dog. I am 40 years \n     old, my wife Kathy is 41, my oldest daughter Jamie is 18, \n     Allycia is 13, and my youngest daughter is Alexandra. She \n     likes to be called Alex and is 7 years old. My oldest \n     daughter Jamie is currently going to college, which has also \n     stressed our financial situation. We are determined to get \n     her through college. We live in a little town called Gilbert, \n     MN. I have helped coach Babe Ruth Baseball and am on the \n     United Way board of directors. I feel I do whatever I can to \n     contribute to try to strengthen or support the community. I \n     guess that is why I feel compelled to write to you about our \n     situation.\n       LTV Steel Mining is the company that I used to work for. \n     The reason that I say used to work for is because LTV Steel \n     Corporation has announced that they are permanently closing \n     our plant because they cannot compete with cheap dumped \n     imported steel. There were approximately 1500 full time \n     employees working there. Except for just a handful of \n     employees to shut down the plant, the rest have been laid off \n     including myself.\n       I would hope that you could seriously consider promoting \n     TRA Benefits for those of us that are laid off. When I heard \n     the announcement last spring, I immediately enrolled and took \n     courses at a local junior college. Fall semester came and I \n     went into a 2-year course called Automated Control \n     Technologies. It was a struggle going to school full time, \n     working full time, and trying to spend time with my family. I \n     did it. I guess that I just want to show an example of my \n     sincerity in trying to educate myself for whatever job the \n     future may have for me. I really believe that I need an \n     education now in order to market myself for employment. I am \n     currently in the first year of a 2-year course. I would need \n     one more year to get my diploma. The graduation date would be \n     around June of 2002. I would need a monetary benefit to \n     support my family while I continue my education. Then I \n     promise you that once I finish school, I will be back into \n     the workforce.\n       I know that everything costs money but I believe that this \n     would be a good investment. The human element is the most \n     important factor in this equation. The financial assistance \n     that we need would strengthen our small rural areas and renew \n     our will and spirit. The opportunity to get an education \n     would help us make our transition into another employment \n     area. I am 40 years old and this could be my last chance to \n     be retrained. I am ready to take on the challenge but we need \n     your help. Our fate and future are in your hands. Thank you \n     for taking the time out to listen to me.\n           Sincerely,\n     Barry and Family.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   United Steelworkers of America,\n\n\n                                Local Union 4108, District 11,\n\n                                                       Aurora, MN.\n       Dave and Lisa are both in their mid thirties. They have two \n     daughters, Haley seven and Nadia four. Two years ago Dave \n     injured his back at work and now has a partial permanent \n     disability. Dave was permanently laid off Friday and will \n     start collecting unemployment in two weeks. Dave is only one \n     of hundreds of laid off steelworkers who are in desperate \n     need of retraining. Dave will be out of unemployment and \n     medical benefits in six months.\n       Cliff and Joanne have two teenage children. Cliff has \n     twenty years of service with LTV. Cliff was permanently laid \n     off last week. In six months Cliff will run out of \n     unemployment benefits and will not have any health benefits \n     in one year. Cliff's wife was recently diagnosed with breast \n     cancer, their main concern is health insurance. With the \n     proper retraining, Cliff would be able to get a good job that \n     would help with health insurance.\n       Lenore is a single parent of a teenage son. She was just \n     permanently laid off from LTV. Lenore has a high school \n     education and general labor type skills she acquired from \n     working at the mine. She realizes that without the \n     opportunity to get retrained, she will have a difficult time \n     trying to get a decent paying job.\n       These are just a couple of examples of some of the 1400 \n     people that will be impacted by the shutdown of LTV.\n       As of today 797 employee's have applied for retraining \n     through The Office Of Job Training. There are 189 people that \n     are currently taking some type of retraining classes. The \n     USWA/LTV Career Development Center has paid out over \n     $50,000.00 in tuition assistance and has used up their budget \n     for the entire year already. At the rate the money is being \n     spent we are afraid the entire grant of 2.1 million dollars \n     that the Office Of Job Training received for the LTV workers, \n     will be used up before everyone has an opportunity to use it.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Iron Range Resources &\n\n\n                                         Rehabilitation Board,\n\n                                   Eveleth, MN, February 27, 2001.\n     Hon.

James Oberstar,\n     U.S. Representative, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone, Senator Dayton and Congressman \n     Oberstar: I am writing to endorse the ``Taconite Workers' \n     Relief Act of 2001.'' Our agency believes it is of vital \n     importance that the taconite industry and its workers fully \n     benefit from our trade laws. The ``Taconite Workers' Relief \n     Act'' will enable Minnesota's working families on the Iron \n     Range to gain access to benefits and protections they need, \n     including Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n       Every ton of semi-finished steel displaces 1.3 tons of \n     taconite in basic steel production. With U.S. imports of \n     semi-finished steel at all time highs and their prices at all \n     time lows, some domestic steel producers have turned to \n     dumped imports of steel slab, which has devastated the \n     taconite industry, and thousands of working families in \n     Minnesota. The injury caused by these imports is \n     unquestionable. Last month, production cutbacks ravaged the \n     U.S. iron ore industry: Northshore Mining Company announced \n     that it will cut 700,000 tons of production; U.S. Steel's \n     Minntac plant will cut 450,000 tons; the Hibbing Taconite \n     Company will cut 1.3 million tons of production; and LTV \n     Steel Mining Company closed its mining plant, permanently \n     eliminating 8 million tons of production and 1400 jobs.\n       By all accounts, the taconite industry and its workers are \n     in crisis. We must enact the Taconite Workers Relief Act \n     immediately to protect and strengthen the industry and the \n     communities of northern Minnesota.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       John Swift,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   United Steelworkers of America,\n\n\n                                Local Union 4108, District 11,\n\n                                    Aurora, MN, February 23, 2001.\n       Dear Senators Wellstone, Dayton, and Congressman Oberstar: \n     I'm writing this letter on behalf of the 1200 employee's I \n     represent, that formally worked for LTV Steel Mining Company. \n     I can't begin to tell you how much your bill, the Taconite \n     Workers Relief Act, will mean to our members. As of today 900 \n     employees were placed on permanent layoff. In six months \n     these people will be out of unemployment benefits and a lot \n     of them will be out of Health Benefits.\n       As every one knows the continued flow of imported steel is \n     devastating not only the steel industry, but also the \n     taconite industry. The taconite plants in Minnesota and \n     across the country are in a crisis they may never recover \n     from. With the closure of LTV steel Mining Company and the \n     continued layoffs of miners from the six other mines it is \n     critical to the survival of the Iron Range that this \n     important piece of legislation gets passed. The benefits and \n     protection that would be gained from this, is a critical \n     piece of legislation to keep the people in Northern \n     Minnesota. If this legislation is adopted it will enable the \n     people to get the assistance and retraining they need to get \n     on with their lives. With the help of you and other \n     legislators, we can help prevent what happened in the early \n     80's, when there were massive layoffs across the range, and \n     people lost their homes, and families were torn apart.\n       I know you have always said that our young people are our \n     greatest resource, with this legislation we can keep our \n     young people in Minnesota.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jerry Fallos,\n     President, Local 4108.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               City of Aurora,\n\n                                    Aurora, MN, February 26, 2001.\n     Senator Paul Wellstone,\n     St. Paul, MN.\n       Dear Senators Wellstone and Dayton and Congressman \n     Oberstar: I am writing to endorse the ``Taconite Workers' \n     Relief Act of 2001''.

Dayton and Rep. \n     Oberstar are introducing into the Senate and House of \n     Representatives on the illegal dumping of imports of semi-\n     finished steel into the U.S. market.\n       As you know, in June of 1999, EVTAC Mining laid off approx. \n     150 Bargaining Unit employees because of the illegal dumping \n     of imports of semi-finished steel into the U.S. market. I \n     attempted, thru your office and Rep. Oberstar's office to get \n     TAA/TRA benefits and was denied three (3) different times by \n     the Dept. of Labor because Pellets were considered to be not \n     alike, the same or not in direct competition with the imports \n     of semi-finished steel. At least half of these employees are \n     still in need of these benefits yet today.\n       This law could change this or at least help other employees \n     in the future.\n       I will do everything I can to help you, Sen. Dayton and \n     Rep. Oberstar get this Bill passed.\n       Please feel free to call if I can help.\n           In Solidarity,\n                                                 Samuel H.

The Mesabi Range fueled the industrial \n     development of North America throughout the 20th Century, \n     provided the raw material for the steel that won two world \n     wars, and contributed to building many of the nation's great \n     industrial fortunes. It likewise was typical of the ethnic \n     melting pots that created the archetypal American \n     communities--governed by strong family values, a sense of \n     fair play, self-reliance, and a belief that working together \n     we could shape our own future as we wished.\n       The steelworkers who go to work every day in Minnesota's \n     iron ore mines, drilling, blasting, digging, hauling, \n     crushing, and refining millions of tons of taconite ore still \n     do so under remarkably harsh conditions. Twenty-four hours a \n     day, 365 days a year, working on graveyard shifts in wind \n     chills of 60 degrees below zero in the winter, as their \n     parents, grandparents and great-grandparents did, our members \n     are men and women with stamina and grit. We have always felt \n     capable of standing up for our families and ourselves.\n       But now we need our government to stand up for our jobs and \n     our communities. Without the enactment of federal legislation \n     that prevents the illegal dumping of semi-finished steel \n     products in the U.S. which destroy the market for the iron \n     ore we mine, our jobs will be lost and our communities will \n     die. We need the Taconite Workers' Relief Act to be passed \n     immediately.\n       Thank you for your efforts on our behalf.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David Foster,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              City of Biwabik,\n\n                                                      Biwabik, MN.\n       Dear Senators Wellstone and Dayton and Congressman \n     Oberstar: I am writing to endorse the ``Taconite Workers' \n     Relief Act of 2001.'' We believe it is of vital importance \n     that the taconite industry and its workers fully benefit from \n     our trade laws. The ``Taconite Workers' Relief Act'' will \n     enable Minnesota's working families on the Iron Range to gain \n     access to benefits and protections they need, including Trade \n     Adjustment Assistance.\n       Every ton of semi-finished steel displaces 1.3 tons of \n     taconite in basic steel production. With U.S. imports of \n     semi-finished steel at all time highs and their prices at all \n     time lows, domestic steel producers have turned to dumped \n     imports of steel slab, which has devastated the taconite \n     industry, and thousands of working families in Minnesota. The \n     injury caused by these imports is unquestionable. Last month, \n     production cutbacks ravaged the U.S. iron ore industry: \n     Northshore Mining Company announced that it will cut 700,000 \n     tons of production, U.S. Steel's Minntac plant will cut \n     450,000 tons; Hibbing Taconite Company will cut 1.3 million \n     tons of production; and LTV Steel Mining Company closed its \n     mining plant, permanently eliminating 8 million tons of \n     production and 1400 jobs.\n       As you may or may not know, this not only impacts the \n     direct employees of the taconite industry, but equally as \n     great the families, vendors, schools and communities that are \n     affected by these layoffs, production cutbacks and shutdowns. \n     This is an issue of today, not tomorrow.\n       By all accounts, the taconite industry and its workers are \n     in crisis. We must enact the Taconite Workers' Relief Act \n     immediately to protect and strengthen the industry and the \n     communities of Northern MN.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Steve Bradach,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   United Steelworkers of America,\n\n\n                                                   Local 6115,\n\n                                                     Virginia, MN.\n       To whom it may concern: As a representative of workers at a \n     northern Minnesota mining operation, I feel you should know \n     the devastation on the lives of hard working individuals and \n     their families when our industry is shrinking, because of \n     unfairly traded steel and slabs. The downsizing of the steel \n     industry is a result of unfairly traded imports and we (the \n     mining industry) are doubly hit because of dumped slabs \n     coming into this country. Why won't an administration or law \n     help us or protect us with the same types of laws as the \n     other end of our industry? On behalf of our membership, I \n     would like to express our urgent support of Senator \n     Wellstone's ``Taconite Import Injury Adjustment Act of \n     2001.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Marty Henry,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Upper Peninsula Building\n\n\n                                               Trades Council,\n\n                                 Marquette, MI, February 28, 2001.\n     Re: Taconite Workers Relief Act.\n\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: I want to go on record thanking you \n     for introducing the Taconite Workers Relief Act. You well \n     know the various consequences resulting from the Free Market \n     Free-for-All occurring in the unprotected Steel Industry. Not \n     the least of these consequences are the hardships that come \n     down on the workers and their families who mine iron ore, the \n     basic ingredient in steel production.\n       Those of us who provide construction services to the mines \n     also lose out when the profiteers dump steel, import cheap \n     iron ore, or otherwise take market steps that destroy our \n     basic industries in the united States. Our situation in the \n     Upper Peninsula of Michigan is that workers in the \n     construction industry\n\n[[Page S1752]]\n\n     will also suffer along with mining families as our steel and \n     iron ore industries are decimated by imports of one kind or \n     another.\n       There is another related side issue that bothers me, too. \n     What happens to our national defense capabilities when the \n     United States no longer has the capacity to produce high \n     grade steel, has no iron ore industry remaining, and perhaps, \n     no longer has a friendly relationship with those who produce \n     steel? Would that scenario not invite belligerence from our \n     enemies?\n       Thank you, Senator Wellstone, for your concern for all \n     workers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jon G. LaSalle,\n     Field Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Stand Up For Iron Ore,\n\n                                Ishperning, MI, February 28, 2001.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: I applaud your introduction of the \n     Taconite Workers Relief Act and offer you the full support \n     and encouragement of our organization, Stand Up For Iron Ore. \n     Your legislation will go a long way toward resolving the \n     problems we have come together to work on. As iron ore miners \n     and managers, vendors and suppliers, political and community \n     leaders we all have a stake in ensuring that our industry is \n     treated equally when trade cases are considered.\n       The iron ranges in Michigan and Minnesota have long been \n     integral to that basic foundation of America's industrial \n     might, the steel industry. For over one hundred and fifty \n     years vibrant communities have grown up around the mines. \n     Miners have worked under dangerous, grueling conditions to \n     support their families. Mining companies and employees have \n     paid the taxes that support government efforts Keewatin to \n     Washington.\n       I find it unconscionable that our industry has been ignored \n     as the impact of illegally traded steel has reverberated \n     through the economy. I thank you for attempting to rectify \n     this situation and I will do all I can to assist in rallying \n     support for your efforts.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                       Mike Prusi,\n                                                      Coordinator.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dayton. This Taconite \nWorkers Relief Act that we are introducing is also being introduced in \nthe House of Representatives today by Congressman Oberstar.\n  This legislation has two central objectives. The first is to make \nsure the taconite workers in the Iron Range in Minnesota, and taconite-\nproducing regions in Michigan, are eligible for trade adjustment \nassistance. The second provision says that the taconite industry and \nits workers should be fully brought under trade laws that, if enforced, \nprovide some protection for our working families: section 201 cases, \nantidumping cases, and countervailing duty cases. I would like to take \nthose one at a time.\n  On trade adjustment assistance, I could not be more in agreement with \nmy colleague, Senator Dayton, from Minnesota. The argument that has \nbeen made is that our taconite workers are not in competition with slab \nsteel or semifinished steel and that could not be further from the \ntruth in this highly integrated steel industry. We want to make sure we \nget this trade adjustment assistance to people, and the sooner the \nbetter. This is a matter of lifeline support. This is a matter of \nenabling a worker or workers to go to school, to get additional \ntraining, to have some support, to be able to keep their families \ngoing. It is unconscionable--I think Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, will agree--that taconite workers now are not getting this \nprotection.\n  We will make the direct appeal to Secretary of Labor Chao, who seems \nto me to be a very good person--agree or disagree on policies--because \nI still think, Senator Dayton, that the Department of Labor can \nadministratively provide this support. It has been done before. We hope \nit can be done again. We will make the direct appeal. We will work very \nhard at this administratively.\n  But if we cannot do it that way, we will come out on the floor of the \nSenate with an amendment, with a separate bill--however we best do it--\nto make sure we can get this trade adjustment assistance for taconite \nworkers in Minnesota and in Michigan as well.\n  The other part of it deals with the whole question of trade laws and \nmaking sure for taconite workers--and, for that matter, steelworkers in \ngeneral, because they are not, Senator Dayton, getting the protection \nthey deserve right now--that we really apply section 201 and really \nlook at the whole problem of other countries illegally dumping steel \nand semifinished steel on our market way below the cost of production; \nand our taking action.\n  What is Government for, if not to be on the side of hard-working \npeople. I say to my colleagues, you will not find a stronger work ethic \nor a group of citizens who work harder than those on the Iron Range. \nYou cannot if you go anywhere in the country. The taconite workers fit \neverything we say on the floor of the Senate about what we think is \nimportant about America. They are people who work, work under tough \nconditions, are absolutely committed to supporting their families, and \nthrough no fault of their own they are out of work.\n  So I say to Senator Dayton, and I would like to go back and forth \nwith him in discussion in the time we have, I would say this is a \nshort-run solution and then we will be trying to get to the bottom of \nthis. In the short run, we want to make sure the assistance is there \nfor the taconite workers. This is about survival. This is about \nsupporting people who desperately need the help.\n  The other thing we want to do is get it right on trade on the Iron \nRange in Minnesota, and I am sure the same is true for Michigan. \nFrankly, I think about steelworkers and think about auto workers and I \nthink about industrial workers all across our country. Our workers are \nnot asking for any kind of isolationist policy. Our workers are more \nthan willing to compete in an international economy. But we want trade \nlaws that give us a level playing field.\n  When you have a situation where you have really what amounts to \nillegal dumping of cheap semifinished steel or steel on the market or \nwhen you have children working under deplorable working conditions, \nwith nothing done about that, we have to figure out a way that this new \nglobal economy works for working people--works for working people in \nBrazil, works for working people in Russia, works for working people in \nSouth Korea, but also works for working people in the Iron Range of \nMinnesota and all across our country.\n  We are committed to both fronts. I say to Senator Dayton, initially \nwe want to get this assistance to people right away, immediately. Then \nwe want to get colleagues engaged in this debate on trade policy which \nis so important when it comes to what crucially affects the lives of \npeople.\n  I ask my colleague from Minnesota, if I can, whether he would be \nwilling to reflect with me on the floor of the Senate on some of the \nmeetings he has had in the range, just some of the conversations with \npeople and what this all means to Iron Rangers in personal terms. What \nhas been your experience meeting with steelworkers and others? I ask my \ncolleague that question.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I agree with you, Senator Wellstone. People up there are \nsuffering enormously because of these tragedies. To look in their \nfaces, to see the pain and suffering, to see fathers and mothers who \ncannot support their families, who are losing not only their homes but \ntheir jobs and way of life--as you know, Senator, thousands of people \nfrom across the Iron Range have had to leave the area where they were \nborn, where their families have lived for generations, because they \ncannot find work there.\n  We are losing especially the youngest. In fact, part of a whole \ngeneration of Minnesotans have had to leave the Iron Range because of \nthe lack of job opportunities. The average age of a citizen now in \nnortheastern Minnesota is over the age of 55. Over half the citizens \nwho reside there are senior citizens. This kind of devastation is \nreally unspeakable, unfair, and, as I say, it is a consequence of over \n20 years of what I believe are misguided trade policies.\n  I agree with my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from \nMinnesota, that we should be looking forward to working with the new \nSecretary of Labor, the new ambassador, and the international trade \nambassador. They are not the architects of these policies. Hopefully, \nwith a new administration, we can work together because at least the \ntrade adjustment assistance benefits, the program itself--this is \nclearly, precisely what was intended by Congress when it was passed. It \nis just unconscionable that it has not been provided administratively \nalready.\n  I agree with you that should be an option. But in the broader context \nof these policies, before these industries are wiped out in the United \nStates, I\n\n[[Page S1753]]\n\nhope the administration will take a serious look at them. I yield back \nto my colleague.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, he is absolutely right. There \nhave been a number of meetings I have been at and I know the same \napplies to Senator Dayton. I can remember one. It was right before \nChristmas. It was a meeting in Aurora. There were a lot of people \nthere, a lot of the steelworkers, taconite workers, and also some of \ntheir families. I was asking people, besides legislation, what else can \nbe done? This is the first time this has ever happened in the Iron \nRange, at least in the 20 or 25 years I have been up there. Senator \nDayton, this one fairly young worker stood up and he said: We need help \nfor Christmas presents.\n\n  I never heard that before. When people were working, they made good \nwages and had health care benefits. Now they are worried about \npresents.\n  On the other issue that we are going to come up with, I don't know \nwhat the position of the administration will be. I think the Clinton \nadministration was not strong enough at all. I am very skeptical about \nwhere the Bush administration is going to go, but we are going to push \nvery hard, and where we can cooperate with them, we will do so; no \nquestion about it.\n  One of the terrible issues when we get to the bankruptcy bill soon is \nthat for younger workers, next to losing their jobs, the next worst \nthing is health care. You are losing your job, but then you are scared \nto death about what is going to happen to health care coverage with \nyour children.\n  For the younger workers who have been laid off in the case of the LTV \nmine shutting down, in a few months, they lose their health benefits; \nfor the older workers who have worked a little longer, 1 year.\n  Maybe the Senator would want to respond to this.\n  Then there are the retirees. What I heard from the retirees was they \nare terrified LTV will file for chapter 7 and walk away from any health \ncare. A lot of those retirees--too many I think--are struggling with \ncancer.\n  Did the Senator find that people were talking about health care as \nwell when he met with them, and does he think that is yet another issue \nwe ought to focus on?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I agree with Senator Wellstone. He points \nto a couple of other failures of our society. As he said, there is a \nlack of health coverage for families when someone loses their job \nthrough no choice or fault of their own. That is one of the great \ntravesties of this situation. It takes what is an already awful \nsituation and makes it even more destructive to an individual. It is \nbad enough when people can't afford Christmas presents, but then they \ncannot afford to take their child to a doctor and cannot afford to have \ntheir own health problems diagnosed on a timely basis. When they cannot \nafford to get surgery, then it becomes a problem this country and \nsociety should not allow.\n  I underscore the Senator's point that he made a short while ago. \nThere was a janitor's position that opened up to take care of all sorts \nof restrooms and everything else in one of the county buildings and, \nthat paid less than $7 an hour. There were over 300 applicants for that \none position.\n  It underscores again how hard it is for people who want to work and \nare willing to work at anything rather than take a handout and relief.\n  It is basic humanity to offer assistance.\n  Again, I hope to work with the Senator so that we can pass this \nlegislation. The administration must acknowledge their failure to \nprovide assistance to the men and women of the Iron Range who want to \ncontribute to the economic strength of this country.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I look forward to working with my \ncolleague, Senator Dayton, on this. I think two Senators from the same \nState who care deeply about people who are really hurting and who love \nnortheastern Minnesota are going to give this every bit of effort. I am \nreally looking forward to working with the Senator on this. I so much \nwant to help people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nfrom Michigan and Minnesota in sponsoring the Taconite Workers Relief \nAct of 2001. This is an important piece of legislation for the future \nof our States' taconite iron ore mines and their employees which are \nfacing a severe import crisis that is threatening to put them out of \nbusiness. Enactment of this legislation will simply allow an industry \nproviding a key input into finished steel to use existing trade laws to \nfight back against harmful import surges and dumped steel as other \nsectors of the steel industry may currently do under existing trade \nlaw.\n  Taconite, iron ore, is an input into basic steel production and is \ndisplaced when semi-finished steel slab are imported. For example, one \nton of semi-finished steel displaces 1.3 tons of iron ore in basic \nsteel production.\n  Unfairly traded steel imports are overwhelming U.S. production, \nthreatening to endanger both our national defense and manufacturing \nbase. Recently, steel producers have found it cheaper to import semi-\nfinished steel slabs than to make it themselves using iron ore from \nMichigan's Upper Peninsula and Minnesota. Unfortunately, if our \ntaconite mines are overwhelmed by cheap imports and driven to \nbankruptcy, we will lose our capacity to make steel without depending \non foreign sources of semi-finished steel. In effect, if we lose our \ntaconite mining industry, we lose our domestic integrated steel \nmanufacturing capabilities. For national security reasons, I don't \nthink that is something we want to do.\n  This crisis particularly impacts Michigan and Minnesota. The taconite \niron ore mines located there are a foundation of the economies in the \ncommunities where they are located. To make matters worse, the iron ore \nindustry faces a unique problem in trying to combat these harmful and \nunfair trade practices. Although its workers are losing their jobs to \ncheap and probably illegally dumped imports, they cannot fight back \nusing our trade laws that were specifically designed to deal with these \nsituations.\n  This is because of how our trade laws have been interpreted in the \npast and the failure to recognize the U.S. iron ore industry's standing \nto file import relief cases against foreign producers of semi-finished \nsteel. For example, under previous interpretations of U.S. trade laws, \niron ore is not considered an article that is ``like or directly \ncompetitive'' with an imported article that is found to be a \nsubstantial cause of serious injury, or threat, to the domestic \nindustry, even though it is a key input in making finished steel. This \nis clearly an oversight that should be corrected. The bill we are \nintroducing today will achieve that goal.\n  This legislation would ensure that the taconite industry and its \nemployees fully benefit from the protection of section 201, anti-\ndumping and countervailing duties laws as well as making its displaced \nemployees eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance. It does this by \ndesignating Taconite pellets as ``like or directly competitive with \nsemi-finished steel slab'' for the purposes of eligibility for TAA and \nSection 201 remedies. It also would consider imported semi-finished \nsteel slab eligible for countervailing duties, CVD, which are duties \nintended to provide relief to a domestic industry, taconite, that has \nbeen injured by subsidized imports, such as semi-finished steel, and \nfor anti- dumping remedies.\n  I hope the Senate will recognize the fairness in giving parity to a \ncritical sector of the steel industry that has been overlooked in the \npast and should not be forgotten now. There is too much at stake to let \nthis industry go under.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 423. A bill to amend the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the \nestablishment of Fort Clatsop National Memorial in the State of Oregon, \nand for other purposes''; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Fort \nClatsop National Memorial Expansion Act of 2001 with my friends and \ncolleagues, Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon and Senator Patty Murray \nfrom Washington.\n  The Fort Clatsop Memorial marks the spot where Meriwether Lewis, \nWilliam Clark, and the Corps of Discovery\n\n[[Page S1754]]\n\nspent 106 days during the winter of 1805. The bicentennial of their \nhistoric journey is fast approaching. It is estimated that over a \nquarter-million people will visit the memorial during the bicentennial \nyears of 2003 though 2006. Despite this anticipated influx of visitors, \nthe memorial is legally limited to be no larger than 130 acres. This \nlegislation would authorize a boundary expansion of the memorial up to \n1500 acres and will therefore help accommodate the increasing number of \nvisitors expected during the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial. The bill \nalso authorizes a study of the national significance of Station Camp, \nanother Lewis and Clark stopping point in 1805, located in Washington \nState.\n  Since the 1980s, the United States Park Service in Astoria, OR has \nbeen negotiating with Willamette Industries to acquire approximately \n928 acres for the expansion of the Ft. Clatsop National Memorial. These \nacres are integral to the interpretation and enjoyment of the \nmemorial's historic site. The Park Service and Willamette Industries \nhave reached an agreement that will enable the Park Service to acquire \nthis property. However, this legislation is necessary to authorize the \nexpansion of the memorial's boundary before any additional lands can be \nacquired.\n  The Park Service has targeted the expansion of the Fort Clatsop \nMemorial as one of its highest priorities. The Clatsop County \nCommission supports this legislation, as do the local landowners in and \naround the memorial. In addition, I have heard from the National Parks \nand Conservation Association NPCA, the Trust for Public Lands, and the \nConservation Fund, all of whom support this effort to expand the Ft. \nClatsop Memorial.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation \nbecause the protection of this important American historic area will \nenable us to illustrate the story of Oregon and America's western \nexpansion for all who visit this special place. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 423\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fort Clatsop National \n     Memorial Expansion Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1805, the members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition \n     built Fort Clatsop at the mouth of the Columbia River near \n     Astoria, Oregon, where they spent 106 days waiting for the \n     end of winter and preparing for their journey home. The Fort \n     Clatsop National Memorial was created by Congress in 1958 for \n     the purpose of commemorating the culmination, and the winter \n     encampment, of the Lewis and Clark Expedition following its \n     successful crossing of the North American continent, and is \n     the only National Park Service site solely dedicated to the \n     Lewis and Clark expedition.\n       (2) The 1995 General Management Plan for the Fort Clatsop \n     National Memorial, prepared with input from the local \n     community, calls for the addition of lands to the memorial to \n     include the trail used by expedition members to travel from \n     the fort to the Pacific Ocean and to include the shore and \n     forest lands surrounding the fort and trail to protect their \n     natural settings.\n       (3) The area near present day McGowan, Washington where \n     Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery camped after \n     reaching the Pacific Ocean, performed detailed surveying, and \n     conducted the historic ``vote'' to determine where to spend \n     the winter, is of undisputed national significance.\n       (4) The National Park Service and State of Washington \n     should identify the best alternative for adequately and cost \n     effectively protecting and interpreting the ``Station Camp'' \n     site.\n       (5) Expansion of the Fort Clatsop National Memorial would \n     require Federal legislation because the size of the memorial \n     is currently limited by statute to 130 acres.\n       (6) Congressional action to allow for the expansion of Fort \n     Clatsop for both the trail to the Pacific and, possibly, the \n     Station Camp site would be both timely and appropriate before \n     the start of the national bicentennial celebration of the \n     Lewis and Clark Expedition planned to take place during the \n     years 2004 through 2006.\n\n     SEC. 3. ACQUISITION OF LANDS FOR FORT CLATSOP NATIONAL \n                   MEMORIAL.\n\n       The act entitled ``An Act to provide for the establishment \n     of Fort Clatsop National Memorial in the State of Oregon, and \n     for other purposes'', approved May 29, 1958 (Chapter 158; 72 \n     Stat. 153), is amended--\n       (a) by inserting in section 2 ``(a)'' before ``The \n     Secretary''.\n       (b) by inserting in section 2 a period, ``.'', following \n     ``coast'' and by striking the remainder of the section.\n       (c) by inserting in section 2 the following new \n     subsections:\n       ``(b) The Memorial shall also include the lands depicted on \n     the map entitled `Fort Clatsop Boundary Map', numbered and \n     dated `405-80016-CCO-June-1996'. The area designated in the \n     map as a `buffer zone' shall not be developed but shall be \n     managed as a visual buffer between a commemorative trail that \n     will run through the property, and contiguous private land \n     holdings.\n       ``(c) The total area designated as the Memorial shall \n     contain no more than 1,500 acres.''\n       (d) by inserting at the end of section 3 the following:\n       ``(b) Such lands included within the newly expanded \n     boundary may be acquired from willing sellers only, with the \n     exception of corporately owned timberlands.''\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF STUDY OF STATION CAMP.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior shall conduct a study of the \n     area known as ``Station Camp'' near McGowan, Washington, to \n     determine its suitability, feasibility, and national \n     significance, for inclusion into the National Park System. \n     The study shall be conducted in accordance with Section 8 of \n     Public Law 91-383 (16 U.S.C. 1a-5).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 424. A bill to provide incentives to encourage private sector \nefforts to reduce earthquake losses, to establish a national disaster \nmitigation program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, my thoughts go out today to the people \nof Washington as they assess the damage and begin recovery from the \nearthquake there yesterday afternoon.\n  Yesterday's event is a reminder that earthquakes are a national \nproblem, and one that can strike at any time, without warning.\n  It is in this light that I introduce, today, the Earthquake Loss \nReduction Act of 2001. This bill provides incentives to encourage \nresponsible state and local governments, individuals, and businesses to \ninvest in damage prevention measures before an earthquake strikes. It \nis an ``ounce of prevention'' that will save the federal treasury, \nhomeowners, businesses, and state and local governments the ``pound of \ncure'' for relief and recovery.\n  The legislation builds on the excellent work of our nation's earth \nscientists and engineers by making implementation of loss reduction \nmeasure a federal priority. We know where earthquake hazards exist, \nwhich buildings and utility and transportation systems are most \nvulnerable, and what the consequences will be to public safety, \ncommunity character, and our economy if an earthquake strikes. We also \nknow how to reduce losses. Guidelines exist that provide rational, \ncommon sense approaches to upgrade weak facilities.\n  The challenge as we enter the 21st century is to put this knowledge \nto work to reduce future losses, and improving the safety of Americans \nand the performance of privately and publicly owned buildings and \nfacilities. The time to implement our knowledge is now.\n  There is no question that mitigation efforts save dollars and lives \nin the long run. It worries me greatly that the President, in his \nBudget, proposes a cut to existing mitigation efforts.\n  First, the President proposes eliminating the Project Impact program. \nProject Impact is the nation's premier disaster prevention initiative. \nCommunities use Project Impact funds to retrofit hospitals and schools, \nto create flood barriers, and to help shore-up communities against any \nnumber of other possible natural disasters.\n  California has eight Project Impact communities, and has used Project \nImpact funds to stabilize emergency facilities and other important \nstructures. Local communities do not always have the resources to \nmitigate these facilities on their own.\n  There are two other proposals in President Bush's budget that are \ncause for alarm.\n  1. The President's budget outline assumes $83 million in FEMA savings \nby including a public buildings disaster insurance requirement, phased \nin over three years. This provision would mean that public entities \nlike the U.C. system would have to have insurance on ALL structures \nbefore they could apply for federal assistance in the event of a \ndisaster.\n  This proposal simply is not feasible for states like California. \nInsurance companies in California do not offer\n\n[[Page S1755]]\n\ndisaster insurance or, specifically, earthquake insurance.\n  It will be interesting to see how the cities affected by the \nWashington earthquake would be affected by this rule. Insurance \ncompanies in Washington do offer earthquake insurance and will be \npaying-out over the coming months. It will be interesting to see if the \ninsurers are able to withstand the costs.\n  2. The budget also proposes reducing from 75 percent to 50 percent \nthe federal share of funding for hazard mitigation grants. Once again, \nthis is simply not feasible in California. California public \ninstitutions would not be able to afford 50 percent of clean-up costs \nafter a major earthquake. It would be difficult for them to pay even 25 \npercent, which is current law.\n  These two provisions could cause my State, and others, great harm if \nenacted. I am prepared to fight them, and I will.\n  The United States Geological Survey tells us there are 40 states and \nfive territories with a moderate or higher earthquake risk. Entire \nmetropolitan areas in these states and territories are at risk of being \ncrippled by earthquake damage because existing buildings and \ninfrastructure were built without appropriate seismic requirements.\n  Areas lying outside ``earthquake zones'' are also affected. Even \nlocalized damage threatens complex economic systems and the magnitude \nof federal disaster aid. Let me give you a few examples of potential \nlosses estimated by FEMA's regional earthquake loss estimation model, \nHAZUS.\n  A magnitude of 7.0 earthquake on California's Newport-Inglewood fault \nrunning through the Los Angeles basin could cause an estimated $80 \nbillion in losses. Damage to buildings and business interruption would \naffect Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, and San \nDiego Counties. About 58 percent of the damage would be to residential \nbuildings, displacing about 400,000 people. An estimated 100,000 people \nwould need shelter.\n  A magnitude 7.0 earthquake on the Hayward fault running along the \neast side of the San Francisco Bay could cause about $37 billion in \ndamage. About 56 percent of the damage would be to residential \nbuildings, displacing about 140,000 people. More than half of the \nlosses would stem from damage to wood-frame homes and small business \nbuildings.\n  A magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Border Ranges fault near Anchorage, \nAK could cause about $5 billion in losses. Anchorage, a city of about \n260,000 people, would suffer most of the damage. More than 60 percent \nof the damage would be to wood-frame buildings serving as homes and \nsmall businesses.\n  A magnitude 7.2 earthquake on the Wasatch fault on the east side of \nSalt Lake City could cause about $13 billion in losses to the eight \ncounties in that region. Most of the damage, about $11 billion, would \noccur in Salt Lake County. Throughout the region, about 150,000 people \nwould be displaced, nearly 38,000 would require shelter, and nearly $10 \nbillion of the losses would result from damage and disruption to \nresidential buildings.\n  As large as these estimates seem, the actual losses could be even \ngreater. Make no mistake, earthquakes will strike these regions and \nothers, we just do not know when. In each estimate, over half of the \nlosses are expected to come from residential buildings. Most vulnerable \nresidential buildings can be upgraded for reasonable levels of \nexpenditures. The incentives proposed in this bill could make it \nhappen.\n  While it is too early to determine the extent of the damage of \nyesterday's earthquake in Washington, taking a look at the losses from \nthe 1994 earthquake in Northridge, CA. The direct losses from that \nquake totaled more than $44 billion. For all disasters declared since \n1989, FEMA has paid nearly $28 billion in disaster assistance for \nrepairs to public buildings and infrastructure and for humanitarian \naid. FEMA's outlay for Northridge alone represents 25 percent of this \n12-year aggregate figure, approximately $7 billion.\n  You and I know that supplemental relief funds disrupt carefully \nplanned budget decisions and undermine on-going programs. For some \npeople, reducing recurring demands for federal disaster aid may be \nreason enough to support this bill, but there are more compelling \nreasons.\n  The cost and consequences of earthquakes are painful to the victims, \nboth individuals and businesses. The plight of those in the disaster \narea may be obvious, but the effects extend outside of the disaster \narea, often across state borders affecting those who depend on damaged \nbusinesses and affected customers. The American economy depends on \nclosely linked businesses, suppliers of raw materials and components, \nmanufacturers, transporters, and marketers. Worldwide competitors seek \nthe market share of American business when a disaster disrupts our \neconomy.\n  Research from the Northridge earthquake indicates that even when \nbusinesses did not suffer direct damage in that quake, their presence \nin or near areas of wide-spread damage or disruption caused economic \nhardship. Economic losses can be large and have long-term effects on \nthe future of businesses and regions. Simply put, earthquake loss \nreduction efforts improve the sustainability of American businesses.\n  What we need is a widespread investment in loss reduction by many \nparties, not just the federal government. Responsibility for earthquake \nsafety rests with state and local government, individuals, and \ncompanies. The federal role I advocate is one of leadership backed by \nincentives to inform and motivate those responsible to implement loss-\nreduction actions. The result I seek is reduced pain and suffering, and \nmore sustainable communities and businesses.\n  The Federal Government is already contributing to earthquake disaster \nprevention. In a little over twenty years, our National Earthquake \nHazard Reduction Program has sponsored research and development \nactivities in earth sciences and engineering and has produced the \nknowledge and tools, such as the HAZUS estimates I noted earlier, we \nneed to reduce our risk. If we are to reduce losses, however, we must \nput this knowledge to work.\n  Reducing earthquake losses depends on the actions of millions of \nindividual decision-makers, homeowners, business owners, and government \nofficials. Many successful measures are easy to implement, but may seem \nexpensive when considering competing demand for funds between immediate \nissues and the perceived low probability threat of an earthquake. The \nincentives in this bill provide good reasons to undertake loss \nreduction efforts. This bill will move knowledge from the laboratory to \nthe community. The bill recognizes that shared responsibility for \nprevention means that those responsible for the facilities at risk \naccept responsibility for reducing the risk.\n  This legislation does the following:\n  1. It provides a credit against federal income taxes equal to 50 \npercent of a homeowner's investment in seismic retrofit, not to exceed \n$6,000.\n  2. It provides businesses an opportunity to depreciate the cost of \nseismic retrofit over five years.\n  3. The bill defines a seismic retrofitting bond as a bond for which \n95 percent of the proceeds are used for seismic retrofitting \nexpenditures or used to finance loans to borrowers for seismic \nretrofitting expenditures as ``qualified bonds.''\n  4. It encourages private investments in seismic retrofitting of \nresidential properties by allowing deduction of passive activity \nlosses.\n  5. The legislation provides mortgage insurance incentives for seismic \nretrofitting of residences.\n  6. It authorizes a $1 billion Loss Reduction Trust Fund to provide \nmatching grants for mitigation measures and recovery planning grants to \nreduce damage to buildings and utility and transportation systems \ncritical to disaster response. Provided to local government entities, \npublic and private hospitals, institutions of higher education, and \nspecial districts, the trust fund grants would require that the state \nand the local entity recipients benefitting from the investment fund a \nportion of the cost. To be eligible, the local entities must also have \nin place a long-term strategic earthquake loss reduction plan and \nenforce land use, building code, and other measures to reduce the \nvulnerability of facilities in the jurisdiction.\n  7. And the bill authorizes establishment of the Advanced National \nSeismic Research and Monitoring System\n\n[[Page S1756]]\n\nby the United States Geological Survey.\n  The incentives offered in this bill are available only if the \nrecipient, sometimes with state aid, invests in the effort to prevent \nlosses. These investments will spawn meaningful loss prevention actions \nthat will benefit all of the stakeholders involved and will reduce the \nneed for disaster aid.\n  Public/private partnership work:\n  City of Berkeley, CA, has demonstrated that even small incentives \nwork. This city of 109,000 people spends about $1 million each year in \nhazard reduction activities. It rebates a portion of its real estate \ntransfer tax, up to $1,500, to homeowners for loss reduction actions, \nwaives permit fees for seismic residential retrofit projects, and \noffers low income loans up to $15,000 and some grants to low income \nsenior and disabled homeowners for retrofit work.\n  In the 10 ears since these incentives were put in place, 38 percent \nof the single-family homes have had some form of retrofit work done and \n30 percent of small apartment buildings have been improved.\n  Berkeley has also passed seven special taxes that concentrate funding \non pre-disaster mitigation.\n  Federal incentives can empower similar results nationwide. Cities \nlike Berkeley, where the earthquake threat is a critical community \nconcern, will benefit from the additional inducements included in this \nbill.\n  Preventing damage makes sense, and it benefits our nation in many \nways besides reducing the need for disaster aide. Not all benefits are \neasily quantified because they accrue to a variety of stakeholders and \nmany of the indirect and human effects are subtle, yet important.\n  Earthquakes impact all segments of the communities they strike, \nindividuals, businesses, and public services such as police, fire, \nhospitals, and schools. Damage often creates economic ripples \nthroughout the community and beyond state borders. Homeowners, building \nowners, their tenants, neighboring businesses, local and state \ngovernment, and the Federal Government will benefit.\n  Let me give you three examples of loss reduction projects that have \nwidespread benefits:\n  1. Water officials in Memphis, TN recently made the wise decision to \ninvest in a structural upgrade of the Davis Water Pumping station. \nStrengthening this critical station cost about $488,000.\n  What the officials at the Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division \nrecognize is that there is a fifty-fifty chance that a moderate \nearthquake will strike the Memphis area within the next fifteen years. \nIt would cost $17 million to replace the water pumping station after \nsuch an earthquake. Plus, every day the station is inoperable costs \nabout $1.4 million in lost services.\n  The loss of drinkable water affects the entire community and cripples \nbusiness activity. Considering the time to repair or replace a damaged \npump facility, it is estimated that the cost of lost services would be \n$112 million. Clearly, a $488,000 investment is a good one.\n  The Loss Reduction Trust Fund established by this bill authorizes $1 \nbillion in matching grants to strengthen critical infrastructure like \nthe Davis Water Pumping Station.\n  2. Another good example of forward thinking is the Anheuser-Busch \nbrewery in Los Angeles. After realizing its facilities were vulnerable \nto earthquake damage, the company began a $20 million program to \nretrofit critical buildings and equipment. The brewery is a critical \ncompany asset because it supplies the Southwest and Pacific regions. \nAlthough located only a few miles from the epicenter of the 1994 \nNorthridge earthquake, the brewery was able to return to operation \nafter just minor cleanup, repairs, and restoration of off-site water \nsupply.\n  Anheuser-Busch estimated that damage and business interruption costs \ncould have exceeded $300 million after the Northridge quake, had it not \nstrengthened its facilities. There was more at stake than the viability \nof a major business. Damage affects employees, federal, state, and \nlocal government income, suppliers, vendors, and the surrounding \ncommunity.\n  By accelerating depreciation of seismic retrofit expenses, this bill \nwill encourage other businesses to carry out similar projects.\n  3. And there is another example from the Northridge earthquake. Three \nmonths before that quake, a homeowner in the Hollywood area of Los \nAngeles spent $3,200 to retrofit his 1911-vintage home. The house \nsurvived with only minor damage, while similar houses on the same block \nsuffered severe damage. In fact, several of those neighboring homes \nwere demolished by the earthquake.\n  Many homes across the nation are built on poorly braced foundation \nwalls or piers and posts and are vulnerable to damage during even mild \nearthquake activity. The cost to add the bracing needed generally is \nonly a few thousand dollars, yet the cost of repairing a home after it \nfalls is tens of thousands of dollars. As with a business, when a home \ntopples, there is more at stake than injury to family members and the \ncost of repairs. Not to mention the fact that a falling home can spark \na fire that can burn an entire community.\n  This bill creates a tax credit for half of the cost of the seismic \nretrofit of a residence, makes mortgages for earthquake resistant homes \nmore attractive than those for homes meeting lower standards, and makes \nit easier for local government to use general obligation bonds \nfinancing for loss prevention project loans.\n  FEMA's HAZUS software was recently used to estimate how the \nindividual actions provided by the bill could add up to significant \nsavings of importance to our communities, economy, and governments.\n  If a magnitude 7.0 earthquake occurred on the Newport-Inglewood fault \nunder Los Angeles today, it could cause about $80 billion in damages. \nThousands of businesses would be interrupted, 400,000 people would be \ndisplaced, and there would be several hundred deaths. If every existing \nbuilding in that area were retrofitted to the standards in current \ncodes, the losses would drop by $28 billion to $52 billion. Business \ninterruption losses would drop from $15 billion to less than $6 \nbillion. The number of people displaced would shrink to 93,000, and the \nestimated number of deaths would drop by over 90 percent.\n  Similarly, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on the Hayward fault in the San \nFrancisco Bay area would cause about $37 billion in damages, if it \nstruck today. 140,000 people would be displaced. However, if every \nexisting building were retrofitted to the standards in current codes, \nthe losses would be reduced by a third. Business interruption losses \nwould drop from $6.5 billion to about $2 billion. The number of people \ndisplaced would shrink to 40,000 and the estimated deaths would drop by \nmore than 90 percent.\n  Assuming that all buildings meet the latest seismic standards is \nambitious, but the resulting estimates give convincing evidence that \nimplementing loss reduction measures can pay handsome dividends.\n  Moreover, the importance of loss reduction efforts extends beyond \nthese quantitative estimates. Less damage means less psychological \npain, more sustainable communities and businesses, protected stocks of \nlow-income housing and architecturally and historically significant \nbuildings and neighborhoods, and protected family savings. Every time a \nneighbor, employer, or local government invests in prevention, the \nentire community benefits.\n  Earthquakes are a nationwide problem. They have struck the Northeast \nand Northwest, damaged Charleston, Saint Louis, and Memphis, struck our \nmountain states, Alaska, and Hawaii. They will strike these and other \nplaces again.\n  Much of the knowledge we need to reduce losses from future \nearthquakes exists. While some forward thinking businesses, \nindividuals, and local governments are already using the knowledge to \ninvest in measures to reduce future losses, the Earthquake Loss \nReduction Act creates modest federal incentives to foster a needed \nincrease in the implementation of hazard mitigation measures.\n  This bill also establishes a $1 billion grant program to match the \ninvestments from local government entities, hospitals, and institutions \nof higher education. It challenges states to add to this match, and \nmakes investment in properties for the purpose of seismic retrofit an \nattractive investment in\n\n[[Page S1757]]\n\nour future. While the occurrence of large-scale earthquakes may be \nperceived as a low probability, our experience shows the high \nconsequence of these events.\n  Strong federal leadership, and modest incentive, can lead Americans \nto undertake loss reduction measures and can lead us to a safer \ntomorrow. I urge my colleagues to support the Earthquake Loss Reduction \nAct.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 424\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Earthquake Loss Reduction \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) After 23 years of research funded by the National \n     Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, a substantial body of \n     knowledge exists about earth sciences, geotechnical, and \n     structural engineering and human behavior relating \n     earthquakes.\n       (2) The foremost challenge as we enter the 21st century is \n     putting this knowledge to work by reducing future losses to \n     improve the safety of Americans and the performance of State \n     and local government facilities and private buildings and \n     facilities.\n       (3) Earthquakes and tsunamis cause great danger to human \n     life and property throughout the United States and continue \n     to threaten Americans significantly in over 40 States and \n     territories.\n       (4) Too few States and local communities have sufficiently \n     identified and assessed their risk and implemented adequate \n     measures to reduce losses from such disasters and to ensure \n     that their critical public infrastructure and facilities will \n     continue to function after the disaster.\n       (5) Too much of the Nation's stocks of housing and \n     commercial buildings remain inherently vulnerable to \n     earthquake shaking. Future losses in these facilities can be \n     lessened using currently feasible technology.\n       (6) Too much of local government infrastructure remain at \n     risk and are likely to be non-functional in the aftermath of \n     foreseeable earthquake events at the time when the services \n     they provide are critically necessary.\n       (7) Federal, State and local government expenditures for \n     disaster assistance and recovery have increased without \n     commensurate reduction in the likelihood of future losses \n     from such earthquakes.\n       (8) Feasible techniques for reducing future earthquake \n     losses are readily available.\n       (9) Without economic incentives, it is unlikely that States \n     and local communities and the public will be able to \n     implement available measures to reduce losses and ensure \n     continued functionality of their infrastructure.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a \n     national disaster mitigation program that --\n       (1) reduces the loss of life and property, human suffering, \n     economic disruption, and disaster assistance costs resulting \n     from earthquakes;\n       (2) offers financial incentives to encourage private sector \n     efforts to reduce earthquake losses;\n       (3) provides matching finds to encourage and assist States \n     and local governments and the private sector in their efforts \n     to implement measures designed to ensure the continued \n     functionality of public infrastructure, commerce, and \n     habitation after earthquakes; and\n       (4) creates Federal, State and local government \n     partnerships to reduce the vulnerability of public \n     infrastructure, commercial enterprises, and residential \n     buildings to earthquakes.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge \nin the State of Colorado, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nalong with my good friend and Colorado colleague, Senator Ben \nNighthorse Campbell, to permanently designate Rocky Flats as a National \nWildlife Refuge following the cleanup and closure of the site.\n  This legislation is the beginning of a new chapter in the history of \nRocky Flats. The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act is the \nproduct of more than a year's worth of work by citizens, community \nleaders, and local elected officials. Its passage will ensure our \nchildren and grandchildren will continue to enjoy the wildlife and open \nspace that currently exists at Rocky Flats.\n  To that end, I have worked in a bi-partisan manner with my Colorado \ncolleague from the other body, Congressman Mark Udall, to produce the \nRocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2001. This bill was \noriginally introduced in November of 2000, and with a few refinements, \nis being reintroduced today in both the Senate and House. Also, this \nbill could not be possible without the hard work and dedication of the \nlocal governments and the Rocky Flats stakeholders.\n  My vested interest in Rocky Flats began during the 1980's when I was \nthe Chairman of the State Senate Committee on Health, Environment, \nWelfare and Institutions. Although I supported the national security \nmission of the Rocky Flats site prior to closure, I believe that the \nDepartment of Energy must also ensure the safety and health of all \nColoradans and the environment. When the Rocky Flats site was shut down \nin 1990, cleaning up and closing of the site became one of my top \nlegislative priorities and will remain so until this project is \ncomplete.\n  In 1999, I became the Strategic Subcommittee Chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, which has direct oversight of former DoE \nweapons facilities including Rocky Flats. This is the first site in the \nDoE complex to receive funding for cleanup and closure, and will \ntherefore be a role model for other sites in the complex. As Chairman \nof the Subcommittee, I will continue to work closely with my colleagues \nto educate them on the importance of cleaning up and closing down Rocky \nFlats so it can be utilized as a National Wildlife Refuge. This \neducation extends beyond the cleanup and closure of Rocky Flats to the \nimportance of cleaning up and closing of all the former DoE weapons \nsites and how all closure sites in the DoE complex are closely tied \ntogether. That is why it is important for everyone in Congress with a \nclosure site to work together in a non-partisan manner for the good of \nthe country. We also need to work close with our new Secretary of \nEnergy, Spencer Abraham, to ensure that cleanup and closure remain a \npriority for DoE.\n  As a brief summary of the bill, I would like to bring to your \nattention a few of the following high points of the bill:\n  To begin, Rocky Flats will remain in permanent federal ownership \nthrough a transfer from the Department of Energy to the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service after the cleanup and closure of the site is complete.\n  The historic Lindsay Ranch will be preserved for future generations.\n  There will be no annexation of land to any local government, nor any \nconstruction of through roads. The only roads that may be constructed \non the site would be by the Fish and Wildlife Service for the \nmanagement of the refuge.\n  The Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of the Interior are \nauthorized to grant a transportation right-of-way on the eastern \nboundary of the site for transportation improvements along Indiana \nStreet. Please note, however, that we are aware of the continued \nevaluation of this issue and want this section of the bill to be \nconsistent with the needs of the local governments.\n  The Department of Energy and the Fish and Wildlife Service are to \nenter into a Memorandum of Understanding addressing administrative \nresponsibilities prior to the transfer of the site not later than 1 \nyear after the enactment of this Act.\n  The Department of Energy will not transfer any property to the Fish \nand Wildlife Service that must be retained for future onsite monitoring \nor that must be retained for protection of human health and safety. \nThis legislation also clarifies that in the event of future cleanup \nactivities, this action will take priority over wildlife management.\n  One of the most important directives in this Act and it states that \n``nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the degree of \ncleanup at the Rocky Flats site required under the Rocky Flats Cleanup \nAgreement or any Federal or State law.'' I believe it is important to \nreiterate that this bill should not be used as a mechanism to drive the \nlevel of cleanup. As with any cleanup, the future land use is always \nconsidered in setting cleanup levels, but other important factors will \nplay into any decision. For instance, the protection of surface water \ncoming off the site, the desire to minimize long-\n\n[[Page S1761]]\n\nterm operation and monitoring costs, and the State of Colorado's rules \nfor decommissioning nuclear sites which say licensees should reduce \npotential radiation dose levels as low as reasonably achievable.\n  Once the site is transferred to the Fish and Wildlife Service, the \nrefuge will be managed in accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem Act to preserve wildlife, enhance wildlife habitat, conserve \nthreatened and endangered species, provide education opportunities and \nscientific research, as well as wildlife compatible recreation.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service are to convene a public process to \ninclude input on the management of the site.\n  I firmly believe that access rights and property rights must be \npreserved. Therefore, this legislation recognizes and preserves all \nmineral rights, water rights and utility rights-of-way. This Act does, \nhowever, provide the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Interior \nthe authority to impose reasonable conditions on the access to private \nproperty rights for cleanup and refuge management purposes.\n  With regard to mineral rights, the Secretary of Energy is required to \nseek to purchase mineral rights from willing sellers.\n  As a tribute to the Cold War and the dedicated Rocky Flats workers \nboth prior to and after the site closure, the bill authorizes the \nestablishment of a Rocky Flats museum to commemorate the site requiring \nthat the creation of the museum shall be studied, and a report shall be \nsubmitted to Congress within three years following the enactment of \nthis act.\n  Finally, this bill directs the Department of Energy and the Fish and \nWildlife Service to inform Congress on the costs associated with the \nimplementation of this Act.\n  Lastly, I want to thank Representative Mark Udall for the bi-partisan \nmanner in which he and his staff worked with me and my office. Rocky \nFlats, like all other cleanup sites, is bigger than partisan politics \nand this effort proves it. I would also like to specifically thank the \nDepartment of Energy for taking the expedited cleanup plan and making \nit work within their budgetary guidelines; Kaiser-Hill for making the \nimpossible, possible; and, I would like to say a great big thanks to \nall of the workers at Rocky Flats whose skill and dedication have made \nthe reality of cleanup possible. Without the workers, even the best \nlaid plans would be for naught.\n  Once cleanup and closure is accomplished in 2006, I look forward to \nreturning to Rocky Flats for the dedication of the new Rocky Flats \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \n        Dayton, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 426.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about bringing \ndevelopment and good jobs to upstate New York and other regions of our \ncountry that have not fully participated in our nation's economic \ngrowth.\n  As I travel across the state and listen to the struggles of small \nbusiness owners and workers, I'm often reminded of my father, who ran a \nsmall business and worked hard every day to provide for our family. I \nthink about people like him who live in Plattsburgh and Buffalo, \nRochester, Syracuse, Binghamton, Oneonta and every town and village in \nbetween. Most importantly, I think that--with the right ideas and a lot \nof hard work--we can create opportunities that will revitalize New \nYork's upstate economy, as well as in places like these all across our \ncountry.\n  Now as we all know, a historic shift has taken place in our economy \nand, to succeed in the twenty first century new economy, businesses \nhave to be innovative, creative and flexible. Workers have to have \nbetter education and training; and community leaders have to bring all \nsectors of our communities together to make their hometowns more \nhospitable to high tech industries.\n  Many parts of upstate New York have not been able to fully enjoy the \nfruits of the new knowledge based economy. Too many of our finest young \npeople leave the state for better jobs elsewhere. Two summers ago, I \ntalked to an upstate New York professor who told me what he thought was \nthe biggest barrier to economic progress in the region: poor internet \naccess. He pointed out that just as canals and railroad lines had made \nupstate, western and central New York the hub of the industrial economy \nin the 19th and 20th centuries, the region's shortage of high speed \ninternet lines would hold us back in the 21st Century.\n  Studies have shown, for example, that New York lags behind many \nstates when it comes to the internet connections that are essential to \ncommerce and communications in this new economy. But with leadership, \nand through partnerships, we can meet these challenges. All of us who \ncare about the towns and villages in upstate New York and across our \ncountry have an obligation to help. That is why I am very proud today \nto introduce a package of legislation that is designed to bring new \njobs to New York and to America.\n  This legislation is the result of a lot of conversations, and \nlistening, and hard work by many people. These seven bills will help \nbring all of New York online and into the new economy by promoting \nentrepreneurship and innovation, and by knocking down some of the \nstubborn barriers to economic progress.\n\n[[Page S1762]]\n\n  Just in the past three weeks, I have been in Rochester, and Rome and \nWatertown--Buffalo, and Niagara Falls meeting with business and labor \nleaders, academic, religious and civic leaders as well as citizens from \nall walks of life. I've also been meeting and talking with many of my \nRepublican and Democratic colleagues here in the Congress--talking \nabout the budget, and talking about the economies of New York and the \nrest of our nation.\n  I have found that this legislation I propose today reflects the views \nand values, not only of many New Yorkers, but also a number of my \ncolleagues here in the Senate. We agree that we have to clear away some \nof the major obstacles to economic growth and that we must invest in \nthe skills of our country's greatest resources--our people.\n  After all, upstate New York is the region where America's innovators, \nbusinesses and workers spun Thomas Edison's first light bulb, made \ncameras widely available to all Americans, created the nation's first \nbusiness incubator and the pacemaker. Now, with a proud place in the \neconomic history of our country, upstate New York deserves its place in \nthe economic future as well. My legislation is designed to help bring \nall of New York to the forefront of the 21st century economy.\n  Specifically, I propose the creation of new technology bonds. Using \nfederal tax credits, states and local governments will be able to issue \nsuch bonds to help local governments invest in the high-speed data \nlines they need to attract cutting edge businesses.\n  I propose creating new incentives to link industrial parks and small \nbusiness incubators to the Internet--and to bring access to high-speed \ninternet connections called broadband. Too many families and businesses \nstill have to dial long distance to get on the Internet. That's why my \nplan also includes a $100 million initiative to help businesses bring \nbroadband to rural and underserved communities.\n  I also support research into the next generation of broadband \ntechnologies that could make access to the Internet even more cost-\neffective. We have to help small businesses make the most of the new \ntechnologies to maximize profits and productivity. Too many firms still \ndo not know where to begin when it comes to bringing their businesses \nonline. Large businesses, we know, can spend millions on high-priced \nconsultants to find out which computer and software systems to buy so \nthey can best use the new technologies. But small, and even medium size \nbusinesses, just can't afford to do that.\n  So, as part of my package of incentives, I am introducing what I call \na Technology Extension Program to help small and medium business \nowners. For years, the federal government has provided farmers advice \nand expertise through the Cooperative Extension system. More recently, \nthe Department of Commerce has successfully helped small manufacturers \nwith new technologies through the Manufacturing Extension Program. I \nthink we can build on the successes of these programs and help small \nand medium business owners in the same way, creating partnerships with \nuniversities and community colleges to transform their innovations into \njobs for more and more people.\n  New York is also a state blessed with some of the finest colleges and \nresearch institutions in the world. Yet, we haven't been able to \ntransform a lot of those discoveries into commercial ventures near \nwhere they have been made. That's why my plan increases support for \nbusiness incubators that can cut the time it takes for a breakthrough \non the laboratory bench to make it to the factory and sales floor.\n  Of course one of the most important parts of this legislation focuses \non investing in the skills of our people. We can create all the high \ntech jobs we need from, you know, Plattsburg to Reno--but if they don't \nhave people to fill them it's not going to mean anything, as I know \nthat the President understands. That's why I'll fight to increase \nAmerica's investment in the Regional Skills Alliances that bring \nbusinesses, universities, and community colleges together to make sure \nworkers have the training they need in the modern workplace.\n  I know that we have to support and encourage small businesses to \nbring jobs to places like upstate New York. My legislation will create \na new Small Business Jobs Tax Credit to allow small firms in \nunderserved communities across the country eligible because of \npopulation loss and low job growth--to claim a $3,000 tax credit for \nevery employee they hire.\n  Mr. President, during my campaign I promised that my first \nlegislation would focus on promoting economic growth in upstate New \nYork. That is why I am particularly pleased to be here in fulfillment \nof that pledge.\n  But I see my plan as a part of a larger partnership to spur job \ncreation across our country, where good people and their communities \nare in need of help. According to the latest Labor Department \nstatistics New York, for example, as a whole enjoyed a 2.3 percent job \ngrowth rate last year. But upstate New York's job growth rate was about \nhalf of that at 1.2% and below the national average of 2.1 percent. Now \nbehind those numbers are the lives and livelihoods of millions of \npeople, and it is for those people that this legislation is being \nintroduced. No parent should have to see a child leave his or her \nhometown simply because a good job can't be found.\n  My co-sponsors and I know that the fight for new jobs for New York \nand America is a long and difficult one. We do not expect everything in \nthis plan to pass in one year alone, or even in the exact form in which \nit is introduced. And standing alone, no single plan or Senator will be \nable to get the job done. But my colleagues and I understand we need a \nlong-term partnership among people in government at all levels and with \nthe private sector, business, labor, schools universities and others.\n  That is why I also support S. 41 introduced by Senators Hatch and \nBaucus, and supported by many Democrats and Republicans to make the \nresearch and development tax credit permanent and to promote \nentrepreneurship and innovation. It's why I think we have to continue \nto tackle other stubborn barriers to economic growth like high \nutilities costs, high taxes and inadequate transportation and poor \ninfrastructure. And of course, I can't talk about upstate New York \nwithout mentioning the spectacular geography and cultural heritage that \nis not only a source of pride, but also as a valuable economic \nresource.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues, representing both \nparties, who have come together to join and sponsor one or more of my \nbills today. I look forward to talking to more members of this chamber \nand the other body in the days and weeks ahead. I believe if we take \ngood ideas and through hard work make them real, we can revitalize New \nYork's upstate economy and also give hope to the hardworking, deserving \nfamilies of communities across our country. No one should have to leave \ntheir hometown, their families, and their roots to find a good job in \nAmerica.\n  I ask unanimous consent that text of the bills, the summary of the \nbills, and articles relevant to the bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 426\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Access to high-speed Internet is as important to 21st \n     Century businesses as access to the railroads and interstate \n     highways was to businesses of the last century.\n       (2) Up to one-third of the United States population lacks \n     access to high-speed Internet.\n       (3) Companies without access to high-speed Internet are \n     unable to meet their market potential, just as a community \n     cannot prosper if it doesn't have high quality roads and \n     bridges.\n       (4) Technology bonds would provide incentives to State and \n     local governments to partner with the private sector to \n     expand broadband deployment in their communities, especially \n     underserved urban and rural areas.\n\n     SEC. 2.

GRANTS FOR SUPPORT OF BUSINESS INCUBATOR ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to \n     encourage entrepreneurial creativity and risk taking through \n     the support of the furnishing of business incubator services \n     for newly established small businesses and medium-sized \n     businesses.\n       (b) Grant Program.--to achieve the purpose of this section, \n     the Secretary of Commerce (in this section, referred to as \n     the ``Secretary'') shall carry out a program to provide, \n     through grants, financial assistance for the establishment \n     and support of entities that provide business incubator \n     services in support of the initiation and initial sustainment \n     of business activities by newly established small businesses \n     and medium-sized businesses.\n       (c) Awards of Grants.--\n       (1) Eligibility requirements.--The Secretary shall \n     prescribe the eligibility requirements for the awarding of \n     grants under this section.\n       (2) Competitive selection.--The Secretary shall use a \n     competitive process for the awarding of grants under this \n     section and, under that process, select recipients of the \n     grant son the basis of merit, with priority given to \n     underserved rural and urban communities.\n       (3) Applications for grants.--The Secretary shall prescribe \n     the form and content of applications required for grants \n     under this section.\n       (d) Additional Administrative Authorities.--\n       (1) Cost-sharing.--The Secretary may require the recipient \n     of a grant under this section to defray a specific level of \n     its operating expenses for business incubator services out of \n     funds available from sources other than the Federal \n     Government.\n       (2) Additional terms and conditions.--The Secretary, in \n     awarding a grant, may impose any other terms and conditions \n     for the use of the proceeds of the grant that the Secretary \n     determines appropriate for carrying out the purpose of this \n     section and to protect the interests of the United States, \n     including the requirement that entities providing business \n     incubator services that receive a grant under this section \n     develop a plan for ultimately becoming self-sufficient.\n       (e) Definitions.--\n       (1) Business incubator services.--In this section, the term \n     ``business incubator services'' includes professional and \n     technical services necessary for the initiation and initial \n     sustainment of operations of a newly established business, \n     including such services as the following:\n       (A) Legal services.--Legal services, including aid in \n     preparing corporate charters, partnership agreements, and \n     basic contracts.\n       (B) Intellectual property services.--Services in support of \n     the protection of intellectual property through patents, \n     trademarks, or otherwise.\n       (C) Technology services.--Services in support of the \n     acquisition and use of advanced technology, including the use \n     of Internet services and web-based services.\n       (D) Planning.--Advice on--\n       (i) strategic planning; and\n       (ii) marketing, including advertising.\n       (2) Small business and medium-sized business.--\n       (A) Secretary to prescribe.--The Secretary shall prescribe \n     the definitions of the terms ``small business'' and ``medium-\n     sized business'' for the purpose of this section.\n       (B) Small business standards.--In defining the term ``small \n     business'' for the purpose of this section, the Secretary \n     shall apply the standards applicable for the definition of \n     the term ``small business concern'' under section 3 of the \n     Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).\n       (f) Regulations.--The Secretary shall prescribe regulations \n     for the grant program administered under this section.\n       (g) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated for the Department of Commerce for \n     carrying out this section $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, \n     and $200,000,000 for each fiscal year thereafter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Economic Development Proposals for the New Economy--Summary\n\n       In too many parts of America, many of our communities are \n     plagued by low job growth and economic stagnation. These \n     communities, which historically have been the backbone of our \n     nation, are deeply concerned about their economic prospects. \n     This package of incentives focuses on encouraging new \n     technology companies to move to places where they can take \n     advantage of a well-educated workforce and a higher education \n     infrastructure that is often available and underutilized.\n       Technology Bonds: In order to help states and local \n     governments invest in telecommunications infrastructure, this \n     proposal invests $100 million a year in a new type of tax \n     incentive: Technology Bonds. Localities would be allowed to \n     use Technology Bonds to expand high-speed Internet access in \n     their communities. These bonds would provide a significant \n     incentive to state and local governments because they would \n     not have to pay any interest on them, and, thus, would make \n     no payments until maturity (15 years in the future). Because \n     the program directs its benefits to communities, it will \n     better ensure that higher need communities receive the \n     benefits.\n       Small Business Jobs Tax Credit: This tax credit for small \n     businesses will promote jobs in smaller communities. This \n     proposal will provide a tax credit for wages, up to $3,000 \n     per employee, for small businesses that locate in communities \n     that are losing population, have low job growth rates and \n     high poverty rates. Specifically, this proposal creates a 20% \n     tax credit for wages of up to $15,000 per year, which is a \n     value of up to $3,000 per employee, companies could receive \n     the credit for up to five years. This initiative will focus \n     on smaller communities by targeting communities with a \n     population over 5,000. The program would designate roughly \n     100 communities and could subsidize roughly 8,000 jobs for \n     each area.\n       Broadband Expansion Grant Initiative of 2001: This proposal \n     complements Tech Bonds by creating a $100 million initiative \n     to accelerate private-sector deployment of broadband networks \n     in under-served rural communities. Right now many families \n     have to make long distances calls to connect to Internet. \n     This initiative will support $100 million in grants and loan \n     guarantees to ensure the Internet is more cost-effective and \n     only a local call away. It will connect industrial parks and \n     small business incubators with high-speed links; and \n     encourage trials of innovative deployment of broadband \n     networks to provide cost-effective access to rural areas.\n       Technology Extension Act of 2001: During the early part of \n     this century, the Federal government helped farmers gain \n     access to new agricultural technologies through the \n     Agriculture Extension Program at the Department of \n     Agriculture. More recently, the Department of Commerce has \n     successfully helped small manufacturers with new technologies \n     through its Manufacturing Extension Program. Now it is time \n     to provide small and medium-sized businesses with a \n     technology extension program that provides the latest \n     technology to improve productivity and promote economic \n     growth. This initiative will build upon the Manufacturing \n     Extension Program to address critical needs in areas such as \n     technology applications, infrastructure upgrades and business \n     practices, insurance and other forms. It would also work with \n     universities and laboratories to transfer technologies to \n     small and medium-sized businesses that will help them move \n     products to markets faster. This program would be funded at \n     $25 million the first year, growing to $125 million in fiscal \n     year 2002.\n       Broadband Rural Research Investment Act of 2001: This \n     proposal targets $25 million in funding for research to \n     ensure the availability of broadband in rural areas. This \n     proposal supports additional investments at the National \n     Science Foundation for research in new broadband technology \n     to increase the availability of broadband telecommunications \n     services in remote and rural areas.\n       Regional Skills Alliances: Throughout the nation, high-tech \n     companies often consider recruiting employees from overseas \n     because a shortage of information technology workers remains \n     a significant problem throughout the state. Too many small \n     firms do not have the resources to train the workers they \n     need. This proposals creates Regional Skills Alliances to \n     bring businesses, schools, and community college together to \n     help create effective programs to ensure workers have the \n     training needed to compete in the new economy. Without some \n     kind of support to create alliances, small firms just don't \n     have the time or resources to collaborate with anybody on \n     training. In fact, almost all existing RSA's report that they \n     would not have been able to get off the ground without an\n\n[[Page S1767]]\n\n     independent, staffed entity to operate the alliance.\n       Entrepreneurial Incubators: This initiative would help \n     entrepreneurs who have good ideas but cannot afford lawyers \n     and consultants to access the help they need with legal \n     complexities such as preparing corporate charters, \n     partnership agreements, contracts, patent and intellectual \n     property rules, and basic marketing strategies. This will \n     especially help areas where universities can be key \n     collaborators in entrepreneurial incubators. This proposal \n     would initially invest $50 million and up to $200 million the \n     following years, to increase business incubators nationally \n     by a third.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From the Associated Press]\n\n               How Does Upstate Keep Best and Brightest?\n\n                           (By Michael Hill)\n\n       Albany, NY.--Jaclyn Welcher's college degree turned out to \n     be a one-way ticket out of upstate New York.\n       After graduating from Siena College near Albany in 1998, \n     Welcher tried to apply her marketing and management degree to \n     a job around her parents' home in Queensbury. It didn't work \n     out.\n       ``I said: `There's no point in this at all,' '' Welcher \n     recalled, ``I'm outta here!'' Welcher--now 24 and working in \n     Los Angeles--is far from the only twenty-something to leave \n     upstate New York.\n       Young New Yorkers have long been leaving for bigger \n     paychecks and jazzier lifestyles in places like Boston, \n     Austin and Atlanta. The exodus is considered a serious \n     problem because young people are a vital cog in local \n     economies--they take entry-level jobs, spend money and add \n     vibrancy to an area. Employers and local officials have \n     become concerned enough to try out some new strategies to \n     attract and retain young workers.\n       Updated U.S. Census figures tracking local population \n     changes by age won't be available until later this year. \n     However, interviews with recent college graduates, employers \n     and local leaders across New York reveal a widespread \n     perception that upstate areas struggle in the competition for \n     young workers.\n       Part of the problem is higher salaries offered elsewhere \n     for certain jobs. For instance, the mean 1998 salary for a \n     computer engineer in Rochester area was $54,910; it was \n     $62,930 in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area of North \n     Carolina, according to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics \n     data.\n       Lower pay can be mitigated by a relatively inexpensive \n     costs of living--three-bedroom houses in Buffalo or Syracuse \n     areas can be purchased for under $100,000. Albany Molecular \n     Research Inc. Vice President James Grates said when he tells \n     potential recruits in Berkeley that homes in the Albany area \n     can go for $90,000-$110,000--two or three times less than \n     similar houses in the Bay Area of California--``their jaws \n     drop to the table.''\n       But inexpensive housing is a bigger draw for workers ready \n     to settle down and have a family. People in their 20s have \n     been known to have other priorities--like being around other \n     people in their 20s.\n       ``California, Boston, Texas--they have some glitter to \n     them. Fancy nightclubs, bars, sports bars, restaurants, \n     entertainment . . . the perception is here we don't have as \n     much of that,'' said Rochester Institute of Technology \n     President Albert Simone.\n       Take Atlanta, where Jonathan Cancro reports that there are \n     so many of his fellow University of Buffalo graduates that \n     he's helping start a local chapter of the college's alumni \n     association. One obvious sign of the Buffalo connection, \n     Cancro said, is the number of bars catering to Bills fans.\n       ``There are tons of people down here from New York,'' said \n     the 30-year-old Long Island native. ``Not just UB.''\n       The twentysomething exodus has been serious enough to show \n     up on some politicians' radar. Erie County Executive Joel \n     Giambra ran a successful campaign in 1999 on the slogan \n     ``Keep Our Kids.'' Sen. Hilliary Rodham Clinton also lamented \n     the loss of young people from New York while on the campaign \n     trail last year.\n       Employers have noticed too, and have tried to sweeten the \n     pot for young people. A survey last year by the Business \n     Council of New York State employers bumping up starting pay \n     and hastening first raises.\n       Companies also are experimenting with benefits that might \n     be attractive to younger, childless workers. Media Logic, a \n     marketing and advertising firm in Albany, includes yoga and \n     stress classes as part of its employees benefits package.\n       Meanwhile, business groups in several cities are \n     strengthening their links to local colleges in hopes in \n     grabbing graduates to fill job slots.\n       In Sycrause, the Metropolitan Development Association is \n     spending $550,000 in state grant money for summer internship \n     programs aimed at keeping area college students in the region \n     after graduation.\n       In Rochester, presidents of a number of area schools--\n     including RIT, the University of Rochester and the state \n     universities at Geneseo and Brockport--have met with local \n     employers to find ways to make it easier for small- and \n     medium-sized businesses to recruit local talent.\n       In Albany, the Center for Economic Growth plans to bring \n     together business leaders, students and maybe even guidance \n     counselors to start dialogues on what young graduates look \n     for in an employer.\n       ``To tell a 22-year-old freshly minted college graduate \n     that the reason they should come to work for my company is \n     because I have this incredible 401k plan--it's probably not \n     going to raise their eyebrows and make them go `Yahoo!' '' \n     said center President Kelly Lovell. Also, there are new signs \n     of nightlife in many old upstate cities, be it brew pubs or \n     couch-crammed coffee houses. Buffalo's Chippewa Street might \n     be the most dramatic transformation--once notorious for its \n     sex trade, it is now a gentrified strip packed with bars, \n     dance clubs and restaurants.\n       Syracuse also is showing signs of rebirth, said super \n     booster Jeff Brown. The 36-year-old lawyer is helping start a \n     unique program to draw young people back to his hometown. \n     Under the ``Come Home to Sycrause'' program volunteers will \n     work off of alumni lists from local colleges and high \n     schools, contacting young expatriates to see if they want to \n     come back. The volunteers will help returnees network for \n     jobs.\n       A web site is planned and there's already a toll-free \n     number: 1-866-BAK-2SYR. Brown seems qualified for the job. He \n     was once one of those young people who left, in his case for \n     Washington D.C. Brown said he liked the hubbub but missed his \n     home community. ``At some point in your life,'' he said, \n     ``you realize there's something more to life than 20 \n     different Ethiopian restaurants.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the New York Post, Mar. 1, 2001]\n\n               New York's Job Growth Again Tops U.S. Rate\n\n                          (By Kenneth Lovett)\n\n       Albany.--Spurred by a surge in New York City, job growth in \n     the state surpassed the nation's average, for the second \n     straight year, in 2000.\n       The total number of jobs in the state grew by 2.3 percent \n     last year, compared with the national average of 2.1 percent, \n     the state Labor Department reported yesterday. New York's 4.2 \n     percent unemployment rate in January matched the nation's for \n     the first time in nearly a decade.\n       The city had a 5.6 percent unemployment rate in January, \n     down from 5.9 percent in December and 6.4 percent last \n     January.\n       Overall, New York had 7.168 million private-sector jobs in \n     January, the highest number on record.\n       ``Our policies have better positioned New York to fend off \n     a national economic slowdown,'' Gov. Pataki said. Mayor \n     Giuliani recently said the city was the ``economic \n     engine'' for the state as a whole. The numbers seem to \n     back him up.\n       New York City saw a 3.3-percent increase in jobs last year, \n     by far the largest jump in the state.\n       Upstate saw 1.2 percent growth, significantly lower than \n     the state average.\n       Large urban regions like Buffalo-Niagara Falls, Syracuse \n     and Rochester saw jobs grow by only .3 percent, .9 percent \n     and 1.1 percent, respectively.\n       The health of the upstate economy looms as a major issue in \n     next year's gubernatorial race. Republican Rick Lazio drew \n     heavy criticism last year when he downplayed the region's \n     economic woes in his failed Senate bid against Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton.\n       Democrats have already targeted the upstate economy as one \n     of the primary issues they will use against Pataki next year.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a growing crisis \nin America's rural communities. We live in a time of balanced budgets, \nlarge surpluses, record unemployment, and average wages rising across \nthe country. However, this wealth is not universal across the United \nStates. Our rural areas are suffering the exact opposite effect with \nlarge outmigration and negative job growth. My highest priority is \nreversing this trend, stimulating economic growth and bringing higher \npaying jobs to my home State of Montana. I am pleased to join Senator \nClinton in introducing economic development legislation that is \ntargeted to the areas of greatest need, our rural communities.\n  Our Nation has enjoyed unparalleled economic prosperity during the \npast decade. However, the boom on Wall Street has not extended to Main \nStreet, MT. The rural areas of America and Montana have endured \nincreased unemployment, the loss of family farms, and the transition \nfrom a traditional economy based on natural resources to a new economy \nwhere information and technology are highly valued. The effects have \nbeen disastrous. Small businesses, which are essential components of \ncommunity, have been driven under as people have been forced to make \nthe most difficult choice of all and leave their home towns seeking a \nnew and better paying job.\n  In Montana, the problems are actually worse. Statewide, we are \nsuffering. Comparatively we rank forty-seventh in per-capita personal \nincome and second in the number of people holding more than one job. \nWith such a massive economic down-turn, State and local governments are \nleft unable to assist in this economic transition simply due to a lack \nof funding. The private sector invests where it can, but\n\n[[Page S1768]]\n\nthere is not a company in existence that could finance the investment \nnecessary to bring essential technology to sparsely populated areas.\n  Many of our small towns are left without hope because they are faced \nwith no alternative to the current situation. The tools that are \nnecessary to compete in the new economy are just not available to rural \ncommunities and the means to attain them do not exist. If rural America \nis to survive, we are charged with finding a way for these communities \nto compete on an equal footing with the more populous areas of this \ncountry and the world.\n  That is the intent of the legislative package that we are introducing \ntoday. In the same spirit that brought electricity and basic telephone \nservice to our rural communities, we propose a mechanism for bringing \nbroadband capabilities, cutting-edge technology equipment, and \nincentives for bringing new business to communities and regions that \nhave been left behind.\n  The issues addressed by this legislation strike to the heart of the \nmost pressing problems in my home State of Montana. Especially in \nEastern Montana, the so-called ``Digital Divide'' is very real and \npresents a significant obstacle to economic growth and prosperity. \nSpecifically, the Broadband Deployment Initiative and the Technology \nExtension Program will not only provide an incentive to the private \nsector to bring cutting-edge technology to the most rural areas, they \nwill also provide the technical expertise to allow small and medium \nbusinesses to use these new tools to their maximum potential. They will \nbe fully equipped to compete in a global economy.\n  I look forward to seeing this bipartisan legislation through Congress \nand enacted into law. I encourage my colleagues to assist us in this \nendeavor. It is our duty to ensure that all regions of America have a \nchance to achieve economic prosperity and have access to the necessary \ninstruments of success.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 434. A bill to provide equitable compensation to the Yankton Sioux \nTribe of South Dakota and the Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska for the \nloss of value of certain lands; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am joining with Senators Tim \nJohnson and Chuck Hagel to introduce legislation to compensate the \nYankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota and the Santee Sioux Tribe of \nNebraska for losses the tribes suffered when the Fort Randall and \nGavins Point dams were constructed on the Missouri River over four \ndecades ago.\n  As a result of the construction of these dams, more than 3,259 acres \nof land owned by the Yankton Sioux Tribe were flooded or subsequently \nlost to erosion. Also, approximately 600 acres of land located near the \nSantee village and 400 acres on the Niobrara Island of the Santee Sioux \nTribe Indian Reservation were flooded. The flooding of these fertile \nlands struck a significant blow to the economies of these tribes, a \nloss for which they have never been adequately compensated. This \nlegislation attempts to redress that unfortunate reality by providing \nthe tribes resources to rebuild their infrastructure and strengthen \ntheir economies.\n  To appreciate fully the need for this legislation, it is important to \nunderstand history. The Fort Randall and Gavins Point dams were \nconstructed in South Dakota pursuant to the Flood Control Act (58 Stat. \n887) of 1944. That legislation authorized implementation of the \nMissouri River Basin Pick-Sloan Plan for water development and flood \ncontrol for downstream states.\n  The Fort Randall dam, which was an integral part of the Pick-Sloan \nproject, initially flooded 2,851 acres of tribal land, forcing the \nrelocation and resettlement of numerous families, including the \ntraditional and self-sustaining community of White Swan, one of the \nfour major settlement areas on the reservation. On other reservations, \nsuch as Crow Creek, Lower Brule, Cheyenne River, Standing Rock and Fort \nBerthold, communities affected by the Pick-Sloan dams were relocated to \nhigher ground. In contract, the White Swan community was completely \ndissolved and its residents dispersed to whatever areas they could \nsettle and start again.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Yankton Sioux Tribe and Santee \nSioux Tribe of Nebraska Development Trust Fund Act, follows the \nprecedent established over the last ten years by a series of laws that \naddress similar claims by other tribes in South Dakota for losses \ncaused by the Pick-Sloan dams. In 1992, Congress granted the Three \nAffiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation and the Standing Rock \nSioux Tribe compensation for direct damages, including lost reservation \ninfrastructure, relocation and resettlement expenses, the general \nrehabilitation of the tribes and unfulfilled government commitments \nregarding replacement facilities. In 1996, Congress enacted legislation \ncompensating the Crow Creek tribe for its losses and in 1997 \nlegislation was enacted to compensate the Lower Brule tribe. Last year, \nthe Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe also received compensation.\n  The Yankton Sioux Tribe and Santee Sioux Tribe have not yet received \nfair compensation for their losses. Their time has come.\n  The flooding caused by the Pick-Sloan projects touched every aspect \nof life on the Yankton and Santee Sioux reservations, as large portions \nof their communities were forced to relocate wherever they could find \nshelter. These effects were never fully considered when the federal \ngovernment was acquiring these lands or designing the Pick-Sloan \nprojects.\n  The Yankton Sioux Tribe and Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska \nDevelopment Trust Fund Act represents an important element of our \ncontinuing effort to compensate fairly the tribes of the Missouri River \nBasin for the sacrifices they made decades ago for the construction of \nthe dams. Passage of this legislation will not only right a historic \nwrong, but in doing so it will also improve the lives of Native \nAmericans living on these reservations.\n  It took decades for Congress to recognize the government's \nunfulfilled federal obligation to compensate the tribes for the effects \nof the construction of the Fort Randall and Gavins Point dams. We \ncannot, of course, reclaim the productive lands lost to those projects \nwhich are now covered with water and return them to the tribes. We can, \nhowever, help replace the forsaken economic potential of those lands by \nproviding resources to improve the infrastructure on the reservations. \nThis approach, in turn, will enhance opportunities for economic \ndevelopment that will benefit all members of the tribe.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to approve the Yankton Sioux Tribe and \nSantee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska Development Trust Fund Act this year. \nProviding compensation to the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the Santee Sioux \nTribe of Nebraska for past economic harm inflicted by the federal \ngovernment is long overdue, and further delay only compounds that harm. \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 434\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide that the annual drug certification \nprocedures under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 not apply to \ncertain countries with which the United States has bilateral agreements \nand other plans relating to counterdrug activities, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, over the last several years, Congress has \nhad no good options when it comes to the certification of major drug \nproducing and drug transit countries. This has been most apparent in \nour annual debate over the certification of Mexico's efforts in \ncombating illicit drugs.\n  Certifying Mexico has been very difficult to do in light of the \nupsetting statistics showing that Mexico is a major point of production \nand transit for drugs entering the United States. I have also been, and \ncontinue to be, concerned about the influence of powerful drug cartels \nin Mexico. In fact, in 1998, I joined 44 other Senators in voting in \nfavor of decertifying Mexico.\n  Nevertheless, I join many of my colleagues in the belief that the \ncertification process does not work as it was intended. In some cases, \nwhat we have now is the worst of both worlds. The certification process \nsubjects some of our closest allies and trading partners to an annual \nritual of finger-pointing and humiliation rather than supporting mutual \nefforts to control illicit drugs.\n  Today, Senator Gramm and I are reintroducing legislation which we \nhope will lead to a more honest and realistic way of addressing the \ninternational drug problem. By replacing confrontation with \ncooperation, we are encouraging nations to join the United States in \nfighting drugs while eliminating a process which strains our relations \nwith allies such as Mexico.\n  Our legislation would exempt from the certification process those \ncountries that have a bilateral agreement with the United States. These \nagreements would have to address issues relating to the control of \nillicit drugs--including production, distribution, interdiction, demand \nreduction, border security, and cooperation among law enforcement \nagencies.\n  This alternative will give both countries a way to work together for \nreal goals with real results. Make no mistake, this will not give \nMexico or any other country a free pass on fighting illicit drugs. On \nthe contrary, our bill encourages the adoption of tough bilateral \nagreements. It specifically spells out issues that must be addressed in \nthe agreements.\n  We specifically require the adoption of ``timetables and objective \nand measurable standards.'' And we require semi-annual reports \nassessing the progress of both countries under the bilateral agreement. \nIf progress is not made, the country returns to the annual \ncertification process, which involves the possibility of sanctions.\n  This issue is particularly important to those of us from border \nstates, which are hit so hard by the traffic in illegal drugs. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on a bipartisan and comprehensive \nsolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 436. A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nto require the provision of a child safety lock in connection with the \ntransfer of a handgun and provide safety standards for child safety \nlocks; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Child Safety Lock Act \nof 2001, along with Senators Chafee, Durbin, Schumer, Reed, Corzine, \nBoxer and Kerry. Our bipartisan measure will save children's lives by \nreducing the senseless tragedies that result when children get their \nhands on improperly stored and unlocked handguns.\n  Each year, teenagers and children are involved in more than 10,000 \naccidental shootings in which close to 800 people die. In addition, \nevery year 1,300 children use firearms to commit suicide. Safety locks \ncan be effective in deterring some of these incidents and in preventing \nothers.\n  The sad truth is that we are inviting disaster every time an unlocked \ngun is stored but is still easily accessible to children. In fact, guns \nare kept in 43 percent of American households with children. In 23 \npercent of the gun households, the guns are kept loaded. And, in one \nout of every eight of those homes the guns are left unlocked.\n  That is wrong. It is unacceptable. But these cold statistics do not \nbegin to describe in human terms the daily tragedies that could be \nprevented by the use of a safety lock.\n  Take, for example, the story of a teenage girl in Milwaukee last year \nwho was killed when the gun her boyfriend found accidentally went off, \nshooting her in the chest. A lock certainly would have prevented this \ntragedy. A lock would have also saved both the three-year-old in New \nOrleans who shot himself in the head with his mother's gun two months \nago or the two-year-old boy who shot himself in the forehead with his \nmother's pistol in Pennsylvania last October. Of course, no one will \never forget the story of six-year-old Kayla Rolland in Michigan killed \nlast year by a classmate who had brought a gun to school. The stories \ncould go on for pages, each more tragic than the last, but the most \ntragic fact of all is that many of them were entirely preventable.\n  Our legislation will help address this problem. It is simple, \neffective and straightforward. It requires that a child safety device, \nor trigger lock, be sold with every handgun. These devices vary in \nform, but the most common resemble a padlock that wraps around the gun \ntrigger and immobilizes it. Trigger locks are already used by tens of \nthousands of responsible gun owners to protect their firearms from \nunauthorized use, and they can be purchased in virtually any gun store \nfor less than ten dollars.\n  This year, for the first time, this child safety lock bill includes \nstandards for the safety locks, building on the work of Senator Kerry \non this issue. A recent study by the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nand a recent recall by the safety lock manufacturers conclusively \ndemonstrates that child safety locks are not being made\n\n[[Page S1771]]\n\nwell enough. A lock that is easily picked or one that breaks apart with \nlittle force defeats the safety purpose of this bill. We wouldn't use a \nlock that is less than foolproof to guard our most valuable \npossessions. We shouldn't use defective locks to protect what is most \nvaluable to us--our children.\n  A child safety lock provision passed the Senate by an overwhelming \nvote of 78-20 last session as an amendment during the juvenile justice \ndebate. This proposal is as popular with the rest of the country and \nthe law enforcement community as it was with the last Senate. Polls \nshow that between 75 and 80 percent of the American public, including \ngun owners, favor the mandatory sale of child safety locks with guns. \nWhen I surveyed almost 500 of Wisconsin's police chiefs and sheriffs \nlast summer, approximately 90 percent responded that child safety locks \nshould be sold with each gun.\n  In addition, according to published reports from last year's \ncampaign, President Bush indicated that he supports the idea of \nmandatory child safety locks and would sign a bill that required the \nsale of a child safety lock with all new handguns. Attorney General \nAshcroft confirmed that the administration supports the mandatory sale \nof child safety locks during his confirmation hearings before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee earlier this year.\n  This legislation is necessary to ensure that safety locks are \nprovided with all handguns and to keep the pressure on handgun \nmanufacturers to put safety first. We already protect children by \nrequiring that seat belts be installed in all automobiles and that \nchildproof safety caps be provided on medicine bottles. We should be no \nless vigilant when it comes to gun safety.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 436\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

For example, data \n     show that students who drink tend to receive lower grades and \n     are more likely to miss school because of illness than \n     students who do not drink.\n       ``(3) Drug and violence prevention programs are essential \n     components of a comprehensive strategy to promote school \n     safety, youth development, positive school outcomes, and to \n     reduce the demand for and illegal use of alcohol, tobacco and \n     drugs throughout the Nation. Schools, local organizations, \n     parents, students, and communities throughout the Nation have \n     a special responsibility to work together to combat the \n     continuing epidemic of violence and illegal drug use and \n     should measure the success of their programs against clearly \n     defined goals and objectives.\n       ``(4) Drug and violence prevention programs are most \n     effective when implemented within a research-based, drug and \n     violence prevention framework of proven effectiveness.\n       ``(5) Research clearly shows that community contexts \n     contribute to substance abuse and violence.\n       ``(6) Substance abuse and violence are intricately related \n     and must be dealt with in a holistic manner.\n       ``(7) Research has documented that parental behavior and \n     environment directly influence a child's inclination to use \n     alcohol, tobacco or drugs.\n\n     ``SEC. 4003.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The American teaching force is aging. The average \n     school teacher was 43 years old in academic year 1993-1994, \n     an increase of 3 years over the average age of school \n     teachers in academic year 1987-1998. Nearly a quarter of \n     American teachers are over 50 years old and nearing \n     retirement.\n       (2) On average public school teachers have slightly more \n     than 15 years teaching experience, and over a third of the \n     public school teachers have 20 or more years of teaching \n     experience.\n       (3) The experience of America's veteran teachers should be \n     utilized to help introduce beginning teachers to the \n     profession and to their new school.\n       (4) Retention of beginning teachers is a growing problem, \n     with approximately 25 percent of beginning teachers leaving \n     the teaching profession within their first 3 years in the \n     classroom.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to increase \n     teacher retention and improve the support and performance of \n     teachers by encouraging and assisting States to develop and \n     operate mentoring programs for beginning teachers.\n\n     SEC. 202. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       The terms used in this title have the meanings given the \n     terms in section 14101 of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801).\n\n     SEC. 203. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary is authorized to award \n     grants to State educational agencies to enable the State \n     educational agencies to carry out mentoring programs under \n     which public elementary school or secondary school teachers \n     with more than 3 years teaching experience serve as mentor \n     teachers to public elementary school or secondary school \n     teachers with less than 3 years teaching experience.\n       (b) Amount.--Each State educational agency having an \n     application approved under subsection (d) for a fiscal year \n     shall receive a grant in an amount that bears the same \n     relation to the amount appropriated under subsection (f) for \n     the fiscal year as the number of elementary school and \n     secondary school students in the State for the fiscal year \n     bears to the number of such students in all States for the \n     fiscal year.\n       (c) Reallocation.--The amount of a State educational \n     agency's grant that will not be used by the State educational \n     agency for a fiscal year shall be reallotted to the other \n     State educational agency in the same manner as grants are \n     awarded under subsection (b).\n       (d) Application.--Each State educational agency that \n     desires a grant under this section shall submit an \n     application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner and \n     accompanied by such information as the Secretary may require. \n     Each such application shall--\n       (1) describe the activities and services for which \n     assistance is sought;\n       (2) contain an assurance that funds provided under this \n     title will be used to supplement and not supplant State or \n     local public funds available for teacher mentoring programs; \n     and\n       (3) contain an assurance that the State educational agency \n     consulted with local educational agencies, school \n     superintendents, school boards, parents, and institutions of \n     higher education in the design and implementation of the \n     teacher mentoring program to be assisted.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this title $5,000,000 for \n     each of the fiscal years 2002 and 2003.\n\n     TITLE III--ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATION AND LICENSURE OF TEACHERS\n\n     SEC. 301. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the measure of a good teacher is how much and how well \n     the teacher's students learn;\n       (2) the main teacher quality problem in 1998 was the lack \n     of subject matter knowledge;\n       (3) knowledgeable and eager individuals of sound character \n     and various professional backgrounds should be encouraged to \n     enter the kindergarten through grade 12 classrooms as \n     teachers;\n       (4) many talented professionals who have demonstrated a \n     high level of subject area competence outside the education \n     profession may wish to pursue careers in education, but have \n     not fulfilled the traditional requirements to be certified or \n     licensed as teachers;\n       (5) States should have maximum flexibility and incentives \n     to create alternative teacher certification and licensure \n     programs in order to recruit well-educated people into the \n     teaching profession; and\n       (6) alternative routes can enable qualified individuals to \n     fulfill State teacher certification or licensure requirements \n     and will allow school systems to utilize the expertise of \n     professionals and improve the pool of qualified individuals \n     available to local educational agencies as teachers.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to improve \n     the supply of well-qualified elementary school and secondary \n     school teachers by encouraging and assisting States to \n     develop and implement programs for alternative routes to \n     teacher certification or licensure requirements.\n\n     SEC. 302. ALLOTMENTS.\n\n       (a) Allotments to States.--\n       (1) In general.--From the amount appropriated to carry out \n     this title for each fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to \n     each State the lesser of--\n       (A) the amount the State applies for under section 303; or\n       (B) an amount that bears the same relation to the amount so \n     appropriated as the total population of children ages 5 \n     through 17 in the State bears to the total population of such \n     children in all the States (based on the most recent data \n     available that is satisfactory to the Secretary).\n       (2) Reallocation.--If a State does not apply for the \n     State's allotment, or the full amount of the State's \n     allotment, under paragraph (1), the Secretary may reallocate \n     the excess funds to 1 or more other States that demonstrate, \n     to the satisfaction of the Secretary, a current need for the \n     funds.\n       (b) Special Rule.--Notwithstanding section 421(b) of the \n     General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1225(b)), funds \n     awarded under this title shall remain available for \n     obligation by a recipient for a period of 2 calendar years \n     from the date of the grant.\n\n     SEC. 303.

A bill to authorize the establishment of a suboffice of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service in Nashville, Tennessee; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, I introduce the Nashville INS Sub-\noffice Act along with Senator Thompson. This bill addresses important \nimmigration issues facing Tennessee by authorizing funds for a much \nneeded INS sub-office in Nashville.\n  The Mid-South region is experiencing exceptional population growth \nfrom not only other parts of the nation, but also from a significant \nnumber of foreign nationals looking to relocate. As a result of this \nnew influx in population, the existing Memphis INS office is \noverstretched and facing an enormous backlog of cases. As the largest \nmetropolitan area in the state, it only makes sense to open another INS \noffice in Nashville.\n  The new office would be geographically positioned to better provide \nthe necessary services for individuals living in Middle and East \nTennessee. It would also help alleviate the excessive burden facing the \nMemphis office by transferring a large portion of its workload. The new \nNashville sub-office would improve overall services and enables the INS \nto better address illegal immigration concerns in our area.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 439\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nashville INS Suboffice \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Immigration and Naturalization Service field office \n     in Memphis, Tennessee, is designated as a suboffice within \n     the jurisdiction of the district office in New Orleans, \n     Louisiana.\n       (2) Over the past 10 years, the foreign national population \n     has grown substantially in the jurisdictional area of the \n     Memphis suboffice.\n       (3) It is estimated that more than 200,000 foreign \n     nationals are residing in the jurisdictional area of the \n     Memphis suboffice.\n       (4) The Memphis suboffice has pending an equal or greater \n     number of cases, and receives as many new cases, as the New \n     Orleans district office.\n       (5) Approximately 46 percent of the total number of \n     permanent resident applications received by the Memphis \n     suboffice come from individuals residing in middle and \n     eastern Tennessee.\n       (6) In many instances, such individuals have to travel 3 to \n     6 hours each way to Memphis to receive service.\n       (7) Nashville is a logical location for a new Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service suboffice because its central \n     location will reduce such travel time and allow the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service to provide better and \n     more efficient service to such individuals.\n       (8) As the largest metropolitan area in the State of \n     Tennessee, major routes from across the State flow into \n     Nashville and air transportation is readily available there.\n       (9) Establishment of a Nashville suboffice would make a \n     strong statement about the commitment of the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service to gaining control over illegal \n     immigration and would facilitate legal immigration and \n     citizenship initiatives in central and eastern Tennessee.\n       (10) Congress has identified Nashville as a region \n     underserved by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated $5,000,000 for each \n     fiscal year to establish and operate an Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service suboffice in Nashville, Tennessee. \n     Such suboffice shall have jurisdiction over the following \n     counties in the State of Tennessee: Anderson, Bedford, \n     Bledsoe, Blount, Bradley, Campbell, Cannon, Carter, Cheatham, \n     Claiborne, Clay, Cocke, Coffee, Cumberland, Davidson, Dekalb, \n     Dickson, Fentress, Franklin, Giles, Grainger, Greene, Grundy, \n     Hamblen, Hamilton, Hancock, Hardin, Hawkins, Hickman, \n     Houston, Humphries, Jackson, Jefferson, Johnson, Knox, \n     Lawrence, Lewis, Lincoln, Loudon, Macon, Marion, Marshall, \n     Maury, McMinn, Meigs, Moore, Monroe, Montgomery, Morgan, \n     Overton, Perry, Pickett, Polk, Putnam, Rhea, Roane, \n     Robertson, Rutherford, Scott, Sevier, Sequatchie, Smith, \n     Stewart, Sullivan, Sumner, Trousdale, Unicoi, Union, Van \n     Buren, Warren, Washington, Wayne, White, Williamson, and \n     Wilson.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 440. A bill to establish a matching grant program to help State \nand local jurisdictions purchase bullet-resistant equipment for use by \nlaw enforcement departments; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing a package of four \nbills that will help improve our nation's justice system and honor \nthose law enforcement officers and firefighters who gave their lives in \nthe line of duty.\n  The first bill I am introducing is the Officer Dale Claxton Bullet \nResistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 2001, an updated version \nof legislation I introduced during the last Congress.\n\n[[Page S1781]]\n\n  This bill is named in honor of Officer Dale Claxton of Cortez, CO, a \nfine law enforcement officer and family man, who was fatally shot \nthrough the windshield of his patrol car on May 29, 1998, after \nstopping a stolen truck. His assailants turned out to be dangerous \nfugitives and a large-scale man hunt was launched. Officer Claxton was \ntragically and prematurely taken away from his wife and four children.\n  The Officer Dale Claxton Act would help law enforcement agencies \nacquire bullet resistant equipment including bullet resistant glass for \nlaw enforcement vehicles, hand-held shields and any other equipment \nthat officers may need when they serve on the front lines of law \nenforcement. Specifically, this legislation would help our nation's \nstate and local law enforcement officers acquire the bullet resistant \nequipment they need to protect themselves from would-be killers. This \nlegislation would authorize the Department of Justice's Bureau of \nJustice Assistance to administer a $40 million matching grant program \nto assist these agencies purchase bullet resistant equipment.\n  This legislation is a worthy companion, and similar in many ways, to \nthe Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, P.L. 105-181, which I \nintroduced and the President signed into law on June 16, 1998. The \nlegislation I am introducing today would help state and local law \nenforcement agencies acquire a wider array of bullet resistant \nequipment to supplement bullet proof vests.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I am personally aware of the dangers \nwhich law enforcement officers face on the front lines every day. One \nway in which the federal government can improve their safety is to help \nthem acquire bullet resistant glass and other equipment for patrol \ncars. These partnership grants are especially crucial for officers who \nserve in small local jurisdictions that often lack the funds to provide \ntheir officers with the life saving equipment they may need.\n  The second component of this legislation would launch an expedited \nand targeted research and development by authorizing $3 million over 3 \nyears for the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice, NIJ, \nto conduct research and development of a new bullet resistant \ntechnologies, such as bonded acrylic, polymers, polycarbons, aluminized \nmaterial, and transparent ceramics.\n  Promising new bullet resistant materials now being developed could be \nas revolutionary in coming years as the development of Kevlar was in \nthe 1970s for the manufacture of body armor. These exciting new \ntechnologies promise to be lighter, more versatile and hopefully less \nexpensive than traditional heavy bulletproof glass.\n  Our Nation's police officers, sheriffs and deputies regularly put \ntheir lives in harm's way as they protect the people and preserve the \npeace. They deserve to have access to the bullet resistant equipment \nthey need. The Officer Dale Claxton bill will both accelerate the \ndevelopment of new lifesaving bullet resistant technologies and then \nhelp get them deployed into the field where they are needed. Officers \nlives will be saved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Officer Dale Claxton Bullet \nResistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 2001 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 440\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Officer Dale Claxton \n     Bulletproof Police Protective Equipment Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Officer Dale Claxton of the Cortez, Colorado, Police \n     Department was shot and killed by bullets that passed through \n     the windshield of his police car after he stopped a stolen \n     truck, and his life may have been saved if his police car had \n     been equipped with bullet-resistant equipment;\n       (2) the number of law enforcement officers who are killed \n     in the line of duty would significantly decrease if every law \n     enforcement officer in the United States had access to \n     additional bullet-resistant equipment;\n       (3) according to studies, between 1990 and 2000, 1,700 law \n     enforcement officers in the United States were shot and \n     killed in the line of duty;\n       (4) the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that the \n     risk of fatality to law enforcement officers while not \n     wearing bullet-resistant equipment, such as an armor vest, is \n     14 times higher than for officers wearing an armor vest; and\n       (5) the Executive Committee for Indian Country Law \n     Enforcement Improvements reports that violent crime in Indian \n     country has risen sharply despite a decrease in the national \n     crime rate, and has concluded that there is a ``public safety \n     crisis in Indian country''.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to save lives of \n     law enforcement officers by helping State, local, and tribal \n     law enforcement agencies provide officers with bullet-\n     resistant equipment and video cameras.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The Department of Justice \nshall pay the cost of the flags, including shipping, out of \ndiscretionary grant funds, and provide them to the victim's family.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I know firsthand the risks which law \nenforcement officers face everyday on the front lines protecting our \ncommunities.

A bill to exempt qualified current and former law enforcement \nofficers from State laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed firearms \nand to allow States to enter into compacts to recognize other States' \nconcealed weapons permits; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, the third bill I am introducing today is \na bill to authorize states to recognize each other's concealed weapons \nlaws and exempt qualified current and former law enforcement officers \nfrom State laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed firearms. This \nlegislation is designed to support the rights of States and to \nfacilitate the right of law-abiding citizens as well as law enforcement \nofficers to protect themselves, their families, and their property.\n  The language of this bill is based on S. 727, which I introduced in \nthe 106th Congress. Specifically, this bill allows States to enter into \nagreements, known as ``compacts,'' to recognize the concealed weapons \nlaws of those States included in the compacts. This is not a\n\n[[Page S1783]]\n\nFederal mandate; it is strictly voluntary for those States interested \nin this approach. States would also be allowed to include provisions \nwhich best meet their needs, such as special provisions for law \nenforcement personnel.\n  Currently, a Federal standard governs the conduct of nonresidents in \nthose States that do not have a right-to-carry statute. Many of us in \nthis body have always worked to protect the interests of States and \ncommunities by allowing them to make important decisions on how their \naffairs should be conducted. We are taking to the floor almost every \nday to talk about mandating certain things to the States. This bill \nwould allow States to decide for themselves.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 442\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nto increase the maximum term of imprisonment for offenses involving \nstolen firearms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, the fourth bill I am introducing today \nis the ``Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 2001'' which would \nincrease the maximum prison sentences for violating existing stolen gun \nlaws.\n  Many crimes in our country are being committed with stolen guns. The \nextent of this problem is reflected in a number of recent studies and \nnews reports which indicate that almost half a million guns are stolen \neach year.\n  This problem is especially alarming among young people. A Justice \nDepartment study of juvenile inmates in four states shows that over 50 \npercent of those inmates had stolen a gun. In the same study, gang \nmembers and drug sellers were more likely to have stolen a gun.\n  Specifically, this bill would increase the maximum penalty for \nviolating four provisions of the firearms laws. Under title 18 of the \nU.S. Code, it is illegal to knowingly transport or ship a stolen \nfirearm or stolen ammunition. It is also illegal to knowingly receive, \npossess, conceal, store, sell, or otherwise dispose of a stolen firearm \nor stolen ammunition. The penalty for violating either of these \nprovisions is a fine, a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years, or \nboth. My bill increases the maximum prison sentence to 15 years.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of the rights of law-abiding \ngun owners. However, I firmly believe we need tough penalties for the \nillegal use of firearms.\n  The Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 2001 will send a strong \nsignal to criminals who are even thinking about stealing a firearm. I \nurge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. Preisent, I ask unanimous consent that the Stolen Gun Penalty \nEnhancement Act of 2001 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 443\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title II of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 to support teacher corps programs, and for other \npurposes; to\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if there is one thing we all can agree \non in education, it is that quality teachers are absolutely critical to \nhow well children learn. Yet, the nation confronts one of the worst \nteacher shortages in history. With expanding enrollment, decreasing \nclass size and one third of the nation's teachers nearing retirement \nage, public schools will need to hire as many as 2.2 million teachers \nover the next decade.\n  The need is greatest in specific subject areas such as mathematics, \nscience, special education and bilingual education, all important \nsubjects if the nation is to have an educated work force to keep it \ncompetitive in the world marketplace.\n  Teacher shortages are also greatest in specific geographical areas \nsuch as the inner city and rural areas. Ironically, it is the most \neducationally and socio-economically disadvantaged students that are \nunder-served. If there is one action we can take that is guaranteed to \nhelp struggling schools and children, it is to provide states and \nschool districts the means to ensure that there is a highly qualified \nteacher in every class room.\n  My bill, Teacher Corps, which I am proud to introduce today with my \ncolleagues, Senators Kennedy and Schumer, who for so long have fought \nto bring the best possible educational opportunities to all of \nAmerica's children, is designed to do just that. Its components are \nbased on a definite need and sound research concerning effective \nmechanisms for meeting that need.\n  Teacher Corps would fund collaboratives between state education \nagencies, local education agencies and institutions of higher \neducation. The collaboratives would recruit top ranked college students \nand qualified mid career individuals, who have not yet been trained as \nteachers, to teach in the nation's poorest schools in the areas of \ngreatest need--both geographically and academically. Districts and \nuniversities would work together to recruit only candidates who have an \nacademic major or extensive and substantive professional experience in \nthe subject in which they will teach.\n  The collaboratives would provide recruits a tuition free alternative \nroute to certification which includes intensive study and a teaching \ninternship. The internship would include mentoring, co-teaching and \nadvanced course work in pedagogy, state standards, technology and other \nareas.\n  After the internship period, the collaboratives would offer \nindividualized follow up training and mentoring in the first two years \nof full time teaching.\n  Corps members that become certified will be given priority in hiring \nwithin that district in exchange for a commitment to teach in low \nincome schools for 3 years.\n  A good teacher can mean the world to any child whether it is through \ncaring or through providing children with the skills they need to open \ntheir own doors to the future. Every time I enter schools in Minnesota, \nI am in awe of teachers' work. When a skilled, energetic teacher \ncreates an invigorating learning environment for his or her students it \nis truly a magical thing. In my travels to schools around Minnesota and \nthe country I see a great deal of that magic happening.\n  That is why it is so tragic to think that there are so many children \nthat do not have access to qualified teachers, at the same time that \nmany people interested in teaching are either not entering the \nprofession or are not staying there once they have qualified.\n  Teacher Corps will help meet the growing need for teachers in low \nincome urban and rural schools, and in high need subject areas such as \nmath, science, bilingual and special education.\n  It will do so because Teacher Corps is rooted in three fundamental \nparts. Recruitment, retention and innovative, flexible, high quality \ntraining programs for college graduates and mid-career professionals \nwho want to teach in high need areas.\n  The first principle is recruitment. As I mentioned before, we may \nneed to hire as many as 2.2 million new teachers in the next decade to \nensure that there are enough teachers in our schools. But, overall \nquantity is not the only issue. Quality and shortages in specific \ngeographic and curriculum areas are equally critical. While there are \nteacher surpluses in some areas, certain states and cities are facing \nacute teacher shortages. In California, 1 out of every 10 teachers \nlacks proper credentials. Fifty-eight percent of new hires in Los \nAngeles are not certified.\n  There are also crucial shortages in some subject areas such as math, \nscience, bilingual and special education. In my home state of \nMinnesota, 90 percent of principals report a serious shortage of strong \ncandidates in at least one curriculum area. Fifty-four percent of the \nmathematics teachers in the state of Idaho and 48 percent of the \nscience teachers in Florida and Tennessee did not major in the subject \nof their primary assignment.\n  The report recently released by the Commission chaired by our former \ncolleague John Glenn highlights this problem in the area of math and \nscience teaching. The Glenn Commission--in its report ominously, but \naccurately, titled ``Before It's Too Late''--called on all the \ndecision-makers in our country to establish an ongoing system to \nimprove the quality of mathematics and science teaching in our \nelementary and secondary schools and to improve the quality of those \nteachers' preparation for the classroom.\n  Teacher Corps would meet this need because it would recruit and train \nthousands of high quality teachers into the field to meet the specific \nteaching needs of local school districts.\n  It would recruit and train top college students and mid-career \nprofessionals from around the country, who increasingly want to enter \nthe teaching profession.\n\n  More college students want to enter teaching today than have wanted \nto join the profession in the past 30 years. In the surveys of incoming \ncollege students that UCLA conducts each fall, in recent years over 10 \npercent of all freshman consistently have said they want to teach in \nelementary and secondary schools.\n  Second, the design of the program ensures that the needs of local \nschool districts will be considered so that only those candidates who \nmeet the specific needs of that district will be recruited and trained. \nIf, for example, there is a shortage of special education, bilingual, \nmath and science teachers in a particular district, Teacher Corps would \ntrain people with only those skills. In setting up collaboratives in \nthis way, teacher corps helps avoid the overproduction of candidates in \nareas where they are not needed.\n  Finally, Teacher Corps gives priority to high-need rural, inner \nsuburban and urban districts to ensure that new teachers will enter \nwhere they are needed most.\n  However, it does not help to recruit teachers into high-need schools \nand train them if we cannot retain them in the profession. Teaching is \none of the hardest, most important jobs there is. We ask teachers to \nprepare our children for adulthood. We ask them to educate our children \nso that they may be productive members of society. We entrust them with \nour children's minds and with their future. It is a disgrace how little \nsupport we give them in return. It is no surprise that one of the major \ncauses of our teacher shortage is that teachers decide to change \nprofessions before retirement. Seventy-three percent of Minnesota \nteachers who leave the profession, leave for reasons other than \nretirement. In urban schools, 50 percent of teachers leave the field \nwithin five years of when they start teaching.\n  To retain high quality teachers in the profession, we must give \nteachers the support they deserve. Teachers, like doctors, need \nmentoring and support during the first years of their professional \nlife. Teacher Corps offers new teachers the training, mentoring and \nsupport they need to meet the profession's many challenges. It includes \nmethods of support that have proven effective in ensuring that teachers \nstay in schools. The key elements for effective teacher retention were \nlaid out by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future in \n1996. Effective programs organize professional development around \nstandards for teachers and students; provide a year long, pre-service \ninternship; include mentoring and strong evaluation of teacher skills; \noffer stable, high quality professional development.\n\n[[Page S1785]]\n\n  Each of these criteria are included in the Teacher Corps program.\n  Further, Teacher Corps supports people who choose teaching by paying \nfor their training. Through this financial and professional support, \nTeacher Corps will go a long way toward keeping recruits in teaching.\n  But, it is still not enough to recruit and retain teachers. Quality \nmust be of primary importance. Research shows that the most important \npredictor of student success is not income, but the quality of the \nteacher. Despite this need, studies show that as the proportion of \nstudents of color and students from low-income families increases in \nschools, the test scores of teachers decline.\n  This is wrong. We are denying children from low income areas, \nchildren from racial minorities, children with limited English \nproficiency, access to what we know works. Several studies have shown \nthat if poor and minority students are taught by high quality teachers \nat the same rate as other students, a large part of the gap between \npoor and minority students and their more affluent white counterparts \nwould disappear. For example, one Alabama study shows that an increase \nof one standard deviation in teacher test scores leads to a two-third \nreduction in the gap between black/white tests scores.\n  We cannot turn our back on this knowledge. We must act on it. We must \ngive low income, minority and limited English proficiency children the \nsame opportunities that all children have and we must do it now.\n  The very essence of Teacher Corps is to funnel high quality teachers \nwhere they are needed most. Teacher Corps would help ensure quality by \nusing a selective, competitive recruitment process. It would provide \nhigh quality training, professional development, mentoring and \nevaluations of corps member performance, all of which have been proven \nto increase the quality of the teaching force and the achievement of \nthe students they teach.\n  Further, by creating strong connections between universities and \ndistricts and by implementing effective professional development \nprojects within districts, we are setting up powerful structures to \nbenefit all teachers and students.\n  We have an opportunity to do what we know works to help children who \nneed our help most. Good teachers have an extraordinary impact on \nchildren's lives and learning. We need to be sure that all children \nhave access to such teachers and all children have the opportunity to \nlearn so that all children may take advantage of the many opportunities \nthis country provides.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 445. A bill to provide for local family information centers, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President: I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will go a long way to increase the accountability of our schools \nand to help parents become more involved in their children's education. \nWe all know that families are crucial to improving our nation's \nschools. To ensure that schools and students meet challenging \neducational goals, families must be involved. Parents must insist that \ntheir children get the best education. They must understand, shape and \nsupport the reforms in their schools; and, they must work with schools \nto help all children meet their goals.\n  We know that when families are fully engaged in the educational \nprocess, students have: higher grades and test scores; better \nattendance and more homework done; fewer placements in special \neducation; more positive attitudes and behavior; higher graduation \nrates; and greater enrollment in post-secondary education.\n  For school reforms to help all children, we must move to ensure that \nall parents are involved in their children's education. For many \nparents, this is not an easy task. Parents, particularly those who have \nlimited English proficiency, those who are homeless, or those who have \na troubled history with the school system, often need outside help to \nget the information, support, and training they need to help their \nchildren navigate through the school system.\n  Parent involvement is more important now than ever before. As we move \nin the direction of increased accountability, high stakes testing and \nexpanded public school choice, it is critical that parents know \neverything that is required of them and their children. They need to be \nsure that they have access to every aspect of their child's schooling, \nor their child could easily be left behind.\n  Current provisions in Title I of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act provide for excellent and important ways for parents to \nget involved in their children's education. However, in some cases, \nparent involvement of the type envisioned by Title I remains a distant \ngoal. Many Title I schools, though not all, have failed to fully bring \nparents into the development of parent involvement policies, school-\nparent compacts, and into planning and improvement for the school as \nprovided for in Title I. Therefore, it is essential for families to \nhave an independent source of information and support that they \nunderstand and trust so that they can participate in an informed and \neffective manner and help move the schools toward the goal of full \nparental participation.\n  To achieve this critical end, this legislation would provide \ncompetitive grants to community-based organizations to establish Local \nFamily Information Centers. These centers, made up of community members \nas well as professionals from the Title I schools in the area, should \nhave a track record of effective outreach and work with low income \ncommunities. They, in consultation with the school district, would \ndevelop a plan to provide parents with the full support that they need \nto be partners in their children's education. For example, they would \nhelp parents understand standards, tests, and accountability systems; \nsupport activities that are likely to improve student achievement in \nTitle I schools; understand and analyze data that schools, districts, \nand states must provide under reporting requirements of ESEA and other \nlaws; understand and participate in the implementation of parent \ninvolvement requirements of ESEA, including; understand school choice \noptions; and, communicate effectively with school personnel.\n  This legislation is essential because it would reach and assist \nparents most isolated from participation by poverty, race, limited \nEnglish proficiency and other factors. It is essential because \nultimately, it should be parents that are the greatest lever for strong \naccountability in schools. It is essential because of what we know \nabout how children learn--that children who are the farthest behind \nmake the greatest gains when their parents are part of their school \nlife.\n  Many schools do a very good job of involving parents in education \nreform. This bill does nothing but ensure that parents have the option \nof an independent voice in districts where schools do not do such a \ngood job. If we are to educate our children, we must also educate and \nempower their parents. This legislation provides one necessary means to \ndo so.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 446. A bill to preserve the authority of States over water within \ntheir boundaries, to delegate to States the authority of Congress to \nregulate water, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the State Water \nSovereignty Protection Act, a bill to preserve the authority of the \nStates over waters within their boundaries, to delegate the authority \nof the Congress to the States to regular water, and for other purposes.\n  Since 1866, Congress has recognized and deferred to the States the \nauthority to allocate and administer water within their borders. The \nSupreme Court has confirmed that this is an appropriate role for the \nStates. Additionally, in 1952, the Congress passed the McCarran \namendment which provides for the adjudication of State and Federal \nWater claims in State water courts.\n  However, despite both judicial and legislative edicts, I am deeply \nconcerned that the administration, Federal agencies, and some in the \nCongress are setting the stage for ignoring long established statutory \nprovisions concerning State water rights and State water contracts. The \nEndangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, the Federal Land Policy \nManagement Act, and\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\nwilderness designations have all been vehicles used to erode State \nsovereignty over it water.\n  It is imperative that States maintain sovereignty over management and \ncontrol of their water and water systems. All rights to water or \nreservations of rights for any purpose in States should be subject to \nthe substantive and procedural laws of that State, not the Federal \nGovernment. To protect State water rights, I am introducing the State \nWater Sovereignty Protection Act.\n  The State Water Sovereignty Protection Act provide that whenever the \nUnited States seeks to appropriate water or acquire a water right, it \nwill be subject to State procedural and substantive water law. The Act \nfurther holds that States control the water within their boundaries and \nthat the Federal Government may exercise management or control over \nwater only in compliance with State law. Finally, in any administrative \nor judicial proceeding in which the United States participates pursuant \nto the McCarran Amendment, the United States is subject to all costs \nand fees to the same extend as costs and fees may be imposed on a \nprivate party.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Craig and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 447. A bill to subject the United States to imposition of fees and \ncosts in proceedings relating to State water rights adjudications; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Water Adjudication \nFee Fairness Act of 2001. This bill would require the federal \ngovernment to pay the same filing fees and costs associated with state \nwater rights' adjudications as is currently required of states and \nprivate parties.\n  To establish relative rights to water--water that is the lifeblood of \nmany states, particularly in the west--states must conduct lengthy, \ncomplicated, and expensive proceedings in water rights' adjudications. \nIn 1952, Congress recognized the necessity and benefit of requiring \nfederal claims to be adjudicated in these state proceedings by adopting \nthe McCarran amendment. The McCarran amendment waives the sovereign \nimmunity of the United States and requires the federal government to \nsubmit to state court jurisdiction and to file water rights' claims in \nstate general adjudication proceedings.\n  These federal claims are typically among the most complicated and \nlargest of claims in state adjudications, and federal agencies are \noften the primary beneficiary of adjudication proceedings where states \nofficially quantify and record their water rights. However, in 1992, \nthe United States Supreme Court held that, under existing law, the U.S. \nneed not pay fees for processing federal claims.\n  When the United States does not pay a proportionate share of the \ncosts associated with adjudications, the burden of funding the \nproceedings unfairly shifts to other water users and often delays \ncompletion of the adjudications by diminishing the resources necessary \nto complete them. Delays in completing adjudications result in the \ninability to protect private and public property interests or determine \nhow much unappropriated water may remain to satisfy important \nenvironmental and economic development priorities.\n  Additionally, because they are not subject to fees and costs like \nother water users in the adjudication, federal agencies can file \nquestionable claims without facing court costs, inflating the number of \ntheir claims for future negotiation purposes. This creates an unlevel \nplaying field favoring the federal agencies and places a further \nfinancial and resources burden on the system.\n  For example, in the Snake River Basin adjudication, which is in Idaho \nand is probably the largest water adjudication proceeding in the \ncountry, the United States Forest Service filed more than 3,700 federal \nclaims. The Idaho Department of Water Resources expended thousands of \ndollars giving notice to all other claimants, additionally the State of \nIdaho and private claimants spent over $800,000 preparing objections to \nthe Federal Service's claims. On the eve of the objection deadline, the \nUS withdrew all but 71 of the claims--the Department of Justice's \nexplanation: litigation strategy.\n  This example is not an isolated incident. At best, the taxpayers and \nstates should not be forced to incur these costs simply because the \nagency does not take the time to seriously evaluate its claims. At \nworst, the taxpayers should not bear the brunt of the federal \ngovernment's Machiavellian tactics.\n  I recognize that the federal government has a legitimate right to \nsome reserved water rights; however, the federal government should play \nby the same rules as the states and other private users. The Water \nAdjudication Fee Fairness Act is legislation that remedies this \nsituation by subjecting the United States, when party to a general \nadjudication, to the same fees and costs as state and private users in \nwater rights adjudications.\n  This measure has the full support of the Western States Water Council \nand the Western Governor's Association. I ask my colleagues to join me \nin supporting water users, taxpayers, the states, and welcome their co-\nsponsorship.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Water Adjudication Fee \n     Fairness Act of 2001''.\n\n      SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Generally, water allocation in the western United \n     States is based upon the doctrine of prior appropriation, \n     under which water users' rights are quantified under State \n     law. Appropriative rights carry designated priority dates \n     that establish the relative right of priority to use water \n     from a source. Most States in the West have developed \n     judicial and administrative proceedings, often called general \n     adjudications, to quantify and document these relative \n     rights, including the rights to water claimed by the United \n     States Government under either State or Federal law.\n       (2) State general adjudications are typically complicated, \n     expensive civil court and administrative actions that can \n     involve hundreds or even thousands of claimants. Such \n     adjudications give certainty to water rights, provide \n     direction for water administration, and reduce conflict over \n     water allocation and water usage. Those claiming and \n     establishing rights to water are the primary beneficiaries of \n     State general adjudication proceedings.\n       (3) The Congress has recognized the benefits of the State \n     general adjudication system, and by enactment of section 208 \n     of the Department of Justice Appropriation Act, 1953 (43 \n     U.S.C. 666; popularly known as the ``McCarran Amendment''), \n     required the United States to submit to State court \n     jurisdiction and to file claims in State general adjudication \n     proceedings.\n       (4) Water rights claims by Federal agencies under either \n     State or Federal law are often the largest or most complex \n     claims in State general adjudications. However, the United \n     States Supreme Court, in the case United States v. Idaho, 508 \n     U.S. 1 (1992), determined that the McCarran Amendment does \n     not require the United States to pay some filing fees simply \n     because they were misconstrued or perceived to be the same as \n     costs taxed against all parties.\n       (5) Since Federal agency water rights claims are among the \n     most difficult to adjudicate, and since the United States is \n     not required to pay some fees and costs paid by non-Federal \n     claimants, the burden of funding adjudication proceedings \n     unfairly shifts to private water users and State taxpayers.\n       (6) The lack of Federal Government funding to support State \n     water rights adjudications in relation to the complexity of \n     the claims involved has produced significant delays in \n     completion of many State general adjudications. These delays \n     inhibit the ability of both the States and Federal agencies \n     to protect private and public property interests. Also, \n     failure to complete the final adjudication of claims to water \n     restricts the ability of resource managers to determine how \n     much unappropriated water is available to satisfy \n     environmental and economic development demands.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIABILITY OF UNITED STATES FOR FEES AND COSTS IN \n                   WATER USE RIGHTS PROCEEDINGS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any State administrative or judicial \n     proceeding for the adjudication or administration of rights \n     to the use of water in which the United States is a party, \n     the United States shall be subject to the imposition of fees \n     and costs on its claims to water rights under either State or \n     Federal law to the same extent as a private party to the \n     proceeding.\n       (b) Application.--Subsection (a) shall apply to proceedings \n     pending on or initiated after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, including with respect to fees and costs imposed in such \n     a proceeding before the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Report to Congress.--The head of any Federal agency \n     that files or has pending any\n\n[[Page S1787]]\n\n     water rights claim shall prepare and submit to the Congress, \n     within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, a report \n     that identifies--\n       (1) each such claim filed by the agency that has not yet \n     been decreed;\n       (2) all fees and costs imposed on the United States for \n     each claim identified under paragraph (1);\n       (3) any portion of such fees and costs that has not been \n     paid; and\n       (4) the source of funds used to pay such fees and costs.\n       (d) Fees and Costs Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``fees and costs'' means any administrative fee, \n     administrative cost, claim fee, judicial fee, or judicial \n     cost imposed by a State on a party claiming a right to the \n     use of water under either State or Federal law in a State \n     proceeding referred to in subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 448. A bill to provide permanent appropriations to the Radiation \nExposure Compensation Trust Fund to make payments under the Radiation \nExposure Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210 note); to the Committee on \nAppropriations.\n  S. 449. A bill to ensure the timely payment of benefits to eligible \npersons under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210); \nto the Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills that \nwill provide full funding for the Radiation Exposure Compensation Trust \nFund.\n  One of the unfortunate consequences of our country's rapid \ndevelopment of its nuclear weapons programs was that many of those who \nworked in the early uranium mines became afflicted with debilitating \nand too often deadly diseases, including various cancers and \nrespiratory illnesses.\n  These miners and their families lived under tough conditions. Some \nlived in one-room houses located as close as 200 feet from the mine \nshafts. Their children played near the mines and their families drank \nunderground water that exposed them to radiation. The miners endured \nlong, uncomfortable days many feet underground.\n  One such miner was Paul Hicks, for whom this bill is named. Mr. Hicks \nof Grants, NM was a uranium miner for twelve years in New Mexico. He \nlater worked as lead miner, a shift boss, and ended his career as a \nmine foreman. Paul was the President of the New Mexico Uranium Miners \nCouncil and he championed the fight on behalf of miners of the Najavo \nNation, Acoma Pueblo, Grants, NM, Dove Creek, and Grand Junction, CO. \nUnfortunately, Paul passed away from bone cancer last year.\n  Although Paul is no longer with us, his voice on behalf of uranium \nminers will forever be heard. As long as I'm in the United States \nSenate I will carry his torch until justice for all uranium miners is \nrealized.\n  Paul was not alone in his suffering. Other New Mexico uranium miners \nhave been stricken by radiation-related diseases. Indeed, many of these \nminers were Native Americans--primarily from the Najavo Nation. As many \nas 1,500 Navajos worked in the uranium mines from 1947-1971.\n  To these Americans, the Federal government owes a special duty of \ncare. The government has a longstanding trust relationship with Native \nAmericans based on treaties and agreements. I regret to say that as for \nthe Najavo miners our government has failed miserably in protecting \nthis trust relationship.\n\n  After all, these Native American miners and all uranium miners helped \nbuild our nuclear arsenal--the arsenal that is, at least in part, \nresponsible for ending the Cold War. Our nation owes them a debt of \ngratitude. Yet, despite their enormous sacrifice, the federal \ngovernment failed to protect their health. The government had adequate \nwarning about the radiation hazards associated with uranium mining. \nNonetheless, prior to federal regulations in 1971, the miners were sent \ninto poorly ventilated mines with almost no warnings about the dangers \nof radiation.\n  After a 13-year fight we finally passed legislation to rectify this \ninjustice in 1990. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act was intended \nto provide fair and swift compensation for those miners, federal \nworkers, and downwinders who had contracted certain radiation-related \nillnesses.\n  Since 1990, more than 3500 claims have been paid by the federal \ngovernment under RECA. However, by mid-2000 the fund had run dry.\n  The bottom line is that there is not enough money for the RECA trust \nfund. In fact, the Justice Department, who administers this program, \nhas been sending IOU's to individuals who have already been approved \nfor benefits.\n  Frankly, this is unconscionable. Those who helped protect our \nnation's security through their work on our nuclear programs must be \ncompensated for the enormous price they paid. Anything less is \nunacceptable.\n  Senator Hatch and I propose a bill seeking $84 million in emergency \nsupplemental appropriations to pay those claims that have already been \napproved as well as the projected number of approved claims for FY \n2001. We are also introducing legislation to make all future payments \nfor approved claims mandatory.\n  With this legislation, we will ensure that those who gave so much for \nour nation will at least receive their deserved benefits. We must never \nagain let their sacrifice go unanswered.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Department of Justice \nIOU letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                               Civil Division,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Re RECA Claim No. 201\n     Claimant: ------ ------\n       Dear Mr. ------ ------. I am pleased to inform you that \n     your claim for compensation under the Radiation Exposure \n     Compensation Act has been approved. Regretfully, because the \n     money available to pay claims has been exhausted, we are \n     unable to send a compensation payment to you at this time. \n     When Congress provides additional funds, we will contact you \n     to commence the payment process.\n       Thank you for your understanding.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Gerard W. Fischer,\n\n                                               Assistant Director,\n                                     Torts Branch, Civil Division.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am joining with my esteemed \ncolleague and chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, in \nintroducing two pieces of legislation that will ensure the full funding \nof the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, RECA, Trust Fund.\n  As the original sponsor of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of \n1990 and the subsequent amendments to the Act, S. 1515 which was \nenacted last year, I am pleased that this program has provided much \nneeded compassionate compensation to thousands of individuals. And, \nalthough many RECA eligible individuals have received compensation, it \nis now apparent that a funding shortfall exists within the program \nresulting in hundreds of individuals not receiving their payments.\n  The legislation Senator Domenici and I are introducing today is \ndesigned to meet the funding shortfall so that all eligible individuals \nwho are approved for compensation will receive their payment and not an \n``IOU'' from the Justice Department.\n  The first bill ensures the timely payment of benefits to eligible \npersons by providing $84 million to the RECA Trust Fund for fiscal year \n2001. The money will be available to the Justice Department to fund the \nexisting claims that have already been processed as well as anticipated \nclaims of the remainder of this fiscal year.\n  The second bill provides for a permanent appropriation to the RECA \nTrust Fund beginning in fiscal year 2002, and thereafter, such sums as \nmay be necessary to meet the financial obligations of approved claims.\n  Both of these bills are needed in order to pay those individuals who \nhave qualified under the original 1990 Act and the RECA 2000 \namendments, as signed into law last July 10, 2000, but who have not \nreceived their payment because the fund is currently depleted. \nMoreover, as a result of the passage of RECA 2000, we have extended \ncompensation to additional deserving citizens who have suffered \nmightily as a result of the cold war atomic testing programs.\n  In addition, the legislation we are introducing today provides that \nfunding for the RECA trust fund be made through a permanent \nappropriation. This provision will provide certainty and stability in \nfinancing the trust fund and, thereby, ensure eligible individuals \nreceive their compensation.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Senator Domenici, for his commitment to\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\nresolving this very difficult problem that many individuals are now \nfacing. It is simply unfair for the federal government to promise \ncompensation to harmed individuals and then tell these same people that \nthere are no federal dollars to pay their claims. This situation is \ncompletely unacceptable.\n  I would also like to add, in this context, that within the next few \nweeks I will be introducing additional legislation that will not only \ncomplement the bills introduced today but also provide for necessary \nrefinements and technical changes to improve the administration of the \nRECA program. I will have more to say about this legislation when it is \nintroduced within the next several weeks.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these important \nmeasures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 450. A bill to amend the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to provide for \nenhanced protection of nonpublic personal information, including health \ninformation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  S. 451. A bill to establish civil and criminal penalties for the sale \nor purchase of a social security number; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ngrave concern about the administration's decision that apparently \nfavors the interests of big insurance companies over the health privacy \nrights of Americans.\n  I was dismayed to learn on Tuesday that the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services prevented new medical privacy rules from coming into \neffect. In essence, these rules would have prevented doctors and \ninsurers from sharing private medical information about their patients.\n  The delay ostensibly is to allow further discussion. But it makes no \nsense. The rules have been debated in Washington for nearly 10 years. \nThe Secretary's decision was unfortunate. There are no acceptable \nexcuses for their delay. Consumers deserve to have their personally \nidentifiable information protected from prying eyes.\n  I promised the people of my State in the course of the last 6 to 8 \nmonths of the discussion in the course of the campaign that I would \nmake protecting their privacy one of my top priorities, because too \noften these days, personally identifiable medical and financial \ninformation is being shared, bought, or sold, and it is being done \nwithout the consent of the consumer. This practice must stop. It is our \njob to pass legislation that will stop it.\n  Today, I am going to be introducing two bills that begin to address \naspects of the privacy crisis. Both bills build upon the undeniable \nprinciple that information gathered for one purpose should never be \ndisclosed, made available, or otherwise used for another purpose \nwithout the consumer's consent.\n  Clearly, we should be able to share information with our doctor that \nwe don't want revealed to other people, particularly an employer or a \nmoney lender. I am going to work hard to try to pass these privacy \nprotections for every American.\n  The first bill prohibits banks and financial institutions from \nselling or sharing private customer information. I strongly believe \nthat financial institutions should not be allowed to pass along \nconfidential customer, financial, or medical information to affiliates, \nbusiness partners, or others who wish to turn a profit from an \nindividual's personal data.\n  I have a little bit of background in this because 6 years ago, when I \nhad the privilege of being the elected insurance commissioner of the \nState of Florida, there was a case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court \nentitled Barnett Banks v. Bill Nelson, in my capacity as insurance \ncommissioner. The issue was on a technical question of a 1916 Federal \nlaw as to whether or not banks could sell insurance. The Court ruled, \non the basis of that law, that it pertained to the business of \ninsurance, the upshot of which was that banks could sell insurance. In \nour argument, we noted that if that occurred, there was always the \npossibility that you had to protect against coercion and protect \nagainst privacy rights being invaded.\n  As a result of that unanimous Supreme Court decision, Congress then, \nin 1999, enacted the Financial Services Modernization Act. In the 11th \nhour of the closing of the session in October, the promise was made \nthat, if you can pass this bill now, we will come back next year--the \nyear 2000--and enact the privacy protections. That promise was not \nfulfilled in the year 2000.\n\n  For under the present condition of the law, there is a gaping \nloophole on privacy protection. In an era of mergers, under the new \nlaw, banks can now join with insurance companies and then evaluate the \nmedical information of their affiliates' policyholders before deciding \nwhether or not to issue a loan.\n  What my legislation will do is require the express written consent of \nthe consumer before any personally identifiable medical information can \nbe shared or sold, and the express consent of the consumer before any \npersonally identifiable financial information can be shared or sold.\n  For the consumer, privacy should always be the assumption. To prevent \ncoercion, this legislation I am introducing prohibits banks and \nfinancial companies from denying service to customers who refuse to \nconsent to the sale of their personally identifiable financial and \nmedical information. To make sure financial institutions take this law \nseriously, under the legislation, officers of the company can incur \npersonal liability for failing to comply.\n  This is a serious problem: the invasion of our privacy under the \ncurrent condition of the law. It demands a serious remedy. I am going \nto be encouraging all of our colleagues to join with me and fulfill the \npromise that the Congress made in 1999 in the enactment of the \nFinancial Services Modernization Act by plugging this gaping loophole \nwhere there is no privacy protection.\n  There is a second bill that I am introducing today. It makes the \nselling or purchasing of an individual's Social Security number a \nFederal crime. Social Security numbers are often the key to unlocking \nvast stores of personal information, both in the private sector and the \nFederal Government. If there is any personal identification number, it \nis the Social Security number. We look all around us and we see that \nidentity theft has grown at an alarming rate during the past decade--in \nmany cases, through the Social Security number abuse.\n  My goodness, we have heard of credit cards being established in \nsomebody else's name by the theft of their Social Security number and \nrunning up huge bills. We have heard these stories over and over, and \neven the confusion caused by identity theft, where crimes are reported \nto be attributed to an individual who does not have anything to do with \nit.\n  When a Social Security number falls into the wrong hands, tremendous \nfinancial and personal damage can be incurred. To tackle this terrible \nproblem, this legislation that I am introducing today establishes \ncriminal and monetary penalties. The bill creates both prison terms and \nfines of up to $100,000 for buying or selling Social Security numbers.\n  I hope in this field of privacy protection that the Senate is going \nto ultimately fulfill the promise that it made 2 years ago and move \nquickly in this session to protect the privacy of our American \ncitizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of both bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 450\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
