Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of the Murray amendment No. 378 \nunder which there will be 120 minutes equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to yield myself about 15 \nminutes. It can go either way.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator from Tennessee wants to begin, that is \nOK. I will go after the Senator finishes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 378\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  I rise to speak to the underlying amendment about which we will be \ntalking over the course of the morning and on which we will be voting \non this afternoon shortly after 2 o'clock. It is a very important \namendment, one which we talked about over the last several days--in \nfact, into last week--an amendment that deserves this time, that \ndeserves the debate, that deserves the discussion that has been put \nforth.\n  I say that because it really does strike, I believe, at a fundamental \nprinciple that distinguishes much of the debate around education today. \nIt strikes right at the heart of an understanding of what is in the \nunderlying bill as well as in the amendment which is being proposed to \nthat bill.\n  The principle is one of freedom, and we feel very strongly that local \ncommunities, local needs, must dictate what we do here in Washington, \nthrough our Federal legislation. We feel strongly that Washington must \ngive local communities--schools, school districts--the opportunity to \nidentify their particular needs or deficiencies. And, yes, it takes \ntesting in many ways to identify the different types of students--that \nis in the underlying bill. But we must also identify needs such as \nnumber of teachers, teacher quality, classroom size, the environment in \nwhich the teacher-pupil relationship is cultivated and maximized so \nachievement is boosted to the largest degree possible. And it really \ndoes, to my mind, boil down to freedom, the freedom, the flexibility, \nthe opportunity to identify those local needs and to satisfy them as \nthey see fit at the local level.\n  Again, it goes to the heart of much of what is in this bill because \nthere are disparities all over the country, and the degree of education \nsuccess is, in part, dependent on location. That needs to be addressed. \nAnd I think it is best addressed at the local level. That is what we \nwould like to do, and that is what is in the underlying bill.\n  In the bill--and again I encourage our colleagues to go and look at \nwhat is in the underlying bill--we try to allow school districts to \nhave that choice, to use the resources available either for class size \nor for teacher development, professional development, again focusing on \nwhat goes on in that classroom between that teacher and that student.\n  The goal is to boost student achievement. What is needed in Alamo, \nTN, might be different than what is needed in Manhattan, or the Bronx, \nor down in Fort Lauderdale, FL. One school might need class size \nreduction if the classes are very large in certain subjects. Another \nschool might need a better and higher quality teacher in that \nclassroom.\n  The underlying bill takes those two components of teacher quality and \nclass size, pools those resources, and says to local communities and to \nlocal school districts: You choose as to which of those areas you need \nto apply those resources to boost student achievement.\n  I think it is very important because class size in some cases can be \nvery important. We all know that. If you happen to be in a State or a \ncommunity where class size is very large in certain subjects, I think \nit is very important that class size be reduced. Other parts of the \ncountry might have already reduced class size down to an appropriate \nlevel, in their judgement, and they prefer the freedom to use that \nclass size reduction money, and teacher development money, to recruit \nteachers or attract teachers by paying them more, or by encouraging \ntheir professional development.\n  What we want to do is give local school districts the freedom to \nspend the money in a way that they believe will best increase student \nachievement.\n  School districts should have the flexibility to decide whether to use \nthat money for class size or for teacher development. That is very \nsimple. That is what we have heard laid out in the bill. It is very \nimportant for people to understand that it is that flexibility, that \nlocal identification of need, that principle, on which we are voting at \n2:20 today. We fundamentally believe school districts should be given \nmaximum freedom and flexibility as to how they use those funds.\n  Again, it is important to understand the underlying bill. Basically, \nwe pool these resources from class size reduction and teacher \ndevelopment and put them together. We give that local school district \nthe opportunity to use them in the best way they see fit.\n  Over the last several days we have talked a lot about cost \neffectiveness of our education dollars to get the very best bang for \nthe buck, the very best outcome and achievement for the dollars \ninvested. When you look at it that way, in terms of cost effectiveness \nof the dollars being invested in education, that is what we are doing \nin the underlying bill. We are becoming not education spenders but \neducation investors by investing in the system and investing in that \nflexibility and local control.\n  For every dollar invested, it is important to look at what sort of \noutcome you achieve. If we say school districts shouldn't be forced to \ndownsize classes, and recognize that some have downsized the class size \nalready, then you can ask how effective is each of those dollars \ninvested in terms of cost effectiveness.\n  It is interesting, if you go back and look at the studies which \nexamine at all sorts of different and independent variables regarding \nboosting student achievement, class size does not come at the top or \neven in the middle but further down on that list. In fact, in many of \nthese studies, it is the least effective reform, but it is coupled with \nthe very highest price tag. So in terms of dollars invested, the effect \nis it falls to the lower end of those scales.\n  Studies have found that class size can be among the least effective \neducational investment, especially when you compare it to something \nlike teacher education or teacher development--providing teachers with \nthe resources they need to become better teachers, or to become better \neducated, for example, to become a real specialist in the field they \nare teaching.\n\n  Again, I don't want to overplay this because I, for one, think class \nsize is an important variable, but I think it is important to recognize \nthat is addressed in the underlying bill. The resources are there. We \nare simply saying to give the local community the flexibility to use \nthose dollars in a way that gives the biggest bang for the buck \ninvested.\n  What is the No. 1 variable in many of these studies? If you look \noutside of parental involvement, which again we encourage in the \nunderlying bill, it is to have a highly qualified teacher in the \nclassroom--not the size of the classroom but a highly qualified \nteacher.\n  One recent study conducted at the University of Rochester examined \nmore than 300 studies on the impact of class size reduction and found \nthat it is the quality of the teacher which is much more important than \nthe absolute class size. The National Commission on Teaching & \nAmerica's Future found that teacher education is five times as \neffective for each dollar invested as is class size.\n  All of us can remember our own teachers when we were young and the \nimpact that a high-quality teacher has in the classroom. It is a \nlasting impact. A smaller classroom has an effect--a here and now \neffect--but it doesn't have the lasting effect that a highly qualified \nteacher does in the classroom.\n  A study done in Tennessee found that the impact of a high-quality \nteacher continues for at least two years after the student has left \nthat teacher.\n  Bill Saunders, who has been quoted again and again on this floor, \ndetermined that the percentile difference\n\n[[Page S4903]]\n\nbetween the student who has 3 years of high-quality teaching versus 3 \nyears of poor quality teaching could mean the difference between a \nstudent that is enrolled in a remedial class versus an honors class--\nagain, underscoring the critical importance of not just having more \nteachers in the classroom but having high-quality teachers in the \nclassroom.\n  Over the last week or so we have talked a lot about the shortage of \nhigh-quality teachers. The fact is that more than 25 percent of new \nteachers enter our Nation's schools poorly qualified to teach.\n  We talked a little bit about the studies that have shown that mastery \nin a subject area is the most tangible teacher quality. When you look \nat that measure, we are simply not doing as good a job as we should.\n  Many teachers either lack a major or minor in the subject they are \nteaching. Fifty-six percent of physics and chemistry teachers lack a \nmajor or a minor. Thirty-four percent of English teaches lack a major \nor minor. And 34 percent of math teachers lack a major or minor.\n  It is important for people to understand that compulsory class size--\nfocusing just on class size--can exacerbate the problem of having a \nshortage of high quality teachers.\n  Over the past week, we talked about a little bit about California's \nexperiment with compulsory class size. It led to many credentialed \nteachers coming into the classroom. It led to underqualified teachers, \nand an increase in teacher aides rather than teachers in the \nclassroom--all providing direct instruction to students. This hit \nespecially hard in the underserved areas in inner-city schools, and in \nrural schools.\n  Where is the impact? I think the impact of declining teacher quality \nhas been greatest in low-income schools, if you look at the studies \naltogether. That is where the percentage of qualified teachers has \ndropped nationwide--but specifically in the California studies.\n  The third point that I would like to make is that there is no need \ntoday for compulsory class size reduction. Again, it comes back to this \nopportunity of freedom to choose class size reduction, if you want, or \nto spend those moneys on training teachers.\n  I mentioned that it is important to understand what is in the \nunderlying bill. In the bill we have combined professional development \nwith class size money. Teacher quality and teacher recruitment varies \nfrom community to community. It varies from district to district. We \nwant to have that right balance between class size and having a good \nhigh quality teacher in the room. That is why we chose to pool those \ntwo resources together and allow that local school and that local \nschool district to choose either a combination of both of those, or one \nversus the other.\n  The underlying bill permits school districts to use Federal dollars \nto recruit high-quality teachers.\n  The underlying bill supports school efforts to establish incentive \nprograms such as differential pay to attract, hire and keep highly \nqualified and knowledgeable teachers.\n  The underlying bill contains specific provisions for recruitment. It \nsupports efforts to recruit individuals who have careers outside of \nteaching but whose life experience provide a solid foundation for \nteaching.\n  The underlying bill also looks at the issue of class size, support \nschools in hiring teachers, reduce class size, if they so desire it, \nand to address the teacher shortages in particular grades in subject \nareas.\n  The underlying bill addresses the issue of teacher development and \npromoting teacher reforms, including mentoring and master teachers.\n  The underlying bill looks at issues, such as alternative \ncredentialing programs.\n  The underlying bill addresses teacher opportunity payments, allowing \nfunds to go directly to teachers so they can choose their own \nprofessional development.\n  In conclusion, I want to make it very clear from at least my \nstandpoint, and on our side of the aisle, that we are not opposed to \nclass size reduction. Again, I for one think that an appropriate class \nsize and appropriate ratios, depending on where you are in the subject \nmatter, is important. I point out, many areas in many regions have \nalready addressed this particular issue. Secondly, the underlying bill \npermits States and school districts to use those pooled Federal funds \nin the best way they see fit.\n\n  We increase the number of high-quality teachers by promoting \ninnovative teacher reforms, including alternative certification, merit \npay, and the list I just mentioned.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the Murray amendment. Again, it will \nbe a very important vote that we take at 2:20 today because I think it \ndoes move us in the wrong direction: less choice, less freedom for our \nlocal communities, less flexibility, and less attention to local needs.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment \nlater today and look forward to participating in the debate as we go \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I rise, once again, to urge my \ncolleagues to continue our commitment to help our schools reduce \nclassroom overcrowding.\n  Before I begin, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators \nbe added as cosponsors to my amendment: Senators Levin, Mikulski, and \nSchumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we all want to improve education. In the \nlast few years we have made a lot of progress. In fact, thanks to our \ncommitment at the Federal level, local schools have now hired about \n34,000 new highly qualified teachers.\n  Because of our investment over the last 3 years, almost 2 million \nstudents are learning in less crowded classrooms today. That is because \nof the Federal commitment we have had. Those kids are learning the \nbasics. They have fewer distractions and fewer discipline problems. \nIsn't that what we want for all of our kids?\n  Over the last 3 years we have done the responsible thing by \nsupporting what works. But the underlying bill, despite the rhetoric \nyou have just heard, takes a very different approach. It breaks our \ncommitment to investing in smaller classes. I can tell you as a parent, \nas a former educator, and as a former school board member, it is the \nwrong way to go. We should be building on our progress. That is why I \nam offering this amendment today.\n  In just a few hours we are going to vote on this amendment. So I want \nto talk about some of the arguments we have heard throughout the debate \nlast week and today and probably we will hear more of today.\n  First, we have heard that smaller classes do not really make a \ndifference. Let me tell you, any parent or any teacher knows better. \nThe first questions parents ask their kids when they come home from \nschool on the first day in September are: Who is your teacher? And how \nmany kids are in your classroom? Parents know it makes a difference on \nhow many kids are in that classroom as to whether their child is going \nto have a successful year or not.\n  It is not just parents and it is not just teachers. Research, over \nand over again, has shown us that smaller classes help children \nsucceed. The Tennessee Project STAR--Student/Teacher Achievement \nRatio--study has consistently demonstrated that reducing class sizes in \nK-3 to 13 to 17 students significantly increases children's reading and \nmathematics scores. And the biggest gains have been found for poor and \nminority students--those children who are most in danger of being left \nbehind.\n  Studies have shown that the children in those smaller classes in the \nearly grades were: More likely to take college entrance exams, more \nlikely to finish high school, more likely to enroll in college, less \nlikely to become teen parents, and less likely to go to jail.\n  In the last month two new studies that have been released \ninterpreting the STAR study have concluded that smaller classes produce \nsignificant benefits. One joint study by researchers from Tennessee \nState University and the University of Chicago found significant \nincreases in ninth grade math test scores among students who had spent \ntheir early grades in smaller classes, with the gains even more \npronounced among minority students.\n  Robert Reichardt, a researcher with Mid-continent Research for \nEducation\n\n[[Page S4904]]\n\nand Learning, concluded in yet another study that class size reduction \n``provides policymakers with a direct lever for influencing \nclassrooms'' and is one of a few policies that ``offer such immediate \nconcrete effects.''\n  As in Project STAR, students participating in Wisconsin's SAGE class-\nsize reduction effort outperformed their counterparts in larger \nclassrooms on standardized tests.\n  Again, as in the other studies, these benefits were strongest among \nAfrican American students who had larger gains than their white \ncounterparts.\n  So not only can smaller class size help raise student achievement \noverall, but reduced class size may be an especially effective measure \nfor closing the ``achievement gap'' between black students and white \nstudents.\n  Let me turn to a second argument we have heard. I keep hearing that \nFederal money should not be targeted for a specific purpose such as \nmaking classrooms less crowded.\n  I remind all of my colleagues that in this underlying bill we have \ntargeted money for many causes, including reading, technology, \nafterschool programs, school safety, and charter schools and magnet \nschools.\n  In fact, there are more than 20 targeted funding streams in the \nunderlying bill.\n  If targeted funding were really the problem, and why we should vote \nagainst this amendment, then those who vote against my class size \namendment ought to vote against the entire bill.\n  Some have said we should just let school boards choose how to use \nthis money. But that really ignores the realities local school boards \nface. I served on a local school board. I know what it is like to try \nto set aside money to hire new teachers for the foreseeable future when \nyou do not even know if a school bond is going to pass next month. That \nis one of the reasons it is so hard for local schools to hire new \nteachers to reduce overcrowding on their own.\n  Fortunately, because of the work we have done in the last 3 years, \ntoday they are not on their own. They have a Federal partner to help \nthem make that critical investment. We need to continue that \ncommitment.\n  The truth is, the underlying bill would pit two key elements of good \nschools against one another: Small classes and good teachers. Under \nthis bill, any dollar that local schools decide to spend on smaller \nclasses comes at the expense of a dollar spent on teacher quality. We \nshould not make our schools choose between two priorities that are \nimportant; we should fund both.\n  This kind of ``false flexibility'' that we see in this underlying \nbill would be unacceptable in most other arenas. Do we make our \nmilitary choose between weapons and training? Of course not. We know \nboth are necessary to protect our Nation. Do we make a sick patient \nchoose between food and medicine? Of course not, because we know both \nare necessary.\n  Why then, in this underlying bill, are we forcing our schools to \nchoose between high-quality teachers and smaller classes when we know \nboth are necessary to help our children learn?\n  In their zeal to assail small classes, some people have even claimed \nthat a good teacher is more important than a small class size. Let me \nsay this as clearly as I can: Small classes and good teachers are both \nimportant. The importance of funding teacher quality should not crowd \nout funding for other important reforms such as smaller classes.\n  I also point out that smaller classes can help us recruit and retain \ngood teachers. One of the main reasons that teachers leave the \nclassroom is job dissatisfaction. The truth is, we are losing a lot of \nteachers very early in their careers. After 1 year of teaching, we lose \n11 percent of our new teachers; after 2 years, we lose 21 percent of \nthem; and after 5 years, it is now up to 39 percent.\n  Why are we losing teachers out of our classrooms? Studies have shown \nthat one of the main reasons is job dissatisfaction. One of the main \ncauses of job dissatisfaction: Overcrowded classes. Another top \ncomplaint: Student discipline. We know there are fewer discipline \nproblems in smaller classes. We need to keep good teachers in our \nclassrooms. That means we ought to invest in teacher quality. But it \nalso means we should reduce overcrowding to encourage more good \nteachers to stay in our classrooms and give their students their best.\n  This is not just about statistics. The other day in this Chamber I \nread an excerpt from a letter sent to me by an award-winning teacher \nfrom Pullman, WA. Kristi wrote to me that she is very frustrated. Every \nday she tries to give her students her best, but with large classes \nthat is getting harder and harder. Kristi is a great teacher. She is a \nnational award-winning teacher.\n  She is asking us to help her be the kind of ``high-quality'' teacher \nwe say we want for every child by giving her a class small enough for \nevery child to get the attention they need.\n  Dedicated teachers such as Kristi spend their lives helping our \nchildren to learn. We reward them with working conditions that none of \nus would tolerate.\n  Fourth, some on the other side have said we should focus our reform \nefforts on testing and accountability. The truth is that this amendment \nis even more essential because of the testing and accountability \nprovisions in the underlying bill. This bill could punish students for \nfailing tests, but it does not give them the tools they need to pass \nthose tests.\n  Implying that testing is some kind of magic bullet that will somehow \nturn around low-performing schools is simplistic. The truth is far more \ncomplex. Testing is just one of many tools, and it is useless by \nitself. Tests can identify problems but without the support to solve \nthose problems, tests have little value. Tests alone cannot improve a \nstudent's achievement, but give that student a smaller class and a good \nteacher, and the sky is not even a limit for his or her potential \nsuccess.\n  I want all of us to think about that. No test is going to help a \nstudent learn to read or learn to write or learn to add. A smaller \nclass and a qualified teacher will.\n  We can take a classroom of students and give them tests every day for \n10 years, and those kids won't do better unless they have a qualified \nteacher in a classroom that is not overcrowded, where they get the \nindividual attention they need to learn.\n  Let's make sure we give those kids the tools they need to pass the \ntest, not just to take the test. Let's invest in what works. Our \nschools are facing bigger challenges than they ever have before. They \nare educating more students, and more students with special challenges \nare filling our classrooms such as children with limited English \nproficiency and disabilities. They are educating them to meet higher \nstandards and succeed in an increasingly complex world.\n  We know many schools need to do a better job. Schools need to be held \naccountable and teachers need to be held accountable. But in Congress, \nwe must also be held accountable for meeting our responsibilities as a \nFederal partner to our schools. Believe me, if we pass this bill \nwithout guaranteed funding for things such as smaller classes and with \nhuge unfunded testing mandates, we will be held accountable.\n  Finally, I will mention something we did not hear from the other side \nbut is at the heart of what is going on in the bill. We did not hear \nthis new funding scheme that is in the underlying bill described as a \nblock grant. That is exactly what it is. The reason it is not called a \nblock grant is because parents know that block grants offer less \naccountability, less focus on things that work, and in the end less \nfunding. So instead of calling it a block grant, they now call it ``a \nfunding pool.''\n  Parents don't want pools of funding. They want commonsense \ninvestments that make a difference, such as smaller classes and decent \nfacilities. We have heard a lot of excuses. We have heard a lot of \nrhetoric. The only thing that will matter when this debate is done is \nhow the students in Kristi's classrooms and thousands of classrooms \nacross our country do next year.\n  I have shown my colleagues why the arguments that have been raised \ndon't hold up. I close by mentioning some of the reasons we should \ntarget these dollars to smaller classes.\n  Parents know better than to believe the false rhetoric about smaller \nclasses not helping children learn. Smaller classes result in more \nindividual attention for students and better student performance on \nassessments. They\n\n[[Page S4905]]\n\nproduce long-lasting academic benefits such as lower dropout rates and \nmore students taking college entrance exams and long-lasting social \nbenefits such as less teen pregnancy and incarceration. Rhetoric about \nchoice and flexibility will not go very far when parents ask us why \nclass sizes went back up. The reasons we need a guaranteed funding \nstream for class size reduction are clear.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to invest in the things that work. \nAs local schools across the country try to make progress in the face of \ngrowing challenges, let's give them the tools they need to succeed.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator from \nWashington yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the ranking member for the time.\n  I compliment the Senator from Washington on her amendment and for the \ntremendous insight she brings, as someone who has participated on a \nschool board, as a mom, who understands education from the grassroots.\n  As the Senator from Washington was talking, I couldn't help but \nthink, I don't get to go to the movies very much, but there was one \nmovie about 2 years ago named ``October Sky'' that I saw. It was about \na coal mining town in West Virginia and how the escape for those young \npeople in school from a life of coal mining was only through the avenue \nof a dedicated teacher who ignited their little minds.\n  In this particular case, they were called the rocket boys. They went \nout and built miniature rockets, won the State science fair, got the \ncollege scholarships, and were able to go to college. It is based on a \ntrue story about one of those rocket boys who went on to become a very \naccomplished NASA engineer.\n  It popped into my mind because of what the Senator was saying about \nthe importance of the teacher and the teacher being able to interrelate \nwith the children in that classroom. If it is a classroom of 50 or 60 \nchildren, that personal attention, that interaction just isn't going to \noccur.\n  How many studies do we have to undertake to understand that when \nclass size is reduced, particularly in the formative years of \nkindergarten through the third grade, it shows up in spades later on in \nlife by the child's ability to accomplish and succeed.\n  The Senator's amendment is so clear. This is like voting against \nmotherhood. I can't imagine anybody would not be supporting this \namendment. We have already had 2 years of experience with this program. \nIt clearly has started to work. The Senator wants to extend this \nprogram for another 5 years for a total program of 7 years.\n  If I went to my State and asked the average citizen on the street: Do \nyou want to lower class size by hiring more teachers over a 7-year \nperiod, to have the Federal Government invest more by hiring 100,000 \nteachers, I would get an almost unanimous response.\n  I add my voice of appreciation to the Senator from Washington for her \nwonderful commentary and for her very insightful amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes off the bill on \nthe amendment.\n  I commend the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, for bringing this \nmeasure back to the Chamber, urging the Senate to support an amendment \nwhich will make available to school districts the additional funding \nfor smaller class sizes with a particular emphasis on K-3 classrooms.\n  Senator Murray brings a unique and special credibility to this issue \nas someone who has been an active school board member and also someone \nwho has been a first grade school teacher. Although she didn't review \nthat experience with us this morning, I think all of us who have \nlistened to her make this presentation and fight for this program \nremember clearly the very compelling case that she has made.\n  I think it still echoes in my ears about the schoolteachers who are \nin the classes with 30 children, trying to deal with all of their \nparticular names and needs, as compared to a teacher in a smaller class \nof 15, 13 children, where she is able to spend the time to give the \nindividual kind of attention to the child, and particularly that child \nwho may have some very special needs on that particular day. It is \ntranslated into helping and assisting children in the earliest grades \nto be able to develop their interests and their awareness in terms of \neducation and reflects itself in terms of an enhancement in their \nacademic achievement and accomplishment.\n  Now there has been some suggestion on the floor of the Senate that \nthis is not effective, that the studies indicate this is not effective, \nthat it is one of the least desirable reforms. I hope those who \nmaintain that position will at least be good enough to illustrate what \nstudies they were referring to, because I am going to give three \npractical studies that are compelling information and make a compelling \ncase in support of the Murray amendment. They are overwhelming. And you \ndon't have to go back years to look at the results of the studies, all \nyou have to do is look at the front page of the newspapers here Tuesday \nof last week:\n\n       Prince Georges' Test Scores Show Best Gains Ever.\n\n  Then you read down through this:\n\n       Prince Georges County students posted their highest gains \n     ever on a key standardized test used to gauge how local \n     children measure up to their peers nationally, according to \n     the results released.\n\n  Then the school superintendent, when asked about what the principal \ncontributors were in moving the children along in this direction:\n\n       [She] said she hoped that county and State leaders would \n     see the test scores as proof that the county is serious about \n     improving academic achievement and that they would reward it \n     with more funding to reduce class size.\n\n  There it is. Results. Reduce class size. We reject this idea that you \nhave to make a choice between well-qualified teachers in the classroom \nand smaller class size. The Murray amendment says we can do both. That \nis our position, that we can do both.\n  With all respect to our colleagues on the other side, the ones who \nhave been addressing this issue voted against getting an allocation of \nresources in our committee toward having well-qualified, well-trained \nteachers with professional development and mentoring. As many of us \ntried to say, let's make sure we are going to provide that, and that \nwas rejected in our committee. Now, in some kind of an attempt to \ndefeat the Murray amendment, they say the No. 1 question is: Are we \ngoing to have a well-trained teacher in every class?\n  We are for it. The Senate voted in favor of it, with a strong \nbipartisan vote to expand that last week. What we are also saying is we \nwant to have a well-trained teacher in the class with professional \ndevelopment and mentoring programs, but we also want the smaller class \nsize, as has been done here every time we have reviewed this amendment. \nAll we have to do is look at the results.\n\n  I think what would be useful is, rather than speculating perhaps what \neach Member believes is best in the local community, to look at what is \nhappening out in the country and what the results are. Maybe we can \nbenefit from what is happening when we have results. That is what we \nhave.\n  In the STAR program in the State of Tennessee, April 29, 1999, \nreport, it says:\n\n       The original STAR research tracked the progress of an \n     average of 6,500 students each year in 79 schools between \n     1985 and 1989 (and 11,600 students overall). It found that \n     children who attended small classes (13-17 pupils per \n     teacher) in kindergarten through grade 3 outperformed \n     students in larger class sizes (22-25 pupils) in both reading \n     and math on the Stanford Achievement Tests for elementary \n     students. The second phase of the STAR research found that \n     even after returning to larger classes in grade 4, STAR's \n     small class students continued to outperform their peers who \n     had been in larger class sizes.\n\n  That is what we have, Mr. President. The study goes on and shows that \nstudents in smaller class sizes are more likely to pursue college, \nsmall classes lead to higher graduation rates, students in small \nclasses achieve at higher levels, and the list goes on. That is \nTennessee, 6,500 students.\n  We can go to what took place from 1996 up to the year 2000 in the \nState of Wisconsin, the SAGE Program. The exact same results--30 \nschools, 21 school districts. When adjusted for preexisting differences \nin academic\n\n[[Page S4906]]\n\nachievement, attendance, and socioeconomic status, the SAGE students \nshowed significant improvement over their comparison school \ncounterparts from the beginning of the first grade to the end of the \nthird grade across all academic areas. The charts go through there.\n  We can take the Rand study. That is not known to be a flaming liberal \nor Democratic organization--the Rand Corporation. Here they examine \nsmaller class sizes in California --more than 1.8 million students. \nThis is their conclusion:\n\n       Smaller class sizes with certified teachers--\n\n  That is what we stand for. We have the certified teachers with the \nauthorizations we passed last week in a bipartisan way. But also we \nhaven't got the guarantee that there will be resources in here for the \nsmaller class sizes. Here is the Rand study that was just produced in \nJuly of last year:\n\n       Smaller class sizes with certified teachers have the \n     greatest benefit for the neediest students.\n\n  Why not do both? That is what the Senator from Washington is saying. \nWhy don't we do both? We are doing the well-qualified teachers. Why not \ndo smaller class sizes? Why be in the situation? We have to make a \nchoice. We know what is working. Let's give that option to the local \ncommunities. That is what the Murray amendment does.\n  Here it is:\n\n       Smaller class sizes with certified teachers have the \n     greatest benefit for the neediest students. Evaluation shows \n     that those students in the most disadvantaged schools were \n     most likely to be in larger classes, or have less-qualified \n     teachers. Students in smaller classes still outperformed \n     their peers in larger classes, even with less-qualified \n     teachers. These students could be performing even better if \n     all children in these schools had fully qualified teachers \n     and smaller class sizes.\n\n  That is the Rand Corporation. If we want to try to do something to \nhelp children in local communities, let's take the best in terms of \nstudies. Let's take the best in practical experience. Let's take the \nbest in terms of our own intuition and understanding about a \nschoolteacher in a classroom where they are familiar with the children \nand can spend the time with the children versus in a larger classroom. \nThat is what this is really all about.\n  Finally, I want to read this. I have other examples. In Fayetteville, \nAR, there is a wonderful story about a rural school that took advantage \nof the Murray amendment, because although we are resisted on the floor \nof the Senate by our Republican friends, in the past we were able to, \nunder the leadership of Senator Murray and President Clinton, have an \neffective program that is currently working, and one we want to keep.\n  Let me just read a very brief letter from a student at the Richmond \nElementary School from Narragansett, RI. I think it could have been \nfrom any number of children. This is from Marieke Spresser:\n\n       If I were in a smaller class, I would do more projects. I \n     could talk more with my teacher about school. I could read \n     more in my book packets. I could have more time for centers. \n     I could have more time for snacks. I could ask more \n     questions. I could talk more with my friends. The coat room \n     would not be so messy and we would not waste the time looking \n     for something. The line would not be so long.\n\n  My colleagues get the sense from this student. Even though there are \nreferences about other activities, my colleagues have an understanding, \nwhich the children have, that should not be lost as well. If we are \ntalking about developing a legislative initiative that is going to \npresent the best we possibly can to local communities, let them make \ntheir choice; let them make the decision. They are the ones who are \ngoing to ultimately make the request.\n  There is nothing mandatory in here, but let us at least pass \nlegislation that reflects the best of educators and practical \nexperience. The Murray amendment does that in spades. It is a \ncompelling case. It should be accepted, and I hope it will be.\n  My colleague, the Senator from New York has arrived. The Senator from \nWashington can yield time to our colleague.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington. I \nrise to express my very strong support for Senator Murray's class size \nreduction amendment.\n  I have been in this Chamber several times in the last weeks talking \nabout class size and have shown numerous pictures of conditions in the \nclasses in the schools in New York. I have listened to the \nextraordinary description of other colleagues as to what their students \nand teachers face day in and day out because of overcrowded classrooms.\n  I know we will be making decisions that determine the opportunities \nfor our educational achievement for our students for years to come when \nwe vote on this amendment and on the bill of which I hope it will be a \npart.\n  I have to reiterate several points and call on my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to look at the evidence. I do believe sometimes in \nWashington we live in an evidence-free zone. It does not matter who \ncomes up with whatever scientific research or evidence. If it runs \nagainst any particular political point of view, it is not given the \nseriousness it deserves.\n  I do not see how we can turn our backs on the evidence that we have \nfrom study after study that lower class size, when it comes to teaching \nchildren from disadvantaged backgrounds, makes all the difference.\n  Sometimes my colleagues say: But there are schools that do a good job \nwith more students, and I remember when I was in school and we had a \nlot of students.\n  I can remember that, too. I started school when we had three \ntelevision networks. I can remember when we had more two-parent \nfamilies. I can remember when we did not have all of the social and \ncultural interference with raising children that we now face.\n\n  The fact is, we have to take our kids where they are today, and many \nof them today are coming from situations where they need more \nattention, more adult time, more discipline, more guidance in order to \nbe academically successful.\n  We are turning our backs not only on the research which points that \nout time and again but on these children. I hope my colleagues who have \nnot seen fit to support this amendment will reconsider it. It is not \ntoo late to cast a vote for the kinds of classrooms where teachers can \nteach and children can learn.\n  If you look at our big States with big cities--and I know New York \nhas obviously a special set of issues because of the size of our school \ndistrict in New York City, but it is not unique. In Pennsylvania, for \nexample, the average class size in Philadelphia is 30 children per \nclass. In Pittsburgh, it is 25 children per class. In Chicago, it \naverages 28. In Georgia, it averages 32.\n  This is not an issue for just Senators or teachers or school board \nmembers to be concerned about in debate. Much of the attention I have \nseen focused on this comes from parents who know their children are not \ngetting academic assistance they need to do the best they can do.\n  There is a woman in New York whom I commend who started a grassroots \nparents organization called Class Size Matters. She began to form \nnetworks of parents around the country who know because they have seen \nwith their own eyes and their experience of their children, that class \nsize matters.\n  In Pennsylvania alone, this Class Size Matters network got 1,700 \nparents to sign a petition in just 2 days, urging the Senate to vote in \nfavor of class size reductions.\n  I have heard from parents throughout New York who tell me in great \ndetail how crowded their classrooms are and how they need help. This \ndoes not interfere with flexibility. This does not take anything away \nfrom the local school districts determining priorities, but it does \ngive additional help and resources to those districts and those parents \nwho know that unless we get those class sizes down, their children will \nnot learn to the extent they should do so.\n  I also regret deeply that if we do not adopt this amendment, we will \nbe stopping the progress we have made.\n  New York State has hired to date 2,600 teachers and has 700 more all \nready to be hired. This will stop that hiring, and we know from the \n2,600 we have already hired what a difference it makes in the \nclassrooms of New York.\n  I believe that without dedicated funding for reducing class sizes, \nour\n\n[[Page S4907]]\n\nhardest pressed, most needy districts will not receive the dollars they \nneed to reduce the classes.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to stand behind our children, our \nparents, our teachers and reduce the size of our classes and adopt \nSenator Murray's amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time does the Senator from Michigan wish?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Five minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Washington \nState who has been such a stalwart on this commonsense issue. If you \nwere to ask anyone in the public whether it makes sense to have smaller \nclass size so that our children can receive the attention they need \nfrom the teacher and have the opportunity to interact in the classroom \nand maximum opportunity to learn in the classroom, everyone would look \nat you and say: Well, of course, that ought to be a priority.\n  We have been able to back up the commonsense nature of this ideal \nwith numerous studies that have been talked about by my colleagues \ntoday about what has happened around the country and the difference \nsmaller class size makes.\n  I want to share with my colleagues what is happening in my great \nState of Michigan. I have a colleague, a former State senate colleague, \nSenator Joe Conroy, who is the Senator Murray of Michigan. For years he \nhas been speaking about the importance of lowering the number of \nchildren in a classroom and how critical that is to teaching. He has \nbeen bringing those studies to Michigan, and Michigan finally took \naction in 1996.\n  For the 1996-1997 school year, thanks to Senator Conroy, Michigan \ncreated a pilot project in Flint, MI, to focus on grades 1-3 and to \ncreate a 17-student-per-teacher classroom, a ratio of 17 children to 1 \nteacher in the high-risk schools.\n  They found it was so successful after 3 years that the State of \nMichigan has begun to look for ways to expand that and has now expanded \na classroom project to lower class size to 26 different districts in \nMichigan.\n  That is the good news. They found in Flint that, in fact, it made a \ndifference that children's performance in reading and math increased \ndramatically. They are now looking for ways to bring that to children \nall across Michigan. But the challenge is that there are over 500 \ndistricts, and the State has been able to expand to 26 districts, but \nthey need our partnership. They need this Murray amendment. Our \nchildren in Michigan need to know that we in Washington understand the \ncritical importance of partnering with the States to lower class size \nso that our teachers can teach and our children can learn.\n  We have heard the numbers. We have heard about national studies. Let \nme just add an analysis of a Texas program that used data from 800 \nschool districts containing more than 2.4 million children. They found \nthat as the number of children in a classroom went up above 18 students \nper 1 teacher, student achievement fell dramatically. So the more \nchildren in the classroom, the lower the achievement.\n  We have seen study after study that has shown this. We have the \nopportunity in the Senate to show that we have responded to the common \nsense and the studies that have indicated very clearly the direction in \nwhich we should move as we look at improving education for our \nchildren.\n  I support having strong standards, high standards, and I commend \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle for initiatives that relate to \naccountability. But if we do not also provide the opportunity for \nchildren to learn in small classes, if we do not also focus on \nrecruiting more certified teachers, and make sure there are an \nappropriate number of classrooms and they are modernized so the tools \nare there, we are only doing half the job.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Murray amendment. It has made a \ndifference. It will make a difference. The efforts that we have seen in \nFlint, MI, and now expanded across Michigan, have demonstrated very \ndramatically that if a teacher is able to spend the time in a \nclassroom--and the ideal number we found in Michigan is 17 to 18 \nchildren per classroom--if you are able to do that, if that teacher has \nthe opportunity to spend time with children in a small class, we know \nreading scores go up, math scores go up, and student performance goes \nup in general. We also know that classroom is more safe; there is a \nbetter opportunity in general for children to be in safe, quality \nschools when we focus on small class size.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 43 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask the Senator from New Hampshire when he intends to \nuse his time? Mr. President, we have 16 minutes on our side and 43 \nminutes on the other side. If I could just inquire when the other side \nintends to use their time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe the Senator from Minnesota wished to speak. We \nwill proceed after the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will just take 3 minutes because I \nwant to give the Senator from Washington as much time as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Michigan for her response. I \nask unanimous consent I be included as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I heard the Senator from Florida state \nto the Senator from Washington he appreciated her grassroots \nperspective. I do as well. I didn't serve on a school board. I wish I \nhad. I keep calling on people in Minnesota to please run for the school \nboard. We desperately need good leadership on our school boards. There \nis no more important issue and there is no more important public \nservice.\n  I certainly agree with what the Senator from Michigan has said. The \nonly thing I would add to this debate is, while I didn't serve on a \nschool board, I have averaged being in a school every 2 weeks for the \nlast 10\\1/2\\ years. I love to teach. I was a college teacher. I was in \nWoodbury High School yesterday. I love being in schools. Almost every \ntime now in the last year or so we have gotten into discussions about \neducation, I pretty much ask students: What do you think makes for a \ngood education? Where do you think the gaps are? What works well? what \ndoes not? Why?\n  Really, over and over again the first of two things students talk \nabout is good teachers. When they talk about good teachers, they never \nthen define good teachers as teachers who teach to worksheets. They are \nnot talking about drill education. They are talking about teachers who \nfire their imagination, get them to relate themselves personally in \nrelation to the material that is being discussed. Also you hear about \nsmaller class size.\n\n  I agree certainly with the little ones, under 4 feet tall, it is \ncritically important. But I frankly think it goes all the way through \nhigh school. When you ask students to talk about why, it is just a no-\nbrainer to them.\n  They say the good teachers are the teachers who get to know us, who \ncan interact with us and can really support us, and they are much \nbetter able to do that when there is a smaller class size.\n  I am a proud Jewish father. My daughter is a great teacher. Next \nyear, the school in which she is teaching will have to lay off 40 \nteachers for many reasons, including an awful State budget. She will \nhave 50 students in her Spanish class. It is hard to get to know them \nwell and give them the help they need.\n  Maybe this is the best way I can support this amendment. She said she \nkept the parents around the night of the parent/teacher conference and \nhad\n\n[[Page S4908]]\n\nthem all crammed into the classroom. She sat them all down and said \nthis year she has 40. She said: Next year, there will be 10 more. That \nmeans your child will get 1 minute.\n  If you think about a class, and they were all sitting there, \nthinking: This doesn't work very well, does it?\n  It does not. At the national level, the one thing we can say is there \nare certain priorities we have, and there is a certain commitment we \nmake to all children wherever they live. We at the Senate say we know \ngood teachers and small class size are important, so we make this \ncommitment in our education legislation. Therefore, I am proud to \nsupport your amendment. I certainly hope it will be agreed to in the \nSenate.\n  I have no doubt that at the grassroots level in all of our States, \nthe people we represent, including the students who maybe cannot even \nvote, view this as a priority for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nwill be charged equally to both sides. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 43 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask the Senator from New Hampshire when they intend to \nuse their time? Certainly we have several Senators coming to the floor. \nWe would like to use our 11\\1/2\\ minutes. If the other side doesn't \nwant to use their time, we would love to have some of it.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the generosity of the Senator from \nWashington. I yield to the Senator from Alabama 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire and appreciate his leadership \non all issues relating to this education bill. As a former Governor and \na person who has been deeply involved in trying to get the best \npossible advantage from every dollar spent on education, his influence \nhas been very valuable to us in this body. I think President Bush--as a \nformer Governor himself who made education a high priority, who \ntraveled his State and who was in schools and met with school boards \nand principals all over his State, he wrestled with those kinds of \nissues that face all educators--also is providing great leadership. I \nam pleased to be able to support legislation that he proposes.\n  We deeply care about improving learning in the classroom. My wife and \nI both have taught. She taught a number of years. We care about it, \nhave been active in the PTA and those kinds of things, and have tried \nto keep up with the relevant issues of importance to education.\n  With regard to class size reductions, it would seem that class size \nreductions is a wonderful idea. I am sure teachers would say: Wouldn't \nit be great if I had a smaller group of students? And teacher unions \nlike it; they get to hire more teachers. Polling numbers show that \npeople think they like that.\n  How are you going to improve education? What do you want to do? Poll? \nReducing class size. That sounds like a good idea. It sounds like a \ngood idea to me. It sounds like a good idea for politicians who want to \nplease the public and do something about education. I have thought over \nthe years it is a good public policy we ought to pursue.\n  I do not suggest there is no benefit from reducing the size of the \nclass.\n  I think we need to be real serious about it. We are talking about a \nlot of money and a major commitment. We need to know whether or not \nthis is the best way to achieve additional learning.\n  Senator Murray's goal is a noble one. I know it comes from her heart. \nShe believes in it. But her amendment is, in fact, a federal mandate \nand a $2.4 billion requirement on education for fiscal year 2002 alone. \nIt is in such sums as are necessary for the next 6 years. It would \nrequire States to use those funds to reduce class size whether this is, \nin their mind, a local need or not.\n  The bill we have under consideration would allow schools to use the \nalready increased Federal funds for class size reduction, but it does \nnot require them to do so. It leaves those decisions in the hands of \nthe States and localities. I think they should make those \ndeterminations.\n  In addition to that, I think we ought to be real careful in this body \nwhen we pass an amendment--if we were to pass this amendment--that we \nwould be sending a signal that it is the considered opinion of this \nbody and the Federal Government that class size reduction ought to be \nmade the No. 1 priority in the schools around America. If that were the \nright thing to do, I would feel more comfortable about this.\n  Reduction of class size is a highly expensive policy to place on the \nStates. Many researchers have found little or no benefit in reducing \nclass size.\n  Some would say, Jeff, that is just skinflint talk. You are always \nfrugal. You are always worried about spending money, and you know that \nwe are going to have more learning if we have smaller classes. Why \nwould you suggest otherwise? I thought so myself. But the more I look \nat the facts and the studies, I am less and less convinced that we \nreceive any real benefit from a reduction in class size.\n  Professor Hanushek, a professor at the University of Rochester, and \nnow I believe at Stanford University, has written that class size \nreduction is best thought of as a political decision. Past evidence \nsuggests that it is a very effective mechanism for gaining voter \nsupport, even if past evidence also suggests that it is a very \nineffective educational policy.\n  The problem is, we are dealing with a counterintuitive circumstance \nhere. But we weren't thinking this way in 1988. The Department of \nEducation of the United States declared that reducing class size in \n1988 was probably a waste of money.\n  Then we had a series of efforts and programs around the country and \ncampaigns to raise this issue. It seemed to have taken hold.\n  I would like to mention a few facts that we need to consider if we \nreally want to make sure the money we are spending benefits children.\n  In 1961, the average class size in America was 30. In 1998, the \naverage class size was 23.\n  Most Americans who are thinking about reducing class size probably \ndon't realize that the average class size in America is that small. I \nthink we have made some very good progress in reducing class size \nalready. In fact, that is almost a one-third reduction since 1960 in \nthe size of classes.\n  Unfortunately, we need to ask ourselves what kind of benefit have we \nreceived from this one-third reduction, this reducing down to 23 \nstudents per classroom. If we look at the standardized test scores over \nthat same period from 1960 to 1998, scores have fallen. They have not \ngone up.\n  You say, well, a standardized test is not a perfect evaluation for a \nlot of complicated reasons. That is true. But most experts who have \nstudied these numbers will tell you they believe fundamentally test \nscores have not gone up since 1960. I think most would agree they \nprobably have at least declined some.\n\n  The NAEP scores of 17-year-olds have been conducted since 1969, and \nfrom 1969 to 1995, class size dropped 23 percent. But NAEP scores on \nacademic improvement show that math and reading were level and science \nand writing declined.\n  We have a continual decline in classroom size and no improvement in \nlearning scores. I think that is strong evidence when we are talking \nabout these numbers.\n  Make no mistake. When we reduce a class size by one-third, what have \nwe done? We have required that we hire one-third more teachers. We have \nrequired that we build one-third more classrooms; that we will have \none-third more insurance to pay for; one-third more maintenance; and \none-third more upkeep and all the things that go with operating a \nschool--a tremendous wealth investment in classroom size reduction.\n  We have had big classroom size reductions, and I have always thought \nthat was great. But we surely haven't had great test score results in \nrecent years.\n  The question I guess would be, if we have already had a one-third \nclassroom size reduction and no benefit, why do\n\n[[Page S4909]]\n\nwe think further reductions of a significant order are going to be paid \nfor in increased educational return? I think that is the question with \nwhich we need to wrestle.\n  In 1994, Professor Hanushek did a study. He examined 277 studies that \nhave been conducted of the effects of classroom size in America. He \ntook every one of them. He pored through their data and examined it and \nreached a number of startling conclusions. He published his study. It \nshowed that in statistically significant studies 15 percent of the \nstudies found some positive benefit from reducing classroom size and 13 \npercent found a negative benefit from reducing classroom size--\nnegative, adverse consequences from reducing classroom size. Seventy-\ntwo percent were basically neutral and didn't show any effect. If you \ntook all the studies, it was 27 percent positive and 25 percent \nnegative.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. To what studies are we referring? I am trying to \nunderstand. We had the study in Tennessee, and the STARS study. I am \ntrying to find out what these studies are and who conducted them.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is a study by Eric Hanushek, a professor at the \nUniversity of Rochester who published his writings, and who I think is \nwell known in the field and referred to by experts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I apologize to the Senator. I did not hear him.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Professor Hanushek.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Where is he from?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. He is now from Stanford University, I believe. He was \nat the University of Rochester, I believe, previously.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What is the title of the study? I want to have a chance \nto review it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be glad to get the Senator the information.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is this the only study that we are using?\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be glad to yield and talk about it \nspecifically.\n  Mr. GREGG. Hanushek is a professor at Rochester. He looked at 300 \ndifferent studies on the question of class size and its effect on pupil \nperformance in the classroom. He also looked at teacher performance in \nthe classroom and teacher professionalism and performance in the \nclassroom. Within those 300 different studies on that subject, he \nevaluated and came to the conclusions being related by the Senator from \nAlabama very precisely.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is this the only study that the Senator is using? I used \nthe Tennessee study, the California study, and then the Prince George's \nresults. I am wondering whether the Senator has other studies? I know \nthe Senator from Tennessee referred to multiple studies that are being \ndone on this. I was just trying to be able to look at the studies \nmyself.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be glad to provide the Senator his analysis of \nthe existing studies he reviewed. That was his conclusion.\n  He also reviewed the Tennessee STAR report in some depth and \nconcluded that its methodology was dubious, that benefits, at best, \nwere very small, even under the STAR report. It took an heroic endeavor \nby the writer of the STAR report, based on a single British study of \nhow much more money you make, if you receive a little more education, \nto justify the expense of it.\n  His conclusion was that the problem with that analysis is that it \ncompares something to nothing. If you count the amount of billions of \ndollars that were spent on reducing class size, and you receive such a \nminimal benefit, perhaps it would be better spent in focusing on \nquestions such as quality teachers.\n  We know, for example, that good teachers benefit students \ndramatically. We have studies, that I think are not disputed, that top-\nquality teachers can produce learning in a year of 1.5 year's worth of \nlearning under their tutelage, whereas a poor teacher may produce an \naverage of .5 year's worth of learning. In other words, an excellent \nteacher could gain for a child in learning a full year's advantage over \na poorer teacher.\n  If we are going to go out and hire one-third more teachers to reduce \nclass size further down, aren't we running a risk, and isn't that \nprobably why the numbers do not show the kind of improvement we desire? \nBecause we are bringing in less qualified teachers, who may not be \nproducing the kind of quality learning environment that excellent \nteachers would be. Which would you prefer?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I ask the Senator a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Did you review the Rand study? You mentioned that they \ndid the STAR school study and that he questioned that. They had the \nSAGE review in Wisconsin. And they have the Rand study, which involved \n1,800,000 children last year, with very positive results. This is the \nRand Corporation. I wonder if----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to see the Rand study. I would just say \nthis, that Michigan Professor Linda Lim has done comparative studies of \nthe United States and Asian schools and found that class sizes are 50-\nplus in places such as Taiwan and they have not kept those schools from \nsurpassing ours.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator from Alabama would yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Rand study came out after Professor Hanushek completed \nhis study in Rochester. The Rand study has been referred to by the \nSenator from Massachusetts. I think it is important to note that what \nthe Rand study concluded was that class size might impact student \nperformance but it was the most expensive way to accomplish it; that, \nin fact, you got much more benefit from the dollars spent if you \nimproved the teacher quality, if you improved the resources of the \nteacher, in most instances. That was the specific conclusion of the \nRand study.\n  In fact, the average cost per pupil for reducing class size to 17 \nstudents, under the Rand study, was found to be $450 per student in a \nhigh-poverty district, whereas the same academic aims could be achieved \nwith the average cost of $90 per pupil by providing increased resources \nand improving the capability of the teacher to teach.\n  The point, of course, of the underlying bill, which the Senator is \ntrying to amend, is that we give that flexibility to the local school \ndistricts. We say to the local school districts: If you need to hire \nmore teachers, you can. But if you think you want to improve the \nsupport facilities for the teachers, you can do that, or if you want to \nimprove their talents, you can do that.\n\n  We are giving that option to the State and local school districts to \ndecide which is the most efficient, effective and cost-effective way to \ndo this.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the Senator from New Hampshire is precisely \ncorrect. It may be that a school system is in circumstances where they \nbelieve that class-size reduction is important. That can be done under \nthis bill as it is written today. They can use the funds for class-size \nreduction.\n  But I think we ought to be careful that we do not require them to \ntake steps that could cost tremendous sums of money, money which could \nbe better spent for bringing in a high-quality computer laboratory, a \nnew science laboratory, the latest and best ways to teach mathematics, \nsending teachers to attain advanced degrees and advanced training in \nhistory and science and math and how to teach reading. Those kinds of \nthings may be more important than simply whether the number of students \nin the classroom is 20 or 16. If you go from 20 students to 16 students \nin a classroom, that is a 20-percent increase in the number of teachers \nyou have to hire. If you go from 20 students to 16 students, you have \nto have 20 percent more classrooms and 20 percent more overhead and \ncost.\n  So I would just say that from Professor Hanushek's analysis, and from \nwhat appears to be common sense over 40 years of rapidly reduced class \nsize with no academic benefit, we ought to be a little bit humble in \nthis body before we start suggesting that it is the sole and best way \nfor any school system in America to spend its money to enhance \nlearning. That is all I am saying in opposition to this amendment.\n  I have serious doubts that this is the best leadership we can give to \nAmerican schools. If the best we can say is, don't make any changes, \nkeep on with business as usual, we will just give you more money and \nmore teachers and a smaller class size, that is not going to\n\n[[Page S4910]]\n\nguarantee that learning will improve in America. We have not seen that \nimprovement. The data does not show it. Serious scientific questions \nhave been raised about the importance of it.\n  With regard to the highly touted Tennessee STAR experiment, that \nexperiment was based on a class reduction of eight students over the \ncomparative-size classroom--a very expensive proposition. If you have \n24 students in a class and you reduce the class size by 8 students, and \ngo to 16 students, you have increased the number of teachers needed by \none-third and increased the number of classrooms needed by one-third. \nThat is a huge increase and huge reduction in class size. We have, at \nbest, according to Professor Hanushek, something like a .2 percent \nstatistical or standard deviation improvement, raising real questions \nabout the validity of that.\n  So the critical issue for us, it seems to me, is that we do not need \nto be pressing this mandate down on schools, requiring them or making \nthem think that the only way they can get Federal money for this \nproject for teachers is to go on a commitment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. May I have 30 seconds to wrap up?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the Senator another 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We need to be sure we are not spending $2.4 billion a \nyear in encouraging a further investment in classrooms and overhead for \nschools on a policy that sounds good--that is, to reduce class size \neven further than we have reduced it in the last 30, 40 years--when we \nmay not be receiving an educational benefit from it.\n  I do not know about all the studies, but I know this professor \nexamined 277 of them as of 1994. He found no benefit statistically \nproven for smaller class sizes in education. Isn't that stunning? It is \nalmost counterintuitive. But that is what he found. No studies that I \nhave seen have shown any dramatic improvement.\n  So I think we ought to allow the local school systems a choice as to \nwhether they want to go to smaller class sizes, improve their science \nlab, or have better teachers, more funding for top-quality teachers, \nmore training for teachers who are weak. That kind of choice would be \nbetter for education.\n  We need to be more humble in this body about what we think we know.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven and a half minutes on the Senator's \nside and a little over 20 minutes on the other side.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 7 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator Murray's \namendment to authorize class size reduction. I have been listening to \nthis rather pedantic discussion of studies and analyses. We can point \non one side to a study from Tennessee and on another side to a study \nfrom an eminent expert from the University of Rochester. The reality is \nmuch more obvious.\n  Ask any parent in America if they want to have their children in a \nclass of 27 or 15. The answer is always 15. Go to any prestigious \nprivate school in America and they are not advertising: Come to our \nschool; we have 50 in a class just like Taiwan. They are saying: Come \nto our school; small class size; constant contact with teachers--the \nkind of atmosphere that provides for academic success.\n  Look around. Just last week, the headline in the Washington Post \nread: ``Pr. George's Test Scores Show Best Gains Ever.'' What did the \nsuperintendent want to do with these remarkable results? The \nsuperintendent said she hoped that the county and State leaders would \nsee the test scores as proof that the county is serious about improving \nacademic achievement and that they would reward it with more funding to \nreduce class size and repair deteriorating buildings. That is not some \nscholar from Rochester or some statistician looking at Tennessee. That \nis the superintendent, a local school official, who said: We are doing \nbetter, but we can do better if we lower class size and repair our \nbuildings.\n  The other point that should be made is that this program is \nvoluntary. It is not a mandate. It does not say: If you take this \nprogram, you cannot have any other Federal program in the realm of \neducation. I have seen the results firsthand.\n  In Providence, the capital city of my State, they use this program \nvery flexibly, very innovatively. They sought a waiver to use class \nsize funding for literacy coaches that would coteach in elementary \nschools half the time, and deliver school-based professional \ndevelopment the other half of their working time. Through this program, \nwe are able to do what everyone on this floor seems to be talking \nabout: reduce class size and enhance professional development.\n  This is a program that we have supported over the last several years \non a bipartisan basis. We made a downpayment to help communities hire \n100,000 teachers. That is something that every parent in this country \nwants. That is something, apparently, that school leaders such as \nSuperintendent Metts of Prince George's County want. It is something \nthat scientists and researchers have indicated is working in Tennessee \nand elsewhere. It is something that obviously should be done, and I \nsupport Senator Murray.\n  I make two other points: First, class size reduction has to be tied \nto funds to increase the number of classrooms. That is another portion \nof an amendment that has been brought to the Chamber.\n  In addition to that--and this is reflected in a note I received from \nJonathan Kozol--by gearing up with an elaborate testing regime, we are \nputting the cart before the horse. We should first be reducing class \nsize. We should be first increasing title I moneys. We should then go \nahead and provide for funds to improve the physical structure of \nschools. Maybe at that point, maybe when urban children have the same \nenvironment, the same teacher ratios as you see in suburban \ncommunities, we can start testing them.\n  We are going to test these children, and urban kids are going to do \nmuch worse than suburban kids. Why? Not because they are not capable. \nBut when you are in a school that is falling down, when you are in a \nschool with a large number of children, much larger than the suburban \nareas, when you have teachers who are not getting the professional \ndevelopment they need, you are not going to get the kind of results you \nget elsewhere. That is the reality.\n  We can talk about tests and studies in Rochester and elsewhere, but \nthe reality we know. Frankly, most of us, if we had a choice to send a \nchild to school, we would look for smaller classrooms. We would look \nfor buildings that are not falling down, teachers who are highly \nmotivated, highly qualified, and highly prepared. That is where we \nwould send our child.\n  Let's give every American family that chance. The one way to do it is \nto support the Murray amendment.\n  I yield back the time to Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have spoken at some length prior to this \ntime on my concern for the Murray amendment. I know it is well directed \nand well intentioned, but it fails to appreciate the fact that local \nschools have a variety of needs for their teachers.\n  Some schools need more teachers, so they want to hire them. Some need \nbetter qualified teachers, so they will want to improve the ability of \nthe teachers who are in the classroom. Some may have high-quality \nteachers they want to keep in the classroom but are being attracted to \nsome other private sector activity or public sector activity, so they \nneed to pay the teachers more. Some classrooms just need more technical \nsupport to assist the teacher or teaching aids such as computers or \nsome sort of monitor capability that allows the student to interface \nwith the teacher in a way that the teacher can guide them.\n  We don't know the answer to which one of those teacher tools are \nneeded, whether it is more teachers, better teachers, better paid \nteachers, or better support for teachers. Therefore,\n\n[[Page S4911]]\n\nthis bill addresses the issue by giving the local school districts the \noption of choosing, of taking the teacher money and the Eisenhower \ngrant money, merging it and saying to local schools: You make the \ndecision on teachers, if the money must be spent on teachers. You make \nthe decision as to how you can best improve your classrooms. You, the \nprincipal, the family, the parents who participate in the PTA, or the \nschool boards, the actual teachers make the decisions, rather than \ncreating an arbitrary program which says every school in America needs \nto have more teachers, when that is not necessarily the case.\n  In fact, 48 to 46 States--something like that--44 States already have \nteacher ratios of 18 to 1 on average in their States. As a practical \nmatter, a lot of States already meet the criteria for which the \noriginal concept of this bill was set up. What those States need is \nbetter teachers, better trained teachers, maybe teachers who are better \npaid, and keeping teachers in the classroom.\n  There was one thing said by the Senator from Rhode Island with which \nI agree. He said most parents are going to choose a school that has \nbetter teachers or smaller class size or better facilities. \nUnfortunately, the other side of the aisle isn't interested in allowing \nchoice in the classroom. They have been resisting choice since the \ndebate started.\n  There will be an opportunity to set up a demonstration program which \nwill allow 3 States and 10 school districts to apply to use choice as \nan option so that parents can choose as to whether or not they want to \nstay in that school that is working or maybe a school that is failing, \nbut in any event, whether they want to stay in a school or whether they \nwant to move to another school.\n  We have in this bill something called supplemental services which \nsays to parents, if your child is in a failed school, after 3 years you \ncan go out and get tutorial support for your student. But if your child \nis in a failed school and that school has failed for 3 years, you \nshould have some other choice--if you want to be able to take your \nchild and move them to another school, a private school, if that is \nwhat you want as your option. That is what happens in Philadelphia. It \nis what is happening in Arizona and Florida. It is what is happening in \na number of areas across the country where schools are consistently \npoor, consistently failing, which are not educating the children, where \nwhen you send your child off to school in the morning, you don't know \nwhether they are going to be beaten up or subjected to some sort of \nexposure to drug sales or whether they are going to learn anything. A \nparent should not be put in that position.\n\n  Remember, it is interesting what we are talking about now. We are not \ntalking about wealthy parents or even moderate-income parents. In those \ninstances, most of those parents, if they have decided to choose--and \nmany of them have by physically living in a different area than they \notherwise might, than in an urban area, for example--those parents will \nmake the choice. We are talking basically about low-income parents in \nurban areas and specifically single moms with children.\n  Those are the people we have trapped in schools that fail year after \nyear after year. We say to that parent: I am sorry; your kid is never \ngoing to be given a chance in America because we are never going to \neducate your child. We are never going to give your child an \nopportunity to be educated. We are always going to send them to a class \nwhere we know that class is not working, a school that we know has \nfailed for 3, 4, 5 years. We are not going to give you any options or \nany opportunities for choice.\n  I was interested to see that the Washington Post, which isn't \nnecessarily a conservative newspaper, has come out very strongly in two \neditorials in the last 2 weeks saying: Let's at least try a \ndemonstration program on the issue of choice, on the issue of \nportability. Let's pick a few districts across the country where people \nare locked into schools that are failing, especially low-income \nparents, and give those parents some other opportunities.\n  When the Senator from Rhode Island talks about giving choices, yes, I \nam for choice. I am for saying to schools that have for 2, 3, 4 years \nnot met the grade and their children are locked in those schools on a \npath which means they cannot participate in the American dream because \nthey are not learning: You have to straighten up. You have to do a \nbetter job or else the parents or the kids are going to get some \noptions that are real. They are going to be able to take their kids and \nput them in schools where they are actually learning something. That is \na big issue.\n  Back on the issue of class size, this bill as it is presently \nstructured addresses that issue. It addresses it with flexibility. It \nmakes a decision on whether or not a new teacher should be hired to the \nlocal school district. But it gives the local school district the \ndiscretion that if it does not need new teachers but, rather, needs to \npay teachers more or improve the quality of teachers or give teachers \ntechnical support, they can do that instead.\n\n  I just don't understand the philosophy of a Government that says we \nin Washington know how to run the local schools. I don't understand \nthat. That is essentially what this amendment does. It says if you want \nthe money, you are going to have to hire more teachers; we in \nWashington know you have to have more teachers.\n  A lot of school districts in the country don't need more teachers; \nthey need better teachers. By adding more teachers, you end up with \nworse teachers. The California experience is exactly that. They \ndramatically increased the number of teachers. They went from 1,000 \nunaccredited teachers to 12,000 unaccredited teachers, which meant \n12,000 teachers who may not know how to teach because they were not \naccredited and who may not even know the subject matter they are \nteaching were added to the classrooms.\n  So reducing class size didn't help those kids. All it did was mean \nfewer kids got poorer teachers. Good teachers in the classroom is the \nkey--a quality teacher, not necessarily class size. That has been shown \nin study after study.\n  As a practical matter, this is too much a one-size-fits-all \namendment. This is that stovepipe approach that says we in Washington \nknow how to run you, the local school district, versus saying to the \nlocal district: If you need more teachers, you can hire them--which is \nwhat our bill says--and if you need better teachers, you can try to \nimprove teachers' ability. If you need to pay your best teachers more, \nyou can do that. If you need to support teachers, use the money that \nway. It is a much more logical and flexible approach which addresses \nthe needs of school districts in a much more practical way rather than \nsimply command and control from here in Washington.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Washington \nand then 2\\1/2\\ to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from my home State \nfor yielding me time on this amendment.\n  I applaud Senator Murray for her consistent and passionate support \nfor education throughout her political career. Her advocacy for \neducation has deep roots dating back to her early experience as a \nlegislator working for more funding for schools in her own special \nexperience in volunteering and schoolteaching children in the Shoreline \narea.\n  This amendment is very important for the reasons some of my \ncolleagues have said. It will provide the type of flexibility our \nschool systems need. It is something that has been proven to work, and \nthis is a program that works. Over the last 2 years, when we say a \nprogram has worked, we can show success. Thanks to this program, 1.7 \nmillion children across the country and over 23,000 schools are \nbenefiting from smaller class size, primarily in the early grades when \nchildren most need personal attention from their teachers.\n  As we have heard from other speakers, smaller class size not only has \ndemonstrated an impact on increasing educational performance but also \nhas helped to limit disciplinary problems,\n\n[[Page S4912]]\n\nand, importantly, small class size has helped encourage greater \nparental participation in their children's education.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation that will \nlead to better student achievement, fewer discipline problems, more \nindividual attention, better parent-teacher communication, and dramatic \nresults for poor and minority students. This program does provide \nflexibility. Up to 25 percent of these funds can be used for other \nthings. This is a program we cannot afford to cut but we need to \ncontinue because it is working.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I certainly thank the chairman, the \nsponsor of this amendment. I want to ask her if she would be kind \nenough to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have listened carefully to the Republican opposition to \nthis amendment to reduce class size in America. I am stunned at the \nsuggestion that putting fewer kids in classrooms does not create a \nbetter learning experience. Every parent knows that. I can recall \nraising one child, then two, then three, and how the challenge grew \ngeometrically as the number of children grew. I can't imagine facing a \nroom full of 30 kids and saying it is just as easy to teach there as it \nis in a room of 13 or 18 children.\n  The thing that is said repeatedly by one of our colleagues is that \n``this is a mandate.'' I ask the Senator from Washington to say once \nand for all, are we mandating school to districts that they have to \nreduce class size with this amendment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator for his question. Let me make it \nvery clear, this is not a mandate. This is funds that are available to \nschool districts to use to decrease class size. School districts that \nneed those funds dramatically can apply for them with a simple \napplication. The funds go directly to them. They are able to use them. \nIt is not a mandate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The difference here is that most of us come to this debate as former \nstudents and parents. Senator Murray comes as a former teacher--one of \nthe few in this body. She has stood in front of classrooms of children \nand taught them. The rest of us here have been pupils sitting at desks \nor parents wondering how our kids are doing. She comes here saying \nlower class size gives teachers a better chance to reach children. It \nis not just her opinion; studies show it.\n\n  The STAR project in Tennessee, which has been followed for years, \nshowed significant gains in smaller class size. In Chicago last week, \nLarry Hedges at the University of Chicago and Barbara Nye of the \nUniversity of Tennessee produced a study that found that smaller class \nsize in the early grades produced better math scores not only in the \nthird grade but all the way into high school--a full 6 years after the \nstudent was in a small elementary school class.\n  It stands to reason. Think about how discouraging it must be for a \nchild who has a special need or a problem to be ignored day after day \nafter day, until they have lost all interest and fall behind. In a \nsmaller class a teacher can reach out and pick out a child who needs \nspecial attention. This is not a mandate; it is an option that makes \nsense.\n  We have decided in this bill to focus on the needs for reading--and I \nsupport that--and the needs for technology--and I support that, too. \nJust because President Clinton came up with this idea doesn't mean it \nis a bad one. It has worked. It has reduced the size of classes across \nAmerica and has given kids a better chance. I don't think that \nPresident Bush, who has called for bipartisanship, should have a \nnegative attitude just because this idea came about on someone else's \nwatch. Aren't there some good ideas on both the Democratic side and the \nRepublican side that we might put into this bill?\n  Sadly, unfortunately, that is the part of the debate we have \noverlooked. More than 29,000 teachers were hired with Class Size \nReduction Program funds in 1999, benefitting approximately 1.7 million \nyoung students. This bill eliminates that program. To do that is to \nturn your back on basic human experience: A teacher with a smaller \nnumber of students is going to be a better teacher and the students \nwill have a better chance.\n  I support the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 12 minutes 50 seconds on the \nSenator's side and 1 minute on the other side.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to restate the significance of the \nvote that we will have in about 2 hours--exactly 2 hours, as a matter \nof fact. It is a vote that will reflect the underlying principles of \nfreedom--freedom to identify local needs and respond to those needs in \na way that is specific to the problem, to the challenge, to the need in \nthe community, or in a school, and address the principle of who best \ndecides how to accomplish the goal we all agree to, and that is \nboosting student achievement. Is it Washington, DC, the Federal \nGovernment, or is it parents, local communities, local schools, \nprincipals--the very people who can identify what the needs might be?\n  The legislation captures it all in many ways, and therefore I think \nthat we, our colleagues, and the American people should follow closely \nhow the votes go because the bill captures that principle of \nflexibility and local control versus sort of a one-size-fits-all \nprogrammatic approach, a categorical approach that has so characterized \nour efforts over the last 35 years.\n  In 1965, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was passed. Since \nthat time, there has been, literally, a litany of programs, not 10, 20, \n30, or 40, but 50, 60, 70--up in the hundreds by some counts--of well-\nintended programs based on the idea that if there is a problem it can \nbe fixed by Washington. For example, if there are too many students in \nclassrooms in one part of the country; let's try to fix it in \nWashington by telling the local communities how to spend their \neducation dollars.\n  Mr. President, this is about freedom, the freedom of local \ncommunities to use federal resources--resources that come from the \ntaxpayers, the people back home, wherever our homes may be--as they see \nfit. Those resources, those dollars, begin with the taxpayer, then come \nto Washington, DC, where they are distributed through huge \nbureaucracies in these categorical programs--all well intended--but all \nof which have been layered one after another, like this amendment, over \nthe last 35 years and essentially accomplishes nothing when measured \nagainst student achievement, or the goal, which President Bush has \nspelled out so beautifully and demonstrated such true leadership, of \nreducing over time the achievement gap that exists between the served \nand the underserved.\n  If that is truly the goal, we clearly need to do something different, \nand that something different, as outlined by President Bush, and as \nincorporated in the underlying bill, is to maximize accountability \nthrough assessments and testing, and to provide local communities with \nthe flexibility they need to identify needs and use the resources we \nmake available to address those needs.\n  As was spelled out today, as well as earlier this week and last week, \nwe have emphasized, in the underlying bill, which is a bipartisan bill \nsupported by both sides, the relationship between teacher and child. \nClose your eyes and see it: There is a teacher, students, books, \ntechnology, computers, but what really ends up having the most value is \nthat relationship between teacher and child. There are many other \nvariable, the number of students in the classroom, how disruptive the \nstudents are, how safe the classroom is.\n\n  But if we put all those variables in there, we know that at the end \nof the day, if you have a bad teacher or a poor-quality teacher at the \nhead of the class, nothing else matters very much. It is the quality of \nthe teacher--not just the number of teachers, not just warm bodies in \nthe room--but the quality of that teacher matters. That, as indicated \nby the studies I cited earlier today, is what determines how well that \nindividual child learns.\n\n[[Page S4913]]\n\n  What is good about the underlying bill, and why I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the Murray amendment, is that we do not make that \ndecision. The data is there. We do not force or encourage or \nincentivize the system to go one way or the other in terms of higher \nquality teachers, better recruitment, or professional development \nversus hiring another teacher and reducing class size.\n  We basically say: No, you decide. If you are in Nashville, TN, in a \ndisadvantaged part of Nashville, TN, or in rural Tennessee, you decide \nhow you can best use that education dollar based on your local needs. \nThe pooling of resources, the discretion we give to local communities \nabout how to use that dollar we feel is so important, we believe that \nschool districts should have the flexibility to decide whether to use \nthe money we have made available for reduced class size, for teacher \ntraining, for technology in the classroom, or some other means to \nreduce the student achievement gap.\n  There is some data, as I mentioned--again, I am one who thinks class \nsize is, indeed, an important issue. I just think it needs to be \ndetermined by a particular school or a particular district rather than \nby Washington, DC.\n  There are studies that have prioritized the importance of class size. \nThe National Commission on Teaching and America's Future found that, if \nyour goal is student achievement, then teacher quality is five times \nmore important than class size per se. Class-size reduction is \nimportant, but in a relative sense it is less important than having a \ngood quality teacher.\n  The New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies found student \ngrades were not linked to class size. Smaller classes did not lead to \nbetter test scores, and that there was no difference in the achievement \nof students from small classrooms versus those from large classrooms.\n  In Dallas, researchers confirmed that one of the studies that was \ndone at the University of Tennessee found that not only did high-\nquality teachers have an enormous impact on student achievement, but \nthat low-quality teachers actually stunted the academic performance of \ntheir students.\n  We have a shortage of high-quality teachers. People who say class \nsize is the answer need to recognize--again, it has been spelled out \nover the course of the morning and last week--that there is a shortage \nof high-quality teachers.\n  We do need to invest--remember, the purpose of this bill is to invest \nin education because the role of the Federal Government is no longer \nspender but investor. We know this because after about $120 billion \nover 35 years, we are still not accomplishing our goal. So, it's not \njust a matter of money but a matter of investment. If you are a prudent \ninvestor, you need to make sure that the outcome is delivered, and in \neducation the outcome is student achievement.\n\n  If we have compulsory class size reduction, basically we are putting \nmore teachers in the classroom. But if we have a shortage of high-\nquality teachers, by definition it means we are going to be taking \nlower quality teachers.\n  The data outlined is clear: You actually hurt children rather than \nhelp children if you are putting poor quality teachers in a classroom \ntoday and, therefore, it is very important that you weigh the relative \nimportance of putting just bodies at the head of that class, \ninteracting with your children, against putting high quality people at \nthe head of the class.\n  The point is, we give the school, the school district, the parents, \nthe opportunity to make that choice based on the needs they identify--\nit could be through assessments, it could be identification of that \nlocal need in any way that school district or that school sees fit.\n  Our underlying bill is very different from the Murray amendment which \noverrides the school district priorities, and overriding the school \ndistrict priorities in many ways restricts that choice, that freedom. \nThat is why I urge defeat of the Murray amendment and hope my \ncolleagues will join me in defeating that amendment.\n  Again, as has been outlined in the underlying bill, we stress \nprofessional development, as well as class size, but it must be a local \nchoice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in my last 1 minute, I will address two \nquick points. Our colleagues keep referring to local control. How can \none define a bill against an amendment that it should be local control \nwhen this underlying bill itself requires Federally mandated testing, \nrequires funding streams for reading, for technology, for 20 other \nprograms? That is fundamentally a flawed argument against this.\n  Our argument is about local control. Local schools decide whether \nthey want to reduce class size knowing they have a Federal partner if \nthey want to make that happen.\n  Second, I keep hearing the Hanushek study referred to.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the Hanushek study is based on study \nof pupil-teacher ratio which includes all of the certified people in \nthe building which is today almost everybody. Hanushek is fundamentally \nflawed because he does not look at class size. All of the studies that \nwe have shown from Wisconsin, Tennessee, the RAND study, and the \nCalifornia study dramatically show that reducing class size increases \nstudent performance.\n  How tragic it will be if this Senate does not approve this amendment \nand keep the commitment to reducing class size that we began 3 years \nago.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to comment on Senator \nMurray's amendment regarding class-size reduction. Yesterday, I \nwithdrew my second degree amendment, amendment No. 388, which would \nhave accomplished what I sought to do last year on the appropriations \nbill covering the Department of Education. I would have preferred to \ngive class-size reduction in hiring new teachers a presumption among \nthe various items which the Federal funds could be spent for on \nteachers. If a school district would make a determination that other \nissues--such as training teachers to improve the education of students \nwith disabilities or those with limited english proficiency--are more \nimportant, then I believe Federal funds should be available for those \npurposes as they may be decided at the local level.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that is responsible \nfor funding critical labor, health and education programs, I have \nsought to strike a balance between providing States and localities the \nflexibility they need to implement programs designed to improve the \nacademic achievement of all students--thereby relieving them of \nWashington's straightjacket--and placing the highest priority on those \nissues that we deem critical to the success of America's \nschoolchildren.\n  I believe that we must weight carefully the flexibility our States \nand school districts need to improve student achievement with priority \nprograms such as class-size reduction. The underlying bill will permit \nthe Federal funds to be used for class-size reduction by hiring more \nteachers although it lacks the impetus which a presumption would have \ngiven.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/15/senate-section/article/S4913-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We will now resume consideration of the Murray \namendment No. 378. There are 5 minutes equally divided before the vote.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in a minute we are going to be voting on \na\n\n[[Page S4914]]\n\nvery important amendment which reduces class size in first, second, and \nthird grades and continue the commitment this Congress has made in the \nlast three years.\n  Frankly, I cannot believe the Senate just spent 2 hours debating \nwhether or not smaller class size makes a difference. We know it makes \na difference. Any teacher, parent, or student will tell you that, and \nwe have the research that proves it.\n  This vote is our opportunity to support the progress being made in \nschools across the country and to show that we are willing to invest in \nthe things that work. If our colleagues vote against this amendment, in \nSeptember when parents find their kids back in overcrowded classrooms, \nthey are going to be upset. They are going to want to know why you \nvoted against smaller classes. You can tell them about flexibility, \nchoice, and funding pools, but the truth is, none of those buzzwords \nwill help their kids learn to read when they are fighting just to get a \nteacher's attention. The choice we make today will demonstrate whether \n``no child left behind'' is just a catchy campaign slogan or a national \ncommitment. I hope it is the latter. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment, and I yield back the remaining time on our side.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Murray \namendment. The bill before us clearly states that Federal funds must be \nused for activities that will improve teaching and learning in the \nclassroom, including the hiring of highly qualified teachers, if that \nhiring will improve student performance. The decision as to how Federal \nmoney is to be used is up to the local school district.\n  Although there are teacher shortages in States and localities, there \nare also areas where teacher shortages are not prevalent. As you can \nsee from this chart, which illustrates class size over the last 40 \nyears, the recent trend in the mid to late 1990s indicates that class \nsize is averaging around 17 students per teacher.\n  I oppose the class size reduction amendment because I believe local \nschools are in a better position than we are to determine how best to \ndistribute funding in regard to professional development and hiring \npractices. S. 1 gives local school districts the opportunity to make \ntheir own decisions about the expenditure of dollars for the purpose of \nimproving their teacher corps, which, in turn, will hopefully lead to \ngains in overall student performance. I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis class size amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a study regarding the effects on children of \n     exposure to violent enterainment, and to require the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress to gather information regarding how \n      much time children spend on various forms of entertainment)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 902. STUDY AND INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--The Director of the National Institutes of \n     Health and the Secretary of Education jointly shall--\n       (A) conduct a study regarding how exposure to violent \n     entertainment (such as movies, music, television, Internet \n     content, video games, and arcade games) affects children's \n     cognitive development and educational achievement; and\n       (B) submit a final report to Congress regarding the study.\n       (2) Plan.--The Director and the Secretary jointly shall \n     submit to Congress, not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, a plan for the conduct of the study.\n       (3) Interim reports.--The Director and the Secretary \n     jointly shall submit to Congress annual interim reports \n     regarding the study until the final report is submitted under \n     paragraph (1)(B).\n       (b) Information.--Section 411(b)(3) of the National \n     Education Statistics Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 9010(b)(3) et \n     seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: \n     ``Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in carrying out the \n     National Assessment the Commissioner shall gather data \n     regarding how much time children spend on various forms of \n     entertainment, such as movies, music, television, Internet \n     content, video games, and arcade games.''.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the adoption of \nthis amendment to S. 1. I am delighted to be joined in this effort by \nmy friend and colleague, Senator Kohl from Wisconsin. I would also like \nto thank the chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions for his work in securing the passage of this amendment. I \nthink this is a noncontroversial amendment so I am going to summarize \nthe point.\n  Over the past several years, we have had a number of hearings by this \nCongress about the impact of entertainment, particularly violent \nentertainment, on children, and the accessibility of such entertainment \nto children. This last summer we had the six major health organizations \nin the country--the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric \nAssociation, American Academy of Pediatrics, and others--sign a \nstatement which said that exposing children to violent entertainment \ncan actually cause increases in aggression and hostility and decreases \nin empathy.\n  Since then, there have also been reports of studies focusing on how \nviolent entertainment affects a child's brain activity. Less than a \nmonth ago, USA Today reported on one study conducted by Professor John \nMurray of Kansas State University. It showed the results of MRIs taken \nof children who were watching violent film clips. The reporter \nconcluded: ``The scans showed that violent film clips activate \nchildren's brains in a distinctive, potentially violence-producing \npattern. Although children may consciously know\n\n[[Page S4915]]\n\nthat violence on the screen isn't real, their brains are treating it as \ngospel truth.''\n  We know that a young child's mind goes through extraordinary \ndevelopment, particularly before the age of 7. We know the influences \non their early life can profoundly affect both what they think about \nand how they think. New research has provided interesting insights into \nhow parents can create the best learning environment and most \nencouraging learning environment for their children--what influences \nand factors will encourage the healthiest development of a child's \nintellect and cognition and enhance their abilities as they develop and \nmove forward in life.\n  Despite these studies and their implications for the way a young \nchild's mind grows and develops, as well as how they perform in school, \nthere has been very little study on how exposure to entertainment, \nparticularly violent entertainment, affects their cognitive \ndevelopment. This is not a data gap; it is a chasm. And it needs to be \nfilled.\n  It is in the public interest to find out what the impact of exposing \nchildren to violent entertainment has on their cognitive development. \nIt is also in the parent's best interests, as well as in the best \ninterests of children, and, obviously, it is in the best interests of \nthis country. Therefore, the amendment I am proposing, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Kohl, would be a first step in addressing this data \nchasm.\n  It calls for a study on how children's cognitive and academic \nachievement are affected by exposure to violent entertainment. It calls \non the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Education to \njointly work out a plan for conducting this study, subject to \ncongressional approval, and to report its findings.\n  The more we know about how our children's young minds are formed and \ncultivated, the better we can educate, nurture, and care for them. This \namendment is an important step towards realizing that goal.\n  In conclusion, let me say this: We know that currently children in \nAmerica spend more time in front of a television, a computer screen, or \na play station than they do in school. They certainly spend more time \nin front of one of those screens than they do talking with their \nparents. We know children spend a large portion of their waking hours \nfocused on entertainment, and we can assume that it has some impact on \ntheir thoughts, attitudes, and even abilities. But what we do not know \nyet is what exposure to violent entertainment does to a child's \ncognitive abilities. Some of the early studies seem to be very \ntroubling about what it is doing to a child's brain. That is why we are \nasking for this study, so we can learn about this much better.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if Senator Jeffords, the manager of the bill \nwould be willing to engage me in a short colloquy concerning the \npending Brownback-Kohl amendment.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for their willingness to include our \namendment in the education bill. We think this is an important addition \nto the legislation because it will give Congress and the Department of \nEducation a tool for evaluating the effect of violent entertainment on \nthe cognitive development and educational achievement of our children.\n  It is the Senator's intention when we go to conference in the House \nto make every effort to assure that the Brownback-Kohl amendment is \nincluded in the final version of the bill?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides of the aisle. We all agree that the Brownback-Kohl amendment, \nwhich would gather data on the use of violent entertainment by children \nthrough the National Assessment of Educational Attainment and require a \njoint National Institutes of Health-Department of Education study on \nthe issue, is highly relevant to improving the educational performance \nof our children. It is my intention to keep this provision in the final \nversion of the education reform package when it comes out of conference \nwith the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I just want to add that there have been no \nobjections from our side of the aisle to including the Brownback-Kohl \namendment in the bill. I appreciate Senator Jeffords' cooperation with \nme, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Brownback to get this amendment \nincluded in the bill. I also appreciate his assurance that he will do \neverything he can to make sure our proposal is included in the final \neducation reform bill.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I do not know of anybody who is \nopposing this amendment. I ask for its adoption. There may be other \nMembers who would like to comment on this amendment. I believe it is \npossible we may be able to proceed to a voice vote on this amendment \nwhile we are still on the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is entirely appropriate that we study \nthe impact of violence in the media on young people. The increasing \nincidence of violent behavior is alarming and we should carefully \nscrutinize the causes of that violence.\n  It will be very helpful to learn which types of imaging and \nbroadcasting have causal links to violent behavior. A great deal of \nresearch has already been conducted in this area. For example, \nresearchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have studied \nthe impact of violent images in movies, television and video games and \nhave expressed caution against a presumption that there is an isolated \ncause and effect between violent images and violent action.\n  I also believe that access to guns is indisputably part of this \ncritical problem. There is no one individual cause of this disturbing \nsocial pattern and we should avoid simplifying either this problem or \nour solution to it.\n  However, many young people spend a great deal of time watching \ntelevision and movies and we should explore incentives to the industry \nto provide entertaining material that is nonviolent.\n  Industry leaders have expressed a willingness to incorporate improved \nwarnings for parents to monitor the programming that their children do \nwatch, and we should do all that we can to make these worthwhile tools \naccessible and understandable.\n  We should be ready also to acknowledge that the entertainment \nindustry is not solely responsible for increasing violent behavior in \nour youngest citizens.\n  The Senate should also improve a broad range of opportunities for \nchildren to help them achieve to their fullest expectations and dreams. \nWe can increase funding for Early Start and Head Start. We can improve \nthe learning experience of children once they enter school, including \nreducing class size and teacher quality.\n  I have sponsored--and I have worked very closely with the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, Mr. Cochran--on our Ready to Learn legislation to \nensure that time spent watching television by young preschool children \nwill be entertaining and educational. With a modest $15 million Federal \nappropriation, public broadcasting has created effective educational \nprogramming that develops skills necessary for success when a child \nenters a classroom for the first time.\n  Accompanying material is provided for parents, caregivers and other \nfamily members to encourage reading in the child's home environment. We \nshould be tripling funding for this program, but instead, this bill \nseeks to eliminate it.\n  The number of awards that those programs for children have been \nnominated for has been truly amazing. There have been over 40 Emmys for \nall the ready-to-learn programs. ``Between the Lions'' has really been \nan extraordinary success. It and its Web site have won several awards. \nThe series won the Parents' Choice Gold Award for best show for kids \naged 4 to 7. It was recently named the Best Children's Show in the \ncountry by the Television Critics Association. It has just been \nnominated for several Academy Awards. And the Web site won two awards \nin the fall of 2000: Best Children's Entertainment Site from the \nMassachusetts Interactive Media Council and Best Kids Web Entertainment \nfrom NewsMedia.com's Invision Awards.\n  We welcome the Senator's amendment and think it is an entirely \nappropriate one. We also recognize there are important additional \nmatters to which we should give focus.\n  I support a serious examination of the impact that violence in the \nmedia\n\n[[Page S4916]]\n\nhas on young children. I am, as well, hopeful we can also improve the \neducational components of our media.\n  As I know the Senator is aware, we attempted, for a number of years, \nto make that as a condition for the relicensing. What happened, of \ncourse, is that it never worked because we would find that with the \napplication the broadcasting industry would just label programs as \nchildren's programs, and they never really carried forward the effect \nof that.\n  We have been remarkably unsuccessful in monitoring and affecting the \nkind of violence there is on television. But when we provided a very \nlimited amount of incentives for the development of children's \nprograms, and worked those through public broadcasting, we have had \nsome amazing success.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator in terms of getting this \nstudy, this review, and also working with him to try to see what can be \ndeveloped to attract families, and particularly parents with their \nchildren, to watch the programs on television that can be useful, \npositive, constructive, and, hopefully, educational and helpful to the \nchildren as well.\n  I urge acceptance of the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I do not believe there is any objection \nto the amendment.\n  I yield to the Senator on his amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I believe we are ready to proceed to a \nvoice vote on the amendment. Unless the Senator from North Carolina \nwould care to address the amendment, I think it would be appropriate \nfor us to proceed to a voice vote. I call for a voice vote at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 413.\n  The amendment (No. 413) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 462 To Amendment No. 358\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Voinovich amendment No. 443 is the pending \nbusiness.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I ask unanimous consent to lay that amendment aside, and \nI call up amendment No. 462.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Edwards] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 462 to amendment No. 358.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for an independent analysis to measure school \n                         district achievement)\n\n       On page 679, after line 25, add the following:\n       ``(6) support for arrangements that provide for independent \n     analysis to measure and report on school district \n     achievement.''.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple and \nstraightforward. It deals with the issue of testing.\n  Much of our education bill we have been discussing for the last \nseveral days and much of the administration's proposal is modeled after \nwhat has been done in North Carolina. In North Carolina, we have had in \nplace for a number of years a very vigorous measurement and testing \nregime. In fact, we already have annual testing in reading and math in \ngrades 3 through 8, which is precisely what is being proposed by the \nadministration and is incorporated into this bill.\n  This testing process has played a very important role in allowing us \nto measure student performance in North Carolina and also to identify \nlow-performing schools so we can make an intense effort to turn those \nschools around.\n  What I have learned from visiting our schools and talking with \nstudents and teachers is that testing in and of itself is not an end. \nIt is a means. From talking to students and teachers and at town hall \nmeetings talking to parents about this testing procedure that has been \nused in North Carolina, I have learned that there is a great deal of \nconcern that students are spending too much time preparing for tests \nand teachers are spending too much time in the classroom teaching to \nthe test.\n  It has gotten to the point where some students and some teachers \nbelieve the tests dominate the classroom. And because of the way the \ntests are given and administered and the kinds of tests that are given, \nit can sometimes be counterproductive to the learning process.\n  What we are doing in this amendment is providing that States can go \nto private outside firms to evaluate the testing in a particular school \ndistrict to determine whether it is working, how effective it is, and \nalso to make comparisons with the testing being used in that school \ndistrict as compared to the testing being used in another school \ndistrict someplace else in the country.\n  The basic theory is these private outside firms can identify school \ndistricts where the testing is working, where it is effective, where it \nhas as little impact as possible on the learning process inside the \nclassroom so the teachers, the students, and the parents feel the \ntesting process is working. It allows them to measure but, at the same \ntime, it doesn't interfere with the substantive learning process of the \nstudents, for the students and the teacher.\n  The basic idea is the State is allowed to contract with these outside \nfirms which can evaluate the testing programs and compare them with \ntesting programs in other places across the country.\n  The amendment does not authorize any new money. It simply allows \nStates to conduct this type of analysis. The purpose of this amendment \nand its thrust is to focus on the issue of testing, allow States to \nidentify testing methods and procedures that are, in fact, working. It \nis a specific effort to address a concern I have heard expressed over \nand over from students, from teachers, and from parents; that is, to \nhave a testing system and a measurement system that provides us with \nthe information we need but at the same time does as little as possible \nto interfere with the teaching process and with the learning process.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina has given \nadditional focus on a very key element in this legislation; that is, \nthe information made available to parents. His amendment will add an \nadditional dimension in terms of the possible accuracy and types of \ninformation so it can be easily understood and utilized by parents and \nso they can understand what is happening in the schools their children \nare attending.\n  In the existing legislation, there is the requirement that the States \nwill provide information to the parents. What the amendment of the \nSenator from North Carolina does is provide the ability for the States \nthemselves to get, through this contracting arrangement, the up-to-\ndate, most advanced, most recent, comprehensive information that can \npossibly be developed. It gives that option to the State to provide it \nto the parents. It is incredibly important.\n  This is one of the underlying concepts of the legislation; that is, \nthat the parents become involved. We want them to be involved, and \nthere are ample provisions in the legislation to have them involved. We \nwant to get the parents involved. Part of a very powerful tool to get \nthem involved is giving them information about what is happening in the \nschool and what the condition of the school is.\n  We have provided in the legislation a range of different information \nthat will be available in the report card. The Senator from North \nCarolina, with this additional amendment, can give the assurance that \nif the State wants to work through a contracting arrangement, the \ninformation may very well be much more available and usable and current \nfor the parent. That is very important\n\n[[Page S4917]]\n\nand completely consistent with the direction of the legislation and \nvery desirable to have.\n  I thank him for this idea, as well as bringing to the basic \nlegislation the experience that has taken place in turning around low-\nperforming schools in North Carolina, and the way it has changed \nthrough the development of some enormously interesting and very \nsuccessful models that will be available in this legislation to \ncommunities all over this country is really a major strengthening of \nand improvement in the legislation itself. That is one of the things \nthat makes this legislation so hopeful.\n  If we are able to get the resources to be able to give all these \nprovisions some life and meaning, we are going to be in an even \nstronger position. As the Senator from North Carolina and others have \npointed out, we have a blueprint here which is both supportable and \ncommendable and can make a difference, but we need the resources to \nmake sure these provisions are going to do what, in this instance, \nparents need and should have and also what schoolchildren should have \nin the provisions which have been included in the bill that are \npatterned after the very important, successful initiatives in North \nCarolina.\n  I thank the Senator for his initiative. I hope we will accept it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to join in the accolades for the \nSenator's amendment. What we are doing in this bill is not something \nthat is easily understood when you try to analyze the facts. But it is \nincredibly important that parents understand how their child is doing.\n  The amendment that we have here will be very helpful in letting us \nunderstand what is an incredibly important move forward in making sure \nthat we get changes and improvements in the system, but it does it in a \nway that we can fully understand how each child is doing. I thank the \nSenator for his excellent amendment.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator. I ask for a voice vote at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The amendment (No. 462) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Voinovich \namendment.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 622, As Modified, to Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 622, and I ask \nunanimous consent to modify my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton], for himself, Mr. \n     Corzine, and Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered \n     622, as modified.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I may have to object. We haven't seen a \ncopy of it yet.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary inquiry. The Senator is permitted to \nmodify his amendment. We haven't asked for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I will make it a second degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was a filing deadline for first-degree \namendments. That does constitute Senate action which would then require \nthat the Senator does need consent to modify.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we have no objection to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 622), as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to \nfully fund 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure for programs \n                       under part B of such Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

MAINTAINING FUNDING FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WITH \n                   DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT.\n\n       Section 611 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Act is amended to add the following new subsection:\n       ``(k) Continuation of Authorization.--For fiscal year 2012 \n     and each fiscal year thereafter, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated such sums as may be necessary for purpose of \n     carrying out this part, other than section 619.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment, \nwhich is also sponsored by Senators Corzine and Wellstone.\n  This amendment would bring the Federal share of funding for special \neducation up to its long-promised 40 percent level in 2 years.\n  I greatly admire the efforts of my senior colleagues, the authors of \nthis legislation, who have negotiated the previous agreement which is \nnow contained in the legislation. I applaud their efforts and I support \ntheir work.\n  However, I would like to see their timetable for funding 40 percent \nof the costs of special education accelerated. That is the promise I \nmade to Minnesota educators, parents, and students.\n  The failure of the Federal Government to pay for 40 percent of the \ncost of special education is a broken promise which now extends for 25 \nyears. This unfunded Federal mandate is having devastating consequences \nfor schools all across Minnesota.\n  Federal law requires these important services to students with \ndisabilities and special needs, but it does not provide the funds \nnecessary for them. There is no question that school districts must \nprovide them and should provide them. But without the necessary and \nlong-promised funding from the Federal Government, Minnesota school \ndistricts must take money away from other students and from other \neducation programs. In Minnesota, that means local property taxes must \nbe increased to make up the shortfall. Yet even then there is still not \nenough money available to do justice to all students.\n  Then schools are blamed, teachers are blamed, and even students are \nblamed. Yet the failure is ours. The failure is our unwillingness to \nprovide the funding necessary to allow schools to succeed, teachers to \nsucceed, and students to succeed.\n  Without my amendment, we are saying: Yes, we recognize our \nresponsibility. We intend to finally keep our\n\n[[Page S4918]]\n\npromise, but we need 6 more years to do so. That is too much \nprocrastination.\n  The recently passed budget resolution said that Congress can afford \nhuge tax cuts for the very wealthiest Americans. However, we cannot \nafford to keep our promises to the schoolchildren of America, \nespecially those who have the greatest needs.\n\n  That is just plain wrong.\n  It is time to put our money where our mouths are. We can no longer \nhide behind the claim that we don't have the funds to do what is right. \nWe have the money. The question is, Do we have the will to spend some \nof it on behalf of better education for all of America's children? That \nis the decision we must make today on this amendment.\n  My amendment would increase education funding by $12 billion in \nfiscal year 2002 and by $18 billion in fiscal year 2003. That is a lot \nof money, no doubt about it. But it is less than one-fifth the cost of \nthe proposed tax cuts for 2002, and less than one-third of the tax cuts \nproposed for 2003. We could still have major tax reduction for middle-\nincome working Americans, and even for upper income Americans, and \nstill keep our promise to fund 40 percent of America's special \neducation costs.\n  That is the decision before us today. That is the question which my \namendment addresses.\n  On behalf of Minnesota's schoolchildren and educators, I urge the \nSenate to adopt this amendment. Its benefits will accrue to every \nclassroom, in every school, in every school district throughout \nAmerica. It will help take the President's words: ``leave no child \nbehind'' and make them a living reality for millions of schoolchildren \nthroughout our country.\n  I am reminded of the title of the old television show, ``Truth or \nConsequences.'' Either we tell the truth or we face the consequences. \nThe truth is that we are not meeting our financial commitment to public \neducation throughout America. The truth is that the Federal Government \nhas mandated important special services to children with special needs \nfor the last 25 years but has not provided its promised funding \nnecessary to fulfill this pledge.\n  The consequences of our failures are children throughout America who \nare not receiving the special education they need and deserve. The \nconsequences are lost hopes, lost dreams, and lost lives.\n  It is time to tell the truth. This amendment will restore the truth \nto a 25-year unfunded mandate.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate's passage of this amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nbe set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to speak for and offer my strong \nsupport to my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Dayton. My \nunderstanding is I am an original cosponsor, along with Senator \nCorzine. I will not take much time. There are other colleagues who are \non the floor.\n  This amendment fully funds the IDEA program within 2 years, and the \nspending will be mandatory. Because of the special rules regarding \nmandatory spending, my understanding is this amendment will require 60 \nvotes for it to be adopted.\n  To give some sense of the impact IDEA full funding will have on some \nschool districts in Minnesota, Minneapolis will receive around $16 \nmillion; St. Paul, $15 million; Duluth will receive around $4.5 \nmillion; Blue Earth area public schools will receive around $550,000; \nDeer River will receive $419,000; and Walnut Grove will receive \n$54,000.\n  For those who do not know each of these towns, they probably know \nMinneapolis and St. Paul. I am also giving some greater Minnesota \nexamples so no one will labor under the misunderstanding that this \namendment only applies to urban or metropolitan areas. It is terribly \nimportant to rural areas as well.\n  We have had some other important amendments dealing with IDEA, and, \nin particular, there was the Harkin-Hagel amendment which passed last \nweek. That was to fully fund IDEA and also to make it mandatory. That \nwas to provide full funding over a 6-year period.\n  I commend the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Nebraska for \ntheir work. I also want to say this about the Senator from Iowa. I do \nnot think there is another Senator--one has to be careful when one says \nthis because one doesn't want to slight anyone, but I do not believe \nthere has been anybody in the Senate who has been, if you will, more \nthere for children and adults with disabilities than Senator Harkin. \nThe IDEA program in some ways is Tom Harkin's idea. This is who he is.\n  The amendment that was adopted is terribly important, and Senator \nHagel's support was critical as well. We also have done some other work \non this education bill that is critically important.\n  The real importance of this amendment and what Senator Dayton is \nsaying and the reason this is a joint effort by both Senators from \nMinnesota--I worry a lot about what we are doing on this education \nbill. I worry about what we are doing for a couple of different \nreasons. I will try to make a couple quick points, I say to the Senator \nfrom Missouri and also to my friend from Arkansas.\n  I have not even had a chance to read this article yet today, but I \nwas skim reading a piece where I saw--and this is really important--a \nreference to a letter or a statement that has been put out by Dr. \nRobert Coles and Dr. Albert Poussant who are two child psychologists \nor, in the case of Coles, a psychiatrist, and maybe Dr. Poussant is a \npsychiatrist as well. They have done the best work with children in the \ncountry. Robert Coles has written 46 books on children. I remember \nassigning one of his books to my students called ``Children in \nCrisis.''\n  I say to the Senator from Vermont, their letter is a plea to the \nSenate not to rush to these tests.\n  What they are saying is--these are now my words--you are taking the \nchildhood away from children. They are finding 8-year-olds and 9-year-\nolds who are under tremendous stress and showing signs of being under \ntremendous stress because of all these tests they are now taking.\n\n  We have to think this through. Some of the amendments I have--and I \nhope to have as many of them adopted as possible, and I appreciate the \nsupport from other colleagues--are to make sure we do this the best \npossible way.\n  In my own mind, I raise the philosophical question again: Should the \nFederal Government be telling every school district in every State to \ntest every child starting at age 8 all the way every year to age 13? I \ndo not know whether we should even be doing this. Should we be doing \nthis to these little children? I am not sure we should. That is a \nphilosophical question, and I will now put it aside.\n  The second problem is whether the resources are going to be there. I \nwant to again put my colleagues on notice, not in a confrontational \nway, but I want them to know there are a couple of amendments I have \nprepared that I look forward to offering which basically say: When we \nadopt these amendments that authorize money, that does not mean it will \never happen, so we have to make sure that if we are going to do this \ntesting, not only do we do it the right way, but that the funding will \nbe available, be it the IDEA program--\n\n[[Page S4919]]\n\nthat is what is so important about Senator Dayton's amendment--for \nchildren with special needs, be it title I for children who come from \neconomically disadvantaged families so that there is more help for \nreading, more help for afterschool programs, more help for good \nteachers and teaching assistants, you name it--which will be another \namendment which I, frankly, think is just as important, especially if \nwe are going to start testing 8-year-olds, third graders. I will argue \nforever that far more important in determining how that child is going \nto do--maybe not at age 13, but at age 8--far more important than the \nteacher, although good teachers are always critically important, and \nfar more important than reduced class size, far more important than \nwhether the school is inviting and a good facility is whether or not \nthat child came to kindergarten ready to learn. So the issue is, if we \nare going to start testing 8-year-olds, then we do that when we make \nthe commitment to fully fund the Head Start Program, and that includes \nEarly Head Start.\n\n  I am convinced, the more I think about this moving beyond Head Start, \nthat we have to get to the point where, for 4-year-olds, if not 3-year-\nolds--and it could be optional--you need to pay teachers who do this \nwork decent salaries. The Head Start Program is optional for families, \nbut every family has that opportunity, and we fund it within our \noverall goal of public education. We really need to get real about it.\n  I think the context for Senator Dayton's amendment is twofold. No. 1, \nfor Minnesota, let me repeat these figures: Minneapolis, an additional \n$16 million; St. Paul, $15 million; Duluth, $4.5 million; Blue Earth \nArea Public School, $550,000; Deer River, $419,000; Walnut Grove, \n$54,000. It would be hugely important for us to make this commitment. \nThat is why I join my colleague, Senator Dayton, in this effort.\n  Final point: I really think the work that is being done for the IDEA \nprogram, that deals with children with special needs, is, as my good \nfriend from Iowa likes to say, a constitutional mandate. We believe \nthese children with special needs should have every right to be in \nschool with other children and to get the best possible education.\n  But we are nowhere near our 40-percent funding to which we made a \ncommitment. We are at about 14 percent. What Senator Dayton is saying \nin this amendment is: Why 7 years? Why 10 years? If it is the right \nthing to do and we have this huge surplus now, then let's do the right \nthing over the next 2 years. The sooner we do it, the sooner we get the \nassistance to the local school districts, the sooner we get the \nassistance to the children, the sooner we get the assistance to our \nteachers, the sooner we get the assistance to our States. Therefore, if \nit is a great idea and a compelling idea and the right thing to do, it \nis the right thing to do now. Make it mandatory and fully fund it over \na 2-year period of time.\n  I strongly support this amendment, and I hope my colleagues will vote \nfor it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 555\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON.

Since I became chairman of the Armed Services \nPersonnel Subcommittee last year, the subcommittee has conducted two \nhearings on recruiting. This has been a real eye opener to me, to \nlisten to these front-line military recruiters about the obstacles they \nface in doing a very important job for the U.S. military.\n  At both hearings, uniformed recruiters complained that denial of \naccess to high school students or student directory information was the \nNo. 1 obstacle they face in their efforts to recruit high-quality men \nand women needed to man today's military. It is a bigger problem than \nthe health care of the military, a bigger problem than educational \nbenefits, a bigger problem than image. Bigger than anything else was \nthe problem of actually getting access to the students to be able to \ntell their story about the career opportunities they might have serving \nin the U.S. military.\n  I was stunned to discover that more than 4,000 high schools across \nthe Nation, which routinely allow colleges, employers, and class ring \ncompanies access to students, are denying access to recruiters from one \nor more of our military services.\n  In 1999, the last year in which accurate figures are available, the \nArmy was denied access by 4,515 schools; the Navy was denied access by \n4,364 schools; the Marine Corps was denied\n\n[[Page S4920]]\n\naccess by 4,884 schools; and the Air Force was denied access by 5,465 \nhigh schools in the United States.\n  This, I suggest, is a national disgrace. Our Armed Forces protect \nAmerica's freedoms, and uniformed recruiters should not be denied \naccess to almost a quarter of America's young people because, many \ntimes, of the arbitrary decision of a high school principal or a high \nschool superintendent.\n  Denial of access undermines our national defense by making it even \nmore difficult to recruit high-quality young Americans in numbers \nsufficient to maintain the readiness of our All-Volunteer Force.\n  Denying recruiters direct access to students and student directory \ninformation also unfairly hurts America's youth. It prevents students \nfrom receiving important information on the educational and training \nbenefits offered by the Armed Forces and impairs students' \ndecisionmaking by hiding the career opportunities available to them.\n  When I became aware, that our recruiters whom we ask to do one of the \nmost difficult jobs in the military, to go out and recruit young men \nand women to go into our military at pay that is disparate from what \nthey could get in the private sector, in an almost full-employment \neconomy, we were asking them to do that with one hand tied behind their \nbacks because they weren't given access to almost one-quarter of the \nstudents, I offered a provision in last year's defense authorization \nbill which would, effective July 1, 2001, require high schools to \nprovide recruiters for the armed services both physical and directory \naccess equal to that provided to colleges and prospective employers.\n  If the high school wants to have an across-the-board policy of no \naccess to their students--no employers, no colleges--then certainly \nthey could apply that to military recruiters. But if they are going to \nsay class ring companies can come on, colleges and institutions of \nhigher learning can come on to the campus and recruit, industries can \ncome on and recruit for careers, then we said that military recruiters \nshould have access on the same basis.\n  If such access is not granted, a recruiter must report the denial to \nhis or her respective service. This report will trigger, then, a series \nof visits and written notifications by the Department of Defense \npersonnel culminating in the Secretary of Defense contacting the \nrelevant Governor and asking for help in restoring access to the \noffending high school.\n  Any school district in America would have the opportunity to opt out \nof the law if the local school board voted publicly to discriminate \nagainst recruiters from the Armed Forces. But no more simply shall a \nsuperintendent or a principal making a determination on their own for \nwhatever reason, because of a bad experience or whatever they might \nhave had, that might motivate them to prevent these recruiters from \naccess. It would have to go to a public vote of the elected \nrepresentatives, elected school board, before they could opt out of the \nlaw. Any high school that continued to discriminate against recruiters \nfrom the Armed Forces without the support of such a vote would open \nitself to lawsuits in Federal court.\n  We are rapidly approaching July 1, 2001, which will mark 1 year until \nthe new law becomes effective. We have already heard from many \nrecruiters that they are finding that high schools are not aware of the \npublic law that changed Federal policy and the fact it is going to go \ninto effect in just a little over a year. So as thousands of high \nschools, yet ignorant of the pending change in the law, continue to \ndiscriminate against uniformed recruiters, I think now is the time for \na national wake-up call concerning this denial of access that continues \nto this day.\n  My amendment states that:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of \n     Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, \n     should. . .establish a year-long campaign to educate \n     principals, school administrators, and other educators \n     regarding career opportunities in the Armed Forces and the \n     access standard [that is required under this new law].\n\n  I think it is very important that recruiters as they go across this \ncountry have the support of the Congress in the sense that these \nprincipals, these superintendents, and school administrators are aware \nthat we have changed the public policy. There will be a new law in \neffect.\n  There will be a new law in effect, and the only way they can deny \nthat access is when they go before the elected school board members and \nhave a public vote to that effect.\n  I hope my colleagues will unanimously support a very commonsense and \npatriotic amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, many young people in our schools today are \nsuspended for bad behavior, somewhat unlike the days when I was in high \nschool. They took care of the bad ones right there on the spot when I \nwas there. But today a lot of them are suspended. A number of children \nin our schools are expelled for violent or dangerous behavior. And I am \nall for that. I am all for suspensions and expulsions where warranted, \nbut what then? In today's home, all to often, both parents work. The \nsuspended or expelled student may be left to his or her own devices. \nMany counties send expelled students to alternative schools, but \nalternative schools do not always follow the same procedure, the same \nschedule as regular public schools, again leaving children on their own \nfor portions of the school day. And an idle mind is the devil's \nworkshop.\n  An idle young person with no supervision is a child who can easily \nget into trouble. A violent young person expelled for serious breaches \nof behavior could even be a menace to the community at large. Some \nchildren actually misbehave in school, I am told, in the hopes of being \nsuspended or expelled with the notion that they will be able to enjoy a \nbrief respite from their school classes.\n  The amendment which I have offered and which has now been modified \nwould encourage States to create a program that enrolls suspended and \nexpelled youth in community service programs. You see, put them to work \nat something that encourages them to become builders, not wreckers, of \nbuildings. The purpose of this amendment then is twofold.\n  First, it would occupy young people who have been suspended or \nexpelled. It would put those idle hands to work. Instead of hanging \naround on street corners or roaming around the shopping malls, these \nyouths would participate in community service activities that give them \nstructure, that promote a work ethic, and send the message that being \nsuspended from school is not a vacation.\n  Second, this program would give back to the community. Too often the \nyoung people of the ``me'' generation--the ``me\" generation--do not \nconsider that we are a society, and that each member of that society \nhas a responsibility to the other people in that society. By performing \ncommunity service, these young people would be making a contribution to \ntheir neighbors which would give them a sense of doing for others, \nperhaps even opening their eyes to the problems of those around them.\n  My amendment would provide $50 million to allow States to coordinate \nand run a program which puts suspended and expelled students to work. \nWhether it is picking up litter, whacking weeds, painting fences, or \nmowing the grass, participating in public service activities will \nprovide these young people with an alternative activity that helps to \nbetter their communities, and to better their lives.\n  Wordsworth wrote, ``Small service is true service while it lasts.'' I \nurge my colleagues to support my amendment which authorizes this amount \nof money and helps to point troubled students toward true service to \ntheir communities, their country, and help them to become good, \nproductive citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, if I may be recognized again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TRANSMITTAL OF S. 27 \n                   TO HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) on April 2, 2001, the Senate of the United States \n     passed S. 27, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001, by \n     a vote of 59 to 41;\n       (2) it has been over 30 days since the Senate moved to \n     third reading and final passage of S. 27;\n       (3) it was then in order for the bill to be engrossed and \n     officially delivered to the House of Representatives of the \n     United States;\n       (4) the precedents and traditions of the Senate dictate \n     that bills passed by the Senate are routinely sent in a \n     timely manner to the House of Representatives;\n       (5) the will of the majority of the Senate, having voted in \n     favor of campaign finance reform is being unduly thwarted;\n       (6) the American people are taught that when a bill passes \n     one body of Congress, it is routinely sent to the other body \n     for consideration; and\n       (7) the delay in sending S. 27 to the House of \n     Representatives appears to be an arbitrary action taken to \n     deliberately thwart the will of the majority of the Senate.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Secretary of the Senate should properly engross and \n     deliver S. 27 to the House of Representatives without any \n     intervening delay.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It \ninstructs the Secretary of the Senate to properly engross and deliver \nS. 27, the campaign finance legislation that was passed 43 days ago by \nthis Senate, to the House of Representatives without any intervening \ndelay.\n  I am sure that few people in this body knew that the bill they voted \nfor--or against, for that matter--was never sent to the other body. Why \nis this so? Unfortunately, I don't have an answer. I do know that it is \nnot what we teach our children.\n  We give out a book here, a very interesting book, one that \nschoolchildren all over America, I hope, know. Some do, but I wish all \nof them did. In that book, on page 41, it says: When a bill originates \nin the Senate, this process is reversed.\n\n       When the Senate passes a bill that originated in the \n     Senate, it is sent to the House for consideration.\n\n  There is another booklet, ``Our American Government,'' the 2000 \nedition. ``What are the stages of a bill in Congress?'' It goes through \nthe various stages:\n\n       (6) Passage by the House after votes to confirm the \n     amendments that were adopted in Committee of the Whole; (7) \n     Transmittal to the Senate, by message; (8) Consideration and \n     passage by the Senate--usually after referral to and \n     reporting from a Senate committee--and after a debate and \n     amendment on the Senate floor; (9) Transmission from the \n     Senate back to the House, with or without Senate amendments \n     to the bill.\n\n  Those are documents that indicate it is the normal procedure. I note \nthat this is not business as usual. In fact, arbitrarily holding this \nbill in the Senate after being passed is not the usual practice. I will \nread from a chart prepared by my staff which shows that the normal \nexpected practice is to send legislation to the other body in a much \nmore timely fashion.\n  Thirteen bills originating in the Senate have passed the Senate \nduring the 107th Congress. Of those bills, 11 were sent in an average \nof 5.18 days. The two remaining bills, S. 27, the Bipartisan Campaign \nReform Act of 2001, and S. 143, Competitive Market Supervision Act of \n2001, were passed on April 5, 2001, and March 22, 2001, respectively. \nNeither has been referred to the House of Representatives.\n  The holding of this bill is arbitrary and unfair. A sound majority of \nSenators has passed the campaign finance reform bill. This is not only \nbad for the Senate but bad for this great country.\n  The minority in this body has a great deal of rights. But the Senate \nalso recognizes in its rule that once a majority reaches a certain \nthreshold, it can prevail and move forward. What we are seeing here is \na minority of one stopping the will of this body.\n  As I said, there is no good rationale for this action. The staff of \nthis body, including the Secretary of the Senate, serve the entire \nSenate. I repeat: The Secretary of the Senate serves the entire Senate, \nnot just one Senator. They are not tools of one individual. They serve \nall 100 duly elected Senators. These good people should be allowed to \nperform their duties with due process.\n  This amendment should not require much discussion or debate. It \nshould be adopted and the Secretary of the Senate should immediately \ntake the actions the resolutions direct. That is what is right, and \nthat is what is fair.\n  I urge my colleagues, those who support campaign finance reform and \nthose who do not, to join me in seeing that the will of the majority \nand basic fairness prevail.\n  I want to talk for a second about this practice being allowed to \ncontinue. I speak, I hope, for Members on both sides of the aisle. If \nthe majority prevails in the Senate on a piece of legislation and that \nlegislation is not sent over to the other body, then this could lead to \na very, very, very unsound and unfair process that could deprive the \nmajority of the Senate of their rights. A bill passed in the other body \nis sent over here for our consideration and placed on the calendar. \nThen it is up to the majority leader and/or the minority leader, \ndepending on who has the votes, as to whether to consider that \nlegislation.\n\n  The same thing is true of legislation that originates in the Senate. \nAs I say, I could go back many years. It is roughly an average of 4 \ndays between the passage of legislation through this body and its \ntransmittal to the other body. We have now gone 43 days, and the \nmajority leader of the Senate has stated publicly that he has no \nintention at any time of sending the legislation to the other body for \ntheir consideration.\n  One can speculate--and I will not--on the reasons why this \nlegislation is not being transmitted to the other body as is our \ncustom. I say to my colleagues in all seriousness, if this practice is \ncondoned, watch out if you prevail and it is against the majority \nleader's wishes for that bill to be sent over to the other body. By not \nsending this and every piece of legislation passed by the Senate over \nto the other body, we may be beginning a very dangerous precedent.\n  I am very aware that this amendment is not relevant to the education \nbill, although obviously, as I mentioned, we educate our children in \nways that we may have to at least amend in this book. I hope we don't \nhave to. But I want to assure my colleagues, as soon as this bill is \ntransmitted to the other body, I will be the first to stand up and ask \nunanimous consent to withdraw this from the legislation because I don't \nwant to encumber the education bill with this issue. But when I see, \nafter the long, hard struggle that I have been through, along now with \na majority of the Senate, to achieve a legislative result and see that \nlegislative result stymied at least temporarily in a procedural \nfashion, as far as I can see an unprecedented fashion, then I have to \nseek whatever vehicle I can to express what I hope is the majority will \nof the Senate.\n  I hope we can get this issue behind us. I strongly believe it has \nmore importance than even the campaign finance reform bill itself, if \nthis practice is allowed to become a precedent, what is being done with \nthis legislation.\n  I might add, it was about 3 weeks ago that by accident I found out \nthat it was not going to be sent over to the other body. I was not even \nnotified that this legislation was not going to be sent over.\n  Once we did discover it, then I went to the majority leader. I asked \non numerous occasions if he would send this bill over. The majority \nleader, yesterday morning, stated that under no circumstances would he \ndo so.\n  I have no alternative than to move to get the sense of the Senate on \nthis issue and then, if that doesn't succeed, then we will have to \nobviously use what other parliamentary options we have.\n\n[[Page S4923]]\n\n  After a long and fair and, in many ways, illuminating and elevating \ndebate on this issue and having a result achieved, and then to have it \nnot even sent over to the other body, is a great disservice. I hope it \nwill be rectified as soon as possible.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays at a time determined by the leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am happy to join with the Senator from \nArizona in offering this amendment. Actually, that is not true. I am \nnot really happy we are offering the amendment; I am disappointed and \npuzzled. Because this amendment should be totally unnecessary. It is \nunnecessary because by instructing the enrolling clerk not to transmit \nS. 27 to the House, the majority leader is frustrating the will of the \nSenate and of the American people for no apparent reason.\n  I was pleased with the debate we had on campaign finance reform back \nin late March. Not only because we finally were able to have a real \ndebate, vote on amendments, and ultimately pass a good bill, but also \nbecause I thought the Senate acquitted itself extremely well under \ndifficult circumstances. Both sides played fair in that debate. The \nmajority leader kept his word not to filibuster the bill.\n  The opponents fought hard but did not drag out the proceedings \nunnecessarily. I think we kept our word as well, even though there were \namendments added that we did not necessarily approve of or like a great \ndeal. We did not offer a cleanup amendment before the end of the debate \nto wipe out all the work of other Members of the Senate; we let the \nchips fall as the Senate wished. The result was a bill of which the \nSenate and the public could be proud.\n  As we know, the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 59-41 on April 2, \n2001. There was a technical amendment right before final passage, and \nit could normally be expected with such a complex piece of legislation \nthat it might take a few days for the bill to be engrossed and \nofficially delivered to the House. That is the way the legislative \nprocess legitimately works. The House passes a bill, and it goes to the \nSenate; the Senate passes a bill, and it goes to the House. But it has \nbeen a month and a half.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill passed by the Senate still has not been sent \nover to the House. There is not a question at all that it is ready to \ngo, but apparently an instruction was received by the enrolling clerk \nnot to follow the standard procedure when the Senate passes a bill. \nThat instruction clearly originated with the majority leader of this \nbody.\n  This is actually an embarrassment to the Senate. I think it would \nalso be an embarrassment to the majority leader. I thought we were \nbeyond petty game playing in this body. These kinds of tactics \ndiscredit the institution, and they also completely undercut the good \nfeeling many of us gained during that extraordinary 2 weeks of open \ndebate. As a result, this action by the majority leader could be \nindicative of the lengths to which the opponents of reform will go to \nstop the bill even when they have lost in the Senate fair and square. \nWill they stop at nothing? Is there no legislative or parliamentary \ntactic too obscure to be invoked in the name of stopping reform, to be \ninvoked in the name of protecting this big money system?\n  In the end, we will enact a reform bill for the American people in \nthis Congress, and the President will sign it, no matter how the \nopponents complain or what tricks they try to stop it. I agree with the \nSenator from Arizona that we need to resolve this. The regular business \nneeds to go forward, but that has to happen after this message is sent \nclearly by the Senate that it is long overdue for this bill to be sent \nover to the House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my good friend from Arizona and the \nSenator from Wisconsin have pointed out the focus on this legislation, \nand Senator McCain indicated that once the papers go over to the House, \nthey will ask to withdraw this amendment.\n  I must say, on a broader issue, I congratulate the Senators from \nArizona and Wisconsin for bringing this to light on the Senate floor. I \nthink all of us are very mindful in this institution that this is where \nthese issues ought to be debated and discussed and also examined. When \nwe do have that opportunity, as we saw during the debate on campaign \nfinancing--the fact that there are a lot of discussions in the back \nrooms and in the corridors and behind closed doors--when they finally \nget it into the openness of the floor of the Senate, you get a \ndifferent reaction.\n  I daresay we will have a very encouraging reaction when we vote on \nthis measure this afternoon, and we should have. I think it is very \nregrettable that we have the use of the Senate rules to deny a clear \nprocess in this legislative undertaking, where this legislation had \npassed and still there has not been the passing of the papers. We have \nseen other actions such as that in denying this body the opportunity to \naddress key issues even currently. For example, on the increase in the \nminimum wage, we were denied the opportunity of getting a fair vote. \nEven though a majority of this body is committed to a Patients' Bill of \nRights, we have seen this.\n  On this measure, which is of such importance to our good leaders \nhere, Senator McCain and Senator Feingold, they deserve credit and \nsupport. I join in congratulating them.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, have we determined a time yet as to when this vote will \ntake place?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I do not. As far as the floor managers are concerned, \nthe earlier the better. I don't know about what the timing is on the \nother side. The leader on our side is familiar with it, and I hope we \nwill do it at an early time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. 884 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are awaiting Senators who desire to \noffer their amendments. I believe Senator Boxer will be here shortly, \nand also Senator Harkin, perhaps just after that, depending on the \ndesire of the other side.\n  While I have a moment and prior to the time they come, I want to \nreview where we are on a very important aspect of this debate, and that \nis the funding for this legislation.\n  As I mentioned on a number of occasions, and I am going to continue \nto mention it, we cannot expect to educate our children on a tin cup \nbudget. It cannot be done on the cheap. Money is not the answer to \neverything, but it is a very clear indication of a nation's priorities.\n  In this legislation, we are looking for investments in America's \nfuture. When we are talking about America's future, we are talking \nabout America's children. We believe we have an effective blueprint \nthat can make an important difference in the quality of education for \nchildren in this country.\n  As I have said on a number of occasions, it is not going to be this \nlegislation in and of itself. It is going to be the cumulative efforts \nof parents, teachers, communities, principals, school administrators, \nand school boards all working together. It is also going to be the \nsupport we provide in the early learning programs that will\n\n[[Page S4924]]\n\nreach children of the 0-to-3 age. It is important we invest in these \nefforts. It is a biological fact that development of a child's brain \nreaches its maximum at the age of 5. All the development takes place \nprior to that time. It is enormously important the child have, up to \nthat time, as many positive influences as possible.\n  We are going to battle the issues of funding for early intervention \nof children--the Early Start Program--the Head Start Program, which are \nonly funded at about 40 percent, and the child care programs as well. \nWe have had a good debate on funding IDEA, and we had a very powerful \nbipartisan vote in the Senate that put us clearly on record that we \nwant to meet our responsibilities to the families and local communities \nby funding 40 percent of the education of the children.\n  I want to review where we are on the question of funding this \nlegislation and what we understand will be the administration's \nposition on funding the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This \nincludes not only title I but professional development programs, \ntechnology programs, the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act, afterschool \nprograms, and related programs that are part of the whole Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act.\n  I pointed out at the time we had the last debate in the Senate last \nweek what was going to be in the budget for this country, what was \ngoing to be available for funding. We have seen now that the Republican \nleadership, with the support of the administration, has effectively \nsucked up all of the available resources that can be used for education \nwith the $1.25 trillion tax reduction.\n  As a result of that, as a result of the document that we had, when it \ncame back from the conference, there was virtually no guarantee or \nassurance for funding for the years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, \n2009, 2010. In fact, a careful reading of that legislation would mean \nthere would actually be a reduction in the funding from current \nservices during that period of time. That is a matter of enormous \nconcern--and it should be--to the families of this country.\n  I expect the families in this Nation would say if we are going to \nhave a tax cut, you ought to be able to get--as a matter of fact, I am \nstating what about 75 percent of the American families say. They say: \nIf we are going to have a tax cut we are going to have a tax cut, but \nfirst let's fund education, investing in the children of this country.\n  What we have seen under the administration's program is they have \nreached a different conclusion. Under that proposal, as I pointed out \nwhen we had that debate, the measure was very clear and precise in the \ninstructions to the Finance Committee about what they ought to come \nback with, within what period of time. Even though we passed that bill \nlast week, as I understand it, we may very well be considering the \nbudget tomorrow. Can you imagine that? We passed it last week. It will \nbe out of the Finance Committee and we may be considering it tomorrow. \nWe can see what happens when the majority, in this case the Republican \nmajority, and in this case the President, want to get something done. \nThey can get it done virtually overnight; over $1 trillion that will go \ninto effect in terms of tax reductions for wealthy individuals. They \ncan get it done overnight.\n  But what was included in this proposal? Over the period of the life \nof this legislation, the 10-years, up to $6 billion may be used for \neducation. I think everybody understands there were very precise \ninstructions on tax reduction, very precise instructions on defense, \nvery precise instructions on agriculture, and virtually no instructions \nwith regard to education. That is the fact. That is indisputable. Now \nwe are going to see what the result of that will be.\n  I think it is instructive to look at what this increase would mean in \nterms of past years: proposed ESEA budget increases, Clinton versus \nBush administration.\n  We heard the President wants this to be the first priority. As I say, \nif we compare apples to apples, oranges to oranges, grapefruits to \ngrapefruits, Clinton to Bush, over recent years, in terms of elementary \nand secondary education budget increases, this chart indicates from \n1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and what the Clinton \naverage was over that period.\n  The Clinton average over that period from 1994 to this last year was \n8.67 percent. Under President Bush, it is 3.6 percent. There it is, the \nClinton average--2001, 22 percent; 2000, 4.7 percent; 15.7 percent in \n1999; 6.8 percent in 1998; 9.4 percent in 1997; 6.4 percent in 1996; 19 \npercent in 1995; 4.5 percent in 1994. Average: 8.67.\n  There is the 3.6 percent. We want to point out that is without the \nchanges and without the reforms. We have done a lot of giving and \ntaking. There has been chiding on both sides about whether the \nadministration, the President, gave up too much, whether others gave up \ntoo much. That is what compromise is all about. This is not the bill I \nwould have written and this is not the bill President Bush would have \nwritten, but it represents a legitimate compromise and I am satisfied. \nI believe the great majority of our Members are satisfied. If this bill \nhad full funding, we would have virtually every vote on our side. We \nmay not, if it is not funded, and that is what we are saying.\n\n  If we are talking about the future of this country and talking about \nthe importance of investing in children, and we have seen the changes \nwhich have been brought back as a matter of additional accountability \nand how this legislation has been put together, the consolidations of \nvarious programming, holding schools accountable, holding the children \naccountable as well, the changes that have been made in holding \nschoolteachers accountable and strengthening the assurance we have \nwell-qualified teachers, that we have a professional mentoring program, \nprofessional development over the years, none of that was out there. We \nhad some accountability in the previous bill. We had some \nreconstitution, actually, of schools under the last elementary and \nsecondary education bill.\n  But this goes further and is more comprehensive as a package, \nbringing together the funding of IDEA, bringing together the additional \nresources for professional development and the way they are structured, \nbringing together the outreach for good quality teachers, bringing \ntogether consolidation of the technology component, and with a strong \nemphasis that we are going to get curriculum reform, well-trained \nteachers, and a more thoughtful process in examining children to find \nout what they don't know. We do that so we can provide the \nsupplementary services, reaching out to the communities in a much wider \nway than we have before to use the resources within the communities to \nhelp and assist children who might need that extra help with \nsupplementary services in a very expansive way that we had not done \nbefore--and to recognize we are only reaching a third of the children.\n  How are we going to achieve what this legislation effectively states, \nand that is that we will bring every needy child in this country up to \nproficiency within 10 years, if we are only reaching a third of them \nnow? It is going to be difficult enough--if we were reaching all of \nthem--to try to help with the additional resources in bilingual \neducation, for example. The number of children who need those services \nhas virtually doubled in our school-age population.\n  As I mentioned on other occasions, but it bears repeating, the \nchallenges that schools are dealing with are much more complex today. \nWe have many more families divided so children are growing up in \ndivided homes. We see what has happened in terms of violence in many of \nthe homes, in inner cities as well as in rural communities, the \nproblems with substance abuse and physical abuse. All that has taken \nplace. Plus, we have seen an increasing number of children who are \nhomeless--more than 800,000 homeless children, 800,000 migrant \nchildren, sweeping from California all the way to Washington in the \nwest and from Florida to the State of Maine in the east. We have about \n1.5 million children.\n  Then we have about 700,000 immigrant children who are going to be \ncitizens of the United States who need help and assistance as they move \nalong. They are going to be American citizens. They are on the way to \nbeing American citizens. We want to invest in those children.\n  These are the kinds of challenges we were not facing 20 years ago, \nfor the\n\n[[Page S4925]]\n\nmost part. So we have a more complex situation at the grassroots level. \nWe have parents, teachers, and schools attempting to cope with this \nunder extraordinary circumstances. They need help, they want help, and \nthey are counting on us to help.\n  The way that we can do that is to make sure with this legislation and \nwith the accountability that we are going to invest in children who \nneed the help. That is for what we are fighting.\n  When you look at this chart, the comparison with what this \nadministration is requesting, 3.6 percent this year versus the 8.6 \npercent average over the previous 8 years and understand that of that \n3.6 percent, money is taken from other pots--that is not new money. \nHalf of that is in job training. Two-hundred million dollars of that is \nfrom the National Science Foundation. Another couple hundred million \ndollars is from the EPA.\n  Look at this: $54.1 million from job training; $20 million from the \nearly learning opportunities--that is the program that reaches the \nchildren in the 0-to-3 programs; pediatric graduate medical education \nto try to assure that we are going to have the best in terms of \npediatric training for children. They have taken $30 million out of \nthat; clean water State fund, $497 million. That is a vital resource in \nterms of many of the States, including my State of Massachusetts where \nyou have so many of the communities under court order to clean up their \nwater systems in what which are basically blue-collar, working-class \ncommunities.\n  They have high taxes as it is. They don't have the resources to be \nable to draw on a State fund. To help them is absolutely essential. We \nare cutting that program.\n  As to the renewable energy programs, we have the great debate and \ndiscussion about these energy programs. The administration takes out \n$156 million; NASA and National Science Foundation, $200 million; FEMA \ndisaster relief, $270 million; and community policing, one of the most \nsuccessful programs, they cut.\n  What we see is a difficult situation over the period of the next 5 \nyears out I fear for the outyears, the fifth year to the tenth year, \nbecause we know what is going to be in this tax package which is going \nto be heavily weighted, or backloaded. That is the word which is used. \nAs we all understand around here, the reason it is backloaded is \nbecause it conceals its purpose.\n  Make no mistake about it; if it was frontloaded, there would be a \nclear indication of the amounts we could evaluate for the first 5 \nyears; that is, the Joint Tax Program, the Congressional Budget Office, \nand the OMB estimates the first 5 years--not the back 5 years.\n  As a result, we find the backloaded tax bill. That is going to mean \nthat education resources will remain scarce--not just for the next \ndecade covered by the budget resolution but for the next decade as well \nwhen the enrollments are expected to expand dramatically.\n  I think this is a clear indication if you look at the broader issue. \nYou say, OK, that is ESEA, but maybe much more will be done in the \nother areas of education; that is, in the Pell grants or other kinds of \nhelp and assistance in higher education, such as the Department of \nEducation, or maybe we are looking at research to find out what really \nworks out there so we can help.\n  But we have the same story. This administration fails in the \neducation budget in investments in education. If we look on the chart, \nthe total increase for the title I program was $669 million, 3.5 \npercent, even though if you look through the book that has the budget \nfigures, that is effectively where it comes out. There was a great \nhoopla about how it was going to be 11.9 percent. It is $669 million, \nand the appropriation for the year 2001 was $3.6 billion.\n\n  If you look at the total Department of Education, 6.5 percent \nappropriations last year; the total for the Department of Education is \n$2.5 billion.\n  This is not only elementary and secondary education, but it is in the \nhigher education as well.\n  I know many of our colleagues have the opportunity to go back as I do \nand talk with people in our States. If I go back to Massachusetts and \nhave a town meeting, I ask people in that hall, say you have $1 that \nrepresents the Federal budget. Let's think through about how that ought \nto be spent. You ask people for a show of hands. They want national \nsecurity. They want defense. They understand the importance of national \nsecurity. They want to make sure whatever is necessary is there, and \nthat is something certainly that we ought to support.\n  While we are talking about national security, is there anyone in this \nbody who doubts that within the next 3 or 4 weeks after we pass their \ntax cut on tomorrow, or the next few days, that within a 4-week period \nwe will have the requests from the Department of Defense as a result of \nSecretary Rumsfeld's total Bottom-Up Review, and the best estimate is \nanywhere from $100 billion to $200 billion over the next 5 years. That \nis going to be on track. We are not hearing about it now. We are not \ntalking about it. But does anybody really doubt that? Does anybody in \nthe defense community really question that? Not that I have heard. We \nare just not going to be able to do this.\n  As I say, if you are in that room and asking people what they think, \nthey say: Oh, yes. We need Social Security and we need to have \nMedicare. They understand that. Maybe some will say we will start \ntalking about it.\n  What about education? What about prescription drugs? Where do they \nfit? Some will mention that we have to pay an interest on the debt. \nThen you ask them: What do you think we are spending on education? \nFirst of all, what do you think we should spend? After they begin to \nunderstand that it is maybe 5 cents in terms of the defense and maybe a \nlittle less than that on the interest on the debt, you get probably 2.4 \nor 2.5 in terms of the Medicare programs. You include Medicaid in \nthere, and you have Social Security. That is figured in the budget. \nThey see that going up.\n  But at the end of the day when you start talking about education, 80 \npercent of Senators will say that we ought to at the minimum spend 10 \ncents or 8 cents out of that dollar on education. Ninety percent will \nsay certainly 5. Would you believe that it is less than 2? And under \nthis administration, it will be less than 1 cent. Does that reflect the \nAmerican families' priorities in terms of education?\n  We understand it is a local responsibility and a State \nresponsibility, and the Federal participation has been focused \nprimarily on the higher education. But I think most families would say \nwe want a partnership with local, State, and Federal. We want a \npartnership because we recognize that we need the resources.\n  In many different communities where they have the greatest kind of \npressure, particularly in the poorest of the poor, they do not have the \nresources to be able to sort of deal with this.\n  We made a decision in the early 1960s that we were going to reach out \nto try to provide resources and recognize as a matter of national \ncommitment that we were going to deal with the neediest students in \nthis country.\n  That is what this title I program is really all about. It provides \nresources for those communities--not a great deal of resources. We have \nhad some successes and failures. But we are in a new day and period.\n  But the idea that we are providing a penny out of that dollar in \nterms of education, which is really another word for talking about our \nfuture--children are our future. Investing in our children is investing \nin our future. Is there anyone who doubts that if you have an eighth \ngrade class and the children don't learn algebra that those children \nare not going to college? It is simple, plain, finished, conversation \nended. You have to make sure you have people in there who are going to \nbe able to teach them. That is going to take upgrading.\n  We don't expect to solve all the problems, but we have made a \ncommitment at least in this bill that the teachers who are going to \nteach the children--better than 50 percent of the title I children who \nare going to be educated within 4 years--will be well qualified. We \nhave made our commitment. We have to have the resources to be able to \ndo it.\n  So this is about our future. This is about our priority. It is about \nthe key element in terms of a nation and our fundamental values. Are \nthey going to be in terms of the future, which is our\n\n[[Page S4926]]\n\nchildren, or are we going to be presented with a future tax reduction \nfor the wealthy individuals in this country? I think that is how it is \ngoing to be.\n  Let me make it clear that I have every intention of offering \namendments to let the American people understand how this body wants to \nvote in terms of a reduction in the top rates for the wealthiest \nindividuals, or fund education.\n  This body will have a chance to make a judgment decision on that. Are \nwe going to go from the 39.6 down to 36, and then further reductions in \nmany other areas or are we going to fund our children's education in \nthe future? What is in the national interest? What is in the interest \nof these children? Do we want this Nation to invest in our children or \ndo we want to find out that we are going to provide additional benefits \nto people who have done very well in the last few years?\n  What we have seen in the most recent times has been this \nextraordinary kind of dichotomy where the wealthier have grown so much \nwealthier and the poor have grown so much poorer. I remember those \ncharts. I do not have them here. But if you look at what has happened \nin terms of American income, broken into fifths, from the time of the \nwar to 1972, you will find each group went up; they grew together. \nVirtually all of them grew together. Not now. You now find the bottom \nfifth is going down--yes, going down. The second fifth is going down \njust a little bit. And the top fifth has gone up through the ceiling. \nWe have these enormous disparities. By failing to invest in the \nchildren, that is going to continue, as sure as we are standing here.\n  So we will have the chance to come back and visit this as soon as the \nFinance Committee reports out its bill. We will welcome the opportunity \nto have the Members of this body vote on these measures.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 tonight the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the McCain amendment No. 477. I further \nask unanimous consent that no amendments be in order to the amendment \nprior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 525 To Amendment No. 358\n\n       (Purpose: To provide grants for the renovation of schools)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside, and I call up amendment No. 525.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. Kerry, \n     Mr. Levin, Mr. Reid, Mr. Biden, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Johnson, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 525 to amendment No. 358.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 9, 2001, \nunder ``Amendments Submitted and Proposed.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know there is a unanimous consent \nagreement pending for a vote to occur at 5:30, so my statement on the \namendment will be interrupted at 5:30--if I go on that long--for the \nvote at that time.\n  Mr. President, our children deserve the best when it comes to \neducation--all children; not just a few but all. It is not right that \nsome kids get the best in schooling and the best of teachers and the \nbest of school buildings and other kids are put into rundown, \ndilapidated, old buildings that are not even safe as far as fire and \nsafety codes go.\n  Children deserve modern school buildings with access to technology. \nThey deserve small classes so they can get the teacher's attention when \nthey need extra help. It is not just our kids who deserve this, it is \nthe future of our country that deserves this, cries out for it, demands \nit.\n  As the old saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. This is \na picture of a modern elementary school classroom. This is Cleveland \nElementary in Elkhart, IN. If I am not mistaken, there are 17 or 18 \nkids in this well-lit, well-appointed, roomy classroom. That is what a \nmodern school ought to look like. That is sort of what we think about \nas an elementary school in all of our minds. This is what we conjure \nup. We conjure up a nice, well-ordered classroom with a class small \nenough for the teacher to pay attention.\n  Or how about this? This is South Lawrence East School in Lawrence, \nMA. There are 12, maybe 13 kids here. This is the library and media \ncenter. Now how about that as the kind of an ideal library and media \ncenter for all of our elementary schools around the country?\n  I ask any parent: Wouldn't you like to have your child go to this \nschool? Wouldn't that be wonderful, to think that your kid was in a \nschool like this every day with the latest technology, all hooked up to \nthe Internet? That would be nice.\n  I am afraid most schools look like this. That is not bad. That is not \na dilapidated school. The average school building in the United States \nis 42 years old. This is where most of our kids go to elementary \nschools. They are over 50 years old. They have air-conditioners \nsticking out of the windows. This was added later because the schools \nwere not air-conditioned in those days. Many of them have roofs that \nleak and are kind of rundown schools.\n  It is a national disgrace that the nicest places our children see are \nshopping malls, sports arenas, and movie theaters, and the most rundown \nplace they see is the public school. What kind of a signal are we \nsending them about the value we place on them and their education and \ntheir future? How can we prepare kids for the 21st century in schools \nthat don't even make the grade in the 20th century?\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers recently issued a report card \nfor America's infrastructure. This is their report card. As we can see, \nthe condition of our national infrastructure is poor. All of them are \npoor: energy, waterways, solid waste, wastewater, drinking water, \nairports, bridges, roads--all in pretty bad shape. This is the second \ntime they put out this report. The lowest grade of all goes, once again \nto public schools.\n  Seventy-five percent of our Nation's school buildings are inadequate. \nThe average cost of capital investments needed to upgrade and replace \nour schools is $3,800 per student. Since 1998, the total need has \nincreased from $112 billion to $127 billion. That is just to bring the \nexisting public schools, elementary and secondary schools we have in \nAmerica, up to fire and safety code and to upgrade them in terms of the \nlatest technology.\n  It does not refer to the amount of money we are going to need to \nbuild the new school buildings. That is going to require a lot more \nmoney in the future. Right now we have an all-time high of $53.2 \nmillion. This will grow. Over the next 10 years, it is going to be \nnecessary to build an additional 6,000 schools. That number is not even \nreflected here. This $127 billion is needed now to repair and modernize \nexisting schools.\n\n  I have been advocating this for about a decade now, starting back in \n1991, that the Federal Government begin to meet some of its \nresponsibilities. All one has to do is read Jonathan Kozol's book \n``Savage Inequalities'' to understand why it is necessary for the \nFederal Government to be involved.\n  A little history may be in order. I always ask the question: Where \ndoes it say in the Constitution of the United\n\n[[Page S4927]]\n\nStates that our public school system in America has to be based on \nproperty taxes? You will look in vain, and you won't find it anywhere \nin the Constitution. Why is that the basis of funding for our public \nschools?\n  The reason is, in the early days of the founding of our Republic, it \nwas decided we would have free public education for everyone. At that \ntime it was free public education for white males, but with the \nadoption of the Bill of Rights and with the ensuing concept that we are \nall one Nation, we broadened that to women and minorities and everyone \nelse.\n  Really, we have ingrained this idea of free public education for all. \nBut at that time we didn't have income taxes. We didn't have corporate \ntaxes. We didn't have all these kinds of taxes. All we had were \nproperty taxes and excise taxes. So to fund the public schools, the \nonly tax base they had to go to was the property taxes people paid. \nThus the whole system sort of built up over the centuries that way.\n  It literally was not until 1865, under Republican President Abraham \nLincoln, that the Federal Government got involved in public education. \nThat was with the passage of the Morell Act that set up the land grant \ncolleges of the United States. That was the first time the Federal \nGovernment really got involved at all in public education.\n  Then for about 100 years, the Federal Government was involved only on \nthat level, through land grant colleges, through some research, and \nwith the adoption of the GI bill after World War II, mostly focused at \nhigher education from the Federal Government standpoint.\n  Then, with the passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965, the progeny of which we are now debating, the Federal \nGovernment got involved with trying to equalize a little bit the great \ndisparities in education to meet the needs of lower income students, \nspecial needs students, and to help the States and local governments \nmeet their constitutional requirement that if they did indeed provide a \nfree public education, they couldn't discriminate.\n  Again, no State in this Union has to provide a free public education \nto the kids in the State. But if they do, if a State decides to provide \na free public education, then the Constitution kicks in and says: You \ncan't have a free public education for whites but not for African \nAmericans, for men but not for women, for Catholics but not Jews, \nProtestants but not Catholics. It has to be free for everyone.\n  Of course, as my dear friend and colleague from Vermont knows, this \nwas later expanded under a couple of court cases in the early 1970s to \nalso say that you can't discriminate on the basis of disability. Kids \nwith disabilities under our Constitution also must receive a free, \nappropriate public education.\n  Since 1965, the Federal Government has been providing support and \nfunds for elementary and secondary education. Thus, that is the bill we \nare debating.\n  As we have looked at the concept of what the Federal Government ought \nto do in terms of helping elementary and secondary education, we have \ntitle I programs.\n  We had the Eisenhower math and science programs and a variety of \ndifferent efforts where we have come in and targeted the funds to \naddress a national need, whether it was a lack of science or math, \nunder the Eisenhower math and science program, to try to help needy \nstudents who perhaps did not have any early childhood education or \nsupport, and title I programs, remedial math programs, to get these \nkids to catch up, get ready to learn. That is what these were all \ndesigned to do.\n  I forgot to mention one other aspect of our involvement in elementary \nand secondary education, and that was the free school lunch program, \nand later, the school breakfast program; both targeted not only \nnutritional needs but were to help kids learn better in school. I have \nbeen advocating for a long time--at least since I read Jonathan Kozol's \nbook ``Savage Inequality''--that the Federal Government needs to be \ninvolved in helping to rebuild and modernize our public schools. Why? \nIn many areas you have poor schools, and the property-tax payers are \noverburdened as it is. We need to help them build these schools. It is \na national problem, not just local.\n  So I believe this is a proper role for the Federal Government. As I \nsaid, I have been advocating this for over a decade. In fiscal year \n1995, I did secure $100 million in the appropriations bill as sort of a \ndownpayment to get us started on this. I was disappointed when those \nfunds were later rescinded. But, then, as the years went by, we made \nreal progress, and last year we passed a $1.2 billion initiative to \nmake emergency repairs to our schools. This was a bipartisan agreement, \nhammered out with Congressmen Goodling, Porter, and Obey on the House \nside, and Senators Jeffords, Specter, myself, and the White House, who \nall got involved in that and we hammered out this agreement. That was \npassed last year. That money is now going out to the States.\n  In about 2 months, that $1.2 billion will be made available to the \nStates on the basis of the incidence of poverty, basically following \nthe title I program. So those States with a high incidence of poverty \ntend to get more of the money. This is a busy chart, but it shows you \nthe distribution on July 1 for school renovation grants. It goes from \nCalifornia, with $138 million; New York gets $105 million; North \nCarolina gets $21 million; North Dakota gets $5 million; Ohio gets $37 \nmillion; Pennsylvania, also another big player in this, gets $44 \nmillion; Texas gets $94.9 million to help modernize and rebuild its \nschools; Louisiana gets $24.9 million; Vermont gets $5.4 million, about \nthe same as Iowa, which gets $6.4 million. So this money is all \ncontributed on the basis of the incidence of poverty as to the \npopulation in those States.\n  We can't solve the whole problem in one year. This will make a \ndifference, but the bill before us eliminates this program at a \ncritical time, just when it is getting off the ground, the first year. \nWe will get the money out to the States; they will be able to use some \nof this to get up to fire and safety code in some schools and modernize \nsome schools, and this bill will pull the rug out from underneath them.\n  We must continue this program to repair and renovate our Nation's \npublic schools. That is why I am proposing this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senators Kerry, Levin, Reid of Nevada, Biden, Corzine, \nJohnson, Cantwell, Torricelli, Bingaman, Clinton, and Dodd. They are \nthe cosponsors.\n  This amendment reauthorizes the school renovation program that we \ncreated last year and increases the authorization level from $1.2 \nbillion to $1.6 billion. The amendment continues to split between \nschool modernization and the needs of kids with disabilities under \nIDEA, which we negotiated in last year's bill. Seventy-five percent of \nthe funds will finance urgent repairs, such as fixing a leaky roof, \nreplacing faulty wiring, or making repairs to bring schools up to local \nsafety and fire codes. That is 75 percent of the $1.6 billion. The \nremaining funding will support activities related to the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act, part B, or for technology activities \nrelated to school construction.\n\n  The need to help schools make these repairs is clear. The Healthy \nSchools Network has reported many problems around the Nation.\n  Several parents complain that their children were getting sick at a \nlarge city school near Albany, NY. The county inspected the school and \nfound unsafe levels of lead and mold in the school. The school has not \nbeen able to correct the problem, citing a lack of funding for repairs. \nBut the children continue to go to that school.\n  A child in North Carolina missed several days of school suffering \nfrom headaches and stomach aches. During summer break, the child's \nillness abated. But when school started and they came back, he got sick \nagain. The child attends class in an old trailer that has poor \nventilation and bad odor problems.\n  In Southern California, a teacher was forced to quit teaching after \nshe suffered hearing and voice loss from, again, lack of proper \nventilation and mold in her fourth grade classroom.\n  A Virginia parent said her son felt sick at school and was doing very \npoorly. An inspection of the classroom found nonfunctioning \nventilators, water stains, mold in the ceiling tiles. Leaky roofs, \npeeling lead paint, poor plumbing, not meeting fire and safety codes \naren't just an inconvenience, they are a hazard to our children.\n\n[[Page S4928]]\n\n  In my State of Iowa, the State fire marshal reported that fires in \nIowa schools have increased fivefold over the past several years, from \nan average of 20 per year in the previous decades to over 100 per year \nin just the last decade. I asked why that was. Well, the schools are \ngetting older, the wiring is in disrepair, and thus the fires are \nstarted. What happens is they don't have proper wiring, and maybe they \nput more things in the classroom, and they expand the number of plugs \ngoing in the sockets, and they overload the circuits and fires start.\n  So there is a clear need to help school districts improve the \ncondition of their schools to ensure the health and safety and \neducation of our children.\n  States and local communities are struggling to renovate existing \nschools and build new ones to alleviate overcrowding. School \nconstruction modernization is necessary to equip classrooms for the \n21st century and improve learning conditions, end overcrowding, and \nmake smaller classes possible.\n  Our school buildings are wearing out. Nearly three-quarters of all \npublic schools in America were built before 1970; 74 percent were built \nbefore 1970. In fact, almost 1 out of every 3 schools in America was \nbuilt before World War II, in the last century.\n  According to the National Center for Education Statistics, when a \nschool is between 20 and 30 years old, frequent replacement of \nequipment is necessary. When a school is between 30 and 40 years old, \nall of the original equipment should have been replaced, including the \nroof and the electrical system. After 40 years of age, a school \nbuilding begins to deteriorate rapidly, and most schools are abandoned \nafter 60 years. Yet before World War II, over 60 years ago--and 1 out \nof 3 schools functioning today were built over 60 years ago--the \naverage school building was 42 years old, as I noted.\n  Technology is placing new demands on schools. As a result of the \nincreased use of technology, many schools must install new wiring, new \ntelephone wires, new electrical systems, and the demand for the \nInternet is at an all-time high. But in the Nation's poorest schools, \nonly about a third have Internet access.\n  The need to modernize our Nation's public schools is clear, and yet \nthe Federal Government lags in helping our local school districts \naddress this critical problem. Because of increasing enrollments and \naging buildings, local and State expenditures for school construction \nhave increased dramatically--by 39 percent from 1990 to 1997. Let me \nrepeat that. Local and State expenditures for school construction has \ngone up 39 percent from 1990 to 1997. However, this still has not been \nsufficient to address the need.\n  Those taxes come from property-tax payers which--not in every case \nbut in most cases--is one of the most unfair, unsound ways of taxing to \nraise money for our public schools. Again, if you live in an area where \nthere is high income and pay high property taxes, you have good \nschools. If you live in an area that is low income with low property \ntaxes, you have poorer schools.\n  Is that any way to run the educational system of America based upon \nproperty taxes or where you live? If you are lucky and are born in \nsuburban Northern Virginia, you have great public schools, but if you \nare born in southern Maryland or maybe even in the southern part of \nIowa--I can speak about my own State--where we have low property \nvalues, a lack of a good property tax base, you simply do not have the \ngood schools that you need.\n  This amendment will help school districts make the urgent repairs \nneeded to make schools safer for our children, but we have to do more.\n  Some buildings have simply outlived their usefulness. As I mentioned, \nwe have to build an additional 6,000 schools in the next decade. We are \nnot even talking about that here.\n  In the near future, the Senate will act on a tax bill. I will be \nworking with my colleagues, Senator Kerry and others, to provide school \nmodernization tax credits to help underwrite the nearly $25 billion of \nnew school facilities that are needed.\n  Mr. President, you might ask: Will this approach work? It will work. \nWe have had an experiment going on in Iowa. We are in the third year of \na school modernization demonstration project. Over the past 3 years, \n$28 million in Federal funds have gone to my State of Iowa to rebuild \nand modernize schools to bring our schools up to safety and fire codes, \nto make sure these schools are meeting the needs of the 21st century.\n  Twenty-eight million dollars have gone to Iowa, but it has leveraged \n$311 million in repair and new construction projects. For every dollar \nthe Federal Government has invested in Iowa, it has leveraged over $10 \nof State spending to help repair our schools.\n  The Iowa construction grant program shows what can happen if we put \nthis money out nationally. If we put this money out nationally, the \n$1.2 billion that we did last year, I guarantee it is going to leverage \nmoney all over this country to rebuild and modernize our schools. That \nis why with $1.2 billion, I would be shocked if we come in at less than \n$7 billion or $8 billion of additional money leveraged in the States to \nmeet this requirement. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it my understanding that we will be \nvoting at 5:30 p.m.; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I congratulate and thank the Senator from \nIowa for bringing up this amendment. We will have an opportunity to \naddress this issue perhaps later this evening and tomorrow.\n  As we have worked on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nthere have been five major components. A well-trained teacher in every \nclassroom is enormously important. Smaller class sizes for the early \ngrades are enormously important. Afterschool supplementary services are \nenormously important. Having newer computers and technologies to avoid \na digital divide are enormously important. But to have a schoolroom \nthat is going to be safe and secure and free from the conditions which \nthe Senator described is absolutely essential as well.\n  I thank him very much. I will have more to say about this when the \ntime comes. We are going to be voting in a few moments.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to discuss the amendment that \nthe Senator from Iowa and I, and others, have offered to deal with the \noft-discussed issue of overcrowded and dilapidated schools.\n  As many of my colleagues know, for this is an issue that we have \ntalked about before and even addressed in a bipartisan fashion last \nyear, the need for school construction assistance is great. Three-\nquarters of the public schools are in need of repairs, renovation, or \nmodernization. More than one-third of schools rely on portable \nclassrooms, such as trailers, many of which lack heat or air \nconditioning. Twenty percent of public schools report unsafe \nconditions, such as failing fire alarms or electric problems.\n  At the same time the schools are getting older, the number of \nstudents is growing, up 9 percent since 1990. The Department of \nEducation estimates that 2,400 new schools will be needed by 2003 and \npublic elementary and secondary enrollment is expected to increase \nanother million between 1999 and 2006, reaching an all-time high of \n44.4 million and increasing demand on schools.\n  I have come to the floor on more than a few occasions and made clear \nmy feeling that Democrats need to acknowledge that bricks and mortar \nalone are not the answer for our public schools; I think the reforms on \naccountability, local control, and tough standards that our party has \nembraced make clear that we have heard that message, but it does not \nfor a minute dilute the fact that it's increasingly difficult to have \nmeaningful reform in schools that are falling apart at the seams. \nResearch does show that student and teacher achievement lags in shabby \nschool buildings, those with no science labs, inadequate ventilation, \nand faulty heating systems. Older schools are also less likely to be \nconnected to the Internet than recently built or renovated schools. \nFacilities are vital to implementation of research-based school reform \nefforts. We know, for example, that students learn more effectively in \nsmall classes, but school districts cannot create smaller classes or \nhire more teachers unless there is a place to put them.\n\n[[Page S4929]]\n\n  Many schools are trying to offer more robust curricula, including \nmusic, physical education and classes in the arts, but their ability to \nprovide these programs is hampered if there is no space to house them.\n  Almost every State in the Nation has implemented curriculum \nstandards, calling for advanced work in science and technologies, but \nsome schools are so old that their electrical wiring cannot support \nenough computers for the students and their science facilities are so \nantiquated that students cannot perform the experiments required to \nlearn the State's curriculum.\n  Some school districts are looking to implement universal preschool--a \nservice that we know enhances children's school preparedness and which \na study published in last week's Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation confirmed makes children more likely to complete high \nschool, less likely to need special education or grade retention \nservices while in school, and more likely to avoid arrest as young \nadults--but the lack of available facilities is often prohibitive. If \nwe are serious about encouraging research-based, meaningful, effective \neducation reforms--and if we are serious about doing our part to help \nlocal districts run safe schools--a commensurate investment in school \nfacilities is imperative.\n  I have listened to the debate today and have heard some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about the Federal \nGovernment overstepping its bounds into what is a State and local \nissue. I agree with their sentiment that the Federal Government should \nnot go into local communities and decide what to build or decide what \nto repair. I also agree, to a certain extent, that the burden of \nbuilding and renovating schools should be borne by localities.\n  But what we have seen very clearly over the past several years is \nthat States and local school districts are investing in school \nconstruction, but they still need our help. Annual construction \nexpenditures for elementary and secondary schools have been growing. \nBut local and State budgets have not been able to keep up with demand \nfor new schools and the repair of aging ones. Unless school leaders can \npersuade their wary voters to pass such bond referendums or raise local \ntaxes, though, there's often little hope of change. Until the last few \nyears, the plight of State and local leaders had not received much \nattention from Washington. Last year we came together to respond to \ntheir call by funding a $1.2 billion grant program and this year we \nshould come together again and pass legislation that continues our \ncommitment to help local districts with their repair and renovation \nneeds.\n  The amendment that we are offering will provide $1.6 billion in \ngrants to local education agencies to help them make urgently needed \nrepairs and to pay for special education and construction expenses \nrelated to upgrading technology. And this amendment builds upon the \nbipartisan emergency school modernization initiative that passed into \nlaw as part of the fiscal year 2001 Labor-HHS-Education bill.\n  Under this amendment, States will distribute 75 percent of the funds \non a competitive basis to local school districts to make emergency \nrepairs such as fixing fire code violation, repairing the roof or \ninstalling new plumbing. The remaining 25 percent will be distributed \nby State competitively to local school districts to use for technology \nactivities related to school renovation or for activities authorized \nunder the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  I know that my friend from Iowa has seen this school modernization \nprogram work. Earlier he talked about the demonstration program in his \nState, which leveraged $10.33 for each federal dollar invested in the \ndemonstration program. This amendment is a partnership between the \nFederal Government and districts and it does constitute a legitimate \nrole of the Federal Government.\n  It is a tragedy that so many of our Nation's students attend schools \nin crumbling and unsafe facilities. According to the American Institute \nof Architects, one in every three public schools in America needs major \nrepair. The American Society of Civil Engineers found school facilities \nto be in worse condition than any other part of our Nation's \ninfrastructure.\n  The problem is particularly acute in some high-poverty schools, where \ninadequate roofs, electrical systems, and plumbing place students and \nschool employees at risk. Last month I visited the Westford Public \nSchool District in Massachusetts. School facilities were a big concern \nfor this semi-rural town which has seen its student population sky \nrocket in recent years, but has not experienced comparable property tax \nrevenues. In order to meet the fiscal demands of new school \nconstruction, the town is foregoing replacement of large, drafty \nwindows from the early 1950s and is relying on pre-fab trailers to \nserve as an elementary school.\n  The Wilson Middle School in Natick, MA, was built for approximately \n500 students and currently houses 625. The school has no technical \ninfrastructure, it has no electrical wiring to allow the integration of \ncomputers in the classroom. The classrooms are 75 percent of the size \nof contemporary classrooms and were built with chairs and desks fixed \nto floor. Classrooms like these make it near-impossible for teachers to \nuse modern-day teaching methods which rely heavily on student \ncollaboration and interaction. The school also lacks science \nlaboratories, making it impossible for students to do hands-on work and \nexperiments.\n  Natick High School, like many aging school buildings around the \nCommonwealth, needs to have its basic infrastructure updated: \nelectrical wiring, heating, plumbing and intercom systems are among the \nmany components of the school in need of modernization. Also, the \nscience labs are presently unable to meet the demands of updated State \ncurricula. Natick put in place a prototype lab, and saw remarkable \nchanges in students' interest and ability to experiment in science.\n  The urgent repair funding that passed the Congress last year provided \n$1.2 billion for repairs in high-need schools. In fiscal year 2001, \nthis important program will help repair some 3,500 schools across the \ncountry and Massachusetts is slated to receive $19.5 million. But that \nwill be the only money that my State receives unless we pass this \nimportant amendment and ensure that every student has a safe learning \nenvironment.\n  The ESEA bill that we have been debating for the past several weeks \nrepresents a true coming together of the parties. This body worked \ntirelessly to hammer out an agreement on the outstanding issues that \nhave separated us in the past and which prevented us from completing \nwork on this reauthorization during the last Congress. It is my sincere \nhope that we can come together again on the issue of school \nconstruction and pass legislation that addresses this nation's critical \nneed for school repairs and renovation, and that we can do it as a part \nof a broader package of honest and tough reforms which focus, above all \nelse, on the goal of empowering our schools to raise student \nachievement.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Harkin's \namendment to the Better Education for Students and Teachers (BEST) Act, \nS. 1, that would restore the critical school repair program. I commend \nSenator Harkin for his leadership on this issue, and I thank Senators \nKennedy and Jeffords for the work that they have done on the overall \nelementary and secondary education reauthorization bill before us \ntoday.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment. Communities across \nthe country like many in my home State of South Dakota are struggling \nto address critical needs to build new schools and renovate existing \nones. School construction and modernization are necessary to address \nurgent safety and facility needs, to accommodate rising student \nenrollments, to help reduce class sizes, and to make sure schools are \naccessible to all students and well-equipped for the 21st century.\n  In South Dakota, it has become increasingly difficult to pass school \nbond issues, given the fact that real estate taxes are already too high \nand our State's agricultural economy has been struggling. The result is \nan enormous backlog of school construction needs, and the costs of \nrepair and replacement only increase with each passing year. A report \nby the General Accounting Office found that in my home State of South \nDakota, 25 percent of schools\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\nhave inadequate plumbing, 21 percent of schools have roof problems, 29 \npercent have ventilation problems, and 21 percent of schools are not \nmeeting safety codes.\n  Crumbling schools are not just an urban problem. They are a \nnationwide problem, and rural areas are no exception. In fact, 30 \npercent of schools in rural areas report at least one inadequate \nbuilding feature. Nationwide, the statistics are similarly ominous.\n  The findings surrounding the condition of our Nation's schools is \ndown-right frightening. Fourteen million children attend classes in \nbuildings that are unsafe or inadequate. Nearly three-quarters of our \nNation's schools are over 30 years old with 74 percent of schools built \nbefore 1970.\n  According to the American Institute of Architects, one in every three \npublic schools in America needs major repair. The American Society of \nCivil Engineers found school facilities to be in worse condition than \nany other part of our Nation's infrastructure.\n  South Dakota's tribal schools also face very serious facilities \nproblems and major construction backlogs. There are nine federally \nrecognized tribes in South Dakota. At the same time, my State has 3 of \nthe 10 poorest counties in the Nation, all of which are within \nreservation boundaries.\n  With 56 percent of its people under the age of 24, the Native \nAmerican population in this country is disproportionately young when \ncompared the American population overall. This population strains \nexisting school facilities. The BIA estimates that there is a \nconstruction backlog of $680 million in its 185 elementary, secondary \nand boarding schools serving Indian children on 63 reservations in 23 \nStates.\n  However, after several years of debate on this issue, Congress made \nsubstantial progress last year on the fiscal year 2001 appropriations \nbill by including a bipartisan agreement to provide $1.2 billion for a \nnew school urgent repair and renovation program. This important program \nwill help repair some 3,500 schools across the country this year and \nassist schools with approximately $5.4 million in repair needs \nthroughout the State of South Dakota.\n  Under this program, funds are allocated to the States based on title \nI and States are to make competitive grants to Local Education \nAgencies, LEAs. 75 percent of the funds are to be distributed to LEAs \nto make urgent repairs such as fixing a leaky roof, replacing faulty \nwiring or making repairs to bring schools up to local safety and fire \ncodes. The remaining 25 percent of the funds are to be distributed to \nLEAs for activities related to Part B of IDEA or for technology \nactivities related to school renovation. $75 million is reserved for \nschool districts with more than 50 percent of their students residing \non Indian lands.\n  Senator Harkin's amendment reauthorizes this critically important \nprogram and increases the authorization to $1.6 billion, continuing the \nsplit between school modernization and IDEA negotiated in last year's \nbill.\n  It is no secret that crumbling schools are a problem of enormous \nmagnitude. It is nearly impossible to measure the impact that these \nconditions have on students' ability to learn, but there is no doubt \nthat the impact is severe.\n  The school repair program is a key component in a dual strategy to \nmodernize our Nation's schools. Some schools have simply outlived their \nusefulness and need to be replaced. In addition, the record enrollment \nin our Nation's public schools have caused overcrowding that can only \nbe remedied by building new schools. Estimates are that we will need to \nbuild 6,000 new schools by the year 2006 if we want to keep class sizes \nthe same as they are presently. That is why we also need to pass \nlegislation to provide school modernization bonds that will finance at \nleast $25 billion in new construction through a Federal-State-local \npartnership. South Dakota has a great many school districts which are \nnot completely impoverished, but yet find it almost impossible to pass \na bond issue and otherwise adequately fund their education programs. I \nstrongly believe that there is a legitimate federal role in helping fix \nour Nation's crumbling schools, and we can do so without undermining \nlocal control of education.\n  I applaud and support these efforts to invest a small portion of our \nNation's wealth in improved educational opportunities and facilities \nfor all--this investment now, will result in improved academic \nperformance, better citizenship and a stronger economy for generations \nto come. I urge the Senate to pass Senator Harkin's amendment and \ninvest in the health and well-being of our Nation's school children.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 477\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to state for the record that I \nwill vote in opposition to the McCain position. I expect it will be an \nup-or-down vote. If not, I will vote to table. He is entitled to an up-\nor-down vote. I want to explain my position.\n  I indicated to colleagues that on this legislation I was going to \nresist nongermane amendments. I do not think the majority leader has \nthe right to a pocket veto. Although it is a position which I strongly \nsupport, we have to be consistent if we are going to take the position \nthat we are not going to support nongermane amendments. We cannot pick \nand choose with which ones we agree and differ.\n  Even though I agree with this amendment, I indicated to colleagues \nthat I would oppose nongermane amendments. Therefore, I feel compelled \nto oppose this amendment.\n  Should there be an expression of overwhelming support for this, then, \nobviously, I will at that time interpret my vote perhaps in a different \nway. I have every intention now to vote in opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I follow my good friend from \nMassachusetts in explaining that I, too, certainly agree with Senator \nMcCain on the merits of his proposal and that we should send that very \nfine bill to the House, but I also made a commitment to oppose all \nnonrelevant amendments to the bill. Thus, I will vote against the \nMcCain amendment, but I certainly support the advancement of campaign \nfinance reform and was one of the principal sponsors and participants \nof that legislation of which I am very proud. I have made this \ncommitment, and I will stick by it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. We are almost at the point of \nvoting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the amendment under discussion is laid \naside. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 477. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. \nGregg) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, one reason I made campaign finance \nreform a centerpiece of my campaign and joined by colleagues Senators \nMcCain and Feingold in working hard to pass campaign finance \nlegislation, is because our current campaign finance system contributes \nto Americans' growing cynicism about government. And who can blame them \nfor being cynical and believing that government really does not \nrepresent their interests, when procedural maneuvering causes a \nbipartisan bill passed by a wide majority to fail to be transmitted \nfrom the Senate to the House?\n  The McCain-Feingold bill passed this body with 59 votes. Similar \nlegislation has twice passed the House with 252 votes. The majority of \nboth bodies clearly support campaign finance reform, and so do a \nmajority of the American people. Yet leaders in both Houses are \napparently determined to use every tool at their disposal to force this \nbroadly supported bill into a divisive conference committee composed of \nthe most vocal opponents of reform.\n  The day we passed this bill in the Senate, I spoke on the floor about \nwhat an amazing feeling it was to have accomplished one of my primary \nlegislative goals within 90 days of arriving in the Senate. While I \nnever thought that day would be the end of the battle to pass this \nbill, I must admit that I certainly did not expect to be back on this \nfloor because the bill, despite its comfortable margin of passage six \nweeks ago, continues to gather dust here in the Senate because the \nRepublican leadership cannot reconcile itself to the most significant \ncampaign finance reform in a quarter century. In an information age, we \nowe our citizens a government free of special interest influence. Not a \nsystem of expedient, special-interest based, decision making, and not a \nsystem that engages in byzantine maneuvering to delay and thwart the \nwill of the majority.\n  I hope that the leadership of both the House and the Senate will stop \nattempting to devise new ways to stonewall this bill and allow the \nSenate-passed version of this legislation to be debated and voted on in \nthe House without further delay.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to note that due to the \nneed to fulfill a long-scheduled speaking engagement at a university \nmade in the expectation there would not be votes, I unfortunately was \nnot able to be here in the Senate last night to vote on two amendments \nto the education bill, S. 1. I would like to say for the record that I \nwould have voted for both amendments and am pleased that they both \npassed with broad bipartisan approval.\n  I support Senator Reid's amendment, #460 to expand the 21st Century \nCommunity Learning Centers to include projects with emphasis on \nlanguage and life skills programs for limited English proficient \nstudents. We know that assisting students to acquire English \nproficiency is becoming increasingly important as many of our \ncommunities are receiving immigrant children from many different \ncountries. Limited English proficient students are at greatest risk for \ndropping out of school and are among some of our lowest performing \nsubgroups of students. I have long been an advocate for investing \nincreased Federal resources and greater attention on limited English \nproficient students. My own ESEA reauthorization bill, S. 303, calls \nfor $1 billion in formula funds focused on increasing the English \nproficiency and raising the academic performance in all core subjects \nof our immigrant children. One of the primary risk factors for low \nacademic performance and dropping out of school among immigrant \nstudents is their lack of English proficiency. Students that are \nproficient in English have a much greater chance to reach higher levels \nof academic achievement and fully participate in our society. The Reid \namendment would help many immigrant children receive the extra help \nthey need for English language acquisition through after-school \nprograms. The Senate clearly recognized the value of this amendment by \napproving it 96 to 0.\n  I also support Senator Cleland's amendment, #376 on school safety. It \nmakes funds available to establish a center to offer emergency \nassistance to schools and local communities by providing information \nand best practices on how to respond to school safety crises, including \ncounseling for victims, advice on how to enhance school safety and \nwould operate a toll-free nationwide hotline for students to report \ncriminal activity, threats of criminal activity and other high-risk \nbehaviors. It also would provide grants to help communities develop \ncommunity-wide safety programs involving students, parents, educators, \nand civic leaders. This amendment would further help to forge a crucial \npartnership between the Department of Education and the Attorney \nGeneral so that these two departments may work together to ensure that \nour schools have the resources and tools they need to create safe \nlearning environments for our nation's youth. In addition, the \namendment would provide flexible funding, something that I have long \nfought for, to enable localities to design school safety programs that \nbest meet their specific needs. For all of these reasons, I would have \nvoted for the Cleland amendment and am pleased it passed by a strong \nvote of 74 to 23.\n  (The original statement of Senator Feinstein which was delivered on \nMonday, May 14, but omitted is as follows:)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 443\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor this \namendment with Senators Voinovich, Baucus, Cochran, Landrieu, Murray, \nand Corzine.\n  Under current law, elementary and secondary teachers can receive up \nto $5,000 of their student loans forgiven in exchange for 5 years of \nteaching. Head Start teachers are not currently included in the federal \nloan forgiveness program. By offering Head Start teachers the same loan \nforgiveness benefit as that afforded to elementary and secondary school \nteachers, I believe, we will encourage more college graduates to enter \nthe field.\n  Many Head Start programs in California are losing qualified teachers \nto local school districts in part because the pay is better--\nnationally, the average Head Start teacher made $20,700 in 2000 \ncompared to $40,575 for an elementary and secondary school teacher. \nHead Start teachers are making half of what elementary and secondary \nteachers are paid on average.\n  Low pay, combined with mounting student loan debt, is a real \ndeterrent to getting college graduates to become Head Start teachers.\n  Today, there are no educational requirements for a Head Start teacher \nother than a child development associate (CDA) credential, requiring 24 \nearly child education credits and 16 general education credits. By \n2003, 50 percent of Head Start teachers will be required to have at \nminimum an associate or 2-year degree.\n  Under this amendment, a Head Start teacher who has completed at \nminimum a bachelor's degree could receive up to $5,000 of their federal \nstudent loan forgiven provided they agree to teach for at least 5 years \nin a Head Start program.\n  Clearly, we should recruit qualified teachers to the Head Start field \nwho have demonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in reading, \nwriting, early childhood development, and other areas of the preschool \ncurriculum with a particular focus on cognitive learning. Obtaining and \nmaintaining teachers with such educational backgrounds will, I believe, \nimprove the cognitive learning portion of the Head Start program so \nthat our youngsters can start elementary school ready to learn.\n  Several recent studies confirm the importance of investing in the \neducation and training of those who work with preschoolers.\n  The National Research Council has recommended that:\n\n       . . . children in an early childhood education and care \n     program should be assigned a teacher who has a bachelor's \n     degree with specialized education related to early childhood. \n     . . . Progress toward a high-quality teaching force will \n     require substantial public and private support and incentive \n     programs, including innovative education programs, \n     scholarship and loan programs, and compensation commensurate \n     with the expectations of college graduates.\n\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\n\n  Last year, the Head Start 2010 National Advisory Panel held fifteen \nnational hearings and open forums. The panel found:\n\n       . . . that despite increases resulting from Federal quality \n     set-aside funding, relatively low salaries and poor or non-\n     existent benefits make it difficult to attract and retain \n     qualified staff over the long term. . . . the quality of the \n     program is tied directly to the quality of the staff.\n\n  Head Start is one of the most important federal programs because it \nhas the potential to reach children early in their formative years when \ntheir cognitive skills are just developing. Many of our Nation's \nyoungsters, however, enter elementary school without the basic skills \nnecessary to succeed. Often these children lag behind their peers \nthroughout their academic career.\n  I believe we must continue to improve the cognitive learning aspects \nof the Head Start program so that children leave the program able to \ncount to ten, to recognize sizes and colors, and to recite the \nalphabet. To ensure cognitive learning, we must continue to raise the \nstandards for Head Start teachers. Offering Head Start teachers similar \ncompensation for their educational achievements and expenses afforded \nto other teachers is one step to encouraging college graduates to \nbecome Head Start teachers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/15/senate-section/article/S4932-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I rise on a small point, but it is \nrepresentative of some of the difficulties we are having in trying to \nkeep some focus on reality associated with the administration's \nanticipated energy package.\n  I am sure many Members saw the Washington Post today, Tuesday, May \n15. On the front page there was a color picture of the Phillips \nPetroleum Company facility at Alpine which depicts very vividly the \nrealization that technology indeed can make a very small footprint in \nthe Arctic areas of Alaska, my State.\n  The picture represents a fair evaluation of this development. It was \ntaken in the summertime, that brief 2\\1/2\\ months or so when the area \nis not covered with ice and snow. The viewer can see the river, the \nlakes. But to grasp the significance of it, one has to recognize that \nthis is a major oil field in itself. Yet it takes less acreage than the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  That footprint is concentrated in the area that is known as Alpine. \nFor the most part, one derrick has drilled the wells there. These are \ndirectional drills that go out for many miles recovering the oil. This \nparticular facility is producing about 88,000 barrels a day.\n  However, there is another picture. This is the point I want to bring \nhome to the Members. In an effort to try to draw a balance, if you \nwill, between development and the wildlife in the area, the Washington \nPost portrays a picture of three little bears, and it is entitled ``A \npolar bear with her cubs rests in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge.''\n  The reality is that this picture was not taken in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. It was taken in another area of Alaska far, far away.\n  It isn't that we don't have polar bears in Alaska. We are all \nconcerned about the beauty and the majesty of this beast, but we have \ndone a lot to encourage the polar bear by safeguarding it from any \ntrophy hunting. In Alaska, you cannot take a polar bear for a trophy. \nYou cannot take a polar bear if you are a non-Native, but you can go to \nCanada and you can go to Russia.\n  We have and will provide for the Record the statement from the \nphotographer of exactly where this picture was taken. But it is not in \nANWR, and the photographer is prepared to give a statement in that \nregard. Here again we have another mischaracterization, the implication \nthat ANWR is filled with polar bears and that if we open up this \nfragile area, somehow we are going to disturb the polar bears. That is \nnot accurate.\n  The Washington Post should know better. They should check their \nsources. They should recognize that polar bears for the most part live \nout on the ice. Why do they live on the ice? Because that is where \nthere is something to eat. They live on the ice, and they stalk the \nseal. As a consequence, they don't come into the Arctic National \nWildlife area in any abundance.\n  They do come in from time to time.\n  But there is little food for them, and during the months where the \nice is continually moving, they simply stay out on the ice where they \ncan have the availability of food. It is noted that there are very few \nthat den on the shores adjacent to ANWR. So, again, I encourage my \ncolleagues to recognize, as I am sure many people who see in the \nWashington Post today those warm and cuddly polar bears, that they are \nbeing misled in this particular photo because this photo was not taken \nin ANWR.\n  I also encourage my colleagues to recognize that the administration \nis going to come out with an energy task force report. While I have not \nhad briefings to amount to any significant detail, I think it is \nimportant for the American people, and my colleagues particularly, to \nknow that it addresses positive corrections in the imbalance we have in \nAmerica's energy crisis.\n  We do have a crisis. One need only look at California to recognize \nthat Californians are going to be paying an extraordinarily increased \namount for energy. Electricity is $60 billion to $70 billion. Last \nyear, it was in the area of $28 billion. The year before, it was $9 \nbillion. They have an energy crisis. We haven't built a new coal-fired \nplant in this country since 1995. Yet close to 51 percent of our energy \ncomes from coal. We haven't built a new nuclear plant in this country \nfor more than 10 years. Yet we know the value of nuclear from the \nstandpoint of what it does to air quality. There are no emissions. \nThere are other tradeoffs.\n  We also know we are now 56- to 57-percent dependent on imported oil, \nand the forecasts are that the world will be increasing its consumption \nof oil for one reason--for transportation--by nearly a third in the \nnext 10 years or so.\n  We have seen natural gas and our increasing dependence on natural gas \nbecause it is one of the few areas where you can get a permit to put in \nfacilities. Yet natural gas prices have increased dramatically from \n$2.16 per thousand cubic feet 18 months ago to $4, $5, $6, $7 to $8. We \nhave had a coming together and that coming together also involves \ndistribution. We have had the realization in the hearing that we had \ntoday before the Energy Committee, which I chair, that there are severe \nconstrictions on transmitting electric energy.\n  In our bill that we introduced, we left out eminent domain for \nelectric transmission lines purposely because we felt the States could \nmeet that obligation as they saw fit. Now some suggest that States \ndon't have the commitment internally to reach a decision and are going \nto need Federal eminent domain. Maybe that is the case. It is like the \nperfect storm; everything is coming together at once. No new coal, no \nnuclear, dependence on imported oil, higher costs for natural gas, no \nrelief on transmission. Now they are saying we have to do something \nabout it immediately.\n\n[[Page S4933]]\n\n  Well, what do you do about it? This didn't come overnight. We have \nseen the realities with regard to higher prices of gasoline. Yet we \nknow we don't have the refining capacity. We haven't built a new \nrefinery in 25 years in this country. We have our refineries up to \nmaximum production. They were busy making heating oil. Now they are \ntrying to build up inventories for gasoline. So you not only have a \nshortage of refined capacity but you are dependent primarily on foreign \ncountries--OPEC, for the most part--for our crude oil. We suddenly find \nwe have an inability to refine an adequate amount. So with inventories \nlow, the maximum utilization out of refineries is converting over--and \nthey have been for some time--to gasoline; and then the complications \nof 15 different types of reformulated gasoline in this country that \nrequire almost a boutique type of activity in the refiners, where they \nhave to refine it to specific fuel specifications for the area--they \nhave to separate it, batch it, transport it separately. Additives, \nwhether ethanol or MTBE, complicate the process.\n\n  Is it necessary that we have that kind of a mandate? Clearly, the \nindustry says they can meet the air quality requirements and the Clean \nAir Act if you will give them some flexibility. Well, we haven't given \nthem the flexibility.\n  The public wants relief, and I think it is unfair to characterize the \nnew administration with having the sole responsibility to come up with \nso-called immediate relief. Nobody is a magician around here, and it \nwould take a magician to provide immediate relief for the crisis we \nhave gotten into. But what we have to do is focus realistically, and I \nthink that is the value of what we are going to see out of President \nBush's and Vice President Cheney's new energy task force--relief--which \nwill be coming out Thursday.\n  We are not going to see generalities that say you can simply get \nthere from here by conservation. Conservation is important, but \nconservation isn't going to do it alone. Make no mistake; Americans are \nused to a standard of living that has been brought about by plentiful \nsupplies of relatively inexpensive energy. If we want to sacrifice our \nstandard of living, that can be done. But I wonder how many people in \nCalifornia are ready to go out and turn in their old refrigerators, \ntheir old washers and dryers, when they are not worn out, for a new \nenergy-saving appliance that will cut their energy bills in half. I \ndon't know. Maybe we can mandate CAFE savings. We have a mandatory 27-\nmile CAFE standard currently in the automobile industry. People say, \nwell, that doesn't include the vans, the suburban vehicles, the type \nthat are so popular today, the SUVs and others. That is true. They are \nclassified in the truck classification as light trucks, but the reality \nis that you can't get there on CAFE, either.\n  We have 207 million vehicles in this country. About 170 million are \nautomobiles and the rest are trucks and cars. It is going to take you \n10 years to make a significant dent in that number of vehicles because \na lot of them aren't paid for. So you are not going to discard them.\n  If you mandate substantially increased CAFE standards, then people \nhave to buy new cars; they have to buy new ones. CAFE standards are \nimportant, but you can't achieve the kinds of savings we need by CAFE \nstandards. You can give tax credits for people who save energy. I think \nyou will probably see an amendment or two on that to give them a $250, \n$300 tax credit.\n  The point is that we are far behind, and what the administration is \ngoing to propose is some positive steps as to how we can address the \nenergy crisis. It is going to take the conventional sources of energy \nthat we know and have had experience with and the addition of the clean \ncoal technology that we have come to develop in the last decade or so. \nWe can continue to use coal. We can use it in a manner in which we take \nout many of the impurities--the sulfur, and so forth. We can address \nthe reality that we can produce more natural gas in this country, but \nthe incentive has to be there. That is a return on investment.\n  Obviously, we can reduce our increased dependence on imported oil by \nproducing more domestic oil. Of course, that involves my State of \nAlaska and the item that I first mentioned, the accuracy of some of the \nimportant portrayals of ANWR.\n  In conclusion, to those who suggest the potential development in \nANWR, a reserve somewhere in the area of 5.6 billion to as high as 16 \nbillion--and if it were an average of 10 billion it would be the \nlargest oilfield found in the last 40 years--I suggest the prospects \nfor developments of this area are very good. We have the technology to \nopen it safely, there is absolutely no question about that, with the 3-\nD seismic and directional drilling.\n  The people, the residents in the area of Katovik and Nuiqsut, Barrow, \nthe Natives who live in this area who are dependent pretty much on the \nrealities associated with hunting and fishing for their livelihood, a \nsubsistence lifestyle, also have aspirations of a better life, an \nalternative life, and this provides them with jobs, education, health \ncare opportunities, and opportunities for their children as well to \nprosper. Just as people in any other community, they have visions of a \nbetter life. They support it.\n  Some say it is a 6-month supply. That is a totally unsuitable and \ninappropriate comparison because, as we all know, if you were to stop \nall the oil flowing into the United States for a 6-month period, that \nis what it would take to say that this is a 6-month supply. You would \nhave to stop all oil imports coming in from my State of Alaska, from \noil produced in the United States, whether it be from California, \nKentucky, or Pennsylvania, or imported into this country from overseas. \nThat is what it would take to equal a 6 months' supply of oil.\n  That Prudhoe Bay has supplied the Nation with 20 to 25 percent of \ncrude oil for the last 25 years--and the likelihood is this field is \nlarger than Prudhoe Bay and would immediately flow in the area of \nsomewhere in excess of 1 million barrels a day--is the reality about \nwhich we are talking.\n  It is important Members keep in mind the reality of separating fact \nfrom fiction, which again brings me to the fiction associated with the \nfront page of the Washington Post in identifying three little bears as \nresidents of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Clearly, they are \nnot, and we will have certification from the photographer as soon as we \ncan obtain it relative to the exact location of where the picture of \nthe three bears was taken.\n  Mr. President, thank you for indulging me additional time. I yield to \nmy good friend from Nevada, if he is seeking recognition at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/15/senate-section/article/S4933-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4933-S4936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECONCILIATION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as we speak, there is a meeting of the \nFinance Committee taking place. There are 10 Democrats on that \ncommittee and 10 Republicans. I have tried today but really literally \nhave been able to spend no more than 3 or 4 minutes watching the \nproceedings. They have been going on all day. I understand they will go \non into the night trying to come up with a tax bill we call \nreconciliation.\n  I have heard in the last few minutes that there is going to be an \nattempt tomorrow to bring that bill before the Senate. I hope the \nmajority understands there are 40 Democrats and 40 Republicans who do \nnot sit on the Finance Committee. It is a prestigious committee, I \nunderstand, but the members cannot speak for the rest of us, either \nDemocrats or Republicans.\n  I very much want to have the opportunity to look through certain \nparts of that bill. It is going to be a very large piece of \nlegislation. I doubt I will be able to read all of it, but I want to \nread parts of it. I have a staff that will read every word of it and \nbring to my attention those things I have not looked at first.\n  I have a staff that I think is well equipped to peruse that bill, but \nI just cannot imagine that we would go to that bill tomorrow without \nMembers of the Senate having an opportunity to look at that \nlegislation. That is how we get into trouble legislatively.\n  It is unfair to the American people. I have said from the very \nbeginning we are doing well. We have a surplus. We deserve a tax cut. \nThe American people, the people of Nevada deserve a tax cut, and they \nshould get an immediate tax cut. But that tax cut should be given to \nthem with deliberation. We\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\nshould make sure we understand every provision in that very important \nlegislation. I cannot imagine a legislator voting for or against that \nbill not having the opportunity to read it.\n  I hope we slow down. We can work on this bill Thursday or next Monday \nor Tuesday just as well as we can tomorrow. What I prefer, when they \nreport that bill out of committee, is we have several days to look at \nit.\n  I repeat, there is no effort on this Senator's part to unduly delay \nproceedings. There are all kinds of ways we can do that. There has been \ntalk, if this proceeding goes forward as indicated, that people will \nfile lots and lots of amendments, and we would have to vote on every \none of them and the voting would take several weeks.\n  There are methods of slowing this down. I hope we will not have to \nresort to any of those. I hope we have ample time for us and for our \nstaffs to review this legislation in some detail.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my friend from North Dakota, \nwhom I appreciate being here. I say prior to yielding, I served in the \nHouse with my friend from North Dakota. I looked to him when we served \ntogether. He was one of the leaders of issues dealing with money. He \nwas on the Ways and Means Committee, which is the comparable committee \nto the Finance Committee in the Senate.\n  I will be happy to yield to my friend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada makes a critically \nimportant point. It is important for all of us to think through this \nprocess and this strategy. We are blessed with a wonderful country that \nhas had an economy that has produced jobs and expansion and opportunity \nin the last years. We want to make sure we do not create a fiscal \npolicy that turns that around and moves us back into big Federal budget \ndeficits and economic contraction rather than expansion.\n\n  The Congress is now, in a new day, set to provide some tax breaks \nbecause we are at this point experiencing some budget surpluses.\n  I support tax cuts. They need to be thoughtful and reasonable. They \nneed to be fair to all the American people. But what I worry about is \nwe are told that the Finance Committee is now writing a tax bill. It is \nnow 6:30 in the evening. I understand there are over 120 amendments to \nthat bill that have been filed. They are sitting over in, I believe, \n216 of the Hart Building going through amendments. If they do finish \ntonight, I expect they will work until the wee hours of the morning.\n  We are told--I do not know if this is the case--we are told that at \n10 o'clock tomorrow morning the Senate will be confronted with the \nreconciliation bill, the tax bill that is being written this evening. \nIf that is brought before the full Senate for consideration at 10 \no'clock in the morning, I ask who in the Senate, A, has read it; B, \nknows what is in it; and C, has studied it enough to evaluate what kind \nof amendments they may or may not offer.\n  The answer to that question--I will answer it myself--is nobody. Not \none Member of the Senate will have the foggiest notion of what is in \nthat bill. So bringing that bill up tomorrow at 10 o'clock in the \nmorning will be a disservice to this body and a disservice, in my \njudgment, to good sound fiscal policy for this country.\n  We are talking, after all, about a proposal that will affect Federal \nrevenues for well over a decade. We are talking about affecting Federal \nrevenues for over 10 years. This tax bill is put together with the \nprospect that we will always have budget surpluses in our future, \nsomething I hope we will have, but there is no guarantee that will be \nthe case. There is still such a thing as a business cycle, and there is \nstill a contraction phase in the business cycle.\n  I worry very much we may not experience the surpluses, and if we put \nin a very large tax cut that some are proposing to do, the bulk of \nwhich, by the way, will go to the largest income earners in the \ncountry, if we do that in a way that is thoughtless rather than \nthoughtful, we will throw this country into very significant trouble.\n  I implore the majority leader and those involved in scheduling not to \ntell us that the Finance Committee will finish at midnight tonight and, \noh, by the way, we will bring that before the Senate at 10 a.m. \ntomorrow knowing we have not read it, knowing we have not studied it, \nand knowing we would not have an opportunity to figure out what \namendments might be necessary. We will do it and do it under a \nreconciliation proposal, which is a complete fraud as we know--it was \nnever intended for this purpose--and it will be limited to 20 hours of \ndebate on a bill that is worth trillions of dollars that will affect \nthis country's revenues for the next decade. Is that a thoughtful or a \nthoughtless way to legislate? My hope is that we can persuade those in \ncharge to understand the best way to do this would be to go through \nthis committee, the Finance Committee, report a bill to the floor, have \nit printed--God forbid, that should be a radical thought, to have a \nbill printed--have it on the desks of Members of the Senate, have \npeople study the bill, evaluate what its consequences might be for the \ncountry, figure out who gets what, whether it is a fair tax cut, and \nthen come back and debate it after having a couple of days of study and \nevaluation, offer amendments, and proceed to decide exactly how the \nSenate wants to work its will on this important issue.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, does the Senator from Nevada think if \nthey bring this to the floor at 10 o'clock in the morning that there is \nanyone in the Senate, save for those who serve on the Finance \nCommittee, who will know what is in that piece of legislation?\n  Mr. REID. I answer my friend from North Dakota by saying I think \nthere are several, of the 20 who serve on the committee, who would have \na foggy idea of what is in various parts of that bill. Not even every \nmember of the Finance Committee would have a foggy idea of what is in \nthe bill. And certainly the 80 people who do not serve on the committee \nwould not have the slightest idea of what is in that legislation. The \nSenator from North Dakota is correct.\n  I also say to my friend who has served in the Congress longer than I, \nI have known of occurrences when these bills are rushed through that \nmistakes are made: printing errors, people not having had the \nopportunity to look at them. Also, some mischievous things have \nhappened. We know during the budget that was debated a couple of weeks \nago in the House of Representatives, there were two very important \npages missing that they found at 2 o'clock in the morning. Those were \nthe pages dealing with how we would handle, in the budget, the tax \nmeasures. Whether it was done on purpose or not I do not know. The fact \nis those pages were found to be missing and it was necessary to put \nthat over for a couple of days.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, I think the majority would be \nso much better served, our country would be better served, if we had \nthe opportunity to have this week to study this legislation, come back \nMonday, we could come in at 9 o'clock in the morning--it doesn't matter \nto this Senator. We could have ample time next week. There are 20 hours \nto debate it. We could have some thoughtful amendments prepared.\n  I am stating to anyone within the sound of my voice that there may be \nsome Senators who feel so strongly about this basic principle, that \nbefore you vote on something you should be able to read it, who have \nthis radical idea that they want to have a bill that involves trillions \nof dollars and, as the Senator has indicated, will involve fiscal \npolicy for this country for more than 10 years--they have this radical \nidea they would like to understand a little bit before they vote on it. \nThey may feel so strongly that they may file a thousand amendments on \nthis legislation, and the rules are that we only have 20 hours of \ndebate, but we can have a thousand days of voting on amendments.\n  It would seem to me to serve everyone's best interests if we approach \nthis in a deliberative manner, recognizing there are only 20 hours of \ndebate on it. We could take it up Monday or Tuesday, finish it next \nweek.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, I will be happy to yield to him \nto answer that question. Does it not seem to make sense with a piece of \nlegislation that will be huge, to have some idea what is in it before \nwe are required to vote on final passage of this\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\nmost important legislation to people of Nevada, North Dakota, and all \nover this country?\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Nevada yields, and I appreciate that. I \nonly have this to say. The people of America don't care, I am sure, \nwhether you or I or anyone else has the opportunity to speak as long as \nwe might want to speak on anything. They could not care less. Nobody is \ngoing to walk around with a bad attitude because somebody here doesn't \nhave enough time to talk on the floor of the Senate.\n  What is important, if we are going to cut benefits, is who gets the \nbenefit of those tax cuts? I wondered in school whether fractions would \never come in handy. We studied them in the lower grades. Let me give a \ncouple of simple fractions.\n  From a briefing, I understand, over in the Finance Committee right \nnow the chairman's mark--which is going to pass and be brought to the \nfloor and apparently going to be brought here at 10 o'clock in the \nmorning--does the following: The top 1 percent of the American income \nearners pay about a quarter of the taxes. They are going to get about a \nthird of the tax cuts.\n  Let me say that again because I think it is important. The top 1 \npercent of the income earners in America pay about a quarter of the \ntaxes, one-fourth of the taxes. But the tax bill that is going to come \nhere at 10 in the morning gives them a third of the tax cuts.\n  I did take fractions. I didn't go way beyond fractions in my little \nschool, but I understand fractions enough to understand that is not \nfair. Why not take some of that tax cut back, which is above that which \nshould go to the top 1 percent, and give it back to the folks in the \nrest of the 99 percent and say: If we are going to give taxes back, \nlet's make sure everybody is treated fairly. Wouldn't everybody at \nevery tax bracket like to have a little more back than they pay in? The \ntop 1 percent do. They get it under this bill.\n  As we take a look at all this and ask ourselves are we going to have \na chance to dig into this, offer amendments, understand it, make \nchanges, the answer is: If the bill is not written, except that \nprovision, of course, is already in the chairman's mark and we know he \nhas the votes to get that out--if this bill isn't written, they have \n120 or so additional amendments they are going to consider this \nevening. Now we are told they want to bring it to the floor at 10 \no'clock in the morning?\n  I just ask the question, not so much on my behalf but on behalf of \nthe American people who are not going to get the benefit of getting a \nbigger tax cut than the proportion of that which they paid in in taxes, \nwould it be fair to have everybody take a look at this and see if maybe \nthere is not a little better way to cut this pie? There are only so \nmany pieces when you cut these pies up. It seems to me there is kind of \nthis hog-in-the-corn-crib approach to some of these things around here. \nThe same people always get the biggest slice. Did you ever notice that? \nThe same interests always seem to end up with the biggest slice.\n  That is what I fear is going to happen here. It is not that I oppose \na tax cut. I do not oppose a tax cut. In fact, I support a tax cut. We \nhave a surplus. Some of that ought to go back to the American people in \nthe form of a tax cut. But it ought to be fair. It ought to be a \ncircumstance where a lot of people who do not have lobbyists walking \naround this building or haven't been able to afford people to represent \ntheir interests, those people, somewhere on the floor of the Senate, \nought to have people to dissect this, take it apart and evaluate who is \ngetting a fair piece. Whose slice of this tax cut is appropriate? Whose \nslice is too large?\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The other Senator from North Dakota, I spoke to him right \ndown in the well of the Senate a half hour ago. He left the Finance \nCommittee to come to vote.\n  I said: How are things going, Senator Conrad?\n  He said: You can't believe some of the things that are going on \nthere. He said: For example, so that they do not raid the Social \nSecurity trust fund this year, they put off one provision for 15 days \nso they will not raid it for 15 days so they can go around and say we \ndid not raid the trust fund this year--but we will do it in 15 days \nwhen it cuts in.\n  I would like to read that. I would like Senator Conrad or someone on \nmy staff to point out where it is they did that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If you remember a couple of years ago, they created a \n13th month--sort of the same tactic, perhaps by the same people.\n  Mr. REID. I remember that. Thanks for reminding me.\n  The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, also said to me, one \nof the provisions in here had a sunset provision so things would just \nstop and have to start all over at a certain time. That was something \nthat they have also, as of a half hour ago, a kind of gimmick, the \nsunset provision. They changed it only a matter of a few hours.\n  There are some things going on that should be open. Sunshine should \nshine on this bill so everyone has a chance to look at what is in it.\n  Maybe my suspicions are all wrong--I hope so; I hope everything has \nbeen done aboveboard--that the Medicare trust fund is not violated, as \nI think it is. I hope the Social Security trust fund is held inviolate, \nthat it is not also raided so people get these tax cuts. The people of \nNevada want tax cuts, but they do not want them at the expense of \ntaking money from the Medicare trust fund or the Social Security trust \nfund. So all I am saying is, let's take a look at this bill and see \nwhether that, in fact, is the case.\n\n  Would the Senator agree that those are a couple of examples, whether \nvalid or not, and we should check to see if they are by reading the \nbill?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Nevada, he is \nabsolutely correct. This rush here seems to me to be inappropriate if, \nin fact, they bring a bill to the floor tomorrow at 10 a.m. that has \nnot yet been written--it is now 20 minutes to 7 here in Washington, \nDC--the bill has not yet been completed, and there are 100 and some \namendments remaining. They are over in the Hart Building finishing it. \nIt will be brought over to the Senate. I guarantee it will not be \nprinted. They will have one copy at the desk. Someone may have made \nsome copies, some Xerox copies, and hope they don't lose a couple pages \nthis time. A couple weeks ago they lost a couple pages and held things \nup. But that is not the way to legislate.\n  It seems to me the thoughtful way to do this would be to move this \nthrough the Finance Committee, have it printed, bring it to the floor, \nlay it over at least 1 day--it should be more than that--give people an \nopportunity to study it, and determine what is in it and how they might \nwish to amend it.\n  There is an old saying I mentioned before in this Senate Chamber: \nNever buy something from somebody who is out of breath. There is a kind \nof breathless quality to this rush: We must rush; We must get this done \nimmediately; We must bring this bill to the floor immediately.\n  That is not fair. It is not fair in terms of those who come to this \nSenate wanting to represent their constituents, wanting to know what is \nin it for various income groups, various occupations. How will it \naffect their constituents? How will it affect the people living in \ntheir State? In order to do that, they will need to see how the bill is \nwritten and be able to evaluate it with their legislative assistants.\n  Just making a final point to the Senator from Nevada, I did serve in \nthe other body, in the House, and served for 10 years on the Ways and \nMeans Committee. We wrote tax law. We had done this many times, where \nwe would write a rather complicated piece of legislation. But it has \ngenerally been the case that when you write tax law, and write \nlegislation that is complicated--and tax law by definition is always \ncomplicated--you give people an opportunity to evaluate it, to think \nthrough it, to try to understand what kind of changes they would like \nto make; and then have the body work its will.\n  There is, as I said, a kind of breathless quality around here to \nrushing this thing through. I am not quite sure I understand why. As I \nindicated, this will affect our country for a decade. This is big \nstakes. It will have significant impacts on our economy, on the \ncondition of the American economy, the rates of economic growth. I am \nnot\n\n[[Page S4936]]\n\nsure how. I am not sure anybody understands how. But we ought to all be \ngiven the opportunity to think through and evaluate what is in it, what \nit means to our country, what it means for the American people in \ngeneral, and what it means for income groups and occupations, and so \non.\n  The only way we can do that is to have the time. So I urge the \nmajority leader, do not try to do that tomorrow. Do not bring a bill up \ntomorrow that has not yet been printed and ask the Senate, under 20 \nhours of time, to begin debating and trying to amend a piece of \nlegislation that has not yet been printed. That is not fair to the \nSenate and that is not a thoughtful way to legislate.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would yield, I think we have to make sure \nthat people understand this is not some stalling game we are playing. \nThis bill is fast tracked. We have 20 hours to debate it. The majority \nhas a right to yield back 10 of those hours. So it could be done in 1 \nday.\n  But I do not think it is a radical proposal when I say for the people \nI represent--the 2 million people I represent--I would sure like to \nread this bill first, have my staff review this bill first. I do not \nthink that is asking too much. That is all we are asking.\n  I think the majority is buying themselves a lot of trouble by trying \nto fast track this. There is no reason to do this. Let us look at the \nlegislation. We are going to offer amendments anyway. We might as well \noffer amendments that have some bearing on the bill we have read rather \nthan one we have heard about reported in the press.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/15/senate-section/article/S4936-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PRAYERS FOR THE CAPITOL POLICE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was here this morning when the Senate was \nopened and the Chaplain gave a prayer. The prayer was dedicated to the \npolice officers all over the country because this week we honor these \nbrave men and women who have lost their lives in the line of duty. We \nrecognize them. But the part of the prayer the Chaplain gave that I \nthought was so moving was directed to our Capitol Police force.\n  We take for granted these men and women who stand at the doors and \npatrol these large facilities. We take them for granted because we \ndon't see them often directing traffic or arresting people, even though \nthey do that. In fact, we know they are moments away from danger or \nterror at all times of the day.\n  That was recognized a few years ago when two of our finest were \ngunned down blocking an entrance to this building saving the life of \nthe majority whip in the House of Representatives.\n  I appreciate the prayer of the Chaplain. These men and women do a \nremarkable job for the country.\n  All around the world today there are evil people who if they could \nfigure a way to do damage to these representative buildings of this \ngreat democracy or to the people who work in them, would do whatever \nevil they could. But what keeps them from doing that is the Capitol \nPolice force. They are well trained. We are now, in fact, working \ntowards developing our own academies so these men and women can be \ntrained in this area and not have to travel hundreds of miles away in \nGeorgia to do their training.\n  There is no better trained police force any place in the world than \nthe Capitol Police. Whatever the danger, whether it is a bomb threat, \nthe need to call in a SWAT Team, or protecting the many dignitaries who \ncome here, they do it, and they do it very well--without any fanfare \nand without seeking any glory or aggrandizement of any kind.\n  Again, I very much appreciate the prayer of the Chaplain today. I \nhope we will all join in recognizing the fine work done by the men and \nwomen of our Capitol Police force. Every day I see them I recognize \nthey are there to protect me, my family, the people of this country, \nand these beautiful buildings in which we have the privilege of \nworking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/15/senate-section/article/S4936-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to detail a heinous crime that occurred October 29, 1999 \nin Indianapolis, Indiana. A trio of men, while allegedly committing a \nseries of robberies, broke into the apartment of two men. Convinced \nthat the men were gay, the perpetrators forced the men to strip, tied \nthem together, and tortured them with a hot iron. During the attack \nthat lasted more than 30 minutes, both victims were burned repeatedly, \nkicked, beaten with a small baseball bat and other household items, and \ntaunted with homophobic remarks. One of the victims was forced to drink \na mixture of bleach and urine. The robbers also tried to burn the \nbuilding down on their way out but later inexplicably returned, put out \nthe fire, and gave some water to the man they made drink the bleach \nmixture. The robbers walked away from the scene after having stolen $6.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/15/senate-section/article/S4936-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4936-S4937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IMPORTANCE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I speak today in strong support of the \nsense-of-the Senate resolution introduced by Chairman Bond and myself, \nrecognizing the important role played by the Small Business \nAdministration on behalf of the United States small business community. \nI am pleased to say that nearly every Senator on the Small Business \nCommittee has cosponsored this important Resolution. I would like to \nthank Senators Burns, Levin, Bennett, Harkin, Snowe, Lieberman, Enzi, \nWellstone, Crapo, Cleland, Ensign, Landrieu, Edwards, and Cantwell for \nshowing their support for America's small businesses by cosponsoring \nthis Resolution.\n  Mr. President, small businesses keep the U.S. economy moving. They \nare responsible for employing more than 52 percent of the private \nworkforce; for generating more than 51 percent of the nation's gross \ndomestic product; and are the principal source of new jobs. They were \nalso responsible for helping to end the recession of the early 1990's, \nand with the right programs and assistance, will be a major factor in \nsustaining our current economy.\n  To help them achieve success, small businesses rely on a range of \nprograms administered and monitored by the Small Business \nAdministration (SBA), such as the Small Business Innovation Research \nProgram (SBIR), the 7(a) Guaranteed Loan Program, the 8(a) Business \nDevelopment Program, the Small Business Development Center and Women's \nBusiness Center Programs, and the New Markets Venture Capital Program. \nAnd these are just a few of the many initiatives that continue to \nreceive widespread support from the Senate and House Committees on \nSmall Business, as well as the Congress as a whole. Our resolution \ncommends the SBA for their activities, and calls on the President to \nmake every effort to strengthen and expand assistance to small business \nconcerns through Federal programs.\n  SBA programs are relied upon to help restore economically depressed \ncommunities, spur technological innovation, provide access to capital, \ntrain entrepreneurs, monitor the procurement practices of Federal \nagencies, and ensure small businesses are heard when new regulations \nare being developed. Unfortunately, the SBA has received increasing \nresponsibilities without the necessary increase in resources to do the \njob as effectively as possible.\n  To make the situation worse, the Bush administration's budget request \nfor fiscal year 2002 is woefully inadequate and goes in the wrong \ndirection. President Bush has consistently stated that the economy is \nin a period of economic decline, yet he has proposed limiting the \nresources available to our small businesses by cutting funding and \ncharging additional fees for programs that create businesses and jobs, \nand help generate revenue for the American people.\n\n[[Page S4937]]\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend Chairman Bond for working with \nme to pass an amendment to the budget resolution restoring many of the \ncuts initiated by the Bush administration. I am hopeful that our joint \neffort will be retained in the final budget. I also hope that by \ncontinuing to work in a bipartisan fashion on this critical issue, we \ncan further increase SBA resources for the next fiscal year. The SBA \ndeserves our continued support for its important work, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution as well as sufficient resources \nfor the SBA and America's small businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/15/senate-section/article/S4937-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to recognize the exemplary contributions of an \nextraordinary couple, John and Mary Jane Stokesberry of Miami, FL. \nGiven John's significant impact on public policy development and \nimplementation in the areas of gerontology and aging and Mary Jane's \npassion for teaching those with special educational needs, I know their \njoint retirement on June 30, 2001 will leave a void which will be \ndifficult to fill.\n  John L. Stokesberry has to his credit over 30 years of administrative \nleadership in human service delivery in Florida. In his most recent \npublic role, John has served as the Executive Director of the Alliance \nfor Aging, Inc., the Area Agency on Aging for Miami-Dade and Monroe \nCounties in Florida. Through his compassionate and adept oversight, \nmany seniors and developmentally challenged individuals have been \nprovided the benefit of quality care and the timely provision of \nservices.\n  Florida has long been a favored retirement destination for seniors \nwho have worked hard throughout their lives. They are more than \ndeserving of living out their days in dignity and with whatever comfort \nand respect we are able to provide. Consequently, in Florida, \nincreasing attention and focus is being placed on aging issues. John L. \nStokesberry's contributions in helping to chart Florida's course in \nthis relatively new frontier have been pivotal. We have benefitted from \nhis remarkable expertise, coalition building and advocacy for over \nthree decades. Whether at the district or state administrative levels, \nhis leadership has always been felt and has enhanced the mission of our \nstate in meeting the needs of our seniors.\n  Mary Jane Stokesberry has worked at the Van E. Blanton Elementary \nSchool for 39 years and currently serves as the Chair of the Special \nEducation Department. While instructing young people who have special \nneeds can present unique challenges, Mary Jane's genuine warmth and \npatience has consistently led to the most positive development of her \nstudents. It came as no surprise when she was formerly designated as a \nRegional Teacher of the Year. Though many of her former students are \nnow adults, I am sure they would agree that Mary Jane has left an \nindelible mark on their lives. Through her exceptional legacy, I am \nreminded of the proverb, ``if you give a child a fish you feed them for \na day; if you teach a child how to fish, you feed them for a \nlifetime.'' Mary Jane has fed countless children for a lifetime.\n  For these reasons, I am proud to join the chorus of other voices in \nFlorida and Miami-Dade County who extend to John and Mary Jane \nStokesberry best wishes on the occasion of their retirements. I \ncongratulate them today and wish for them many more productive and \nhealthy years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/15/senate-section/article/S4937-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PERRY COMO\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to celebrate the \nlife, and commemorate the death of an American cultural icon from the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, Perry Como.\n  On May 18, 1912, Pierino Roland Como was born in Canonsburg, PA, the \nseventh of thirteen children to Italian immigrants. Pierino, who would \nbecome known to the world as Perry, would lead a life which was the \nAmerican dream personified. He began working as a barber's apprentice \nin Canonsburg at the age of eleven to help provide for his family. It \nis reported that Mr. Como's illustrious singing career developed by \nsinging to patrons in his own barber shop which he opened by fourteen. \nThe baritone voice, which would become famous throughout the world, was \nsoon discovered by a band traveling through his steel town and he began \nhis career as an entertainer. In 1933, Mr. Como married his childhood \nsweetheart, Roselle Beline, who told him he could open another barber \nshop if his singing career failed. His career did not fail, nor did \ntheir marriage which lasted until Roselle's death in 1998.\n  Perry Como's singing and performing career spanned six decades and \nduring that period he sold over 100 million records. Twenty-seven of \nhis albums went gold, while fourteen singles reached number one on the \ncharts. In 1945, ``Till the End of Time'' became the first single to \nsell more than one million records. After his great success in record \nsales in the 1940's, 50's and 60's, his career evolved into that of a \ntelevision star. From 1948 to 1963, Perry Como was a fixture in \nAmerican homes as a pioneer of the variety show format. He won acclaim \nfor his performances including 5 Emmy awards. He also won Peabody and \nGolden Mike awards during his career. And in 1987 Mr. Como was \npresented a Kennedy Center Honor for outstanding achievement in the \nperforming arts by President Ronald Reagan.\n  Mr. Como's fame was worldwide and lasting. The BBC reports that he \nhad twelve top ten hits in Britain, over twenty years. His Christmas \nbroadcasts, for which, perhaps, he was most famous, were broadcast from \naround the globe over the years, including Israel, Paris, and London. A \nRoman Catholic, he reached Protestants and Catholics alike through his \nrenditions of ``Ave Maria'' and ``The Lord's Prayer.'' He sang ``Kol \nNidre'' each year on his television program in observance of Yom \nKippur. Mr. Como also made many fans in Japan, where his variety shows \nhad unique success. Perry Como continued to perform for fans in the \nUnited States well into his eighties.\n  It is with great humility that I ask this body to remember an \nAmerican cultural icon on the occasion of his passing. I hope and pray \nthat future generations of Americans will use Perry Como's example of \ndignity and decency in conducting their personal and professional \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/15/senate-section/article/S4937-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4937-S4938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   STOCKDALE HIGH SCHOOL REPRESENTS CALIFORNIA IN THE WE THE PEOPLE \n                          NATIONAL COMPETITION\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nfamily-owned business in my home State of New Mexico, which is not only \na staple and generous partner in the community, but has grown to be one \nof the largest Hispanic-owned businesses in the United States. This \ncompany, Bueno Foods, this week celebrates its Golden Anniversary--50 \nyears of producing premiere New Mexican food products. The company, \nhoused in Albuquerque's South Valley, is a pride for the community.\n  Started back in 1951, the company provided the means for the Baca \nbrothers, Joe, Ray and Augustine, to provide for themselves, their \nfamily, and improve their community. In the years after World War II, \nthe Baca brothers first opened a grocery store that prospered until \nsupermarket chains started to infiltrate the Albuquerque market. The \nbrothers realized that in order to stay in business for themselves, \nthey needed a new direction. So they expanded their business by \nfeaturing the traditional New Mexican recipes of their mother, \nFilomena. Their company became the first commercial producer of flame-\nroasted, fresh frozen green chile. Today the name ``Bueno Foods'' is \nsynonymous with that frozen green chile.\n  Since those days, the company has grown from a company with five \nemployees to one with 240 workers. Still family run by the Baca family, \nits purpose has not only been to provide high-quality, authentic \nproducts, but also good jobs and active community involvement. Even \nwith its large growth, the company has kept its roots and main plant in \nthe South Valley, a historic and proud part of Albuquerque.\n  Throughout the years, Bueno has remained true to its core values and \nbeliefs that center around making people's lives better through jobs \nand opportunity, and contributing to the community. Bueno donates part \nof its profits to charities and scholarships, and every Christmas helps \nto provide food and clothing to the needy.\n  As Bueno Foods turns 50, it is celebrating its golden anniversary in \na way that continues to epitomize those values. The company has teamed \nup with several organizations to host a 4-day fiesta for the South \nValley's Barelas community, where the Bacas were born and started their \nsmall business. My congratulations go to Bueno Foods president, \nJacqueline Baca, the other members of the Baca family who continue the \nlegacy of the Baca brothers, and all their employees. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in saluting this company's success and its \ncommitment to the Hispanic entrepreneurial and community \nspirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/15/senate-section/article/S4938-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO BURMA--MESSAGE FROM \n                          THE PRESIDENT--PM 19\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a \n6-month periodic report on the national emergency with respect to Burma \nthat was declared in Executive Order 13047 or May 20, 1997.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prorate \nthe heavy vehicle use tax between the first and subsequent purchasers \nof the same vehicle in one taxable period; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a bill that \nwill help many truck-drivers across the country. As we all know, the \ntrucking industry has incurred an incredible cost increase in recent \nyears due to higher fuel prices and other taxes. One of my \nconstituents, Phillip Parks, has felt this tremendous financial burden \nand, as a result, sold his truck and got out of the business \naltogether.\n  The heavy vehicle use tax is one tax many truck drivers, like Mr. \nParks, are required to pay each year. Under the current IRS code, when \na vehicle over 75,000 pounds is purchased and driven over 5,000 miles, \nthe owner must pay a $550 heavy-use tax. However, if the owner sells \nthe vehicle in the same year, he or she is unable to receive a refund \non this tax, while the person buying the vehicle does not have to pay \nthe tax during that year since it has already been paid. This is what \nhappened to Mr. Parks.\n  My bill will not only make this tax more fair, but will provide some \nmuch-needed relief for people who wish to sell their trucks within the \nsame year they bought them. The Heavy Vehicle Use Tax Equity Act will \nrequire the purchaser to pay a prorated tax on the vehicle, while the \nperson selling it will receive a refund for the portion of the tax \nrelative to the time in which they owned it.\n  I am pleased to introduce this bill that will help make our complex \ntax code more equitable while putting money back into the hands of \nhard-working Americans, like Phillip Parks of Stillwell, OK.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 879.

 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 880. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide adequate coverage for immunosuppressive drugs furnished to \nbeneficiaries under the Medicare Program that have received an organ \ntransplant, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with my \ncolleague, Senator Lincoln, to help those with End Stage Renal Disease, \nESRD, who receive Medicare-eligible kidney transplants. Our bill would \nhelp these patients maintain access to life-saving drugs needed to \nprevent their immune systems from rejecting their new organs.\n  With each kidney that is successfully transplanted, a gift of new \nlife is given to the recipient. This precious gift should not be \njeopardized simply because the recipient is unable to pay for the \nimmunosuppressive drugs that help ensure that his or her immune system \ndoes not reject the new organ. It defies common sense for Medicare to \ncover expensive kidney transplant operations, but not cover the drugs \nnecessary to preserve the transplanted organ.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues for supporting the passage of \nmost of the bill that I introduced last Congress--S. 631--which was \npassed as part of the Medicare Benefits and Improvement Protection Act, \nBIPA. This law eliminated the 36-month time limitation for Medicare \ncoverage of immunosuppressive medications for transplant recipients who \n(1) received a Medicare transplant and (2) have Medicare-age or \ndisability status. However, transplant recipients whose Medicare \neligibility is based solely on their End Stage Renal Disease, ESRD, \nstatus did not qualify for the extended coverage under BIPA and remain \nlimited to coverage for 36 months post-transplant.\n  The bill we are introducing today simply would eliminate the 36-month \ntime limitation for Medicare immunosuppressive drug coverage for the \npopulation that was not covered under last year's BIPA provision. Under \ncurrent law, an individual with ESRD retains his or her Medicare \ncoverage for all medical needs for 36 months post-transplant. This bill \nwould eliminate the 36-month time limitation for the purpose of paying \nfor the immunosuppressive drugs only--all other Medicare coverage, \nincluding that related to other post-transplant needs, would cease \nafter 36 months, as under current law.\n  A 1999 Institute of Medicine, IOM, study estimated the cost of \nproviding indefinite coverage of all Medicare-covered kidney \ntransplants at $848 million over five years. The IOM estimate of \neliminating the time limitation for Medicare-aged and disabled \ntransplant recipients only, covered under BIPA, was $566 million over \nfive years. This represents a difference of only $282 million over five \nyears to cover the rest of the ESRD population.\n  Furthermore, our bill would make Medicare the secondary payer after \n36 months for beneficiaries who do not have Medicare-age or disability \nstatus, which the IOM report did not consider. Recipients covered by \nour bill would be subject to the same Part B premium, deductible, and \ncoinsurance that other beneficiaries pay to receive full Part B \ncoverage.\n\n[[Page S4943]]\n\n  Medicare will pay for another transplant (average cost is $100,000) \nor dialysis, annual cost is more than $50,000, if a transplant fails. \nIt makes far better sense from an economic and social perspective to \nextend Medicare coverage for the anti-rejection medications especially \nat a time when the number of people waiting for a kidney transplant in \nthis country exceeds 48,000 people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our bill and help those who receive \nMedicare-eligible transplants gain access to the immunosuppressive \ndrugs they need to prevent their bodies from rejecting transplanted \nkidneys.\n  This legislation is supported by the National Kidney Foundation, the \nAmerican Society of Transplantation, the American Society of Pediatric \nNephrology, the North American Transplant Coordinators Organization, \nLifeCenter, the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, the \nAmerican Kidney Fund, and the Polycystic Kidney Disease Foundation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 880\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to provide \nfor consistent treatment of survivor benefits for public safety \nofficers killed in the line of duty; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Biden, and I are introducing legislation we have drafted to \nhelp ease the burden of those whose husband or wife or father or mother \nwas a public safety officer and has made the ultimate sacrifice and \ndied while protecting the citizens of this Nation. I am speaking of the \nfamilies of law enforcement officers, firefighters, and rescue squad or \nambulance crew members who have lost a loved one in the line of duty.\n  The Hatch-Biden bill we introduce in the Senate today, the Fallen \nHero Survivor Benefit Fairness Act of 2001, is designed to make annuity \nbenefits for survivors of public safety officers killed in the line of \nduty tax free, so long as the annuity is provided under a governmental \nplan to the surviving spouse or to the child of the deceased officer.\n  In the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Congress took an important step \nin showing our appreciation for this country's fallen heroes by \nexempting from taxation survivor benefits for those killed in the line \nof duty after December 31, 1996. This change has undoubtedly made a \nsignificant difference to many such surviving families.\n  But what about the families of fallen heroes who died before that \ndate? Should not their government-provided survivor annuities be tax-\nfree as well? Of course they should.\n  This bill provides tax equity for those survivors receiving annuities \nfor officers who died on or before December 31, 1996. We must make this \ntax-free treatment available for all survivors of peace officers who \ngave their lives to make this great country a\n\n[[Page S4944]]\n\nsafer place for us all to live. The tax correction in this bill would \nnot be retroactive. Rather, it provides that payments from a qualified \nsurvivor annuity received after December 31, 2001, would qualify for \ntax-free treatment, even if the peace officer was killed prior to the \neffective date of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 provision.\n  We are not talking about a great deal of money here. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimates this correction would result in about \n$5 million per year in lost revenue or a total cost of $46 million over \n10 years. This is not a high price to pay to show this country's \ngratitude for the service these men and women who are public safety \nofficers perform each day when they leave their homes, the risks they \ntake, and for the ultimate sacrifice some of them have made.\n  Last week, the House Committee on Ways and Means approved identical \nlegislation to correct this problem, and I am told the bill is coming \nbefore the entire House for a vote today. Mr. President, this week (May \n13-19, 2001) is National Police Week. Although it does not begin to pay \nour debt to these men and women and their survivors, I cannot think of \na better way to honor those public service officers who have died in \nthe line of duty than to pass bills like this one that recognize their \nsacrifices and attempt to help their survivors with their burdens. I \nhope our colleagues will join us in cosponsoring this bill and in \npassing this legislation this week.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 881\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fallen Hero Survivor Benefit \n     Fairness Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF SURVIVOR BENEFITS FOR PUBLIC \n                   SAFETY OFFICERS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY.\n\n       Subsection (b) of section 1528 of the Taxpayer Relief Act \n     of 1997 (Public Law 105-34) is amended by striking the period \n     and inserting ``, and to amounts received in taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 2001, with respect to \n     individuals dying on or before December 31, 1996.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Murray, Ms. \n        Collins, and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 882. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that a monthly insurance benefit thereunder shall be paid for \nthe month in which the recipient dies, subject to a reduction of 50 \npercent if the recipient dies during the first 15 days of such month, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I rise to talk about an issue \nthat is very important to me, very important to my constituents in \nMaryland and very important to the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  For the fourth Congress in a row, I am joining in a bipartisan effort \nwith my friend and colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe, to end an unfair \npolicy of the Social Security System.\n  Senator Snowe and I are introducing the Social Security Family \nProtection Act. This bill addresses retirement security and family \nsecurity. We want the middle class of this Nation to know that we are \ngoing to give help to those who practice self-help.\n  What is it I am talking about? I was shocked when I found out that \nSocial Security does not pay benefits for the last month of life. If a \nSocial Security retiree dies on the 18th of the month or even on the \n30th of the month, the surviving spouse or family members must send \nback the Social Security check for that month.\n  I think that is an harsh and heartless rule. That individual worked \nfor Social Security benefits, earned those benefits, and paid into the \nSocial Security trust fund. The system should allow the surviving \nspouse or the estate of the family to use that Social Security check \nfor the last month of life.\n  This legislation has an urgency. When a loved one dies, there are \nexpenses that the family must take care of. People have called my \noffice in tears. Very often it is a son or a daughter that is grieving \nthe death of a parent. They are clearing up the paperwork for their mom \nor dad, and there is the Social Security check. And they say, `Senator, \nthe check says for the month of May. Mom died on May 28. Why do we have \nto send the Social Security check back? We have bills to pay. We have \nutility coverage that we need to wrap up, mom's rent, or her mortgage, \nor health expenses. Why is Social Security telling me, `Send the check \nback or we're going to come and get you'?'\n  With all the problems in our country today, we ought to be going \nafter drug dealers and tax dodgers, not honest people who have paid \ninto Social Security, and not the surviving spouse or the family who \nhave been left with the bills for the last month of their loved one's \nlife. They are absolutely right when they call me and say that Social \nSecurity was supposed to be there for them.\n  I've listened to my constituents and to the stories of their lives. \nWhat they say is this: ``Senator Mikulski, we don't want anything for \nfree. But our family does want what our parents worked for. We do want \nwhat we feel we deserve and what has been paid for in the trust fund in \nour loved one's name. Please make sure that our family gets the Social \nSecurity check for the last month of our life.''\n  That is what our bill is going to do. That is why Senator Snowe and I \nare introducing the Family Social Security Protection Act. When we talk \nabout retirement security, the most important part of that is income \nsecurity. And the safety net for most Americans is Social Security.\n  We know that as Senators we have to make sure that Social Security \nremains solvent, and we are working to do that. We also don't want to \ncreate an undue administrative burden at the Social Security \nAdministration--a burden that might affect today's retirees. But it is \nabsolutely crucial that we provide a Social Security check for the last \nmonth of life.\n  How do we propose to do that? We have a very simple, straightforward \nway of dealing with this problem. Our legislation says that if you die \nbefore the 15th of the month, you will get a check for half the month. \nIf you die after the 15th of the month, your surviving spouse or the \nfamily estate would get a check for the full month.\n  We think this bill is fundamentally fair. Senator Snowe and I are \nold-fashioned in our belief in family values. We believe you honor your \nfather and your mother. We believe that it is not only a good religious \nand moral principle, but it is good public policy as well.\n  The way to honor your father and mother is to have a strong Social \nSecurity System and to make sure the system is fair in every way. That \nmeans fair for the retiree and fair for the spouse and family. We \nstrongly feel that the current system is an injustice to spouses and \nfamilies across the Nation. Just because a beneficiary passes away, it \ndoes not mean that their bills can go unpaid. Join us to correct this \npolicy and to ensure that families and recipients are protected during \nthis difficult time. That is why we support making sure that the \nsurviving spouse or family can keep the Social Security check for the \nlast month of life.\n  We urge our colleagues to join us in this effort and support the \nSocial Security Family Protection Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 883.

A bill to improve port-of-entry infrastructure along the \nSouthwest border of the United States, to establish grants to improve \nports-of-entry facilities, to designate a port-of-entry as a port \ntechnology demonstration site, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Southwest \nBorder Port-of-Entry Infrastructure Improvement Act. The Southwest \nborder region has been ignored for far too long, and as a result, has \nlagged behind the rest of the Nation in many areas. Poor health and \nenvironmental quality, inadequate infrastructure, and fewer \ntechnological and educational resources are common facts of life along \nmuch of the Southwest Border.\n  Last year, the U.S.-Mexico Border had a population of 12.6 million. \nBy 2020, the region will have more than 21 million residents. That \nmeans that the southwest border region is growing at more than twice \nthe national average and 40 percent faster than the U.S.'s fastest \ngrowing states.\n  And what has been the engine of this tremendous growth? Trade. When \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement came into effect in 1994, U.S.-\nMexico trade totaled $100 billion. In 1999 trade between the two \ncountries accounted for $197 billion, a near doubling in only 5 years.\n  Unfortunately, we have failed to invest in the Southwest Border to \naccommodate this tremendous growth. In 1999, eighty-six percent of U.S-\nMexico trade was transported across the border by trucks. Yet, rather \nthan promote a system where trade can flourish, we have congested \ntraffic lanes where drivers have to wait three even 5 hours before \ncrossing the border.\n  These lines include all manner of people and industry, from a truck \nfilled with auto parts en route to Detroit to hungry tourists wanting \nan authentic taco to service employees who live in Mexico and work in \nthe United States. The effect of these unnecessary traffic backlogs is \ntwo-fold.\n  First, significant delays at our nation's ports-of-entry along the \nSouthwest Border results in inefficient trade. This works at cross \npurposes with ``just in time delivery.''\n  A primary reason that U.S.-Mexico trade has increased so dramatically \nis that the border allows companies to benefit from ``just in time'' \ndelivery. Using ``just in time,'' firms eliminate warehousing and \npreservation costs, resulting in lower prices and more efficient \ndelivery.\n  Primary producers, intermediary companies, downstream retailers, and \ncustomers all rely on the timely delivery of goods and services. But \nhuge backlogs makes ``just-in-time'' delivery more like delivery ``some \ntime.'' When delivery times increase or are uncertain, associated costs \nincrease for everyone down the product and user chain.\n\n[[Page S4946]]\n\n  Second, long traffic backlogs detrimentally affect the people who \nlive along the Southwest Border.\n  A study by the Environmental Protection Agency concluded that, ``the \nborder's health conditions and risks * * * are among the most troubling \nand the most serious in the United States.\n  Health and environmental problems seem to be most prevalent in \npoverty stricken areas. The Southwest Border is one of the poorest \nregions in the nation. In fact, nearly 27 percent of New Mexico's Dona \nAna County live below the poverty line, double the national average, \nand other counties along the border are even worse off. For example, 40 \npercent of Maverick County, Texas' population live below the poverty \nlevel.\n  We cannot continue to focus on the increased wealth the Nation enjoys \nfrom trade while ignoring the burden that trade imposes on border \nresidents.\n  Long backlogs at ports-of-entry along the Southwest Border creates a \nsubstantial hardship on the people in the region. The EPA report \nconcluded that the border disproportionately suffers from serious \nhealth threats due, in part, to airborne pollutants from vehicle \nemissions.\n  Increased trade means ever increasing vehicle emissions. A recent \nstudy by the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation \nfound that truck traffic increases 8.6 percent per year. An 8.6 percent \nincrease means that by 2020, commodity truck flows will be 5.5 times \ngreater than 1999 levels.\n  That study never considered the recent NAFTA arbitration panel ruling \nthat the U.S.'s policy prohibiting Mexican trucks beyond twenty miles \nfrom the border violates the trade agreement.\n  I would like the U.S. to promote trade so that the entire Nation's \neconomy continues to grow. Yet, we need to act pro-actively with \nforesight and responsible planning so that the Southwest Border \ninfrastructure can adequately handle the projected and likely traffic \nincreases.\n  I would like to see the engine that is our economy keep running. I \njust want that engine to run faster, quieter, and smoother. That's why \nI am introducing the Southwest Border Infrastructure Improvement Act.\n  This bill provides funds to improve our ports-of-entry and ensure \nefficient binational trade in the future.\n  Specifically, this bill directs the U.S. Customs Service to update \nthe ``Ports of Entry Infrastructure Assessment Study'' within 6 months \nof enactment. Pursuant to the updated study, it provides $500 million \nto be spent over five years for the recommended improvements.\n  Second, this legislation recognizes our unique shared border and \nrelationship with Mexico. It considers that a unilateral solution along \na binational border is no solution at all.\n  Therefore, this bill establishes a $75 million grant fund for FY02 \nand other sums for 2003-2006 through the Department of Transportation \nfor port-of-entry infrastructure improvements that would reduce \nnegative environmental impacts, such as air pollution, associated with \ncross-border transportation.\n  The grant program will be administered by the North American \nDevelopment Bank and certified by the Border Environment Cooperation \nCommission. Grant applicants must meet a dollar for dollar match \nrequirement to receive grant funds.\n  Last, this bill recognizes that new technologies must be developed to \nfacilitate future binational trade. Our current system of processing \ngoods at ports is impractical, overly burdensome, and is a substantial \nfactor in traffic backlogs.\n  In order to innovate more efficient processing systems, this \nlegislation designates that a port-of-entry will serve as a site to \ndemonstrate port technologies. The Customs Service will carry out a \nprogram to test and evaluate such new technologies. This bill provides \n$10 million for 2002 and other sums from 2003 through 2006 for that \npurpose.\n  The selected port must have sufficient space to conduct the \ndemonstration program, have low traffic volume so that new technologies \nmay be incorporated without interrupting normal processing activity, \nand have a relatively modern design.\n  The recent NAFTA arbitration panel ruling concerning the U.S.'s \npolicy prohibiting Mexican trucks from entering the United States \nbrings our infrastructure limitations to the forefront. It is \nimperative to improve the Southwest Border's inadequate infrastructure \nand design. We must act to ensure continued national growth while \nworking to improve the health and environment of border residents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Cleland, and Mr. Miller):\n  S. 885. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for national standardized payment amounts for inpatient \nhospital services furnished under the medicare program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be joined by \nSenator Cleland of Georgia in introducing the Area Wage and Base \nPayment Improvement Act, which seeks to address Medicare payment \ninequities for rural and small hospitals so they may pay competitive \nwages to attract and retain health care personnel and provide quality \nhealth care.\n  We all know that the health care workforce is shrinking, both in its \nown right and relative to the growing patient population. This is \nillustrated by the nursing profession. The average age of nurses today \nis 43.3 years, and less than 10 percent of the current nurse workforce \nis below age 30. Unfortunately, many nurses are leaving the occupation \nbecause of low pay, excessive paperwork burdens, a lack of respect, and \nother consequences of being short-staffed, such as overly long shifts, \nmandatory overtime, and the stress of having too many patients under \ntheir care. The result is that very few new nurses are getting into the \npipeline to replace those who have retired or left the profession. The \nnursing shortage is being felt in virtually every part of the country, \nbut especially in rural areas, where it is hard for hospitals to \nrecruit and retain qualified personnel. In my home State of Arkansas, \nwhere nearly every county is considered a medically underserved area, \nhospitals are reporting over 750 nurse vacancies, this says nothing of \nthe other personnel shortages they are experiencing as well.\n  Such severe shortages in qualified health care personnel have \n``nationalized'' the market for health care professionals, and \nhistorically low labor costs in rural and small urban areas have \ndisappeared. Hospitals in these areas must compete with large urban \nhospitals for qualified workers and pay higher wages as a result. In \nsome cases, rural hospitals are being forced to pay health care \npersonnel even more than urban hospitals. For example, a nurse \npractitioner in rural Arkansas is paid $29.04 per hours on average, \nwhile the same nurse practitioner would be paid $28.22 per hour in an \nurban hospital.\n  The Area Wage and Base Payment Improvement Act would address this \nissue by establishing an area wage index floor of 0.925 in order to \nbring payments in areas with the lowest wage indexes up to just below \nthe national average of 1.00. The wage index is intended to adjust \nMedicare hospital inpatient and outpatient payments to account for \nvarying wage rates paid by hospitals for workers in different market \nareas across the country, but it has not been updated since 1997. In \nArkansas, the area wage index for rural hospitals is as low as .7445. \nBy creating an area wage index floor of .925, as many as 72 hospitals \nin Arkansas and 2,100 hospitals nationwide will see an increase in \ntheir Medicare payments and their ability to provide competitive wages \nfor hospital labor.\n  The legislation we are introducing also makes an important change to \nthe Medicare payment formula by increasing the Medicare inpatient \nprospective payment system, PPS, base amount for rural and small urban \nhospitals. This base payment is primarily intended to cover labor \ncosts. Today, there are two different base payment amounts for \nhospitals paid under the Medicare PPS, hospitals in large urban areas \nreceive a base payment of $4,197, while hospitals located in all other \nareas receive a lower amount of $4,130. This legislation will eliminate \nthis disparity and create one base payment of $4,197 for all hospitals. \nNationwide, 2,600 hospitals will benefit from this payment increase.\n  The Area Wage and Base Payment Improvement Act will provide critical \npayments to small and rural hospitals\n\n[[Page S4947]]\n\nstriving to provide quality health care and put them on an equal \nfooting with large urban hospitals in terms of competing for health \ncare personnel. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this \nimportant, bipartisan legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 885\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President. I want to thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Arkansas, Senator Tim Hutchinson, for his leadership on \nthe Area Wage and Base Payment Improvement Act. I am very pleased to \njoin Senator Hutchinson in this bipartisan measure to address Medicare \ninequities in the wage index for rural and community hospitals.\n  The severe shortage of nurses and other crucial health care workers \nhas driven salaries higher to compete for these employees. The current \nMedicare wage index for rural areas reimburses at a lower rate which is \nbased on 1997 data. In an increasingly competitive market for health \ncare workers, rural area hospitals are in their ability to provide \nquality care.\n  Our proposal establishes a ``floor'' on the area wage index and will \nadjust Medicare inpatient and outpatient prospective payments (PPS) for \nrural and small metropolitan hospitals. By setting a floor on the area \nwage index of 0.925, our proposed correction would bring Medicare \npayments in areas with the lowest wage index up to just below the \nnational average which is established at 1.00. The impact of the 0.925 \nfloor is estimated to help more than 2100 mostly rural, but also some \nurban hospitals across the country.\n  This measure also increases the Medicare PPS base, of which a \nsignificant portion is to cover hospital labor costs. Today's \ncompetitive labor market has reduced the disparity in wages between \nlarge urban hospitals and rural and small metropolitan facilities. It \nmakes sense that Medicare needs to move to one base payment for the \ninpatient PPS. The key issue here should be access to health care. For \nstates like Georgia and Arkansas, with a large number of residents \nliving in rural areas, the closing or downsizing of hospital beds \nbecause of out-of-date Medicare payment rates and insufficient health \nworkers to provide safe care is creating a health care catastrophe.\n  Our measure is the companion bill to H.R. 1609. We urge our \ncolleagues to support this bicameral, bipartisan effort to ensure \naccess to rural and smaller metropolitan hospitals for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 886. A bill to establish the Katie Poirer Abduction Emergency \nFund, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, last year in my home State, a talented, \nspirited young woman named Katie Poirier was abducted from the her job \nat a Carlton County convenience store. Within days of her \ndisappearance, there was an enormous outpouring of community concern \nand support, with hundreds of volunteers helping local law enforcement \nsearch for Katie. Tragically, Katier's body was later recovered and a \nsuspect arrested and tried for her murder.\n  The Poirier, Holmquist and Swanson cases in Minnesota, all involving \nabductions and homicides, demonstrate that resources and good \ninformation are absolutely crucial to successful law enforcement, \nparticularly in our small towns and rural communities which are too \noften overlooked.\n  To that end, I am re-introducing legislation called ``Katie's Law,'' \nin honor of Katie Poirier, which will give rural law enforcement the \nassistance they need to deal with high profile, major crimes.\n  This legislation will establish a Federal ``Katie Poirier Abduction \nEmergency Fund'' to assist local and rural law enforcement agencies \nwith the unanticipated expenses of major crimes. Second, it will \nprovide grants to local and rural law enforcement agencies to integrate \ntheir identification technologies, or to establish systems that\n\n[[Page S4948]]\n\nwork with the FBI's Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification \nSystem, IAFIS. In many rural communities, this will cut down the time \nit takes to identify a violent suspect from two months to two hours.\n  There are hundreds of thousands adult and child abductions and \nhomicides each year in rural counties. When a high profile, major crime \noccurs, like the Wetterling or Poirier abduction, local and rural law \nenforcement with small budgets are frequently overwhelmed by the \nfinancial demands these large cases make. The overwhelming hours and \ninvestigative demand can wipe out small budgets with expenses, \nincluding overtime pay, transporting witnesses and suspects if there is \na change of trial venue, as occurred in the Poirier case, and other \nunanticipated costs.\n  As the sheriffs across my home State will tell you, the first 72 \nhours in an abduction case are the most critical. After that, the \nchances of locating the victim alive drop dramatically. No matter how \nshort staffed or small the budget, law enforcement must put its pedal \nto the metal 100 percent after an abduction or homicide. It is crucial \nthat rural law enforcement agencies with limited resources handling \nmajor crimes get the support they need from the State and Federal \ngovernments.\n  In Minnesota when a high profile case occurs, a joint task force is \nestablished between the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the FBI, and \nthe local law enforcement agency. Sheriffs I have spoken with say the \ntask force model is effective and extremely helpful. Yet, they still \nmust cover many unanticipated expenses such as huge surges in overtime. \nMany of them just can't do it. As one sheriff said to my staff, ``I am \nrunning my agency on fumes, not gas. I've got nothing left.''\n\n  My bill would establish a Federal Abduction Emergency Fund to help \nsmall law enforcement agencies with expenses from high-profile, major \ncrimes, including kidnaping and homicides. The Attorney General would \nmake grants available to state agencies to distribute to local and \nrural law enforcement agencies in need. The total amount would be $10 \nmillion for each of three years.\n  Second, my legislation will provide local law enforcement officers \nwith the resources to use the latest identification system to solve and \nprevent crime. Access to quality, accurate information in a timely \nfashion is of vital importance in that effort.\n  One of the best tools available is the FBI's IAFIS system. Since \nrural and local enforcement often do not have the funds to access the \nFBI's Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System, (IAFIS), \nthey are at a disadvantage when trying to identify violent offenders.\n  State and local law enforcement organizations need to develop and \nupgrade their criminal information and identification systems, as well \nas integrate those systems with other jurisdictions. The Federal \nGovernment has invested billions in information and identification \nsystems whose benefits will go largely unrealized unless local law \nenforcement receive the resources to be able to participate in these \nsystems.\n  Unfortunately, there is a wide disparity between the criminal \nidentification systems that are now available, and the ability of state \nand local law enforcement to use them. Many states, including \nMinnesota, have been developing systems which will allow, at a minimum, \nthe most populous areas to link up to the FBI's IAFIS system. However, \nmany small, rural localities are being left behind. This reduces the \ncapacity of rural law enforcement to quickly verify the identity and \ncriminal record of dangerous suspects in their custody.\n  Right now, in many rural counties, a sheriff's office may have to \nwait as long as two months to have a suspect positively identified. \nAccess to FBI's IAFIS system would allow sheriffs like Ray Hunt to \ndetermine under two hours a suspect's identity who has an existing file \nwith the FBI.\n  This legislation will be one step in bridging this gap. It will \nprovide grants to states to assist local and rural law enforcement to \nintergrate information technologies or to establish systems that work \nwith the FBI's. These funds may be used by local law enforcement \nagencies to integrate information systems with other jurisdictions, or \nfor training, and maintenance and purchase of fingerprint \nidentification technology. The total amount to be authorized is $20 \nmillion for each of three years.\n  ``Katie's Law'' will be instrumental in ensuring that rural law \nenforcement is not left behind. I can never know how the Poirier and \nthe other families really feel, the depth of their pain and the \ntremendous losses they have suffered. But, I do know how I feel--we \nmust and can do more to safeguard our children and to support rural law \nenforcement prevent and solve violent crimes. I believe ``Katie's Law'' \nis an important step forward in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 886\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Torture Victims Relief Act of 1986 to \nauthorize appropriations to provide assistance for domestic centers and \nprograms for the treatment of victims of torture; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am introducing the Torture Victims \nRelief Act of 2001. This bill authorizes increased appropriations to \nprovide assistance for domestic centers and programs for the treatment \nof victims of torture. The bill authorizes the authorization levels for \ndomestic treatment centers for victims of torture to $20 million for \nfiscal year 2002, double the $10 million amount currently authorized \nfor fiscal year 2002 by the Torture Relief Re-authorization Act of \n1999, and $25 million for fiscal year 2003 (an increase of $15 million \nover the current authorization) and establishes an authorization level \nof $30 million for fiscal year 2004.\n  Repressive governments frequently make use of torture to silence \nthose who are defending human rights and democracy in their own \ncountry. Many\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\nof these people have sought refuge in the United States. The additional \nfunding provided in the Torture Relief Act of 2001 recognizes the debt \nwe own to those courageous people who have made extraordinary \nsacrifices by speaking out for their principles.\n  We have come a long way in raising the awareness of torture and \nhelping victims of torture since 1985 when the Center for Victims of \nTorture in Minnesota was founded and began its pioneering work with \ntorture victims, but still much more needs to be done to stop this \nterrible practice.\n  In 1998, as an outgrowth of my work with the Center for Victims of \nTorture, I introduced the Torture Victims Relief Act. It was adopted by \nCongress and became law, PL 105-320. The legislation authorized the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to support U.S. treatment \nprograms for victims of torture. For Fiscal Year 2000, Congress \nappropriated $7.2 million. The implementing agency, the Office of \nRefugee Settlement, provided 16 grants with this appropriation. About \ntwice that number applied for funding with a total request several \ntimes the available amount. For Fiscal Year 2001, Congress appropriated \n$10 million for this program, the authorized amount. It has become \nobvious that the program is significantly underfunded and requires the \nadditional support provided by this legislation.\n  The funds will support treatment services to hundreds of victims each \nyear in 23 treatment centers, located from New York to California and \nfrom Minnesota to Texas. The victims have suffered horrendous torture \nand as a consequence suffer from nightmares, anxiety attacks, \nflashbacks, depression and other mental health problems. With treatment \nthey can become contributing members of our communities. Without \ntreatment, victims potentially become burdens rather than contributors \nto our society.\n  Since adoption of TVRA, the number of treatment programs for victims \nof torture has more than doubled. The National Consortium of Torture \nTreatment Programs now include 23 organizations and others are seeking \nmembership.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 887\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nassistance to students and families coping with the costs of higher \neducation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nCollege Tuition Assistance Act of 2001, a bill that will provide tax \nrelief to middle and lower income American families struggling to pay \nthe rising cost of college tuition for their children.\n  Last year, at my request, the Committee on Governmental Affairs held \ntwo days of hearings on the affordability of higher education. Those \nhearings showed that the price of college tuition continues to rise at \na pace that exceeds the rate of inflation. In fact, the most recent \ndata released by the College Board show that since 1980, both public \nand private four-year college tuitions have increased on average more \nthan 115 percent over inflation. It's no wonder families are worried \nabout their ability to afford a college education for their children, \nand about the student loan debt burden their children may have to bear \nafter graduation. We should be worried too--ensuring that higher \neducation is affordable is critical to our nation's ability to maintain \nits competitiveness in a global economy. Highly trained, skilled \nworkers making good wages are the engine that powers our economy, both \nbecause of the work they do and the revenue they generate as both \nbuyers and sellers of goods and services.\n  The College Tuition Assistance Act will help families in four key \nways:\n  First, it will help them pay tuition expenses while students are in \nschool, by increasing the value of the current Lifetime Learning \nCredit. Under my bill, while a student is in college, a family would be \neligible for a tax credit or tax deduction worth as much as $2,800 \ntoward the first $10,000 in tuition and fees they pay each year. In \naddition, the adjusted income levels at which individuals and families \nqualify for the credit are raised so that more families would be \neligible to receive this credit.\n  Second, my bill would remove the requirement that Pell grants and \nother need-based government aid be subtracted from a family's eligible \ncollege expenses, allowing those families to qualify for some portion \nof the Lifetime Learning Credit. A problem under current law is that \nthe value of need-based aid, such as a Pell grant, received by the \nchild of a lower income family may reduce or even eliminate the \nfamily's eligibility for a tax credit based on tuition expenses. \nHowever, a recent study by the Congressionally-created Advisory \nCommittee on Student Financial Assistance showed that, even after \nreceiving need-based aid, students from low-income families have as \nmuch as $3,800 a year in ``unmet need,'' that is, college expenses that \nare not covered by assistance and which the family may be unable to \nafford. If families are permitted to subtract the value of their \ngovernment aid from their eligible college expenses, they may qualify \nfor the first time for the Lifetime Learning Credit and apply this \nmoney toward the costs of their college student's education. Without \nthis help, many students from low-income families might not attend \ncollege; the Advisory Committee's report says that, because of the \nfinancial barriers, even the most highly qualified students from low-\nincome families attend college at a rate that is 20 percent lower than \nequally qualified students from the wealthiest families. For less \nqualified students, this differential is nearly 40 percent.\n  Third, the costs of higher education continue to be a burden for many \nstudents even after graduation, as their student loans come due and \nthey find a significant portion of their disposable income going to pay \ninterest on these loans. Some graduates find that, even with their \nhigher salary, they cannot afford many of the basic things they would \nlike to acquire as adults, such as home or car purchases or even \nstarting a new family. The College Tuition Assistance Act will expand \nthe current tax law in three ways to provide more help offsetting the \ninterest costs associated with repayment of student loans after \ngraduation. This bill will remove the current five year limit on \ndeductions of student loan interest, it will raise the adjusted income \nlevels so more individuals and families can qualify for this deduction, \nand it will allow the deduction to be taken for each student in the \nfamily who owes interest on college loans.\n  Finally, studies repeatedly show that the purchasing power of the \nPell grant itself has been significantly eroded. Recent reports issued \nby the College Board and the American Council on Education show that in \nacademic year 1975-1976, the maximum Pell grant covered 78 percent of \nthe price of attending a public four-year college; for the current \nacademic year, the maximum grant is enough to cover only 39 percent of \nthese costs. We must do a better job of funding this crucial assistance \nto low-income students. President Bush, during last year's campaign, \npledged to increase the maximum Pell grant for first-year students to \n$5,100 from its current level of $3,300. While many experts do not \nsupport the notion of ``front-loading'' by increasing\n\n[[Page S4950]]\n\naid only to first-year students, this was at least a significant \nproposed increase in Pell grant funding. The College Tuition Assistance \nAct will encourage meaningful increases in the maximum Pell grant by \nraising the authorization level for academic years 2001-2002 and 2002-\n2003 to $5,800.\n  A college degree is a basic necessity in our Innovation Economy and a \nfamily's financial status should not be the determining factor in \nwhether a young person joins society with the advantages of higher \neducation or not. I hope, with the support of my colleagues, that we \ncan pass the College Tuition Assistance Act in order to ease the burden \nmiddle and lower income families and their children bear on their way \nto success.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect consumers in managed care plans and in \nother health coverage; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of my colleagues \nSenator Breaux and Senator Jeffords to introduce the Bipartisan \nPatients' Bill of Rights Act of 2001. This new, balanced patients' \nrights initiative truly represents a bipartisan breakthrough in this \nongoing debate.\n  For over 5 years, we have been engaged in debate about how best to \nprotect patients in managed care plans. The time for debate and \ndiscussion is over. We need to act and to move forward to make progress \non this issue in this Congress.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is designed to do just that. \nIt builds upon, incorporates, and refines the best ideas that have been \nput forth by both Republicans and Democrats over the past few years. \nI'd like to particularly acknowledge the work of Senator Nickles, \nSenator Kennedy, and Senator Jeffords. And of Representative Norwood, \nRepresentative Dingell, Representative Thomas, Representative Boehner, \nRepresentative Shadegg, and Speaker Hastert.\n  Importantly, the legislation we are introducing today meets the \nprinciples the President outlined earlier this year, and can be signed \ninto law. Patients have waited far too long for these needed \nprotections.\n  As a physician, I am particularly gratified that the legislation we \nare introducing is being supported by a wide range of groups \nrepresenting physicians and providers, including the American College \nof Surgeons, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, the American College of \nCardiology, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the American \nSociety for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, the American Society of \nClinical Pathologists, the American Academy of Dermatology Association, \nthe American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the American \nAssociation of Neurological Surgeons, the American Urological \nAssociation, the American Society of Clinical Pathologists, the \nAmerican College of Emergency Physicians, the American Society of \nCataract and Refractive Surgery, the American Psychological \nAssociation, and the American Physical Therapy Association.\n  As others review the details of this legislation, I hope and expect \nthat support will continue to grow.\n  Let me briefly outline the highlights of our legislation.\n  The Bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 2001 protects all \nAmericans in private health plans. At the same time, it gives deference \nto the states by allowing state managed care laws to continue in force \nso long as they are consistent with our principles.\n  The bill also includes a comprehensive set of patient protections. \nFor example, it guarantees emergency coverage under a ``prudent \nlayperson'' standard. It guarantees direct access for women to OB/GYNs, \nand allows patients to choose a pediatrician as their child's primary \nhealth care provider. The legislation also bans so-called ``gag \nclauses'' in health plan contracts; prohibits discrimination against \nhealth professionals based solely on their license, guarantees access \nto needed prescription drugs that are not part of a health plan's \nformulary; and contains many other important protections.\n  Because one of the best ways to improve our health care system is to \nmake sure consumers are fully informed, the Bipartisan Patients' Bill \nof Rights Act of 2001 also requires health plans to disclose to \nenrollees extensive information about their health coverage, including \nproviding information about the new Federal rights they will be \nguaranteed as a result of this legislation.\n  The heart of the legislation is a new, independent, impartial \nexternal medical review to make sure patients can get the care they \nneed when they need it. The independent review in our bill will help \nensure that qualified doctors, not health plans, will make medical \ndecisions.\n  Importantly, the legislation includes new, expanded remedies to hold \nhealth plans accountable in federal court. As I have often said, \nlitigation should be a last resort. But when patients have been harmed \nby a health plan delay or denial of care, or where a plan refuses to \ncomply with an external review decision, patients should be allowed to \nenforce those rights in Federal court.\n  For the first time under our legislation, patients will be able to \nsue for monetary damages in federal court. Economic damages are \nunlimited. Noneconomic damages are capped at $500,000.\n  In addition, patients can go to court at any time to get the health \nbenefits they need through injunctive relief if going through the \ninternal or external review process would cause them irreparable harm.\n  While we provide important new federal legal rights, we do not \npreempt the progress states have made. Our bill expressly protects \nstate HMO liability laws and state court jurisdiction over malpractice \ncases against HMOs where health plans are making ``treatment'' or \n``health care delivery'' decisions.\n  During this time of rapidly rising health care costs, Congress must \nbe extremely careful to protect employers who voluntarily sponsor \nhealth coverage for over one hundred million Americans from the \nincreased risk of litigation simply for offering their employees \ncoverage. Our bill accomplishes this by giving employers the statutory \nright to appoint insurance carriers or third-party administrators who \nare\n\n[[Page S4952]]\n\nmaking coverage decisions as ``designated decision makers'' who may be \nsued in federal court.\n  Finally, the Bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 2001 ensures \nthat treating physicians and health professionals are not subject to \nnew, expanded liability. We make clear that doctors who are providing \ncare or treatment directly to patients cannot be ``designated decision \nmakers'' unless they agree in writing to do so and meet the bill's \nstrict solvency and financial requirements.\n  Let me again thank my cosponsors, Senators Breaux and Jeffords, for \ntheir hard work on this legislation. And let me also express my \ngratitude to the patient and provider groups who have endorsed our \nlegislation.\n  I believe this legislation can gather even more support over time, \nand become a vehicle for breaking through the gridlock and partisan \ndivisions that have prevented us from making progress during the past 5 \nyears on this issue. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nensure that we pass a bill that the President can sign into law to \nguarantee patients the protections they need.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 2001--Summary\n\n       Today, Senators Bill Frist (R-TN), John Breaux (D-LA), and \n     James Jeffords (R-VT) introduced the first bipartisan managed \n     care reform legislation in the 107th Congress that meets the \n     patient protection principles outlined by President Bush in \n     February of this year.\n       The ``Bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 2001'' \n     guarantees that all Americans covered by private health plans \n     will be protected through a new comprehensive, common-sense \n     set of patient protections guaranteed by federal law. This \n     centrist proposal builds upon and incorporates the best \n     elements of the patients' rights legislation developed during \n     the past two Congresses by both Republicans and Democrats.\n       The Bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights Act will ensure \n     that all Americans covered by private health plans get the \n     care they need and deserve by guaranteeing access to medical \n     specialists, emergency care, needed prescription drugs, \n     point-of-service coverage, and coverage for clinical trials. \n     Patients will be guaranteed access to important information \n     about their health coverage. Doctors, not health plans, will \n     make medical decisions. And, for the first time, all \n     Americans will be able to appeal health plan coverage denials \n     to independent doctors to get rapid, unbiased decisions. \n     Unlike other managed care reform proposals before Congress \n     this year, the bipartisan Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill will not \n     unnecessarily drive up consumers' health care costs, threaten \n     employers who do not make medical decisions with costly and \n     unnecessary lawsuits, or add significant bureaucratic red \n     tape to the private health care system.\n       All the protections in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bipartisan \n     ``Patients' Bill of Rights Act'' apply to all 170 million \n     Americans covered by private-sector group health plans, and \n     fully-insured state and local government plans.\n       At the same time, the legislation recognizes that the \n     federal government does not have all the answers. States will \n     play the primary role in enforcing the bill's requirements \n     with respect to health insurers and will have flexibility to \n     apply for certification from the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services (HHS) that their laws are consistent with the \n     patient protection requirements in the bill. A federal \n     advisory board would evaluate state-passed consumer \n     protections under this standard and make recommendations to \n     the Secretary of HHS.\n       If a state does not have a law, or adopt a law, consistent \n     with the new federal requirements, federal fall-back \n     legislation would apply. In this case, the U.S. Department of \n     Labor, DOL, would enforce the requirement for fully-insured \n     group health plans, about 75 million people, and HHS would \n     enforce the provision in the individual insurance market, \n     about 22 million people, and for fully-insured state and \n     local government plans, roughly 17 million people. DOL will \n     enforce all the Act's provisions with respect to self-insured \n     private group health plans (roughly 56 million people).\n       The Bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 2001 \n     includes a comprehensive set of commonsense protections to \n     ensure that patients have access to the care, treatment, and \n     information they need.\n       Patients can go the nearest hospital emergency room to get \n     the emergency care they need regardless of whether the \n     emergency room is in their health plan's network.\n       Employers that offer only closed panel health plans will be \n     required to offer a point-of-service coverage options to \n     their workers.\n       Health plans that offer obstetrician/gynecological services \n     must provide women with direct access to an OB/GYN specialist \n     for OB/GYN covered services.\n       Health plans must allow patients to choose a pediatrician \n     as their child's primary health care provider.\n       When a health care provider is terminated or leaves a \n     health plan's network, the plan must ensure that patients \n     with serious and complex illnesses, and those who are \n     receiving institutional care, may continue treatment with \n     their health care provider for up to 90 days. Health plans \n     also must guarantee that women can continue care with their \n     OB/GYN through post-pregnancy care, and for the remainder of \n     an individual's life in the case of a patient who is \n     terminally ill.\n       Health plans that provide prescription drugs through a \n     formulary must ensure that physicians and pharmacists help \n     develop and review the formulary. They also must ensure that \n     patients have access to medically-necessary prescription \n     medications that are not part of the formulary.\n       Health plans must ensure that patients receive timely \n     access to specialty medical care when needed. If a plan lacks \n     an appropriate specialist within its network, the plan must \n     guarantee access to a specialist outside the network at no \n     additional cost to the patient.\n       Health plans are required to cover routine patient costs \n     associated with participation in approved clinical trials for \n     patients who have life-threatening or serious illnesses for \n     which no standard treatment is effective.\n       Patients who need medical advice should not have to worry \n     that their doctor will be prohibited by a health plan \n     contract from discussing all possible treatment options. \n     Therefore, the legislation bans so-called ``gag rules'' in \n     providers' contracts and otherwise prevents health plans from \n     restricting health care professionals from communicating with \n     their patients about treatment options.\n       Health plans may not exclude doctors and other health \n     professionals from providing services that are covered by the \n     plan based solely on a health professional's license or \n     certification.\n       Health plans must ensure inpatient coverage for the \n     surgical treatment of breast cancer for a period of time \n     determined by a doctor, in consultation with the patient.\n       Health plans must disclose the methods they use for \n     compensating health care professionals and providers. In \n     addition, a comprehensive study is authorized to determine \n     the range of provider compensation methods and evaluate the \n     effect of such methods on provider behavior.\n       Health plans are required, on an annual basis, to provide a \n     wide range of information to enrollees about the plan's \n     coverage, including detailed descriptions of benefits and \n     cost-sharing requirements.\n       To ensure that patients' health care claims are handled \n     fairly from the outset, the legislation contains new rules \n     governing health plans' timing and handling of initial and \n     internal claims. Plans are required to expedite \n     determinations where appropriate.\n       The time frames are as follows: Routine Prior \n     Authorization: 14 business days; Expedited Prior \n     Authorization: 72 hours; Concurrent Review: 24 hours.\n       When health plans deny patients coverage based on a \n     determination that the care is not medically necessary or \n     appropriate, or that the treatment is experimental or \n     investigational, or where a claim for coverage requires an \n     evaluation of medical facts, the Bipartisan Patients' Bill of \n     Rights Act guarantees patients access to timely independent \n     medical review.\n       The legislation requires external medical review decisions \n     to be made by physicians and health care professionals \n     independent of the health plan who practice in a similar \n     specialty as the physician or professional who recommended \n     the care in the first place. In making a decision, \n     independent medical reviewers must take into account all \n     appropriate and available information, including scientific \n     and clinical evidence. Determinations are to be made without \n     deference to the plan's coverage decision and reviewers are \n     not bound by the plan's definitions of medical necessity or \n     experimental/investigational. Independent medical reviewers' \n     decisions are binding on health plans; plans must provide \n     coverage in accordance with the recommendations and time \n     frames established by the independent medical reviewer.\n       If a plan fails to comply with the decision of an \n     independent medical reviewer and a patient is harmed, the \n     legislation provides new, expanded legal remedies to hold \n     health plans accountable in federal court.\n       A new, exclusive federal legal remedy that provides \n     monetary damages will be available to participants and \n     beneficiaries in employer-sponsored health plans. This remedy \n     is available when an external medical reviewer overturns the \n     plan's decision and the patient is harmed because the plan \n     failed to exercise ordinary care in complying with the \n     external review decision. The new remedy also allows lawsuits \n     in federal court when health plans fail to exercise ordinary \n     care in denying coverage initially or upon internal review, \n     resulting in a harmful delay of coverage.\n       Patients must exhaust the external review process before \n     seeking damages in federal court. However, they may go to \n     court at any time to receive injunctive relief, i.e., the \n     court can require the health plan to approve needed care, if \n     they demonstrate that exhausting internal or external review \n     would cause irreparable harm. Patients who are harmed by a \n     plan's failure to exercise ordinary care may receive \n     unlimited economic damages in federal court. They also may be \n     awarded non-economic damages up to $500,000.\n\n[[Page S4953]]\n\n       At the same time, the legislation retains the current law \n     distinction with respect to remedies in the areas that the \n     courts have determined are traditional areas of state \n     concern, such as the ``quality of health care'' and \n     ``treatment'' standards. The bill respects and reinforces \n     state court jurisdiction over quality of care and treatment \n     claims by expressly stating that any harm resulting from \n     treatment and health care delivery activities will continue \n     to be subject to state law remedies.\n       When a patient files an appeal and the external reviewer \n     determines that the appeal is not subject to independent \n     medical review, a federal court may assess a civil penalty up \n     to $100,000 when the denial causes substantial harm to the \n     patient.\n       The Frist-Breaux-Jeffords legislation protects employers \n     who do not make medical decisions from lawsuits. The \n     legislation gives employers statutory authority to designate \n     a party or parties, such as the insurance carrier or the \n     third-party administrator that will have clear and exclusive \n     authority to make determinations that give rise to legal \n     causes of action. In a fully insured group health plan, this \n     ``designated decision-maker'' is always the insurance \n     carrier, unless the employer expressly takes back \n     responsibility from the carrier. Designated decision-makers \n     must demonstrate that they can fulfill their \n     responsibilities, including financial obligations that stem \n     from liability, by obtaining liability insurance or by \n     meeting certain capital and surplus requirements.\n       The Frist-Breaux-Jeffords legislation also helps protect \n     doctors and other health professionals from new, expanded \n     federal liability by expressly providing that health care \n     professionals who directly deliver care or treatment, or who \n     provide services to patients, can not be sued for coverage \n     decisions as designated decision-makers unless they expressly \n     agree in writing to be the designated decision-maker and meet \n     the bill's strict financial requirements. Further, insurance \n     companies may not appoint treating health professionals as \n     designated decision-makers under the bill.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with \nSenators Bill Frist and John Breaux in introducing the Bipartisan \nPatients' Bill of Rights Act of 2001, bipartisan managed care reform \nlegislation that meets the patient protection principles outlined by \nPresident Bush for a bill he would sign into law. The President's \nstrong support for our legislation is proof that he is providing the \nnecessary leadership to bring Republicans and Democrats to the table to \ndevelop managed care protections for all Americans.\n  Some believe that the answer to improving our Nation's health care \nquality is to allow greater access to the State's tort system. However, \nyou simply cannot sue your way to better health. Rather, we believe \nthat patients must get the care they need when they need it. Under the \nBipartisan Patient Bill of Rights patients have access to an \nindependent external medical review process for denials of care. \nDecisions are made by practicing physicians or professionals, \nindependent of the plan. Prevention, not litigation, is the best \nmedicine.\n  A new Federal remedy that provides damages will be available to \nAmericans in employer-sponsored health plans when an external review \nentity overturns the plan's decision and the patient is harmed. \nEmployers who do not make medical decisions are protected from \nfrivolous and unnecessary lawsuits by enabling them to legally \ndesignate a party that will have clear and exclusive authority to make \ncoverage determinations.\n  Our Bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 2001 has much in \ncommon with the managed care legislation introduced by Senators McCain, \nEdwards and Kennedy. They share provisions that provide new patient \nprotections. Each provides for information to assist consumers in \nnavigating the health care system. Most importantly, the bills provide \nfor an internal and external independent review process with strong new \nremedies when the external view process fails. Our primary area of \ndisagreement lies in the degree that employers are protected from \nmultiple causes of action in multiple venues and the provision of a \nreasonable cap on damages.\n  Fortunately, I believe we can provide the key protections that \nconsumers want at a minimal cost and without disruption of coverage, if \nwe apply these protections responsibly and where they are needed, \nwithout adding significant new costs, increasing litigation, and micro-\nmanaging health plans.\n  Our goal is to give Americans the protections they want and need in a \npackage that they can afford and that we can enact. This is why I \nbelieve the Bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 2001 represents \ntrue managed care protections that can be signed into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        DeWine, and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 890. A bill to require criminal background checks on all firearms \ntransactions occurring at events that provide a venue for the sale, \noffer for sale, transfer, or exchange of firearms, and to provide \nadditional resources for gun crime enforcement; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nfinally close what has become known as the ``gun show loophole'' and \nprovide more resources to prosecute violations of gun laws. This bill, \n``The Gun Show Loophole Closing and Gun Law Enforcement Act of 2001,'' \nstops criminals from evading a background check while respecting the \nrights of individuals who enjoy attending and purchasing firearms at \npublic gun show events and helps puts criminals who use guns behind \nbars. I am pleased to have as cosponsors Senators Lieberman, Schumer, \nDeWine, and Carper.\n  Since the Brady law went into effect, Federal law requires anyone \nbuying a gun at a gun store to undergo a background check, but the law \ndoes not apply to private individuals selling guns, such as at gun \nshows. At gun shows, both licensed and unlicensed gun sellers offer \nguns for sale. At tables operated by licensed dealers, buyers must go \nthrough a background check; at tables operated by private sellers \nfederal law requires no background check, and 32 states do not require \nsuch checks either.\n  Criminals and gun traffickers have figured this out. Gun shows are \nthe second leading source of illegal guns recovered in gun trafficking \ninvestigations. According to a recent report by Americans for Gun \nSafety, ``the states that do not require background checks at gun shows \nare flooding the rest of the nation with crime guns.'' While 95 percent \nof buyers are cleared within two hours, the 5 percent who are not are \n20 times more likely to be a prohibited purchaser. Background checks \nare an essential part of keeping guns from criminals and other \nprohibited individuals.\n  This gun show bill will require background checks at each of the \n4,500 gun shows that occur every year. It does so in a way that is \nbalanced and protects the rights of those who enjoy gun shows. It is \nthe first gun safety legislation that is genuinely bipartisan and it is \nthe only bill that creates real incentives for states to improve their \ncriminal history records in order to make the National Instant Check \nSystem, NICS, faster and more accurate. And this bill contains no \nprovisions that are designed to hurt legitimate gun show business.\n  This bill eliminates the confusing definition of previous bills and \ndefines a gun show as any event where at least 75 guns are available \nfor sale. This bill corrects a flaw in previous bills and excludes from \nbackground checks the sale of a gun either from the seller's home or to \nan immediate family member.\n  The sticking point in previous failed gun show bills was over the \nmaximum time allowed to complete a background check: 3 business days, \nwhich is current law for licensed dealers, or a shorter time due to the \ntransience of gun shows.\n  This bill creates an innovative compromise. For the first three years \nafter the bill becomes law, it extends current law to gun shows: 3 \nbusiness days. But after three years, states may apply for a waiver \nfrom the U.S. Attorney General to reduce the maximum wait to conclude a \nbackground check for sales between unlicensed individuals at gun shows \nto 24 hours, but only when that state has automated its records may a \nwaiver be granted so that a shortened time period won't allow criminals \nand other illegal buyers to get guns. It creates accountability so that \nstates can only receive this waiver when at least 95 percent of their \ndisqualifying records dating back 30 years are computerized.\n  During the first three years, three business days is the maximum time \nit can take to run a check for unlicensed sellers. If, after those \nthree business\n\n[[Page S4954]]\n\ndays the buyer has not been denied, he or she can purchase the gun. It \nis not a waiting period; if you clear the system, you immediately get \nyour gun. If, after three years, a state has sufficiently computerized \ntheir records, 24 hours is the new maximum time it can take to run a \ncheck for unlicensed sellers.\n  Background checks do not hurt gun show business in any way. For \nexample, Pennsylvania currently requires background checks for all gun \nsales and hosts the second most gun shows in the Nation, hundreds every \nyear. And unlike previous bills, this bill creates no new onerous \nreporting requirements for gun sales at gun shows but requires only the \nsame paperwork required for gun sales from a licensed gun store.\n  This bill will reduce crime by providing for tougher enforcement of \ncurrent gun laws. This bill adds new ATF agents and gun crime \nprosecutors, expands Project Exile, calls for more resources for gun \ntracing and more research into new ``smart gun\" technologies, and \nprovides much needed money for states to automate their records.\n  Recently, the States of Oregon and Colorado overwhelmingly passed \nstatewide referenda closing the gun show loophole. I wholeheartedly \nsupported those efforts. Given the overwhelming support that the people \nof these two states provided to closing the gun show loophole, I think \nit is time that we have a national requirement for background checks \nfor all sales at gun shows. In the end, it will require parity between \ngun stores and gun shows, help stop criminals from getting guns on the \nblack market, reduce the interstate trafficking of guns, and will not \nharm gun show operators.\n  I do not view my stance on the gun show loophole as inconsistent with \nmy twenty-year long Congressional voting record on gun-related issues. \nI will always be a strong defender of law-abiding Americans' Second \nAmendment rights, but with rights, come responsibilities. And we have a \nresponsibility to help keep guns out of the hands of criminals while \nprotecting the rights of honest, law-abiding citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 890\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator McCain, \nSenator DeWine, Senator Schumer, and Senator Carper in introducing this \nimportant legislation. This bill aims to build common ground on gun \nviolence, a problem that has too often divided Members of Congress. And \nwe are going to build that common ground on commonly held American \nvalues. As citizens of this great Democracy, we have rights and we have \nresponsibilities. We have the right to own guns, but we have a \nresponsibility not to sell them to criminals. That is the simple but \nimportant set of values on which the legislation we introduce today is \nfounded.\n  For several decades, our nation has had a clear policy against \nallowing convicted felons to buy guns, because we know that mixing \ncriminals and guns far too often yields violent results. Through the \nBrady law, we established what seems like an obvious corollary to that \npolicy--a requirement that those selling guns determine whether someone \ntrying to buy a firearm isn't supposed to get one before they sell it \nto them. The Brady law has been an enormous success. Since its \nenactment, background checks have kept well over half a million people \nwho by law are not allowed to own guns from getting guns, saving an \nuntold number of our citizens from the violence, injury or death the \nsale of many of these guns would have brought.\n  The Brady law, however, contained an unfortunate loophole that has \nsince been exploited to allow convicted felons and other people who \nshouldn't own guns to evade the background check requirement by buying \ntheir guns at gun shows. The problem is that Brady applies only to \nFederal Firearms Licensees, so-called FFLs, people who are in the \nbusiness of selling guns. Brady explicitly exempts from the background \ncheck requirement anyone ``who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or \npurchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or \nfor a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of \nfirearms.'' As a result, any person selling guns as a hobby or only \noccasionally, whether at a gun show, flea market or elsewhere, need not \nobtain a federal license and therefore has no obligation to conduct a \nbackground check. This means that any person wanting to avoid a \nbackground check can go to a gun show, find out which vendors are not \nFFLs, and buy a gun. And this is dangerous not only because it allows \nconvicted felons and other prohibited persons to buy guns, but also \nbecause, in contrast to FFLs, non-FFLs have no obligation to keep \nrecords of the transaction, thereby depriving law enforcement of the \nability to trace the gun if it later turns up at a crime scene.\n  Our bill will change that. We will make sure that no one will be able \nto buy a gun at a gun show without it\n\n[[Page S4957]]\n\nfirst being determined whether that person is a convicted felon or is a \nmember of one of the other categories of people we all agree should not \nbe allowed to buy guns.\n\n  Senator McCain and I have heard the concerns expressed about past \nproposals to close the gun show loophole, and we have tried hard in our \nbill to make sure those concerns are addressed.\n  First, our bill has a simple definition of a gun show, an event where \n75 or more guns are offered or exhibited for sale--and we make clear \nthat that definition doesn't include sales from a private collection by \nnonlicensed sellers out of their homes.\n  Second, to respond to the argument that previous proposals made it \ntoo difficult for nonlicensed sellers to fulfill the background check \nrequirement, our bill makes sure that nonlicensed sellers will have \neasy access to someone who can initiate background checks for them, by \ncreating a new class of licensee whose sole purpose will be to initiate \nbackground checks at gun shows.\n  Third, we have tried to respond to those who say that a three-day \ncheck is too long for gun shows, because those events only last a \ncouple of days. It is worth noting that the length allowed for the \ncheck doesn't affect the majority of gun purchasers, because 72 percent \nof checks are completed within 30 seconds and almost 95 percent are \ndone within two hours. We have come up with a compromise that \nauthorizes a State to move to a 24-hour check for nonlicensed dealers \nat gun shows--when the State can prove that a 24-hour check is \nfeasible. A State can prove that by showing that 95 percent of the \nrecords that would disqualify people in that State from buying guns are \ncomputerized and searchable by the NICS system.\n  Now I know that there are many, including President Bush, who argue \nthat what we need to solve the gun violence problem are not new laws \nbut the enforcement of existing ones. I agree with part of that \nstatement. Our bill authorizes significant increases in funding for a \nnumber of gun enforcement programs, including state and local gun crime \nprosecutors, Project Exile, additional ATF agents, gun tracing and \nsmart gun technology. I am pleased that the President said yesterday \nthat he supported a large chunk of what we are proposing today.\n  But I believe we must go farther than that, because we will never be \nable to enforce existing laws unless we close the loopholes in them \nthat criminals exploit. And we all know that there is a big loophole in \nthe provision saying that felons aren't supposed to buy guns, and that \nis that criminals know that if they go to a gun show, they will be able \nto avoid the background check that was set up to keep them from getting \nguns.\n  Gun crime remains a critical public safety problem. For too long, it \nhas unnecessarily divided the Congress, and the American people have \nbeen left to suffer the violent consequences. But the reality is that \nmost of us agree on most of the critical questions. We agree that the \nlaws on the books should be enforced, that the rights of law-abiding \ngun owners should be protected, and that convicted felons shouldn't be \nable to get guns. The bill we are introducing today would write those \nprinciples into law. I hope all of my colleagues support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 891. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act with respect to \nextensions of credit to consumers under the age of 21; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to help avoid the growing problem of credit card indebtedness.\n  This legislation is fairly straightforward. It would not prohibit \npeople younger than 21 from obtaining a credit card. It simply requires \nthat when issuing credit cards to persons under the age of 21, the \nissuers obtain an application that contains: 1. the signature of a \nparent, guardian, or other qualified individual willing to take \nfinancial responsibility for the debt; or 2. information indicating \nthat the young person has a job or some means of repaying any credit \nextended; or 3. proof that applicant has completed a certified credit \ncounseling course.\n  One of the most troubling developments in the hotly contested battle \nbetween credit card issuers to sign up new customers has been the \naggressive way in which they have targeted people under the age of 21, \nparticularly college students.\n  Solicitations to this age group have become more intense for a \nvariety of reasons. First, it is one of the few market segments in \nwhich there are always new customers to go after; every year, 25 to 30 \npercent of undergraduates are fresh faces entering their first year of \ncollege.\n  Second, it is also an age group in which brand loyalty can be readily \nestablished. In the words of one major credit card issuer: ``We are in \nthe relationship business, and we want to build relationships early \non.'' In fact, most people hold on to their first credit card for up to \n15 years.\n  Many, if not most, credit card issuers exercise prudence in issuing \ncards to young people. But some credit card issuers do not. They target \nvulnerable young people in our society and extend them large amounts of \ncredit with little if any consideration to whether or not there is a \nreasonable expectation of repayment. As a result, more and more young \npeople are falling into a financial hole from which they were unable to \nescape.\n  Experts estimate that the current economic downturn could force a \nrecord 1.5 million Americans into bankruptcy this year. About a third \nof them will be in their 20s and early 30s. According to the American \nBankruptcy Institute, just five years ago, only 1 percent of personal \nbankruptcies filed were by those age 25 or younger. By 1998, that \nnumber had risen to nearly 5 percent.\n  Financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, have stated that loans made \nwithout consideration of the borrower's ability to repay constitutes an \n``unsafe and unsound'' business practice. They have criticized such \nlending practices as ``imprudent.'' Thus, an economic downturn coupled \nwith ``imprudent'' lending practices could have a devastating effect \nnot only on credit card consumers, but on financial institutions, as \nwell.\n\n  The business practices of many credit card companies on college \ncampuses are extremely troubling. Some credit card issuers actively \nentice colleges and universities to help promote their products. \nAccording to University of Houston Professor Robert Manning, during the \nnext five years, banks will pay the largest 250 universities nearly $1 \nbillion annually for exclusive marketing rights on campus.\n  A recent ``60 Minutes II'' piece vividly illustrated the impact that \ncredit card debt can have on college students. A crew form the show, on \na major public university campus, and with the use of hidden cameras, \nfilmed vendors pushing free T-shirts, hats, and other enticements with \ncredit card applications. ``60 Minutes II'' revealed that this \nuniversity is being paid $13 million over ten years by a credit card \ncompany for the right to have a presence on campus and use the \nuniversity logo on its cards.\n  This public university is making money off students who use these \ncredit cards, the report said. As part of the agreement, the university \nreceives 0.4 percent of each purchase made with the cards. In a sense, \nthis university has a vested interest in getting their students in as \nmuch debt as possible.\n  The ``60 Minutes II'' piece also told the story of one student, Sean \nMoyer, and his desperate attempts to handle massive credit card debt. \nThis student's life began to spin out of control as the huge debts he \nracked up in just three years of college began to become, in his mind, \ninsurmountable. As a result of mounting credit card debts, he was \nunable to get loans to go to law school like he dreamed, and his \nparents could not afford to pay his way. So in February 1998, Sean took \nhis own life.\n  ``It is obscene that the university is making money off the suffering \nof their students,'' said Sean Moyer's mother. Sean Moyer had 12 credit \ncards and more than $10,000 in debts when he committed suicide nearly \nthree years ago, she related. He had two jobs: one at the library and \nanother as a security guard at a local hotel, but he still could not \npay his collectors, she said.\n  Even three years after her son's death, she still gets pre-approved \ncredit\n\n[[Page S4958]]\n\ncard offers in Sean's name from some of the same companies that he owed \nthousands of dollars. One company pre-approved Sean for a $100,000 \ncredit line, she said.\n  Last Congress, I went to the main campus of the University of \nConnecticut to meet with student leaders about this issue; quite \nhonestly, I was surprised at the amount of solicitations going on in \nthe student union. I was even more surprised at the degree to which the \nstudents themselves were concerned about the constant barrage of offers \nthey were receiving.\n  These offers seem very attractive. One student intern in my office \nreceived four solicitations in just two weeks, one promised ``eight \ncheap flights while you still have 18 weeks of vacation.'' Another \npromised a platinum card with what appeared to be a low interest rate, \nuntil one reads in the fine print that it applied only to balance \ntransfers, not to the account overall. Only one of the four offered a \nbrochure about credit terms but, in doing so, also offered a ``spring \nbreak sweepstakes.''\n\n  Last year, the Chicago Tribune reported that the average college \nfreshman will receive 50 solicitations during their ``first few \nmonths'' at college. It further reported that ``college students get \ngreen-lighted for a line of credit that can reach more than $10,000, \njust on the strength of a signature and a student ID.''\n  There is a serious public policy question about whether people in \nthis age bracket can be presumed to be able to make the sensible \nfinancial choices that are being forced upon them from this barrage of \nmarketing.\n  While it is very difficult to get reliable information from credit \ncard issuers about their marketing practices to people under the age of \n21, the statistics that are available are disconcerting.\n  Nellie Mae, a major student loan provider in New England, conducted a \nrecent survey of the students who had applied for student loans. It \ntermed the results ``alarming.'' The study found: 78 percent of all \nundergraduate students have a least one credit card--up from 67 percent \nin 1998; of those students, the average credit card balance is $2,748, \nup from $1,879 in 1998; and 32 percent of undergraduates had four or \nmore credit cards.\n  Some college administrators, bucking the trend to use credit card \nissuers as a source of income, have become so concerned that they have \nbanned credit card companies from their campuses, and have even gone so \nfar as to ban credit card advertisements from the campus bookstore. \nRecently, colleges around the nation, ranging from New York's SUNY \nBuffalo to Georgia Tech in Atlanta, have begun to ban the marketing of \ncredit cards on their campuses.\n  Let me touch on an important component of this amendment--credit \ncounseling. Much as we encourage children who reach driving age to take \ndrivers' education courses to prevent automobile accidents, we should \nteach younger consumers the basics of credit to avoid financial wrecks. \nEducating our nation's youth about the responsibilities of financial \nmanagement is critical, and we do not currently do a good enough job in \nthis area.\n  While there is overwhelming evidence that student debt is \nskyrocketing, most surveys also show that this same group of consumers \nis woefully uninformed about basic credit card terms and issues.\n  According to the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy, \na nonprofit group which conducts an annual national survey on high \nschool seniors' knowledge of personal finance, basic financial skills \nare even poorer today than they were three years ago.\n  I agree with those who argue that there are many millions of people \nunder the age of 21 who hold full time jobs and are as deserving of \ncredit as anyone over the age of 21. I also agree that students should \ncontinue to have access to credit and that we should not try to \nprohibit the market from making that credit available.\n  However, the period of time from 18 to 21 is an age of transition \nfrom adolescence to adulthood. As we do in many other places in the \nfederal law, some extra care is needed to make sure that mistakes made \nfrom youthful inexperience do not haunt these young people for the rest \nof their lives.\n  Federal law already says that people under the age of 21 shouldn't \ndrink alcohol. Our tax code makes the presumption that if someone is a \nfull-time student under the age of 23, they are financially dependent \non their parents or guardians.\n  Is it so much to ask that credit card issuers find out if someone \nunder the age of 21 is financially capable of paying back the debt? Or \nthat their parents are willing to assume financial responsibility? Or \nthat they understand the nature and conditions of the debt they are \nincurring?\n  Many responsible credit card issuers already require this information \nin one form or another. Is it too much to ask that the entire credit \ncard industry strive to meet their own best practices when it comes to \nour kids?\n  Providing fair access to credit is something I have fought for \nthroughout my tenure in the United States Senate. And credit cards play \na valuable role in assisting in their pursuit of the American dream. I \ndo not believe that this legislation is either unduly burdensome on the \ncredit card industry or unfair to people under the age of 21.\n  The fact of the matter is that excessive solicitations assume that if \nthe young adult is unable to pay, they will be bailed out by their \nparents. Many times this means that parents must sacrifice other things \nin order to make sure that their child does not start out their adult \nlife in a financial hole or with an ugly black mark on their credit \nhistory.\n  This measure is critical to ensuring that credit cards are both \nissued and used responsibly. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a letter of \nendorsement from Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America, \nand the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, as well as referenced \nnewspaper articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill and additional material were \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 891\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In the alternative, a credit \n     card could be issued to a student who completes a credit-\n     counseling course. This is a reasonable approach--to protect \n     the safety and soundness of financial institutions and help \n     American's youth who every day face aggressive marketing \n     tactics from the credit industry.\n       According to bank regulatory agencies, including the \n     Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation, making loans without any regard for the \n     borrower's ability to repay, as card issuers do with college \n     students, is ``unsafe and unsound.'' The regulators have \n     criticized such lending practices as ``imprudent.'' The \n     student loan corporation, Nellie Mae, said in a recent report \n     that the increase in the number of students having a credit \n     card includes students who would not have been given credit \n     cards in past year, certainly not without a co-signer. The \n     report also pointed to the need for counseling students at \n     the front end--before the student obtains a credit card. \n     Nellie Mae found that: Some students unwittingly accumulate \n     credit card debt, not consciously planning ahead whether they \n     can afford to borrow that sum, and not aware of the actual \n     finance charges they will pay over time. Having a card \n     doesn't necessarily indicate knowledge about the \n     ramifications of borrowing in general; nor does it show that \n     the student has evaluated the benefit and costs of borrowing \n     with a credit card vs. other types of financing. Without \n     assistance, these students may not have the know-how to \n     borrow wisely on the front end.\n       The credit card industry has targeted America's youth with \n     relentless marketing ploys and tactics that seem designed to \n     drive those students into debt. According to Nellie Mae, more \n     than 70 percent of undergraduates possess at least one credit \n     card. The average debt for undergraduates who do not pay off \n     their bill every month is more than $2,000. Many students end \n     up dropping out of school under the weight of such debt. \n     Congress should respond to this growing crisis on college \n     campuses. And the problem could get worse as high school \n     students are also receiving credit card offers.\n       Many colleges and universities not only permit aggressive \n     credit card marketing on campus; they actually benefit \n     financially from this marketing. Credit card issuers pay \n     institutions for sponsorship of school programs, for support \n     of student activities, for rental of on-campus solicitation \n     tables, and for exclusive marketing agreements, such as \n     college ``affinity'' cards.\n       Congress should require lending institutions to act in a \n     safe and sound manner by verifying that the person to whom \n     that credit card issuer is extending credit has the ability \n     to repay. In the absence of acting in a safe and sound \n     manner, the least that could be done is to give student's \n     some of the tools that could be useful in avoiding financial \n     trouble through credit counseling at the front end. The \n     Senate should pass the Underage Consumer Credit Protection \n     Act to preserve the soundness of our financial institutions \n     and help America's youth handle the aggressive credit card \n     industry practices.\n     Frank Torres,\n       Consumers Union.\n     Travis Plunkett,\n       Consumer Federation of America.\n     Ed Mierzwinski,\n       U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, May 7, 1999]\n\n   Charged With Teaching Young People To Save; Educational Campaign \n Attempts To Give Students Basic Financial Survival Skills, Including \n                            Handling Credit\n\n                           (By Humberto Cruz)\n\n       It should come as no surprise. Forty percent of American \n     students between the ages of 16 and 22 said they are likely \n     to buy a pair of jeans or something similar they ``really'' \n     like even if they are short of money.\n       And 22 percent would pay for it with a credit card.\n       But then, isn't that what they see their parents do? Deeper \n     in debt then ever before, Americans owe a record $565 billion \n     on credit cards, or more than $7,000 per balance-revolving \n     household, based on figures from the Federal Reserve.\n       ``We have an economy that encourages people to borrow and \n     spend more than they have,'' said Dallas L. Salisbury, \n     chairman and CEO of the American Savings Education Council in \n     Washington, D.C.\n       Salisbury is talking about the barrage directed at all of \n     us to spend, spend, spend. The enticing offers to sign up for \n     home-equity loans greater than the value of our homes. The \n     culture of instant gratification that demands that if you \n     want something you get it now, and damn the consequences.\n       ``We need to teach our kids very early on how skeptical \n     they should be of this type of thing,'' Salisbury said. ``And \n     how dangerous it is to get yourself buried in debt.''\n       Reaching young people is the goal for the coming year of \n     the ``Facts on Savings and Investing'' campaign, launched in \n     1998 by a national partnership of government agencies, \n     securities regulators and business, education and consumer \n     groups.\n       ``We asked ourselves what our priorities should be, and one \n     thing that has come down loud and clear is the necessity to \n     get many people to start saving early,'' said Salisbury, who \n     is also president and CEO of the Employee Benefit Research \n     Institute in Washington.\n       As part of the campaign, the savings council and the \n     institute released a ``Youth & Money'' survey of 560 high \n     school and 440 college students conducted by the research \n     firm Mathew Greenwald & Associates.\n       The survey found that most students feel confident they \n     understand financial matters. But their behavior suggests \n     they don't know nearly as much as they think, and that many \n     are falling into bad habits.\n       For example, less than half save at least something \n     whenever they receive money or get paid, only 23 percent draw \n     up a monthly budget and stick to it, and 28 percent of those \n     with credit cards roll over debt month after month.\n       Perhaps more telling, one-fourth of the students who think \n     they do a good job of managing their money do not think \n     regular savings is a very high priority, when in fact it \n     should be.\n       And 25 percent of the students with credit cards who say \n     they do a good job of managing their money roll over debt \n     every month, one of the worst financial habits anybody can \n     have.\n       ``One has to presume they are influenced just by watching \n     their parents,'' Salisbury said. ``They end up `learning' \n     things they would be better off not to learn.''\n       But if parents can't or won't help, what is the solution? \n     The survey showed an overwhelming majority of students, or 94 \n     percent, go first to their parents for financial information \n     and advice. Only 21 percent had taken a financial education \n     course in school, although 62 percent had the chance to do \n     so.\n       Among those who did, 41 percent said they began saving, 28 \n     percent said they increased their savings, 28 percent said \n     they invested their savings differently, and 19 percent said \n     they developed a budget. The Youth & Money survey, however, \n     questions whether the students actually changed their \n     behavior as opposed to just saying they did.\n       Still, Salisbury is among a big majority of Americans--\n     count me in, too--who believe financial education should be \n     mandatory in high school. A recent nationwide survey by the \n     National Council on Economic Education found that 96 percent \n     of adults believe basic economics should be a required part \n     of the high school curriculum.\n       Currently, 38 of the 50 states have adopted guidelines for \n     teaching economics in high school, but only 16 mandate that \n     schools offer a course and just 13 require that students take \n     the course. Even in those states, more needs to be done, and \n     is being done, to train teachers and incorporate more basic \n     financial literacy concepts in the course.\n       ``They all should do it,'' Salisbury said. ``If we require \n     students to take English and to take history to graduate, we \n     should require that they learn basic financial survival \n     skills.''\n       If they all did, maybe the students could then educate \n     their parents on the basics of budgeting and handling credit. \n     Then saving and investing would not be a subject that 30 \n     percent of parents never discuss with their children, \n     according to the Youth & Money survey.\n       ``What's most effective is for students to take what they \n     learn in school about finance and discuss it with their \n     parents,'' said Paul Yakoboski, director of research for the \n     savings council.\n\n\n             teens able to calculate how savings can add up\n\n       Would you shell out $4,700 for a pair of sneakers? How \n     about $2,800 for a computer game or $300 for a fast-food \n     meal?\n       The sums may sound outlandishly high, but that is how much \n     a 13-year-old could save if he invested for retirement, \n     rather than spending $75 for a pair of sneakers, $45 for a \n     computer game and $5 for a fast-food meal, according to ``AIE \n     Savings Calculator,'' which was launched recently on the Web \n     at www.investoreducation.org by the non-profit Alliance for \n     Investor Education.\n       The calculator allows a child to enter his or her age, a \n     typical purchase or any dollar amount, and then see how much \n     the money might be worth if it was invested for 10 years, 25 \n     years and to the age of retirement. The calculator is based \n     on an 8 percent annual rate of growth, a stock market average \n     in recent years.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Feb. 13, 2001]\n\n                     Debt Smothers Young Americans\n\n                          (By Christine Dugas)\n\n       For many living in a world of easy credit, digging out of \n     debt can become a way of life: 18- to 35-year-olds often live \n     paycheck to paycheck, using credit for restaurant meals and \n     high-tech toys. A news study says the average undergrad now \n     owes $2,748 on credit cards.\n       As a freshman at the University of Houston in 1995, \n     Jennifer Massey signed up for a credit card and got a free T-\n     shirt. A year later, she had piled up about $20,000 on debt \n     on 14 credit cards.\n       Paige Hall, 34, returned from her honeymoon in 1997 to find \n     herself laid off from her\n\n[[Page S4960]]\n\n     job at a mortgage company in Atlanta. She was out of work for \n     4 months. She and her husband, Kevin, soon were trying to \n     figure out how to pay $18,200 in bills from their wedding, \n     honeymoon and furnishings for their new home.\n       By the time Mistie Medendorp was 29, she had $10,000 in \n     credit card debt and $12,000 in student loans.\n       Like no other generation, today's 18- to 35-year-olds have \n     grown up with a culture of debt--a product of easy credit, a \n     booming economy and expensive lifestyles.\n       They often live paycheck to paycheck and use credit cards \n     and loans to finance restaurant meals, high-tech toys and new \n     cars that they couldn't otherwise afford, according to market \n     researchers, debt counselors and consumer advocates.\n       ``Lenders are much more willing to take a risk on people \n     under 25 than they were 15 years ago,'' says Nina Prikazsky, \n     a vice president at student loan corporation Nellie Mae. \n     ``They will give out credit cards based on a college \n     student's expected ability to repay the bills.''\n       Young people are taking advantage of the offers. A study \n     out today from Nellie Mae shows that the average credit card \n     debt among undergraduate students increased by nearly $1,000 \n     in the past two years. On average, they owed $2,748 last \n     year, up from $1,879 in 1998.\n       At a time when they could be setting aside money for a down \n     payment on a home, many young people are mortgaging their \n     financial future. Instead of getting a head start on saving \n     for retirement, they are spending years digging themselves \n     out of debt.\n       ``I knew for a while that I had a problem. I wouldn't say I \n     was living high on the hog, but when I wanted clothes, I'd \n     buy a new outfit,'' says Medendorp, an Atlanta resident. \n     ``I'd go out to eat and charge it on my cards. There were a \n     bunch of small expenses that added up and got out of \n     control.''\n       Massey, Hall and Medendorp each ended up seeking help from \n     a local consumer credit counseling service. Hundreds of \n     thousands more young people like them are turning to credit \n     counseling or bankruptcy because they can no longer juggle \n     their bills.\n       In 1999 alone, an estimated 461,000 Americans younger than \n     35 sought protection from their creditors in bankruptcy, up \n     from about 380,000 in 1991, according to Harvard Law School \n     professor Elizabeth Warren, principal researcher in a \n     national survey of debtors who filed for bankruptcy.\n       At the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater \n     Denver, more than half of all the clients are 18 to 35 years \n     old, says Darrin Sandoval, director of operations. On \n     average, they have 30% more debt than all other age groups, \n     he says.\n       ``By the time they begin to settle into a suburban \n     lifestyle, they are barely able to meet their debt \n     obligations,'' Sandoval says. ``If there is a job loss, an \n     unexpected medical expense or the birth of a child, they \n     supplement their income with credit cards. Soon they are \n     being financially crushed.''\n\n\n                               Debt heads\n\n       Unlike the baby boom generation--raised by Depression-era \n     parents--young Americans today are often unfazed by the \n     amount of debt they carry.\n       ``This generation has lived through a time when everything \n     was on the upswing,'' says J. Walker Smith, president of \n     Yankelovich Partners, a market research firm. ``There is no \n     sense of worry about being over-leveraged. It all seems to \n     work out.''\n       Kevin Jackson, a 32-year-old software engineer in Denver, \n     has about $8,000 in credit card debt and a $20,000 home-\n     equity loan. He doesn't believe he has a debt problem, though \n     his goal is to reduce his credit card balance to $2,000.\n       ``You learn to live with a certain amount of debt,'' he \n     says. ``It's a means to an end. There is something to be said \n     for paying for everything and something to be said for \n     enjoying life, as long as you do it responsibly.''\n       Unfortunately, enjoying life can be expensive, especially \n     for many young Americans who feel it is essential to have the \n     latest high-tech products and services, such as a cellphone, \n     pager, voice mail, a computer with a second phone line or a \n     DSL connection, an Internet service provider and a Palm \n     Pilot.\n       Jackson just bought a DVD player and a big-screen TV. ``I \n     try to control costs,'' he says. ``I easily could have spent \n     $5,000 on the TV, but instead I paid $2,000 and I got a one-\n     year, no-interest deal.''\n       Movies, TV shows and advertising only reinforce the idea \n     that young people are entitled to have an affluent lifestyle. \n     ``We're encouraged to overspend,'' says Jason Anthony, 31, \n     co-author of Debt-free by 30, a book he wrote with a friend \n     after they found themselves drowning in debt.\n       ``We all see shows like Melrose Place and Beverly Hills \n     90210. It creates tremendous pressure to keep up. I'm one of \n     the few persons who think a recession will be good for my \n     generation. Our expectations are so elevated. In the frenzy \n     to keep up, we've gotten into financial trouble,'' he says.\n\n\n                         The perils of plastic\n\n       Consumers like Massey, who get bogged down in credit card \n     debt before they even graduate from college, learn the hard \n     way about managing money. Now 24 and married, Massey has a \n     good job in marketing. She has cut up her credit cards and is \n     gradually repaying her debts. However, there have been \n     consequences: She had to explain to her boss that because she \n     no longer has a credit card, she cannot travel for work if it \n     involves renting a car or booking a hotel reservation on her \n     own. She had to tell her husband about her debt problems \n     before they were married.\n       ``I lack confidence now,'' Massey says. ``I'm hard on \n     myself because of my mistakes. But I blame the credit card \n     companies and the university for allowing them to promote the \n     cards on campus without educating students about credit.''\n       The percentage of undergraduate college students with a \n     credit card jumped from 67% in 1998 to 78% last year, \n     according to the Nellie Mae study. And many of them are \n     filing their wallets with cards. Last year, 32% said they had \n     four or more cards, up from 27% two years earlier.\n       Although graduate students have an even bigger appetite for \n     credit, they are starting to show signs of restraint. Their \n     average debt declined slightly from $4,925 in 1998 to $4,776 \n     last year, Nellie Mae says.\n       Many young people will be saddled with credit card debts \n     for years, experts say. Among all age groups, credit card \n     holders younger than 35 are the least likely to pay their \n     bills in full each month, according to Robert Manning, author \n     of Credit Card Nation.\n       Though credit cards and uncontrolled spending are a \n     combustible combination, many young people are pushed to the \n     financial edge by the staggering cost of college. The average \n     annual tuition at a four-year private university jumped to \n     $16,332 last year from $7,207 in 1980, according to the \n     College Board. Between 1991 and 2000, the average student \n     loan burden among households under 35 inreased nearly 142% to \n     $15,700, according to an exclusive analysis of the finances \n     of 18- to 34-year-olds for USA TODAY by Claritas, a market \n     research firm based in San Diego.\n       Those who choose to go on and get a graduate degree pay an \n     even higher price. Another Nellie Mae study found that those \n     who borrow for graduate work, and specifically those in \n     expensive professional programs in law and medicine, are \n     likely to have unusually high debt burdens that are not \n     always offset by comparably high salaries.\n       Karen Mann didn't need a survey to come to that conclusion. \n     Her husband, Michael, is about to start his career as an \n     orthopedic surgeon after racking up $400,000 in loans during \n     four years of undergraduate school, four years of medical \n     school, one year in an MBA program and a 5-year residency \n     program.\n       During his residency and a subsequent fellowship, payments \n     and some of the interest on his student loan have been \n     deferred. Soon they'll have to begin paying them off.\n       The interest payment alone is $20,000 a year.\n       The Manns are not extravagant, ``I've always saved, and I \n     have a budget,'' says Karen, 31. ``I'd love to buy a house, \n     but there's no way. We haven't been able to afford kids yet. \n     The loans are so awesome that you do get crazy.''\n\n\n                    paying for everything with cash\n\n       The Manns are not alone in having to defer important goals \n     because of heavy debt loads. Medendorp, a social worker in \n     Decatur, Ga., lives on a budget and is diligently paying her \n     bills with the help of a Consumer Credit Counseling Service \n     debt-management plan. She pays for everything with cash. \n     There are many things she'd like to do but can't afford, such \n     as having laser eye surgery, going back to school and buying \n     a home.\n       ``When you get in a tar pit, forget about buying a home,'' \n     author Anthony says. ``Instead of saving for a down payment, \n     you're making credit card payments.''\n       At a time when the overall U.S. homeownership rate has \n     risen to historic highs, young Americans are less likely than \n     people their age 10 years ago to buy a home. The \n     homeownership rate for heads of households younger than 35 \n     had declined from 41.2% in 1982 to 39.7% in 1999, according \n     to the Census Bureau. And if they own a home, young people \n     tend to make smaller down payments or borrow against what \n     equity they have. As a result, the average amount of equity \n     accumulated by homeowners younger than 35 has shrunk to about \n     $49,200 in 1999, from $57,100 10 years earlier, according to \n     a study from the Consumer Federation of America.\n       ``For middle-income Americans, the most important form of \n     private savings is home equity,'' says Stephen Brobeck, \n     executive director of the Consumer Federation of America. \n     ``It's essential to have paid off a mortgage by retirement so \n     that living expenses are lower and one has an asset that can \n     be borrowed on or sold if necessary.''\n       By almost every measure, young people are falling behind. \n     Between 1995 and 1998, the median net worth of families rose \n     for all age groups except for the under-35 group. Their \n     median net worth declined from $12,700 to $9,000, according \n     to the Federal Reserve.\n       That is not to say that young people today are slackers and \n     deadbeats, as they have sometimes been characterized. Many \n     work hard and often make good incomes. Although they may have \n     a lot of debt, they also are very focused on saving and \n     investing, especially through 401(k)-type retirement \n     accounts. Jackson, for example, contributes the maximum to \n     his 401(k) plan.\n       ``They want to protect themselves against future \n     uncertainty,'' Smith says. ``They absolutely don't expect \n     that Social Security will be around for them.''\n       But it's hard to save money if you are head over heels in \n     debt. Massey earns $32,000 a\n\n[[Page S4961]]\n\n     year. With her husband, their annual income is more than \n     $100,000. ``But we're still broke trying to pay our bills,'' \n     she says.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 892. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to phase out the use of \nmethyl tertiary butyl ether in fuels of fuel additives, to promote the \nuse of renewable fuels, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today legislation \ndesigned to address the extensive problems that have been caused by the \ngasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, MTBE, to make \nappropriate revisions to the reformulated gasoline, RFG, program in the \nClean Air Act, and to increase greatly the use of renewable motor \nvehicle fuels. The bill is similar to legislation I introduced in the \nprevious Congress.\n  We have to get MTBE out of our gasoline. This is absolutely clear. \nEven in Iowa, where we are not required to have oxygenated fuels or \nRFG, a recent survey found a surprising level of water contamination \nwith MTBE. So my legislation requires a phased reduction in the use of \nMTBE in motor fuel and then a prohibition of MTBE in fuel or fuel \nadditives beginning three years after enactment.\n  My legislation recognizes the benefits that have been provided by the \noxygen content requirement in the reformulated gasoline program. Oxygen \nadded to gasoline reduces emissions of carbon monoxide, toxic compounds \nand fine particulate matter. So my legislation continues the oxygen \ncontent requirement, but it would allow, in certain circumstances upon \na proper showing, averaging of the oxygen content requirement over a \nperiod of time up to a year.\n  The legislation also ensures that all health benefits of the \nreformulated gasoline program are maintained and improved, and includes \nvery strong provisions to ensure that there is no backsliding in air \nquality and health benefits from cleaner burning reformulated gasoline. \nThe petroleum companies would also be prohibited from taking the \npollutants from gasoline in some areas and putting them back into \ngasoline in other areas of the country that are not subject to the more \nstringent air quality standards. Those are referred to as the anti-\ndumping protections. My bill places tighter restrictions on highly \npolluting aromatic and olefin content of reformulated gasoline.\n  My legislation also recognizes the important role of renewable fuels \nin improving our environment, building energy security for out nation, \nand increasing farm income, economic growth and job creation, \nespecially in rural areas. The legislation creates a national renewable \ncontent requirement for motor vehicle fuel. The requirement would not \nbe a mandate that any particular user of gasoline or diesel fuel has to \nuse the renewable fuel, but it would require the petroleum industry to \nensure that renewable fuels make up a certain minimum percentage of the \ntotal U.S. supply of motor vehicle fuel, gasoline and diesel fuel. By \n2011, that percentage would be about 5 percent on a volume basis, 3.3 \npercent based on energy content or approximately 10 billion gallons \nbased on current estimates of gasoline and diesel consumption.\n  Overall, this legislation will get MTBE out of gasoline, maintain and \nimprove the air quality and health benefits of the reformulated \ngasoline program and the Clean Air Act, and put our nation on a solid \npath toward greater use of renewable fuels.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 892\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, we have several important amendments \npending, but I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the very \nheart of the bill: Accountability and assessments. I believe the bill \nbefore us is the most dramatic reform of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act since 1965. I would like everyone to understand what is \nin this bill so they can understand how dramatic an impact it will have \nupon every school in this Nation.\n  For the first time, we will require all children in grades 3-8 to be \nannually assessed, and that schools, districts, and States will face \nconsequences if they fail to improve the performance of their students.\n  Each year--year in, year out--every level of education will be held \naccountable for showing measurable progress for each group of students \nthey serve. This is the central feature of the legislation, and yet, to \njudge from press reports and editorials, it is very poorly understood.\n  I want to do what I can this evening to make sure it is widely \nunderstood in this Nation how dramatic the changes are for which we are \nabout to vote.\n  I am not probably known for unwavering support for the President's \nagenda, nor, I hope, am I known for going out of my way to criticize \nthe press. But I rise today both to defend the President and to suggest \nthat the press has been sloppy in its reporting and editorial writing \non what should be the central issue of the story, education reform.\n  For the past week or two, there have been a few press accounts and \neditorials implying that somehow the President or the Senate has caved \nto pressure, has watered down the standards in this bill, or has walked \naway from real reform.\n  In fairness to the press, I realize this is a difficult subject to \ncover. The topic can be a bit dense, and there is no real bright line \nas to the kind of progress we can expect from students and schools.\n  On Thursday, the lead editorial in USA Today read: ``Congress Set to \nDilute Education Reform,'' while the subhead read: ``Lawmakers gut \nschool accountability, turn backs on minorities.''\n  That editorial is but one example of what I think is the lack of \nunderstanding about this bill, especially, it seems, in the press. And \nwhile my opinion, of course, is just that, it is based on a wealth of \ndata that can be verified independently. Not only do I think it can be \nverified, I think it is the obligation of the press to do so before it \nmakes value-laden judgments.\n  In order to understand where we are, a bit of background is \nnecessary. The major education proposals before the Congress have at \ntheir core the requirement that States and schools set high standards \nin core subject matters and that they measure whether students are \nachieving those standards; further, that we pay particular attention to \nthe progress of our lowest-achieving students. In other words, we are \ngoing to look at the groups of students, as well as the students on a \ngeneral basis, to make sure that no child is left behind.\n  As reported from committee, both H.R. 1 and S. 1 contain the notion \nthat all students would be proficient in math and reading in 10 years \nand that a school or school district or State that failed to meet this \nstandard would be deemed to have failed--let me repeat that--and that a \nschool or school district or State that failed to meet this standard \nwould be deemed to have failed.\n  Further, progress in meeting this goal would be monitored on an \nannual basis. If a school or district or State failed to make the so-\ncalled adequate yearly progress--a term I will use over and over again, \n``adequate yearly progress,'' or, for short, AYP--it would be \nidentified as needing school improvement--another phrase to remember--\nor subject to sanctions if improvement efforts failed.\n  The concept of AYP is an important one because adequate yearly \nprogress is the bar for judging whether a school or district or State \nhas succeeded or failed.\n  Legislating that all students should be proficient in 10 years is a \nwonderful goal, and perhaps for this reason none of us really gave it \nmuch thought. Having been involved in the passage of the Goals 2000 Act \nsome years ago, having served on the national goals panel, I must \nconfess that I have become a little wiser about our ability to achieve \nwonderful goals.\n\n  For my colleagues who may not be familiar with the Goals 2000 Act, in \nit we codified very ambitious goals that we hoped to achieve by the \nyear 2000. For example, back in 1994, we called for our students to be \nfirst in the world in math and science--that was a big goal, a goal \nthat we are so far from having fulfilled--and that all students leaving \n4th, 8th, and 12th grades would do so with demonstrated competency in \nchallenging subject matter, including English, math, science, foreign \nlanguage, and so on, all by the year 2000.\n  Well, 2000 has come and gone. In my view, we have made only limited \nprogress in reaching those goals. We have a long way to go, especially \nin these goals directly relating to academics. I don't think the lesson \nto take from this experience is that goals are a bad idea. Rather, I \nthink the lesson is that an unrealistic goal, linked to very real \nconsequences, is a bad idea.\n  The goal contained in S. 1, as it was reported from the HELP \nCommittee, that all students would be proficient in 10 years, was both \nadmirable and entirely unrealistic. That will explain why we have done \nwhat we have. It gives me no great pleasure to say this. I have spent a \ngood part of my career in a continuing effort to improve education for \nall students, beginning in my very first year in Congress in 1975. Like \nanyone, I take some pride in my work. I would much rather correct a \nglaring problem in a piece of legislation before it is reported from my \ncommittee, but as has been noted before, wisdom is a rare commodity \nwhich should not be rejected merely because it arrives late.\n  Unlike some of the issues we confront in this Chamber, we have a \nsolid amount of experience in the results of education reform and \neducational assessment. The same year we put in place the national \neducation goals, we\n\n[[Page S4966]]\n\nalso passed the last reauthorization of ESEA. Among other things, that \nreauthorization required annual assessments of students served by title \nI; that is, for economically disadvantaged students. Combined with the \nefforts of States and especially leaders from Connecticut and North \nCarolina and Texas, we have a good idea of what States can accomplish.\n  Thanks to the Internet, which effectively didn't exist during the \nlast reauthorization, it is a simple matter to examine what States and \nschools have been able to achieve and how they compare with the \nstandards we are contemplating in this legislation.\n  What you will find when you do so is that the standard we have set in \nour bill, expecting every child to be proficient in reading and math in \n10 years, was simply not going to happen unless States dramatically \ndumbed down their tests. Moreover, because States used different \ncriteria for determining proficiency, some States would encounter \ntremendous hurdles relative to other States, as we tried to overlay one \nFederal goal on top of 50 very different State systems of measurement.\n  A good example of this is in the comparison of the States of Texas \nand Missouri. According to the National Assessment of Education \nProgress, or NAEP, students in Texas and Missouri are almost identical \nin their reading ability. Yet the two States' assessments could hardly \nhave been more different.\n  In 1998, when the NAEP reading test was given, Texas, by its own \ntest, judged 79 percent of its students proficient, while Missouri, by \nits tests, rated only 29 percent of its students proficient in reading. \nNeither State is right or wrong. The point is, they have very different \nstandards.\n\n  Yet the way our bill emerged from committee, Missouri students would \nhave been expected to make 2\\1/2\\ times the gains of the students from \nTexas each year merely because their State had set a higher bar for \nproficiency.\n  Whether a State was expected to make proficiency gains of 7 \npercentage points a year, such as Missouri, or 2 percentage points, \nsuch as Texas, matters little. As it turned out, of the 20 or so States \nwe looked at, no State achieved a level of AYP, annual yearly progress, \nrequired by the committee-reported bill.\n  Not surprising, what was true at the State level for all students was \neven more true as the sample size declined. Either by looking at \nvarious student subgroups or districts or schools themselves, random \nsamples of schools in Connecticut and North Carolina and Texas revealed \nthat almost no school would make adequate yearly progress under our \noriginal definition; our original definition meaning later on we \nchanged it. We had to.\n  I should note here, my remarks focusing on certain States should be \ntaken as a compliment. The three States I just mentioned are widely \nrecognized as being leaders in education reform. Their data goes back \nfor several years. And in the case of North Carolina and Texas, that \ndata is broken out by many of the categories that would be required \nunder our legislation.\n  My own State of Vermont, which has been working very hard at \neducation reform and assessments over the past several years, would \nalso fail to make annual yearly progress. So would every other State \nbased on the progress even leading States have been able to make.\n  Some self-styled education reformers have argued that we should not \nhave abandoned the committee report approach, even in the face of this \nevidence that every school, practically, in the United States would \nfail. But it is a mystery to me how you can have education reform if \nevery school and every school district and every State is labeled a \nfailure. Resources would be diluted; chaos would result, as every title \nI school would be steered into corrective action and reconstituted \nunder the bill. Reconstitution means that you tear it all apart. You \ncreate a charter school. You fire all the teachers, whatever else. You \nhave to do something that dramatic, with the entire staff being fired, \nmaybe.\n  Those teachers with seniority rights would no doubt exercise their \nbumping rights to land a position in another school. This mass firing \nand dislocation of teachers would come amidst what most people see as a \nlooming teacher shortage. All over the country, we know that our \nteachers are getting older and fewer and fewer are coming into the \nfield of teaching. Thus, we are going to have problems in that, which \nis another issue we will have to face later.\n  This is not good education policy. This is madness. But we were all \nso intent on proving how tough we could be improving education that for \na long time nobody seemed to be willing to admit we were wrong.\n  The President, to his everlasting credit, saw the problem and was \nwilling to try to address it. He has stuck by that decision in spite of \nthe often ill-informed treatment he has received from the press. He has \nchosen the substance of education reform over its political symbolism.\n  The President and anyone engaged in education reform for very long \nknows that a goal of education reform must be significant, continuous \nimprovement. And to get it, you need to focus your efforts on the \nschools that need the most help. Monstrous gains from one year to the \nnext, year in and year out, simply do not happen in the real world. In \nthe real world, our schools are battling poverty, violence, drugs, \nunstable families, apathetic parents, engaged parents, with more than \none job, television, turnover, and all manner of impediments. We cannot \nthrow in the towel, but neither can we legislate miracles.\n  The substitute amendment pending before the Senate tries to set \nambitious but realistic goals for school improvement. If they are \nadopted, we will all see the results in a few years. I would wager \ntoday that we will not look back with regret for setting the bar too \nlow. My own view is that the greatest likelihood is that we will swamp \nthe system by identifying too many schools and States as failing.\n  But we have reached a compromise on this issue and I will support it, \nin the firm hope that time will prove me wrong and this bill will not \nover-identify schools as failing.\n  The substitute amendment sets our two tests for meeting AYP. First, \nstates must establish a formula that measures progress against the goal \nof 100 percent proficiency for all students in a decade. Many States \nalready have such formulae in place, so they may have to make some \nadjustments to their existing approaches. The state-determined formula \nmust give greater weight to improving the performance of the poorest \nperforming students. Quite sensibly, greater weight should be given to \ngreater gains. And the driving factor behind a formula must be the \nperformance on assessments.\n  The second prong of the AYP definition is designed to ensure that no \nmatter how a State formula is constructed, in order to show adequate \nyearly progress, the State and its schools and districts will be \nrequired to achieve at least a one percentage point gain in proficiency \nfor each group of students, every year.\n  Let me briefly address the notion that our proposal permits schools \nto hide the performance of low-performing minorities.\n  Simply put, this notion is rubbish. The disaggregated scores of \ngroups of students must be reported for schools, districts and states. \nAs a result, parents and the public at large will know exactly how \ngroups of students are performing.\n  What are these groups? They are based on race, ethnicity, gender, \nmigrant status, limited English proficiency, low-income status and \ndisability. The performance of each of these groups will be measured \nand disclosed through various means, including the Internet.\n  We're not hiding the results, we're putting them on a worldwide \nbillboard.\n  A school will be deemed to have failed to make adequate yearly \nprogress if it fails to make progress for disabled students, for \nlimited English proficient students, for low-income students, and for \nracial and ethnic groups of students in each subject assessed.\n  There are easily a dozen different ways a typical school can fail to \nmake adequate yearly progress under the approach taken in the pending \nsubstitute.\n  Making a one percentage point gain in the achievement year after year \nfor every subgroup is a daunting task. Very few states have easily \naccessible data at the school level by the various subgroups for which \nthis bill will require measurement and consequences.\n\n[[Page S4967]]\n\nBut the few that do indicate it will be a high standard indeed.\n  Even at the State level, this kind of continuous improvement has \nproven elusive for almost every State, even those that are held up as \nexamples of states committed to reform.\n  The Education Trust recently published a study of how well States \nhave done in closing the achievement gap between white and minority \nstudents. As part of that study, it looks at the states making the \nlargest gains in minority math achievement as measured by NAEP.\n  According to the Education Trust, eight States made above average \ngains in 4th grade math for African American students. They were: \nMassachusetts, Michigan, Texas, Iowa, North Carolina, Connecticut, \nIndiana, and Louisiana.\n  Most of these States are generally recognized as being in the \nforefront of education reform efforts in our country.\n  They also share this distinction. Each of them would be deemed a \nfailure under the committee reported bill.\n  Let me repeat that. The eight states that did the best job in \nimproving math instruction for black students would all fail if you \nheld them to a standard of reaching 100 percent proficiency for all \nstudents.\n  I have with me a few charts that illustrate my point. In each, the \nmost recent data available is used, and it is compared to what it would \ntake to reach 100 percent proficiency over 10 years. The charts go back \nin time as far as readily available comparable data permits. Again, \nthese are some of the very best, most committed States.\n  If you go across the chart, you will find that in 1999, which is the \nyear from 1998-1999, it shows failure because the progress was not \nthere from 1998, and the actual progress was 11.5 and total required \nprogress was 8.8. I get a little confused with the charts, and I \nsuspect everybody will.\n  Let's go to Iowa. It shows that their annual required progress was a \n2.76 improvement. You will notice that as you go along, starting out \nwith 72.45, if you add all the red, it is because they didn't make the \n2.76 improvement all the way across, and actually they are missing \nabout 16.56 percent. Then you can break it down by groups. You can see \nall the way down male, female, and you go to mathematics and so forth. \nBut they are failing.\n  Connecticut is the same. Connecticut has one of the most impressive \neducational systems, but you will see there from looking back to the \nannual progress, they fail right across the board for all those years. \nWe thought they were one of the best. That gives you an idea of what we \nare looking at, which will show that we have really an incredibly \nstrict piece of legislation.\n  Massachusetts failed to make progress in reading, and actually lost a \nlittle ground in math.\n  Michigan, in 1999, failed in math and reading.\n  Texas failed in both subjects in every year but 1997.\n  Iowa has failed for 5 years running in both subjects.\n  North Carolina failed to make AYP in both 1999 and 2000.\n  Connecticut would have failed to make AYP for 5 years running.\n  Indiana has lost ground in reading and math, and would have failed \nfor 3 years running.\n  In Louisiana, given the high bar it sets for proficiency, its gains \nfrom 1999 to 2000 don't come close to meeting AYP.\n  To sum up, every States fails.\n  So for the press to come out and say that we have weakened the \nstandards and somehow we are not going to be stiff enough, they have to \nunderstand that under this bill it is going to be very difficult for \nthe States to comply.\n  These are the results that drove us to amend the committee-reported \nbill. We didn't do so because of pressure from Governors or any \nalllegiance to the status quo. We did so because facts are stubborn \nthings. And the facts show that no State has made, or will make, the \nkind of gains called for in the original bill. Has the substitute set \nthe bar too low? That's a fair question. Again, I think it has to be \nanswered by what the best schools and States can achieve. And again, I \nthink we have set a very high bar.\n  A look at a random sample of school districts deemed ``exemplary'' in \nTexas shows that they nearly all fail to make one percentage point \ngains each year, for each group. That might be explained by the fact \nthat when a school's students are at 90 or 95 percent proficiency, \neither all students or a group or two will fluctuate up and down. But a \nlook at lower-performing Texas schools, those deemed only \n``acceptable,'' yields the same result. If you look at a dozen, \nprobably only one will make AYP.\n  The same holds true for Connecticut schools and districts.\n  I have a chart that looks at the committee-reported standard, in \nwhich all schools and districts failed. But the results are only \nmarginally different with a 1 percent standard. In the case of \nConnecticut, the data we have does not show student subgroup \nperformance, which will show gains above and below the average \nperformance, but overall not that good. North Carolina shows the same \nresults. The areas that are darker are the problem areas with no \nsuccess shown. We looked at the first dozen or so school districts in \nthat State. As our chart shows, all but one failed to make AYP based on \nthe performance of all students in either math or reading.\n  We found one district did make AYP on the basis of all students, but \nwhen you look at the performance of the subgroups of students as we do \nin the chart for the district, it failed to make a uniform 1 percentage \npoint gain, both for some of the lower performing groups, but also for \nthe highest one. The purpose behind my remarks is not to leave all of \nus discouraged, but to try to illustrate that even where you have the \nbest efforts at educational reform, improving educational performance \nis a very hard task, and we cannot expect miracles.\n  Our efforts should be ambitious but anchored to what we know schools \ncan achieve.\n  If we enact a system that labels all schools failures, then it is we \nwho have failed.\n  On the other hand, if they have not already done so, I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will take some time to talk with educators in \ntheir State about this issue. And I hope the very capable people in the \npress who write on this issue will spend a little more time in trying \nto connect the varying claims in this debate to the rich amount of \nexperience that is easily available.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention.\n  I took the time this evening to allow people to have the full story \nso as to better understand, especially when the press says we have \nwatered down the standards. They can make that argument, but if you \nrealized how strict they were to start with and if you realized the \npresent status of our schools, you would understand that had we not \ndone this, it would have been devastating and probably so deflating \nthat we would have chaos.\n  We have tried to come up with what we believe are the improvements \nthat are capable of being performed by the schools. I point out, as I \nhave pointed out to my colleagues continuously, that is why it is \nincredibly important we make sure the resources are there for these \nschools to make the changes to live up to the President's program.\n  I urge everyone to follow the costs that are going to be incurred and \nto talk with the officials in their States to see what resources they \nbelieve will be necessary to make sure that every child in that State \nhas an opportunity to be a successful student.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
