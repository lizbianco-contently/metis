Mr. President, May 1 is a special day in many cultures. \nThe Celts and Saxons and others in pre-Christian Europe celebrated the \nfirst planting and the beauty of spring. These agrarian celebrations \ncontinued down through the centuries and remain today. In much of \nEurope, May 1 is also a labor holiday, honoring the labor workers. The \nfirst of May, however, has a unique and very special significance to \nthe people of Hawaii. May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii. Lei Day is a \nnonpolitical and nonpartisan celebration. Indeed, its sole purpose is \nto engage in random acts of kindness and sharing, and to celebrate the \nAloha spirit, that intangible, but palpable, essence which is best \nexemplified by the hospitality and inclusiveness exhibited by the \nNative Hawaiians--Hawaii's indigenous peoples--to all people of \ngoodwill.\n  A lei is garland of flowers joined together in a manner which can be \nworn. There are many different styles of lei made of numerous types of \nflowers. The type of flower used determines the manner in which the lei \nis woven. While Hawaii and the Native Hawaiian culture are properly \nacknowledged for giving the lei such prominence, and the lei is a \nsensory manifestation of the Aloha spirit, other Pacific island \npeoples--the Polynesians and Micronesians for example--and Southeast\n\n[[Page S4056]]\n\nAsians use floral garlands to greet and honor guests.\n  A lei symbolizes love, support, and friendship. Longstanding \ntradition in Hawaii has made May 1 a special day for the people of \nHawaii. The Territory of Hawaii observed its first ``May Day is Lei \nDay'' celebration on May 1, 1928. There were many festivities and \ncompetitions that exhibited lei made of flowers from the different \nislands. In addition, many schools held elaborate programs throughout \nthe islands.\n  This tradition has continued for many years in Hawaii. In 1929, \nGovernor Farrington signed a Lei Day proclamation urging the citizens \nof Hawaii to ``observe the day and honor the traditions of Hawaii-nei \nby wearing and displaying lei.'' Many schools celebrate this day by \nholding pageants where students honor the many cultures and traditions \nof Hawaii. Students commonly elect a May Day court, commemorating \nHawaii's royal heritage, that consists of two representatives who wear \nflowers and colored Aloha attire representative and customary for each \nof the eight major islands of Hawaii. In addition, many communities \nhold events in honor of Lei Day, including lei making contests and \nconcerts.\n  This year, the Hawaii State Legislature passed a bill to officially \nrecognize May 1 as ``Lei Day in Hawaii.'' The bill was recently signed \ninto law by Gov. Benjamin Cayetano.\n  Mr. President, in an effort to share the Aloha spirit across America \nand around the world, the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau will be \nsharing lei in seventeen cities today. Approximately 31,000 lei will be \nshared in 17 cities around the world, including here in Washington, DC, \nNew York, Chicago, Vancouver, Seoul, Sydney, Beijing, and Buenos Aires. \nThe lei will be of three types: plumeria, tuberose, and dendrobium \norchids. I am pleased that we in Washington, DC, are able to \nparticipate in this wonderful celebration of the Aloha spirit. Across \nCapitol Hill this morning, young people from the metropolitan area who \nare students of Native Hawaiian hula, language and culture are sharing \na floral greeting and compilation of beautiful Hawaiian music with \nevery Senator and Member of Congress. I encourage all of my colleagues \nto enjoy the fragrant and beautiful lei, listen to the music and allow \nyourself to be transported to Hawaii where you too will discover the \ncheer and camaraderie of Lei Day.\n  The songwriter Red Hawke captured it best when he wrote:\n\n     May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,\n     Garlands of flowers everywhere,\n     All of the colors in the rainbow,\n     Maidens with blossoms in their hair,\n     Flowers that mean we should be happy,\n     Throwing aside a load of care,\n     Oh, May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,\n     May Day is happy out there.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4056-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4056-S4061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are in morning business now, but I do \nwant to take this opportunity to comment on a vote that we at least \nplan to have about an hour from now. That vote is a technical type of \nvote, but it is a very important vote because it determines whether or \nnot we allow this body the opportunity to address straight up, head on, \nwith debate, what I regard as the most important issue before us today, \nif we look both short term and long term: Education, kindergarten \nthrough the 12th grade. That is an issue about which all of us in this \nbody feel very strongly.\n  We have contributed to the debate in many positive ways in the past, \nand it is an issue that has been addressed in the appropriate \ncommittee, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which \nwrote a bill called the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act, \nwhich is in my hands. It passed out of that committee and is ready to \ncome to the floor. People have had the opportunity to read it. It has \nbeen sitting on people's desks. We actually addressed it about a month \nago.\n  I feel so strongly about this issue. It is amazing to me that, \nalthough Republicans believe very strongly we need to bring this to the \nfloor, there are people on the other side of the aisle who object to \nbringing it to the floor. We as a nation have failed to do what has \nbeen so well articulated by the President of the United States, \nPresident Bush, in that we have an obligation to leave no child behind. \nWe as a nation have failed to accomplish that objective.\n\n  It was in 1965 that the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nESEA--we will be talking a lot about ESEA, and that is what that is--\nwas passed as part of the War On Poverty, written by President Johnson. \nOver the last 35 years that program has been reauthorized seven \ndifferent times, each with very good intent, each with a lot of \ndiscussion. From what started as a real focus on allowing better access \nto education, over 35 years with approximately 60 different programs \nand now approximately 14 different titles of this bill, this underlying \nlaw has emerged.\n  We have to start to consider this bill today. I urge my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle to allow it to come to the floor.\n  The sad thing is, we are failing. We have failed in the past, despite \na whole litany of good intentions that resulted in programs, about 230 \ndifferent programs and entities which we tried to put out there to \naddress specific problems in the past--in spite of all that, we failed. \nSo now we have this opportunity, a wonderful opportunity, where, again, \nin a bipartisan way, many of us in this body and in the House of \nRepresentatives, under the leadership of President Bush, have come \ntogether. We have that opportunity to change.\n  When we use the word ``reform,'' it scares some people because reform \nmeans such dramatic change, but we have to admit that it is time to \nchange, to reinvent, to reconceptualize what K-12 Federal education \nprograms are all about.\n  What is the role of the Federal Government? Why are we even \ndiscussing it in this body? I think there are two reasons. No. 1, as I \nsaid, over the last 35 years we have invested a large amount of money, \na lot of resources, and we are failing. All of us know that by every \nglobal comparison, standard testing assessment, we are failing our \nchildren, whether it is in the 8th grade, or the 9th, 10th, 11th, or \n12th grade.\n  The 12th grade is a pretty good year to look at because it is a year \nwe know is important. We have gone through kindergarten and 4th and 8th \nand 10th and 12th grade, so this is kind of the final product of K-12. \nIn truth, you can assess students at the 10th grade or 8th grade or 4th \ngrade, and at each of those levels we are failing our children. But if \nyou look at the 12th grade, you can say that is the final product, that \nis what America is all about, and that is what the future of America is \nall about. For those 12th graders, where access in this country is, I \nwould say, superb, we are failing in those global comparisons in \nmathematics, in science, in ability to write, in ability to \ncommunicate.\n  Those basic skills that we know and that everyone--liberals, \nconservatives, Democrats and Republicans--recognizes you have to be \nequipped with if you are going to live a fulfilling life are \nincreasingly competitive, not just in local towns, communities, States, \nor regions in this Nation but across this great world in which we live, \nsuch as in mathematics. It depends on the particular study. If you look \nat our 12th graders versus other nations, we rank 18th--not 1st, 10th, \nor 15th, but right around 18th, or somewhere between 15th and 20th in \nthe world. That is how many nations are better than us.\n  In my own field of science, it is even worse. We are around 19th or \nin some States 20th compared to other nations in the world. We know how \nimportant science is in terms of understanding nature and in \nunderstanding technology, which is revolutionizing our lives. And we \nare sending our young people out into the world less well prepared than \n18 other countries in the world, none of which have the creativity or \nthe ingenuity or the resources that we have in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  That is why an hour from now I am very hopeful that this body allows \nand\n\n[[Page S4057]]\n\nthat the Democrats allow this bill to come forward. Let's work it out \nand talk about these very important issues. The Republicans want the \nbill considered on the floor; the Democrats have refused, and thus we \nwill have this technical vote an hour from now.\n  I mentioned yesterday in some of the conversations the principles I \nam very hopeful we will bring forward and debate, the principles which \nare outlined in a lot of detail, because this is a product of extensive \nbipartisan discussion. This came out of committee in a bipartisan way \nwith a bipartisan vote. Those guiding principles which I mentioned, at \nleast in my mind, are important.\n  No. 1, instead of straightjacketing out of Washington, DC because of \ngood intentions and what goes on at the State level where there is a \nlot of reform, we are playing catch-up ball. There is a tremendous \namount of reform going on in States all across the country, in \ncommunities, in counties, in districts and in the local schools. We \nhave to play catchup.\n  What we have done historically is invent a new program and say this \nis a silver bullet, take the program and put a little bit of money in \nit and hope that little bit of money and our good intentions will solve \nthe problem. It hasn't over time.\n  Instead of inventing a new program with a whole series of \nregulations, it is time for us to provide flexibility and freedom and \nstrip away the unnecessary regulations at the local level to capture \nthe innovation and creativity but at the same time have strong \naccountability.\n  Senator Lieberman has again and again said we have to have strong \naccountability if we are going to provide this freedom, if we are going \nto allow this flexibility. I agree. It is time to have that freedom and \nflexibility to innovate but there needs to be strong accountability.\n  Accountability is sort of a strange word. What does it really mean? \nWhat it means is taking an individual student--it might be a classroom \nor it might be a school--and assessing whether or not that student is \nlearning. That is all accountability is--to ensure that we provide \nfreedom from regulations, which improves the return in school \nperformance, in education, in the ability to learn, in being prepared \nfor the world that we know students will soon be facing, matching \nfreedom with results. You have to be able to demonstrate the results.\n\n  That leads to a correlate. We haven't done very well in this Nation \nin terms of research. One of the sad things we have done at the Federal \nlevel, which was not intended, was put this straightjacket on the \nsystem such that we have not allowed good research to determine what \nworks and what doesn't work. So we need demonstrable results. That \nmeans we need to have some sort of measure and more assessment.\n  If we do that, I am absolutely convinced that when you shed the light \non what does and does not work, Americans today will make good choices. \nThey will reward what works and they will not reward what doesn't work. \nThat is the way America has thrived in the past.\n  The problem with part of the research in education today is that we \nhave not focused the spotlight on what works and what doesn't work. So \nwe haven't been able to empower parents with that ability to express \nchoice or to express approval.\n  The first principle is tying the flexibility with strong \naccountability and strong, demonstrable results. The second principle \nis focusing on kids and children. The more you look at the history of \nthe last 35 years the more you will see the focus at the Federal level \nhas been on institutional systems and bureaucracies--doing that makes \nus feel good because we can invent a new program for a perceived \nproblem or failure and again put some money in it. Then we can walk \naway and say we have done our best in addressing it. After 35 years, \nthat hasn't worked.\n  I spoke about math and science in the 12th grade. I could give you \nthe same statistics for the 8th grade. For the last 30 years, using \nstandardized tests that are well controlled, we have seen no \nimprovement in math or reading, where other countries have improved \nover the last 30 or 35 years.\n  I believe if we focus on the individual child--the disadvantaged \nchild, the child who may not be from a wealthy family, the family that \nmay live in a neighborhood that just doesn't have the resources, the \nfamily that is underserved in whatever criteria--if you focus on that \nchild instead of an institution, instead of a bureaucracy, we will see \nmore innovation and more creativity and understanding the very best of \nwhat America is all about. Freedom in exchange for results, I believe, \nwill work best if we focus on the child.\n  There will be amendments proposed on the floor as to ``portability.'' \nThat means instead of whatever funds we have and we direct the taxpayer \ndollars to come out of Nashville, TN to Washington, DC, and for every \nFederal dollar that comes up on April 15 to the Federal Government, \nonly about 35 cents is returned to the classroom itself. We need to \nexamine how efficiently we are using those dollars today.\n  What is the value of the education dollar we are investing today? I \nsuggest that it is not nearly as good as it should be or could be.\n  If we come together and are allowed to proceed today, we cannot \nmerely conceptualize but we need to actually pass legislation. The \ngoals have been articulated by the President of the United States. We \nhave a responsibility to look at those goals and to develop a strategy, \non which we have taken the first step in this underlying bill, and \nimprove it over the next several days as we move forward.\n  The third principle I mentioned yesterday was information. Keep that \ninformation current, employing again a way that we can empower parents. \nThe information needs to be current. It doesn't matter what happened 5 \nor 10 years ago. We need to know how well schools and teachers and \nstudents are doing so we can assess from a national perspective and \nalso legally empower parents to make choices for their children. We \nneed to have that information. We have failed miserably. We can invest \nbetter to enlarge educational research to determine what teaching \nmethods actually work.\n  Another point that I have mentioned again and again is that people \nwill say if you have a school that is not doing well, are you talking \nabout taking all of the Federal money out of the schools and putting it \nsomewhere else where they might be wealthy or are doing well? No, we \nare not saying that.\n  The President of the United States has been very clear. When the \nadministration or we in committee say that we don't want to reward \nfailure, we mean through better data, through better information, and \nthrough better assessment, again focusing on the child and identifying \nwhat works and what doesn't work. If something is not working, ask why, \nand try to fix it based on the best policy and the best tools that you \nhave today. And, yes, invest more money, if necessary, if that is the \nreason, in order to try to fix it.\n  But if that school fails one year, and you have a child in that \nschool--remember that child's face--and that school fails a second \nyear--remember that child's face; they are trapped in that school; and \nthink about it being your child--if they are trapped in that school for \na third year of failure, meaning in academic performance, achievement, \nand ability to learn, but also safety issues--a school that might be \nunsafe in spite of doing everything you can in terms of establishing \nsafeguards and investing in that school--and if your child is trapped \nin that unsafe school a fourth year, and they have not learned over \nthose 4 years--the school itself is failing though you put more \nresources into it--then there needs to be repercussions. That is the \nAmerican way of doing things.\n  Again, we need to focus on the child, doing what is best for the \nchild, not what makes you feel good about a particular school. This \nhappens after repetitive failure. That is a part of the policy with \nwhich we have worked in a bipartisan way on this bill.\n  Again, I think this is just an example of why it is so important for \nus to be allowed today to proceed to this bill and have the sort of \ndebate that we owe our children, that we owe our schools, that we owe \nour teachers, given the fact that they have been trapped in a system \nwhich is not working, as we compare ourselves to people in other \ncountries.\n  I think we do have a great opportunity in this reauthorization. In a \nreauthorization bill we go back and look\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\nat legislation and plan ahead for, say, the next 4 years, but in this \ncase it is 10 years for reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  We have a wonderful opportunity, based on strong bipartisan support, \nbased on the principles of the President of the United States in his \ndiscussion of education, initially on the campaign trail and also since \nbecoming President. That encompasses having local control, empowering \nparents, investing more, yes, but investing it wisely where you have \ntrue value to meet those goals. That means accountability with \nassessments.\n  We give States the freedom to innovate, to use Federal funding in a \nway that identifies the needs that might be peculiar to Alamo, TN, or \nKnoxville, TN, or a school district in the tri-city area of Tennessee. \nWe would give them the flexibility to address problems in a way where \nthey can have increased freedom, increased flexibility, but we \ninextricably link it to demonstrable results, to make sure that the \nchild is achieving to the best of his or her ability. We have to give \nthem the opportunity to learn.\n  In that way, we are giving States, as well as local districts, the \nopportunity to maximize flexibility. At the same time, we minimize \nregulation because as well intended as the programs we design are, \nnobody knows the child in the classroom better than the teacher who is \nat the head of the class--nobody at that school. They are there day in \nand day out. And taken one step away, the same thing is true about the \nprincipal, who knows the strengths of the school, who knows whether it \nis the building itself that needs repair or that there needs to be an \nadditional computer in this classroom or an afterschool program for \nthat child. Those decisions need to be made locally.\n  We need to have that minimization of regulation, as long as there is \nstrong accountability and that insistence upon measurable results--not \nwhat makes you feel good and not what is just the trend of the time but \nmeasurable results. It does not mean we write the curriculum in \nWashington, DC. I think most people in this body would be absolutely \nopposed to having the curriculum written in Washington and then imposed \non the States. The whole idea is to allow the people locally--in their \ncommunities, in their States--to develop the standards that best meet \ntheir particular area.\n\n  We need a national comparison. That is why you will hear the \ndiscussion of the NAEP test, the sample test, which does allow an \nassessment and comparison of community to community or State to State.\n  If you put all this together and you look at it, the trend that will \nemerge--again, if we are allowed to proceed to this bill today--the \ntrend you will see is one that is critical, very important; that is, to \nhave the U.S. Government or Washington, DC, no longer being the \nregulator but, rather, the investor in education, to invest in that \nindividual child, to invest in that individual student, instead of \nregulating.\n  Regulation simply has not worked. We will discuss the reasons it has \nnot worked over the next several days. We need to maximize flexibility \nand minimize regulations, but we have to tie both of those to strong, \ndemonstrable, measurable results as a condition of participation.\n  The Federal role, again, is important. The opportunity we have as we \naddress these issues over, hopefully, the next 2 weeks, will make that \nFederal role become clear. It is enormous. When I say that, a lot of my \nRepublican colleagues or people back home might say: Good gosh, Senator \nFrist, what are you talking about? What are you talking about that this \nFederal role is enormous?\n  Let me be clear. If you have a pie chart, the Federal dollars that \nare spent in communities throughout Tennessee or any State, in the \naggregate, are only a little sliver, only about 7 percent. The figure \nvaries. In some States it can go from 5 or 6 percent up to 9 percent, \nbut on average it is 7 percent. That means most of the funding and \nfiscal responsibility is at the local level, just as I believe it \nshould be. But our role is enormous because our discussion, what we \nproduce in terms of regulation as an investor in education, instead of \nas a regulator, very much defines the tenor of the national \ndiscussion--the tone of the debate that goes on at the State level, at \nthe community level, at the district level in individual schools and, \nindeed, I would argue, around the dinner table at night or the \nbreakfast table in the morning.\n  It is the tone of that debate that we are not, as a nation, \nadequately addressing on the issue of educating our young people, \npreparing them for tomorrow. That tone, that tenor, is set in \nWashington, DC.\n  No. 2, I believe, again, the Federal role is important, is enormous, \nin that we do help set priorities. We are in a position to step back \nand look at the whole Nation and see, with the data that is available, \nwhat works and what does not work. We have an obligation to articulate \nthat based on the very best information possible.\n  When I go to a school in, say, rural Tennessee and talk about our \nfailure as a nation, people say: Our school seems pretty good. We \nbelieve we are learning pretty well. How could we do better? We are \nworking hard. We have what we think are good teachers.\n  But when I come and say that is not what the data shows, that is not \nwhat the information shows, they will say: Why does it show that? And \nquestions start being asked. That is the second aspect that I believe \nis important for the Federal role--that we have the opportunity, from \nthe national perspective, to set certain priorities and redirect or \nreinvent or reconceptualize what has not worked in the past.\n\n  Mr. President, again, we are in morning business now. We will have a \nvote, hopefully, later this morning.\n  Just for clarification for my colleagues, what is happening is that a \nnumber of people right now are talking about the particular policies, \ntalking about the level of funding that is most appropriate. All of \nthose issues will be brought to the Chamber and discussed. But a lot of \ndiscussions have gone on over the weekend and through yesterday and \nthrough this morning.\n  I am very hopeful we can come to some resolution over the next 30 or \n45 minutes so we can proceed to the bill. ESEA, the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, is 35 years old. I mentioned 7 \nreauthorizations and now 60 programs. It has tremendous promise. The \ngoal initially was to have more access, but really it was to address \nthe academic achievement of the underserved, to make sure that that \nachievement gap would not get worse over time.\n  Unfortunately, in spite of that being the goal, if we look at title \nI--which we will be talking about, which is about half of the overall \nbill and is aimed at disadvantaged children; and I think that has been \na great monument in the bill because it shows the intent of where we \nhave to work, where we have to focus, but also probably its greatest \nfailure--the achievement gap over the last 35 years has gotten worse. \nThe gap between the underserved and the served has gotten bigger and \nbigger and bigger over time.\n  We need to address it. We need to address it head on. We have done \nthat in the underlying bill which will probably be improved as we \ndebate it in this Chamber. But we have to come together in a bipartisan \nway, under the leadership of the President of the United States, who \nhas brought this problem to the forefront, I believe, of all the issues \naddressing our Nation.\n  So we have a bill, a 35-year-old promise. It is now time to update \nthat bill, to reauthorize that bill in a way where the investments, the \nprograms, the intent, and the strategy are really, for the first time, \nI would argue, in harmony with this 35-year-old bill which shows, in \nterms of intent and purpose, tremendous promise. It is time to bring \nthose together.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have been focusing for the last 2 weeks \non education. Education is probably the\n\n[[Page S4059]]\n\nanswer that is most often given in terms of priorities people think are \nimportant. Yet we seem to have a difficult time moving forward.\n  I don't think there is much debate about the concept of helping \neducation, giving young people the opportunity to have a better life. \nWe get bogged down, unfortunately, in the details. I am anxious that we \nmove forward--I hope we can--today and begin the debate.\n  There are legitimate differences of view with respect to what to do, \nparticularly concerning the role of the Federal Government. There are \nthose who believe the Federal Government has great responsibilities and \nshould, indeed, set the stage for how it is done and, whenever Federal \nmoney is made available, there ought to be requirements as to how each \nschool should use the money.\n  In the last administration if there was money for education, \nPresident Clinton said it had to be used for smaller classes or it had \nto be used for buildings. The fact is, the needs in different places \nare quite varied. We must also remember that the contribution from the \nFederal level is about 6 or 7 percent of the total expenditures for \nelementary and secondary education.\n  What we are trying to do is assist in certain areas, helping local \nschool boards and State education departments decide what is best for \nthem. I am particularly sensitive to that in that I come from a State \nwith low population density. We have lots of small schools, and the \nneeds in those small schools are often quite different than they are in \nmetropolitan areas. The idea of the Federal Government putting \ndown regulations certainly doesn't work.\n\n  I am persuaded that the education bill that will be before us has \nsome excellent goals. That is what we ought to be doing--setting some \ngoals we want to achieve and then moving towards the achievement of \nthose goals by what we do in the interim.\n  For example, as to increasing accountability for student performance, \nthere was a great letter to the editor in my local paper last weekend \nfrom a former school board member who made the point that education has \nto be financed. Financing is an essential element to good education, \nbut financing alone does not do it. Dollars are not all that is \nimportant. We have to have some accountability for student performance, \nfor school performance, and for teacher performance. That is one of the \nkey elements.\n  We also have to do some serious examination on the local level as to \nwhat programs work best and to make sure the resources are available to \ngo into the programs that work and that we move money to accomplish \nthat.\n  I do not think there is any question most people would agree we need \nto reduce the bureaucracy and increase flexibility. It happens that my \nwife is a special ed teacher in a public high school. I hear all the \ntime about the amount of effort that has to go into the detail of \nregulations, the paperwork, as opposed to teaching, which is not \npeculiar in terms of funding by the Government. I realize if you are \ngoing to have accountability for the money, there has to be some \nreporting. But when you have professional people spending half their \ntime with paperwork, that is not the direction we ought to be going.\n  Then there is the amount of money, what we are going to be arguing \nabout in this Chamber. Some of our friends on the other side of the \naisle think if we just put in all the money that is available, it \nsomehow will work out. I don't believe that is the case. We have to \nlook at funding, but we have to look at some of the principles that are \nequally as important.\n  The fact is, President Bush has recommended more spending for \neducation than was recommended in the previous administration. Since a \nRepublican-controlled Congress has been in existence since 1994, we \nhave had more increases in the Federal contribution to spending than we \nhave ever had before. We will hear shortly about how we ought to be \nspending all the money in the world. In my view, that is not the only \nelement of successful education. Empowering parents to have some \nopportunities, to have more input into what they are doing is \nimportant. Again, a little experience in this area shows me that \ncharter schools are a great idea so that parents have some flexibility \nand some choices as to what they do within the public school system, as \nto where their youngsters go to school, and how we can do some of those \nkinds of things.\n\n  So I guess my real message is that it is time to get on with it. I \nknow there are three, four, or five people, probably, in this 100-\nMember body who are determined to hold things up until they get their \nway. It isn't going to be that way. It has to be done when there is a \nmajority that agrees on what it is that should be done. I hope we can \nmove on that.\n  We have other things we need to do. We need to get back to the \nbudget, get on with tax relief, get on with energy; these are some of \nthe areas with which we have to deal. Hopefully, we will deal with them \nsoon. I am anxious that we move forward with education. We have a great \nplan and all we need to do is implement it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about education. \nI appreciate my colleague from Wyoming talking about it. I saw Senator \nFrist earlier today discussing the President's education plan and \ncertainly the congressional education plan. I think they are very \nclose.\n  What I think is so important is the emphasis that is being placed on \nquality public education. Thomas Jefferson said, from the very \nbeginning of our Republic, that public education would be the \nfoundation for democracy. That really set us apart from all the other \ncountries in the world because at that time only the most elite were \neducated. It was only the children of dukes and duchesses around the \nworld; it was only the elite who could afford private schools around \nthe world. But that wasn't the foundation of America. The foundation \nfor America was that every child would receive a quality public \neducation so that child could reach his or her full potential and, of \ncourse, contribute to the great Nation that would become the United \nStates of America.\n  Mr. President, it has been proven time and time again that the \ncreativity that comes from having every child in our country educated \nhas put us in the forefront of technology, of space exploration, of \nmedical research, of quality health care. It goes on and on and on.\n  In the last 10 to 15 years in our country, we have lost the battle \nthat every child would receive a quality public education. Today, this \nweek, this year, Congress and the President are saying: No more. No \nmore are we going to allow some children to waste away in schools that \nare not performing and lose that potential, that productive citizen for \nour country.\n\n  We are going to reform public education. We are going to put more \nmoney into it. But there is a wonderful chart that the Secretary of \nEducation, Rod Paige, has shown us that actually reflects that we have \nincreased spending in public education, and the figure has gone up for \nthe past 25 years. But, in fact, the test scores have straight-lined--\neven gone a little bit down.\n  Well, that doesn't work. Pouring more money into it without giving \nour parents and teachers and principals and school districts and our \nStates the opportunity to get in and help each individual child with \nthat child's learning needs doesn't work. It doesn't work to pour more \nmoney in if we don't give them the tools they need to do the job. That \nis why we are focused on accountability, on letting parents know what \nthe test scores are.\n  Yesterday, I visited Stonewall Jackson Elementary School in Dallas, \nTX. I saw the formula for an excellent school. This is a school that is \njust in a regular middle-class neighborhood that also includes children \nwho are deaf and have learning disabilities--a very diverse student \nbody. Those children have a spark and creativity for several reasons. \nThey also have the highest test scores. But they have the creativity \nand the spark because they have a principal who welcomes parental \ninvolvement. They have a PTA that has teams. They have a men's group. \nIt is like a men's group at church, and that men's group comes into the \npublic school and helps plant gardens, paint things when the paint is \npeeling, and it is not on the list to fix right away. They are raising \nmoney to install security systems. They are raising money\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\nto make sure the library is totally stocked. They are involved in their \nschool, and they are welcome in the classrooms any time.\n  So you have the leadership of a principal, you have parents who are \ninvolved, and they have made it fun to be involved, and they are \nimproving the school. That creates a spark in the teachers. Senator \nGramm and I walked into that elementary school, and it was all \ndecorated as a Caribbean island. We asked, ``Why are we seeing trees \nand monkeys in this elementary school?'' It is because they adopt a \ncountry every year, and this year it is the Caribbean islands. Last \nyear it was Spain. They adopt a country and they talk about that \ncountry and they learn about the language and the customs. They have \nlearned something that gives them a new look at life.\n  I am happy that we are focusing on public education. This is just the \noverview. The overview is, we are going to reform our public schools so \nthat every child in America can reach his or her full potential with a \npublic education. We are going to start talking about the specifics in \nthe next 2 weeks in Congress.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be brief. I spoke yesterday about this issue. \nLet me, first of all, say that, again, before the spring recess, there \nwas a unanimous consent to go forward with the bill, but I had not seen \nmuch of the language that was going to be added and changed in the \nbill. In order to be a good legislator for the people you represent, \nyou need to know what is in a bill. As it turns out--and don't ask me \nwhy; I may be alone on that--we are about to proceed to the bill, but \nwe haven't seen so many of the fundamental changes that are in the \nprocess of being made. How can you be a good legislator and represent \npeople and represent children on such an important question--and there \nis no more important question--without yet knowing what is in the bill?\n  On principle, I am opposed to proceeding on a bill that we don't even \nknow much of the language. There are some very important policy \nquestions, one of which, for example, is the Straight A's Program. To \nwhat extent are we block granting programs like afterschool programs? \nTo what extent are they no longer part of the national priority, \nnational goals? I don't know. I want to see the language. I haven't \nseen the language on that.\n  Second point. We are about to do something very reckless.\n  I find it stunning so many Republican colleagues, much less \nDemocratic colleagues, will vote for this. We are about to now put into \nlaw a Federal mandate that every school and every school district all \nover the country, every year, from age 8 through age 13, will test \nevery child. This will be a Federal mandate. But, at the same time, we \nare quite unwilling to pass a Federal mandate that there will be \nequality of opportunity for every child to have a good education and to \ndo well and to succeed.\n  My understanding was the Democrats were saying yes to accountability, \nif it is done the right way. And, by the way, if we are not careful, \nthis is going to result in the worst kind of drill education where we \nwill basically be saying to teachers--and we are trying to recruit the \nbest and brightest--we will tell them what to teach, when to teach, and \nhow to teach. Over and over again the focus will be on these tests.\n  The question is, How do you do an assessment system the right way? I \nwill have a number of amendments to make sure we ensure high quality \nassessments so we can do it the right way if we move to the bill. \nAgain, I would like to see the final language on this bill.\n  I heard from my colleagues on our side that the position was yes to \naccountability, but we also were going to make sure that we were not \ncreating a huge unfunded mandate. The President calls for $300 million \nfor the administration of these tests. The National Association of \nState Boards of Education, the people who are in the field, are saying \nit will cost us a minimum of $2.5 billion to do this, maybe as high as \n$7 billion if we go to multiple measures and do not rely on one \nstandardized test, which we should never do.\n  On top of that, we are talking about a proposal from the President \nthat says $670 million more for title I; that is all he is calling for. \nWe are funding title I at one-third the level we should be if we were \nto fully fund the program.\n  I will have a trigger amendment that says we cannot mandate new tests \nof all these children--starting as young as age 8--until we fully fund \nthe title I program. My understanding was we were going to get a \ncommitment on investment of resources in the IDEA program. My colleague \nfrom Iowa has been such a leader in this area for children with special \nneeds.\n  I also think it is disgraceful to talk about these mandatory tests \nwhen we don't even fully fund Head Start. We fund Head Start at 50-\npercent of what we need for 4-year-olds, even less for 3-year-olds and \nonly 3 percent for Early Head Start, which serves children aged 0-2-\nyear-olds. We know how important early childhood education is to future \nlearning, we know that most kids do not get it, but we will still test \nthese children at 8 years of age and expect them to do as well as \nchildren who have had every advantage. We are setting up a lot of \nchildren and a lot of teachers and a lot of schools in Minnesota and \nthroughout the country for humiliation. I thought we would have a deal. \nI thought Democrats would stand up for investment in resources that go \nwith accountability. I thought Democrats would stand up for \naccountability being done the right way.\n  The President of the United States calls this the BEST program, yet \nall he offers in terms of support for children and schools is a tin cup \nbudget. And we are going forward on this bill? I don't think we should \ngo forward on the bill until we see the changes that are being agreed \nto. I don't think we should go forward until we have an agreement on \nthe policy. I don't think we should go forward until we have a mandate \non commitment of resources.\n\n  I will talk more about this. I believe colleagues are giving up our \nreal leverage. I wish to fight harder for children in education. I will \nspell this out in great detail after the vote. I, maybe only speaking \nfor one, will vote against proceeding to this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I compliment my dear friend and colleague \nfrom Minnesota. There is no one who fights harder for education with \nmore courage, compassion and conviction than Senator Wellstone from \nMinnesota. He comes from a background of having been an educator and in \neducation for most of his life before coming to the Senate.\n  Senator Wellstone is right. We are about to embark upon a lot of \nrhetoric. We are going to talk about reforming education, saving \neducation in America, but without the resources it will just be empty \nrhetoric, one more time.\n  We have to review where we have been on this bill. The Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act expired 2 years ago. Why are we on it now 2 \nyears later? The other side wouldn't let us pass it last year. They \nblocked it. And now there is this rush to get it through.\n  I am all in favor of passing the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. As I understand it, the bill here is the one passed by committee. \nI understand they are working on another bill. We have not seen it yet \nand they will drop it sometime after we vote for cloture.\n  I make the point that Senator Wellstone so eloquently made. This is \nan authorization bill. We can say all these flowery things about saving \neducation, having testing and all that sort of stuff, but if we don't \nhave the resources to back it, we are fooling the American people one \nmore time.\n  Where are the resources for this bill? The National Association of \nState Boards of Education said the testing requirements in this bill \ncould cost, as Senator Wellstone said, anywhere from $2 billion to $7 \nbillion over 4 years. Where are the resources to pay for that? Are we \ngoing to dump it on our property taxpayers one more time? Testing every \nyear means raising property taxes to pay for it. That is basically what \nwe are going to say, unless we have the resources.\n\n  I have not seen this administration willing to come forward with an \nagreement to say, we will back X amount of\n\n[[Page S4061]]\n\nresources to fulfill these mandates we are about to put on the States, \none more time.\n  The other side is always talking about unfunded mandates. This is \ngoing to be another unfunded mandate. Do the testing. Then raise the \nproperty taxes to pay for it.\n  I don't know about other states, but in my State of Iowa we are \npaying enough property taxes as it is.\n  Do we have the resources? That is the next question. Right now, of \nevery Federal dollar we spend in discretionary spending of hard-earned \ntax dollars, 2 cents goes for education. Two cents out of every dollar \nwe spend goes for education.\n  Again, do we have the resources? It depends on your priorities \nwhether or not we have the resources. Here is the President's tax cut \nplan. For the wealthiest 1 percent--I am not talking about middle-class \ntax cuts; I am talking about for the wealthiest 1 percent--$697 billion \nin tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent; $21.3 billion for education.\n  We have the resources. Don't kid yourself. It depends on what you \nwant to do with them. If you want to give it in tax cuts to the \nwealthiest, you will support the Bush tax cut. If you want to do \neducation, we will have some amendments on the floor when we consider \nthis bill. The real battle will come on appropriations, on whether or \nnot we will have the amount of money in the appropriations bill to pay \nfor all this testing and everything else that we say we love so much.\n  I remind Senators, a few weeks ago we passed an amendment, 53-47, to \ntake $250 billion and put it in education over 10 years, compared with \nthe President's request of $21.3 billion. What we voted on a few weeks \nago by a vote of 53-47 will have the resources to pay for the testing. \nIt will have the resources to fund the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. It will have the resources to fully fund title I \nprograms and the resources to reach down also for things that are not \nin this bill, such as Head Start.\n  Second, there are three items that no one is discussing that we will \nhave to belly up to the bar on and vote:\n  No. 1, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Are we \nwilling to fully fund it or not?\n  Second, school construction. Are we going to help prepare the leaky \nroofs and bring schools into the 21st century?\n  Third, are we going to continue to reduce class sizes so our teachers \ncan teach, so the kids can pass these tests that we are going to foist \nupon them?\n  Senator Wellstone is right. We need a commitment on resources, not \njust the rhetoric. When this bill is considered, we will have \namendments. But keep in mind the real test is going to come on whether \nor not the Appropriations Committee will be supported by this \nadministration to come up with the money to fund the rhetoric that we \nwill hear a lot in the next few days in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4061-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \ncaucuses I be allowed to speak at 2:15 for my time, post cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe there are a number of people who \nwant to have the opportunity to speak on this, and we traditionally \nalternate. I respectfully object.\n  Objection is heard.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the fact that we are now going \nto have a real opportunity for debate on education policy in the \nSenate. I expect that it will take a number of days in order to address \nmany of the interests of our colleagues, but I think the time could \nhardly be more well spent. This is the major debate that we will have \non a matter that is of central importance to families all over this \ncountry. I thank our two leaders for working to make sure that we could \nhave this debate.\n\n  As the ranking minority member on the Education Committee, I thank \nour colleagues from the other side of the aisle, Senator Jeffords and \nothers, who have been active and involved in helping to bring us here. \nI am enormously grateful to all of the members on the full committee \nwho have spent a great deal of time on education matters and have \nprovided leadership in the past in so many different aspects of the \neducation debate.\n  We are looking forward to this debate. We are looking forward to \ntaking action on education here in the Senate Chamber.\n  Just to review the bidding, we have filed a cloture motion to proceed \nto a bill which was reported out of the committee virtually \nunanimously. However, this vote should not be taken to indicate that a \nclear consensus has been reached between the administration's best \njudgment of what is needed and the best judgment of a number of us on \nhow we can really deal with strengthening our educational system. The \nlegislation will be the basis for amendments, although under the rules \nof the Senate it will be possible, as I understand it, to amend the \nbill that will be before us, but I expect it is\n\n[[Page S4062]]\n\ngoing to take at least a day before we have real answers.\n  It is important that our colleagues be given a chance to talk about \nthe areas where this legislation is strong and also the areas where it \nis weak.\n  I take this brief time to make a couple of points. First, this \nlegislation is not just about education, it is about the future of our \ncountry and the kind of country we are going to have. We know we are \ntalking about the most important quality of our society; that is, for \nall young people to have a chance for academic achievement and, \nhopefully, academic excellence. It has been, since the mid-1960s, the \npriority of this Congress to ensure that the neediest children in our \ncountry and to get the special focus, attention, and help that they \ndeserve. It was a national finding in the early 1960s that, despite \nstate efforts in the area of education, we had not really met our \nresponsibility to these needy children.\n  It has been a long march since that time. There have been many \nfailings in schools along the way. There have been some remarkable \nsuccesses along the way. There have been some very notable achievements \nin the more recent years.\n  We have to look at the fact that even with the investment that has \nbeen made by the Federal Government, federal spending on education \namounts to about 2 cents out of every federal dollar. We spend close to \n$30 billion a year on elementary and secondary education in the K-12 \nprograms. This current bill would only account for $8 billion of that \ntotal. Through current Title I we only reach a third of eligible \nchildren. Even if we had all the programs right in this bill, we are \nstill only reaching a third of Title I eligible children.\n  This has been a long process. We will hear many of those on the other \nside talk about the failures of our education policy. There are some \nremarkable changes that have taken place. Fifteen years ago we didn't \nhave the 4.5 million children who have disabilities in our public \nschools. They were shunted off into state hospitals, into special \nschools, not really mainstreamed. Today, they are in our public school \nsystem attending school alongside their friends and family.\n  Fifteen years ago, we did not have programs like those in my State \ntoday, at Revere High School, a wonderful high school where 43 \ndifferent languages are being taught. That was not true 20 years ago or \n30 years ago. We didn't have the number of single parent families, 20, \nor 30 years ago, that we have today that puts additional stress on \nchildren attending schools. We didn't have the levels of violence that \nis so prevalent in many of our inner cities where so many of these \nchildren live and attend school. We didn't have the levels of substance \nabuse that we have at the present time. Children are growing up in more \ncomplicated and difficult circumstances, and their teachers are facing \nmuch more complicated and difficult circumstances. They need our help.\n\n  There are so many dedicated teachers in our inner-city schools who \nhave the opportunity to go to other schools and make a good deal more \nmoney. They would most likely have a more modern building, a smaller \nclass size, better access to technology, more professional development \nopportunities, but they decide to stay. They continue working with \nchallenging situations in the inner-city schools and with the children \nwho so desperately need dedicated, highly-qualified teachers. We must \nprovide these teachers with the educational resources they need, and \nthe professional opportunities they deserve.\n  This bill can do quite a bit for education in this country, however, \nit's promise will remain unfulfilled if it is not adequately funded.\n  We know the importance of investing in children at an early age. We \nhave, over the last 25 years, seen the results of the Carnegie \nCommission studies and many others that discuss the importance of child \ndevelopment in the early years, the zero to 2 years when brain synapses \ndevelop. At that early time their minds begin to develop some ability \nto learn, an ability that is being awakened as children are being \nsupported and nurtured and given additional kinds of help and \nassistance.\n  We know the importance of Early Head Start. We know the importance of \nHead Start Programs, if they are good Head Start Programs. We are \ntroubled by the fact that we see so many Head Start teachers leaving. \nThere has been a serious decline in their incomes. Even though their \nincomes are $8 or $9 or $10,000 a year, their purchasing power has \ndeteriorated as we have failed to have any increase in the minimum \nwage. We see children now in the Head Start Programs that have two or \nthree teachers in the space of one year. They are not able to develop \nthe kind of ongoing relationship with a caring adult that they need at \nthat stage of their life. We are not providing sufficient support to \nthese programs.\n  When we talk about education in this bill, Democrats on this side and \nmany of our Republican friends on the other side know that this is only \none part of the whole education puzzle. It is important that we get it \nright. But it is also important, if we are really interested in \nstrengthening our education system, that we come back and revisit the \npriorities of the Early Head start Programs, the early interventions, \nthe Head Start Programs, adequate funding, the child care programs, all \nthe kinds of outreaches that impact these children along the pathway as \nthey come to school.\n  When we talk about leaving no child behind, at a composite of \ndifferent times during the children's development, we have to make \nsure, to the extent that we can, through policy and through priorities, \nto reach out to those children. We understand, all of us, that the \nfirst way the children learn is through their parents and their \nfamilies--we understand that--and by working through their faiths and \nother support programs. But to the extent we can impact it, we ought to \nmake sure we get the policy right, but also that we are going to make \nsure no child is going to be left behind.\n  That brings me to my third point, and that is the issue of resources.\n  I welcome the opportunity, unlike last year when, quite frankly, with \nall respect, there was more of an effort to deny President Clinton a \nwin on the extension of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act than \nthere really was a serious effort to pass a decent bill. But that is in \nthe past. What we have been trying to do is to respond to the \nPresident's invitation to work with him on what he considers to be the \nNo. 1 priority.\n  For us, it is the No. 1 priority. For the parents and the children, \nit is the No. 1 priority. But we believe strongly--I do, and I know \nothers of our colleagues do--if it is going to be the No. 1 priority, \nit has to be the No. 1 priority in terms of resources. That is not \nwhere this legislation is headed. We have seen the request of the \nbudget for $659 million, when we are talking about 7 million children \nwho are left out. Their increase is $659 million. That just is not \ngoing to respond. The President has indicated they are prepared to do \nsomewhat more. We said at the start of this debate, we cover a third of \nthe children at the present time.\n  Title I funding should cover all children. No child should be left \nbehind when it comes to providing funds for students who most need \neducational resources. We hope that by the end of the first term of the \nBush Presidency the Title I program will cover all eligible children.\n  We need full funding for the title I program to make sure that no \nchild will be left behind in this program. We are going to then come \nback on these other programs as well, to the Head Start Programs, and \nearly intervention programs. We are also going to have an important \ndebate on funding of the IDEA for the education of children with \nspecial needs. There are cross currents of children who need special \nkinds of help and attention who are included in that program. Some of \nthe children are, obviously, the same who need additional help in \nreading and other programs.\n  We will have the chance at the end of this debate to find out who is \ntruly committed to leaving no child behind because that is going to \ntake resources. We heard a bit of the debate yesterday which tried to \nmake the case that Democrats simply want to spend more money. Money, \nsay some, is not the answer to our problems in education. But reform, \nwithout the necessary resources, is not reform--it is a formula for \nfailure.\n  If a child doesn't learn algebra in the eighth grade, they are less \nlikely to go\n\n[[Page S4063]]\n\non to college. Eighty percent of the children in the inner cities do \nnot have a math teacher who can teach algebra. That is a fact today. We \nknow that. But you cannot bridge the gap between our poorest and \nwealthiest schools, without providing them the resources to train their \nteachers and to hire new, fully qualified teachers. Only with these \nresources will more of our students in the inner cities have a better \nchance of taking classes like algebra and a better chance of going on \nto college\n  We know the problems we are facing in reading today. We know what it \ntakes to catch up. We heard discussions about the Sylvan Learning \nCenters. Will they be permitted to provide tutorial services? Yes, they \nwill be. We will use those, even though they are for-profit.\n  Sylvan says they need 36 hours to work with a child to bring that \nchild up 1 year in reading achievement. But the average child spends 50 \nhours over the course of a year. That would cost $1,900 per child. We \ncannot say we are for reading and then fail to provide the necessary \ninvestment to improve the performance of our nation's students in \nreading.\n  But today many of our children aren't reading. We know many children \naren't reading and we know what it takes to get them reading. It is \ngoing to mean an investment: an investment in our neediest students so \nthat their schools can work effectively to improve their performance in \nreading; an investment in training for our teachers in the latest \nmethods of teaching reading; an investment in providing educational \nopportunities after school.\n  It also means an investment to make sure that we have the best tests \nthat will fairly and accurately assess students. Investment is \nnecessary to ensure that we will test a child's ability to reason, \nrationalize and distinguish. We have seen those developed in a number \nof our States. The MCAS test in Massachusetts is this sort of a test.\n  We need to make a lot of progress. But we are not for a quick, slick, \neasy examination. We want to make sure we are going to have thoughtful \nteachers. We want to make sure the teachers are going to be quality \nteachers for our children. We want to make sure the schools are going \nto be quality schools to the extent that we can help and assist them.\n\n  We know we have 10,000 failing schools today. That is the last \nprojection. We know that the average cost to bring those schools along \nand turn them around is $180,000. There is a whole series of different \nways they can be turned around that have been tested and examined. \nThere are 57 proven, research-based comprehensive reform models that \nhave been identified by the New American Schools Development \nCorporation, a creation of the first Bush Administration. These models, \nincluding Success for All and Reading Recovery among others, cost an \naverage of $180,000. That would cost a total of $1.8 billion to turn \naround all 10,000 failing schools.\n  If you are going to turn around schools, you are going to have to \ninvest. Currently the Department of Education is able to fund less than \n20 percent of after-school grant applications. There are 7 million \nlatch key children nationwide. In the first hour after school lets out, \nthe juvenile crime rate triples. If we are going to use the afterschool \nprograms to help strengthen and tutor the children, we are going to \nhave to invest. We are going to have to invest in our children.\n  So what are we asking? Is this something that just the Democrats are \nasking for or speaking for? Absolutely not. Later, when we get into the \nreal debate, I will put in the Record what the National Governors have \nsaid in terms of funding for this program. I will put into the Record \nwhat 38 organizations that have represented children and parents and \nschools have said in terms of the full funding of this program. I will \nput into the Record what the League of Cities, who have a direct \ninsight into what is happening in the inner cities, say in terms of \nfull funding. They say if you are going to do the job right, you need \nto have the resources. That is what we are saying at the outset of this \ndebate. We have to have the resources to be able to do the job, or we \nare failing these children and failing them in a very important way.\n  That is why this debate is so important, because it is about the \nfuture. We know that as we move into a global society and economy, that \nonly about 20 percent of the new entrants into the job market have the \nskills which 60 percent of them need at the present time. We are not \ngiving them the kind of training they need. We are lagging in education \nand in investing in people and training. The Republicans act as if the \ntax cut is an economic program--it is not. It is not. We need to invest \nin the quality of education, which is basic and fundamental in a \ndemocracy. We have to invest in terms of the training, and we have to \nask this Nation what its priorities are. Should we trade in a small \nfraction of a $1.6 billion tax cut to invest approximately $5 billion a \nyear in title I to cover every child by the end of FY 05?\n  We are going to be asked, according to the Wall Street Journal in a \nrecent report, to increase our budget $25 to $30 billion a year for \ndefense. That is going to pass in this body. Are we saying that we are \nunwilling to provide approximately 5 billion a year for the next 4 \nyears to get to full funding for Title I? Are we saying that we are \nunwilling to provide the additional resources for afterschool programs, \nor professional training, or for libraries or smaller class sizes? We \nare saying we are going to spend the $25 billion a year. You can expect \nthat for the next 6 to 8 years, but we are not going to give you the \n$5.5 billion.\n  This is about priorities. I guess we can't do that. That $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut is too sacred to say we are going to reduce that a \nlittle in order to fund this program. We think it should be reduced. We \nbelieve the American people believe so, too. We are going to give the \nopportunity to this body to express itself on that issue. We are going \nto give them the opportunity to do so today, tomorrow, every single day \nthat we debate this. Then we are going to have the opportunity to vote \non it every time we are going to face the budget when it comes back \nfrom conference and every time in appropriations.\n  So get used to it because we are going to give this institution the \nopportunity to vote and vote and vote about whether they are going to \nput the children as the first priority. We guarantee it. That is going \nto be it. Hopefully, if we are able to get that kind of commitment, we \ncan move along and join hands together and say we have a bill that is \nworthy of the children of this country. But it is not there yet.\n  I see others who want to speak. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, I commend my colleague from \nMassachusetts for his eloquence and his passion about a subject matter \nto which he has dedicated a substantial part of his public service--the \nplight and condition of America's children under a variety of adverse \ncircumstances. His passion and concern about the condition of our \npublic education system at the elementary and secondary level has, once \nagain, been expressed in the most heartfelt of terms and views, which I \nam hopeful and confident express the views of a majority of Members of \nthis body regardless of party or ideology.\n  I am very confident I express the views of the majority of American \ncitizens who, without knowing the details, understand intuitively that \nif this Nation is going to live up to its potential, to its own \naspirations as expressed more than two centuries ago by the founding \nmembers of this Nation's Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, \nthat we need to have the best quality of education this country can \nprovide, particularly to a generation that will face challenges \nunimaginable by even this generation, not to mention generations past.\n  This is a critical debate. It doesn't get any more important than \nthis. I have often said if you get the educational needs of this \ncountry right, you may not have an absolute formula to address every \nother concern, but an educated population, an educated America, is in a \nfar stronger position to resolve the great issues of their day than an \nignorant population. An ignorant nation, an ignorant democracy is a \ndangerous country, in the sense that people don't understand or grasp \nthe subtle nuances of our Constitution, of\n\n[[Page S4064]]\n\nour Declaration of Independence, of our Bill of Rights, not to mention \ntheir ability to provide for themselves and to add to the greater \nprosperity of our Nation.\n  This is the No. 1 priority. The President has this right. This is and \nought to be the No. 1 issue we grapple with as a country. There is no \nmore important issue than the quality of our public elementary and \npublic secondary schools in America.\n  This morning, roughly 55 million children went to an elementary \nschool or a secondary school in America. Of that 55 million, 50 million \nwent off to a public school; 5 million went off to a private or \nparochial school. Certainly, while we do things we can to support and \nassist those private and parochial schools, our fundamental obligation \nis to public education. It has been since the founding days of this \ncountry, in one manner or another.\n  On the first great debate on education in the 21st century, a debate \nthat will determine over the next 7 years what our priorities are when \nit comes to public elementary and secondary education, it is important \nwe try and find as much support and common ground for investing in the \nneediest schools in this country. That has been our Federal obligation.\n  I make the case we need to change the formulation of how we fund \npublic education in the country. I think this idea of depending upon a \nproperty tax in State after State, community after community, may have \nserved the country well in the 19th century, and even for a good part \nof the 20th century, but the idea today that the primary source of \neducating the 50 million young people who went off to school today \nought to be based on the property taxes of local communities, as is the \ncase in most States in this country, is an archaic, backward idea.\n  We need to be a far better partner. We only provide a small \npercentage; 6 cents of every dollar spent on elementary and secondary \neducation comes from the Federal Government; 94 cents, 95 cents comes \nfrom our local communities and some from the States. It is mostly from \nlocal communities.\n  I would love to see at some point becoming a one-third partner: One-\nthird of the resources provided by the Federal Government, one-third by \nStates, and one-third by local communities. What a great relief it \nwould be to lower property taxes across this country, to be able to \nhave the Federal Government contribute a far greater percentage of the \neducational needs of America's children and their families. That debate \nwill not occur this week. We are going to argue about the 6 or 7 cents \nand how those 6 and 7 cents are going to be spent.\n\n  Let's be clear at the outset; we are a very minor participant. The \nFederal Government is a minor participant in the financial costs of \npublic education in this country. How we spend those 6 cents will be \nthe subject of this debate which may consume as many as 2 or 3 weeks of \nthe Senate's time.\n  What do you do with 6 cents? Historically, over the past 25 or 30 \nyears, we have said our obligation will be to serve the most \nendangered, the most needy students in schools in the country. We have \ndone that in title I, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, in a \nvariety of other proposals, but principally it has been to serve the \nneediest kids and the neediest schools in America in both rural, urban \nareas, and suburban areas.\n  Over the next 2 or 3 weeks, we will talk about how to better target \nthose resources and how to get some improved accountability so when \ndollars are being spent there is some assurance coming back that kids \nare learning and teachers are teaching. So we will have a good \ndiscussion about how to improve accountability, how to improve some \nsort of grading system without overburdening school districts.\n  We speak in a rather lofty tone when it comes to demanding testing. I \ndon't think anyone wants to be part of a formulation that demands \ntesting without providing the resources to the schools to see it gets \ndone, and also adding to the burdens of teachers and school districts \nand parents by having nothing more than testing going on.\n  Someone said in my State the other day, taking someone's temperature \nthree or four times a day does not make a child better. It does not \nimprove their health. It tells you how they are doing. Testing three or \nfour times a year, whether a local test, a State test, or a Federal \ntest, doesn't make that student a better student with more knowledge. \nIt merely tells you how they are doing. There are many who are \nconcerned that demanding more testing will turn the schools into \nnothing more than test prep centers where kids are geared every day and \nevery week to pass a test, to get good scores on the tests, and where \nactual learning takes a secondary position.\n  While I understand the value of testing, let's not get carried away \nand set up a system that we come back with 4 or 5 years from now and \nall we have done is fulfill a self-fulfilling prophecy; that kids in \npoor districts don't do very well. We know that already. You can spend \nall the time and effort possible to test people. But for the life of \nme, I don't understand all the value of that, at the expense of trying \nto do things that would actually improve the conditions so kids do \nbetter on the tests we do provide.\n  Many feel there are things we can do with the 6 cents. Remember, I am \ntalking 6 cents--not 100 cents on the dollar but 6 cents. That is all \nwe give now. That is what Uncle Sam sends, 6 cents on every dollar.\n  It seems to me we ought to improve the structures where kids attend \nschool. We know a child who walks into a building that is 50, 60, or 70 \nyears old and falling apart isn't going to learn very well. I don't \nneed a study by a bunch of Ph.D.'s at the Department of Education over \nthe next 6 years to tell me that. Talk to any parent who takes their \nkid to a school that leaks, that is not wired, that is falling apart, \nand I will guarantee that child in those circumstances is not going to \nlearn very well.\n  Put some of these resources in to see to it that the buildings, these \nstructures, these physical plants, might be improved so that child who \narrives at that school building has a better chance to learn. About 50 \npercent of all the kids who went to school this morning entered a \nbuilding built more than 50 years ago--50 percent. I think the need for \nimproving the physical structure is quite obvious in the urban and \nrural areas that are the most impoverished and the poorest.\n\n  Reducing class size, again, I don't think it has great value in \nhaving studies done over the next 5 or 6 years. Any parent will tell \nyou, a child will tell you, if they are in a classroom with 20 or 25 \nstudents and one teacher, the teacher cannot teach and the kids can't \nlearn. This is not brain surgery. This is about as basic as it can get.\n  I spoke to a group of charter school students from Connecticut the \nother day on the east front of the Capitol. I said: Tell me why you \nlike the charter school.\n  They said: We get more attention.\n  I said: Why do you get more attention?\n  Because the classes are smaller.\n  These were not the teachers talking or the parents. These were the \nkids. We are doing more in charter schools, and that is good news, but \nnot every child gets to go to a charter school.\n  I asked: How did you get to go to a charter school?\n  It was a lottery. We put our names in a hat and they drew out so many \nnames. There were hundreds who wanted to go, but it was a lottery. They \npicked them out of the hat, so these kids from this town of mine in my \nState of Connecticut got to go.\n\n  I applaud what they are doing with the charter schools. I think they \nare great ideas. But we cannot just talk about improving charter \nschools at the expense of these other public schools. If it is good for \na charter school, why can't it be good for the other schools as well? \nWhy can't every school be a charter school in America? Are we so inept \nthat we cannot come up with the means by which every kid who goes to \nschool, as they did this morning, could walk into a classroom where \nthey were not one of two dozen students vying for the attention of a \nteacher in order to learn? We know without any question that in a class \nthat is smaller, where a teacher has the opportunity to really spend \nsome time with these children, you can make a difference in the quality \nof their education and how they will do on those tests that we all seem \nso interested in funding or requiring as part of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n\n[[Page S4065]]\n\n  Regarding afterschool programs, how many days do parents worry about \nwhere their children are? Single parents working, two-income parents, \nparents who stay at home, wondering where that child is, what goes on \nafter 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Talk to any police chief. I wonder if \nyou think I am making these things up. Call your local police \ndepartment if you question my veracity on this and ask the local police \nchief what is the most dangerous time of day for young kids, in terms \nof them being victims or creating problems themselves. They will tell \nyou it is not after 7 or 8 or 10 o'clock at night. The most dangerous \ntime is between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Again, that is the conclusion of \nevery police chief I ever talked to across the country.\n  So afterschool programs become critically important, not just to keep \nkids safe but as part of the learning experience. We think with that 6 \ncents I talked about here, we ought to allocate some of those resources \nto expand afterschool programs because we know they work. In this day \nand age, we should be utilizing our school buildings after school, \nweekends, evenings, summers, so these learning centers become more a \npart of our community, assisting the towns and counties and States. \nThat is where kids can channel their energies into constructive \nalternatives. Left alone, we know all too often what happens. Good kids \ncan make bad decisions, decisions that affect them the rest of their \nlives.\n  There are many of us, as we begin this debate, who would like to see \nsome effort made to improve the physical structures where kids go to \nschool every day, reducing those class sizes so the kids have an \nopportunity to really learn, seeing to it there are afterschool \nprograms, making sure we have full funding for title I so these needy \nstudents and their families across the country will get the support \nthey richly deserve.\n  My hope is that at long last we will be able to pass some mandatory \nfunding for special ed. How many towns across the country have told us \nthe costs of special education are depriving them of the resources \nother children need in their communities? I know that will be offered.\n  My colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, and I will offer an \namendment on title I for full funding. I know my colleague, the \nPresiding Officer, sat through the debate and discussion in our \ncommittee, the HELP Committee, and I know he is sympathetic to the full \nfunding of title I. If we come up with that as part of the formula for \nfunding this authorization bill, we would like to have his support on \nthis as well, knowing he was part of the debate during committee \nconsideration.\n\n  But I hope we can come up with a mechanism for full funding of title \nI and for special education, to see to it we live up to our obligations \nand fulfill the commitments we must make.\n  Again, going back to what I said at the outset of these remarks, \nthere is no more important issue to address as a legislative body, as a \nnational legislative body. It is not enough any longer that I only have \nto worry about how a child is doing in Connecticut, how a young student \nis doing in Bridgeport or Hartford or Sterling or Union or my hometown \nof East Haddam, CT, but how kids are doing in California, how they are \ndoing in Illinois, how they are doing in Florida and Michigan and \nMaine. These are national issues now.\n  If a kid fails in Wyoming, then that is a problem for those of us who \nlive in Connecticut, just as it is a problem for those who live in \nWyoming if a kid in Connecticut is not doing well. Children in the 21st \ncentury will compete with children in Beijing, in Moscow, in Sidney, \nAustralia, in Tokyo. All across the world is from where the global \ncompetition comes. So we have to do what we can with that 6 cents we \ncontribute to elementary and secondary education to see to it that \nthose dollars are going to reach those families and those communities \nthat have the greatest need.\n  I wish it were otherwise. I wish we were talking about picking up a \nthird of that responsibility, as I think any national government ought \nto do in the 21st century, and contributing to the quality of our \noverall educational system. Unfortunately, that is not part of this \nbill. But I think that in getting these dollars up on title I and \nspecial ed, contributing to school construction and class size and \nafterschool programs, our dollar is well invested.\n  Let me mention last of all the issue of funding, because you are \ngoing to hear a lot of debate about what we can afford and not afford \nto do. Later today, if he has not done it already, the President of the \nUnited States is going to call for $60 billion on a national missile \ndefense system. I happen to believe in the 21st century we are going to \nhave to develop some form of a missile defense system. I will not take \na back seat to anybody in my commitment to seeing to it that the \nnational security needs of my country are met. But we are going to be \nasked today, without knowing much more about it, to spend $60 billion. \nSenator Kennedy mentioned $25 or $30 billion increases each year in the \ncoming few years.\n  I think there may be a good case to be made for increasing spending \nfor the national security needs of this country and for developing a \nnational missile defense system. I understand the need for that. But I \nwant it to be done in a way that is going to reflect what we can \nachieve, the kind of science that needs to be developed, done in \ncoordination, my hope would be, with our allies so this is a shared \ntechnology that will protect us from potential hazards we face with \nthis ever-modernizing technology that puts us all at risk.\n  We have been asked to support a $1.6 trillion tax cut. What we are \ntalking about here is modest increases for the educational needs of \nAmerica. If it is important to invest dollars to protect the national \nsecurity needs, if it is important to invest dollars for the economic \nsecurity of a country, how can you really talk about being secure \nmilitarily or economically if you do not have an educated population? \nIf you do not have an educated population, how secure are you? If you \nhave kids growing up where the gap grows wider and wider and wider \nevery single year between those who fit into an economy where they \nunderstand and have the tools necessary to perform and those who do not \nand are left further and further and further behind. They then beget \nchildren of their own who get further and further behind. You end up \nhaving a growing segment of your population that really cannot fit into \na modern economy or understand or contribute to the national security \nof a nation.\n  This is a seamless garment. National security or economic security \nare never going to be secured if you do not have an educated nation. \nThat means every child being given the opportunity to reach his or her \npotential.\n  None of us has an obligation to guarantee success. I feel no burden \nwhatsoever to say to any child in America: I have an obligation to see \nto it you succeed. I do not have that burden.\n  But I feel the burden that every child ought to be given the \nopportunity to succeed regardless of economic circumstances, of race, \nof ethnicity, or geographical location. A child should not be left \nbehind because of the action in Washington, because of the town they \nare born in, or the economic circumstances of their parents. That is \nnot my America. My America says every child should have the chance to \nreach his or her potential to contribute to their own well-being and to \ncontribute to the well-being of this Nation. That is what successive \nprevious generations have done. That is why this country has achieved \nthe success it has.\n  If we are going to continue that legacy in the 21st century, it \nbecomes the collective responsibility of the 100 of us in this Chamber, \nthe national legislature, with the 6 cents we get to manipulate in \nterms of the educational needs of a nation, to see to it that the \nneediest of our citizens are going to have an opportunity to achieve \nAmerica's dream. You cannot do that without an education. You may get \nlucky at a casino or you may hit the lottery one day. But that is not \nhow most Americans need to depend upon their economic future and to \nfulfill their dreams. You cannot succeed in America without a good \neducation. To do otherwise is totally a fiction.\n  This debate over the next few weeks is about as important as it gets. \nThis debate over the next few weeks is on whether or not we will have \nthe intestinal fortitude to commit the modest resources to seeing to it \nthat America's schools and America's children are going to get the best \nthey can from their Federal Government under these circumstances.\n\n[[Page S4066]]\n\n  Again, I wish to reiterate that we were a far better partner. I think \nit ought to be a source of collective embarrassment that the Federal \nGovernment contributes only 6 cents out of every dollar in America in \nthe 21st century. Why we cannot be a one-third partner, to me, is \nbeyond imagination. Yet that is where we are.\n  The 6 cents that we will be talking about contributing will make a \ndifference. My hope is that we will fully fund those 6 cents to see to \nit that these schools, children, and families will have the chance to \nmaximize their potential.\n  There will be extensive debate. I will be talking about the various \nissues that come along. I look forward to the amendment that I will \noffer with my colleague and friend from Maine, Senator Collins, on \ntitle I. I look forward to the debate on special education and these \nother issues that come along. I will have an amendment with my \ncolleague from Alabama on privacy issues that we will be offering along \nwith some other suggestions with my friend from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, on charter education.\n  We will have a good debate and a good discussion on some of these \nissues. My hope is at the end of this debate we will be able to meet as \na body and say to each other that we have done the right thing for our \ncountry. Many of us may not be here when the next education bill comes \nto the floor. I would like to think that on this occasion and during \nthis discussion we are mindful that this may be our last opportunity \nindividually to leave our signature on how we would like to see America \nmeet its educational challenges for the 21st century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut for his remarks. They are right on. I wish to associate \nmyself with them. I wish to thank him for his decades of perseverance \non behalf of education. It was an excellent set of remarks. I thank him \nvery much.\n  Mr. President, my understanding is that each Member has an hour to \nspeak on the motion to proceed. I intend to use my time not only on the \neducation bill, but because of the situation in California with respect \nto energy, I wish to give this body, on the 1-year anniversary of the \nenergy crisis, a brief report. I ask unanimous consent to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator realize that we have a 12:30 \nrecess for the policy conferences?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I do. I will use the 15 minutes, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4066-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4066-S4069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE ENERGY CRISIS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak once again about \nthe California energy crisis. Today is the first day of May and in many \nparts of California, it is the start of a 5-month summer and the start \nof a five-month period of the highest electricity demand. The day also \nmarks the 12th consecutive month we have been in an energy crisis--I \nadd to that the Pacific Northwest--meaning for an entire year we have \nexperienced energy prices that are about 10 times higher than they were \nin the previous 12 month period. And it also marks the 12th consecutive \nmonth that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has failed to take \ndecisive action.\n  It took the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission until November to \ndeclare what people in San Diego, California discovered last May, \nelectricity rates are ``unjust and unreasonable'' and the market is \nbroken.\n  Last week, FERC attempted to modify the broken market with so-called \n``price mitigation.'' In its April 26th order, the FERC outlined its \nproposal ``to mitigate the dysfunctional market.'' Unfortunately, what \nFERC offered as a solution will not do nearly enough to solve the \nproblems in California and the Northwest.\n  First, the order for the most part, ignored the Northwest--offering \nonly a limited investigation of the broken market in Oregon and \nWashington without any promise of even the feeble price mitigation \noffered to California.\n  Second, the order will last only one year, not nearly enough to get \nenough supply on line to meet our energy needs.\n  Third, the order only applies to stage 1, 2, and 3 energy \nemergencies, practically ensuring that prices for the rest of the time \ncan remain exorbitantly high.\n  Fourth, the FERC order decreed that the cost based rate of the price \nfor the least efficient megawatt of power needed at any given hour \nwould go to everyone who bid into the market. With natural gas prices \nstill averaging three times higher in California than elsewhere, it is \nalmost a guarantee that this would mean at many hours, the average \nprice of electricity will be $400-$500 per megawatt.\n  Which brings up the most glaring problem with the FERC order: It does \nnot address natural gas, which is the major cost in electricity \nproduction and a problem in itself for heating, cooking, food and \nmanufacturing production, etc. I would like to take this opportunity to \nread from some letters I have received about the energy crisis.\n  Let me speak about a letter from the California Steel Industries, and \nI quote:\n\n       Our company is a relatively large consumer of both \n     electricity and natural gas. Our historical gas bill was \n     about $12 million annually. With the price gouging going on \n     in California, that bill will rise to $40 million or even $50 \n     million this year. For electricity, we historically paid \n     about $15 million per year. That number will double this year \n     due to increased retail rates, which became necessary as a \n     result of skyrocketing wholesale prices.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            California Steel Industries, Inc.,\n\n                                      Fontana, CA, April 16, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: This is to ask for your help in \n     immediately seeking emergency action by the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission, to stop the relentless profiteering \n     and price gouging by energy providers to the state of \n     California.\n       The problem in the wholesale price of electricity is well \n     documented. Power prices have gone from about $30 per \n     megawatt hour in 1999 winter months to more than $1400 per \n     megawatt hour at times during the winter of 2000-01. This was \n     not due to a rise in demand or a supply shortage--the winter \n     months for both years saw demand at about half of the summer \n     peak period.\n       High prices have continued through the moderate spring \n     weather and could hit astronomical levels this summer.\n       Natural gas, a key component of electricity generation and \n     of industrial production in its own right, has followed suit. \n     While the price of natural gas is up across the nation--about \n     double the historical average in Chicago, New York and Texas, \n     for example--in California, it is about six times the \n     historical average. In recent weeks, natural gas has been a \n     little over $5 per MMBTU in most areas of the country, and \n     nearly $15 in South California.\n       Our company is a relatively large consumer of both \n     electricity and natural gas. Our historical gas bill was \n     about $12 million annually. With the price gouging going on \n     in California, that bill will rise to $40 million or even $50 \n     million this year. For electricity, we historically paid \n     about $15 million per year. That number will double this year \n     due to increased retail rates, which became necessary as a \n     result of skyrocketing wholesale prices.\n       For California Steel Industries and its 1,000 direct \n     employees, those numbers are not only mind-boggling, they \n     spell disaster. No business can absorb that kind of a hit for \n     long and continue to survive. We are the largest producer of \n     flat-rolled steel in Southern California, and we serve nearly \n     400 customers, most of whom are in California. We cannot pass \n     along these increased costs to our customers because they can \n     easily purchase competing steel from the Midwest, the East, \n     and from offshore, produced with far less expensive energy.\n       Unfortunately, our story is just one of many in California \n     these days.\n       The President of the California Public Utilities \n     Commission, Ms. Loretta Lynch, has requested the help of the \n     FERC in this crisis. Thus far, she has been rebuked by the \n     regulators, on the basis that this is simply a supply and \n     demand issue that will straighten our as soon as more power \n     plants are built and more gas pipelines constructed. \n     Unfortunately, we fear the problem will go away even sooner--\n     by a huge drop-off in demand as businesses shut down and lay \n     people off. This is not the solution the FERC wants, we are \n     sure. However, we cannot wait for the FERC's theoretical \n     approach to solve everything 50 months from now. We cannot \n     even wait 50 days.\n       It is our belief that there is no fair market for gas or \n     electricity in California, and there will not be fair pricing \n     without federal intervention at the wholesale price level. We \n     are committed to doing our part for conservation. We would \n     also welcome the chance to talk with you personally about \n     this subject.\n\n[[Page S4067]]\n\n       In the meantime, on behalf of all Californians who value a \n     good job with a secure future, and who helped create the \n     world's 6th largest economy through hard work and \n     perseverance, we urge you to get directly involved in this \n     matter and demand that the FERC do its job. We must ensure \n     that electricity and natural gas--two unique commodities, \n     which in most cases have no short-term substitute--are priced \n     fairly. Otherwise, you can turn out the lights in California, \n     because the party will be over.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                            C. Lourenco Goncalves,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, California is the largest dairy State \nin the Union.\n  Let me read a brief quote from the Dairy Coalition of Concerned \nEnergy Consumers.\n\n       As the number one-ranking dairy producing state in the \n     nation, the California dairy industry uses substantial \n     quantities of natural gas to run its processing plants. \n     Between December 1999 and December 2000 the cost of gas to \n     dairy plants in California increased 4,000%. Our paramount \n     concern is the dramatic increase in the non-commodity portion \n     of the price of gas.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         California Dairy Coalition of Concerned Energy Consumers,\n                                Sacramento, CA, February 16, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the California Dairy \n     Coalition of Concerned Energy Consumers, I would like to \n     thank you for all of your activities to date directed to \n     resolving the energy crisis in California.\n       The Dairy Coalition was formed recently due to the supply \n     problems and dramatic price increases seen for both \n     electricity and natural gas in California in late 2000. The \n     Coalition represents all of the major dairy producer co-\n     operatives in California, as well as the major proprietary \n     processing companies.\n       As the number one-ranking dairy producing state in the \n     nation, the California dairy industry uses substantial \n     quantities of natural gas to run its processing plants. \n     Between December 1999 and December 2000 the cost of gas to \n     dairy plants in California increased 4,000%. Our paramount \n     concern is the dramatic increase in the non-commodity portion \n     of the price of gas.\n       Again, the Dairy Coalition greatly appreciates your \n     attention to this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                    Jim Gomes,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n                                          California Dairies, Inc.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, let me read briefly from a letter from \nBayer. Bayer uses tremendous quantities of energy, and it relies \nextensively on natural gas and oil as both fuel and feed stock. It has \nhad a 300-percent surge in the open market cost of natural gas since \nearly in 2000.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       Volatile crude oil prices have increased the cost of \n     feedstock by as much as 100 percent.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Bayer Corporation,\n\n                                    Pittsburgh, PA, April 2, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write on behalf of Bayer, the \n     world's largest producer of both synthetic rubber and \n     polyurethane systems and a major U.S. exporter with more than \n     23,000 employees in the United States.\n       Please act promptly to advance a comprehensive national \n     energy policy and strategy that promotes high environmental \n     standards and a diverse, flexible energy supply at globally \n     competitive prices.\n       Our polymers and chemicals businesses use tremendous \n     quantities of energy and rely extensively on natural gas and \n     oil as both fuel and feedstock. In this way, our $10 billion \n     U.S. company is representative of a major segment of the \n     economy. The $460 billion business of chemistry is the \n     largest exporting sector in the country, accounting for ten \n     cents out of every dollar in U.S. exports. At Bayer \n     Corporation, one out of every five jobs depends on our $2 \n     billion export business. We cannot fight with both hands tied \n     behind our back, one already tied by the strong dollar, now \n     the other by high energy costs.\n       The 300-percent surge in the open-market cost of natural \n     gas since early in 2000 has dramatically affected business. \n     Volatile crude oil prices have increased the cost of \n     feedstock by as much as 100 percent.\n       Passing these costs along to our customers in the \n     appliance, automotive, construction and other markets is not \n     a viable, long-term solution. Rather it is a bleak, zero-sum \n     game for the U.S. economy.\n       We are doing our part by aggressively pursuing policies to \n     conserve energy and otherwise raise efficiency through \n     measures such as co-generation. Even so, we need your help in \n     bringing about a rational approach to the energy needs of the \n     world's largest, single-nation economy.\n       I urge you to please speak out on this matter and act \n     immediately.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like \n     additional information about Bayer's perspective on energy \n     policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Helge H. Wehmeier,\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. California is a very large floral producer. I would \nlike to read a brief quote from the California State Floral \nAssociation.\n\n       While our state decision makers have devoted most of their \n     attention to the supply and cost of electrical energy, it is \n     the high cost of natural gas that is of the greatest concern \n     to our grower members. They have seen their natural gas bills \n     increase by five to six fold. For example, one of our \n     nurseries reports having their monthly gas bills increase \n     from $26,000 in December of 1999 to $145,000 in January of \n     2001. This is fairly typical of the industry.\n\n  I have a letter from the H.K. Canning company which states that they \nare going to be forced out of business because of the high costs of \nenergy today in California.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both of those letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  California State\n\n\n                                           Floral Association,\n\n                                 Sacramento, CA, February 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator, Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The California State Floral \n     Association represents retail florists, wholesale florists \n     and cut flower growers in California. We are very concerned \n     about the impacts the current energy crisis is having on our \n     members. Of particular concern is the skyrocketing natural \n     gas price as well as recent concern over natural gas \n     availability and the possibility that gas customers including \n     nurseries will have their gas service curtailed.\n       The energy crisis in California will have major economic \n     ramifications on the state. We know you understand the \n     seriousness of this situation. The unstable supply of all \n     energy resources and the escalating costs of natural gas, \n     diesel, propane and electricity have placed enormous new \n     economic burdens on our industry. Our product is highly \n     perishable and power outages can cause significant losses in \n     a very short period of time. We have a very real concern that \n     many of our members may be forced out of business. We face \n     economic losses from the grower through the marketing chain \n     to the retail florist.\n       While our state decision makers have devoted most of their \n     attention to the supply and cost of electrical energy, it is \n     the high cost of natural gas that is of the greatest concern \n     to our grower members. They have seen their natural gas bills \n     increase by five to six fold. For example, one of our \n     nurseries reports having their monthly gas bills increase \n     from $26,000 in December of 1999 to $145,000 in January of \n     2001. Other nurseries report similar increases in the cost of \n     natural gas. Since farmers are price takers not price makers, \n     these costs cannot be passed on. Some growers have reduced \n     production, laid off employees and had to reduce employee \n     benefits just to stay in business.\n       The flower industry is an important contributor to the \n     agricultural revenues of this state. Cut flowers account for \n     over $300 million dollars in farm gate revenues and all \n     ornamentals total over $700 million statewide. California is \n     also the number one flower producing state in the country. \n     Yet the future of the cut flower industry is not bright.\n       We know that many in our nation's Capitol believe our \n     energy crisis to be a ``California Problem'' and that it \n     should be remedied through state action. While there may be \n     some validity to this view with regard to the shortage of \n     electrical energy, we believe this to be a grossly inaccurate \n     perspective relative to the natural gas crisis in our state. \n     The problem of natural gas availability and manipulative \n     pricing needs to be dealt with at the federal level.\n       In light of the above, we urge you to do everything in your \n     power to get the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission (FERC) \n     to act immediately to stop the predatory gas pricing \n     practices being perpetrated against California consumers. \n     FERC has the ability to mitigate the anti-competitive \n     conditions that exist in the marketing and delivery of \n     natural gas. As we understand it, they have the opportunity \n     to do this through two cases pending before them brought by \n     two of our utilities. They have the responsibility to take \n     such action under their charge as an oversight commission and \n     the statutory authority under which they operate. And they \n     need to take such action soon or many flower growers will not \n     survive this crisis.\n       We desperately need your assistance in this time of great \n     need. Please make this issue your highest priority. We thank \n     you in\n\n[[Page S4068]]\n\n     advance for any help you can provide and are awaiting your \n     response.

K. Canning, Inc. We have 81 employees with families that \n     in total represent approximately 350 people. We all need your \n     help desperately.\n       We purchase Natural Gas to power our steam boiler for \n     processing soups and vegetables. The attached cost summary \n     shows that for the last five years our volume of BTUs has \n     remained constant along with the cost for these BTUs. \n     However, until recently, our Natural Gas bill has risen seven \n     (7) times over previous months without using any additional \n     BTUs.\n       This is going to force us out of business! Profit margins \n     in the food processing business are very tight, as we are all \n     aware of what happened to Tri-Valley Growers in Stockton, CA. \n     We have also seen our Worker's Compensation costs triple \n     since 1999 with no cost control implementation. California is \n     in trouble. We are in trouble and the government is moving to \n     slow!!!\n       We, and our employees, need your help now.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Henry Knaust,\n                                                        President.\n       Enclosure.\n\n                                H.K.

Mr. President, I have a letter from California State \nSenator K. Maurice Johannessen. This letter points out that the Shasta \nPaper Company is now closing its doors because of rising natural gas \nprices and the suspension that has resulted on pulp production. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      California State Senate,\n\n                                Sacramento, CA, December 15, 2000.\n\n     Re: Request for Immediate Intervention\n\n     Hon. Gray Davis,\n     State Capitol,\n     Sacramento, CA.\n       Dear Governor Davis: The State of California currently \n     teeters on the brink of a major energy crisis that threatens \n     the well-being of citizens, communities, and the economy. The \n     significant increase in natural gas prices and looming energy \n     shortages have caused distress among many Californians. \n     Couple that with the decision by the United States Forest \n     Service to halt operations in National Forests, including \n     forest thinning, fire hazard reduction, and ground disturbing \n     activities, and we have a formula for disaster brewing in our \n     state.\n       In my district alone, the Shasta Paper Company (the only \n     remaining paper pulp mill in the state) had to close its \n     doors last week because of rising natural gas prices and the \n     suspension on pulp production. Although they were able to \n     reopen this week, they have been forced to do so on a limited \n     basis, with a substantial reduction in their workforce. They \n     have taken an enormous financial hit and are in danger of \n     being priced out of their ability to operate in the future.\n       The Shasta Paper Company employs nearly 450 people with a \n     payroll of approximately $1 million per week and revenues of \n     $144 million yearly. The closing of this plant will not only \n     devastate the area but deprive the entire state of the \n     benefits from this valuable enterprise. They are currently \n     considering alternatives to natural gas but will require a \n     temporary waiver of emission standards to remain viable. In \n     the meantime, many once productive members of the workforce \n     are left to wonder about their personal financial situations.\n       Burney Forest Power is a 31 megawatt biomass fueled co-\n     generation plant located in Shasta County that is capable of \n     supplying power to about 25,000 homes. At a time when every \n     megawatt produced in the state is precious, the USFS decides \n     to suspend all timber-related activities to the detriment of \n     biomass power plants throughout California. While industries \n     are laying off workers due to the cost of natural gas, these \n     same workers are being asked to pay higher fuel and energy \n     costs. The financial impacts to individuals, communities, \n     social service agencies, and industries may cause irreparable \n     damage statewide.\n       I understand that the actions of the USFS were the result \n     of lawsuits filed by the Earth Island Institute and other \n     environmental groups as an interim settlement. The agreement \n     was for suspension by the USFS ``not to offer, advertise, \n     auction or award any timber sales within the Sierra Nevada \n     Framework planning area'' from December 11, 2000 to March 1, \n     2001, or 30 days after the Record of Decision is issued for \n     the Sierra Nevada Framework Final Environmental Impact \n     Statement.\n       Earth Island Institute asserts in their suit that the area \n     not only has suitable habitat for the California Spotted Owl \n     but also that the Sierra Nevada province may contain \n     potentially suitable habitat for the Pacific Fisher. The USFS \n     agreed to expand the area of consideration from suitable \n     habitat for the California Spotted Owl and suitable or \n     potentially suitable habitat for Fisher to include the entire \n     Sierra Nevada planning area!\n       I do not believe that the USFS took into account the \n     impacts on biomass power producers and other industries when \n     they entered into this agreement. It is not difficult to see \n     the effect that the loss of these power producers can and \n     will have on northern Californians as we enter into the \n     coldest months of the year. What impact can we reasonably \n     project on the cost of doing business in northern California \n     when many enterprises rely on natural gas to operate? If \n     biomass producers are hindered or shut down, the demand for \n     natural gas will increase, causing an even greater strain on \n     the current situation.\n       Governor Davis, California already suffers from \n     skyrocketing gas and energy prices and the state is in a near \n     emergency situation. You have sought to preserve current \n     supplies and I am confident that you will be anxious to \n     prevent further hardship to the citizens of California. We \n     are already facing the threat of rolling blackouts and \n     government offices within California have been directed to \n     implement energy conservation strategies and actions in \n     response to current and expected shortages.\n       I do not believe that the USFS acted maliciously when they \n     entered into the agreement, however, I do feel that the \n     action was shortsighted. To have not consulted with the \n     Governor of a state where such actions will cause harm is \n     irresponsible, unconscionable, and unacceptable.\n       I am requesting that you intervene with the Department of \n     Justice to provide a temporary waiver for emission standards \n     and address the United States Forest Service's action to \n     cease all timber-related operations in the Sierra Nevada \n     planning area.\n       Your immediate consideration is greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           K. Maurice Johannessen,\n                                      Assistant Republican Leader.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last week I reported that C Sugar, \nthe only sugar refinery on the west coast, that had employed 1,000 \npeople, closed its doors for 5 days. Its cost of steam went from \n$450,000 a month to $2 million a month. I would like to update that \nreport. That company is now looking for a special bridge loan. If it is \nunable to find that loan, the only sugar refinery on the west coast \nwill have to permanently close its doors.\n  These complaints are all centered on natural gas prices. People have \nnot yet been hit with the 40-percent increases planned for the average \nratepayer in electricity this month. This does not even address \ngasoline prices which some are predicting may reach $3 a gallon in \nCalifornia this summer. So\n\n[[Page S4069]]\n\nthings are going to get a lot worse before they get better.\n  The California Independent System Operator has said that the State \nwill be 2,000 to 5,000 megawatts short in meeting its energy needs. In \nother words, millions of homes and businesses are at risk of being \nblacked out, maybe every day. This affects traffic lights, ATMs, \nfarmers, assembly lines. It affects vineyards; it affects small \nhospitals--and the list goes on and on.\n  Since January, the State Department of Water Resources has been \npurchasing all of California's power needs because of the poor \nfinancial condition of the State's utilities. Last week, I updated my \ncolleagues in the Senate on the amount the State has spent so far to \nkeep the lights on. At that time, it was $5.2 billion. In the last \nweek, that number has gone up by $1 billion, to $6.2 billion. And the \nState continues to buy power at the rate of $73 million a day.\n  The implications of these high power prices are devastating to the \nState. In fact, State budget officials are already making deep cuts in \nCalifornia's $105 billion budget that the Governor will sign into law \nin late June. Last week, the California State Senate Budget Committee \nchairman called on the Budget Committee to come up with a list of cuts \ntotaling $2 to $4 billion to compensate for higher energy costs so far.\n  I would like to put the costs in perspective. California, as I said, \nis spending $73 million a day on power. How much is that? It is enough \nto fund the annual budget of the Santa Ana Police Department. It is \none-fourth of the cost to run California's entire judicial system for 1 \nyear. It would provide health coverage for almost 300,000 working \nfamilies in the State. And it is gone in 1 day.\n  As I have said before, the major problem was a flawed deregulation \nbill passed in 1996 called AB 1890. However, the State is doing today \nall it can to increase supply and reduce demand. The State will have an \nadditional 3,572 megawatts on line by the end of the summer and an \nadditional 6,923 megawatts on line before the end of 2003, and by 2004 \nthe State expects to add 20,000 more megawatts. That is enough power \nfor 20 million additional homes.\n  The problem is in the interim. The problem is the absence of price \nstability. The State spent $7 billion in 1999 for energy--total--$32 \nbillion in the year 2000, and it is estimated to spend $65 billion in \n2001. Simply stated, this is the result of price gouging. Simply \nstated, it is a Federal responsibility to provide a period of \nreliability and stability in price before we bankrupt every industry in \nthe State of California and close businesses from Eureka to San Diego. \nThe Pacific Northwest is in the same crisis, and the Midwest and other \nregions will be as well, unless the FERC takes action.\n  Yesterday, the Commission ordered the Williams Company to refund $8 \nmillion for withholding power. This is the first action of its kind. \nThe Commission found that this generator improperly shut down plants \nwith the implicit understanding that withholding power from the market \nwould drive up prices. Even to the most conservative Member in this \nbody, this is evidence of manipulation of the market in California to \ndrive up energy prices. The FERC found it, and the agreement was that \nWilliams will pay $8 million in a refund.\n\n  This firm has admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. However, it \nshould be clear that what was alleged was that they took key generating \nunits in Long Beach and Huntington Beach offline in April and May of \nlast year. Williams said it settled to end the matter and that they \nwould have been exonerated had FERC pursued the case. Initially, FERC \nhad sought a refund of about $10.8 million but settled for the $8 \nmillion in the compromise agreement.\n  Today, Pacific Gas and Electric, a very large investor-owned utility, \nis in bankruptcy in chapter 11. Southern California Edison, the \ndistributor of power to 11 million people, is very close to bankruptcy. \nShould the agreement forged by the Governor not go through, that \nutility will be in bankruptcy.\n  Yesterday, a divided State senate appropriations committee approved a \nbill that would impose a windfall profits tax on electricity sellers \nwho gouge California consumers. Revenue from the tax would flow back to \nCalifornians in the form of a credit on their State income tax, \nstarting next April 15. On a 7-3 vote, Democrats on the committee voted \nfor the bill, Republicans lined up against it. The measure moved to the \nSenate floor, where it will require a simple majority of 21 votes and \nis expected to pass. The Governor has said he is open to signing a \nwindfall profits bill, but he has not publicly lobbied for the passage \nof the bill.\n  Yesterday, the Vice President made an energy speech. I would like to \nsay a few things about it.\n  In his first extensive remarks about the energy recommendations his \nCabinet-level task force will make to the President by the end of May, \nthe Vice President blamed current shortages on shortsighted decisions \nin the past. The Vice President said that conservation, while perhaps \n``a sign of personal virtue,'' does not make for sound or comprehensive \npolicy. The Vice President promised ``a mix of new legislation, some \nexecutive action as well as private initiatives'' to cope with rising \nenergy prices and growing demand. He definitely rejected turning to \nprice controls, tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or creating \nnew bureaucracies.\n  Over the next two decades, it will take between 1,300 and 1,900 new \npower plants--or one every week for 20 years--just to meet projected \nincreases in nationwide demand, Mr. Cheney said. And he said, ``Without \na clear, coherent energy strategy for the nation, all Americans could \none day go through what Californians are experiencing now, or even \nworse.''\n  I have been really disappointed and surprised with this \nadministration's attention to the energy crisis. I have written to the \nPresident three times now asking to meet with him and explain the \nsituation. So far, he has not yet agreed to meet with me.\n  The Vice President and the Energy Secretary through this Presidential \nTask Force are talking about how the Federal Government is going to \nhelp. However, adding 1,600 new power plants over the next 20 years is \nnot the answer we need. Nobody questions that we need more supply in \nthe long term. But we have a situation where prices have been spiking \nfor almost a year in California and about 6 months in other parts of \nthe Northwest, where the Northwest is experiencing the driest hydro \nyear on record. This is where we need the help.\n  This is where the Federal Government has a duty to help. California \nand the Northwest badly need a period of stability and reliability, and \nthis is where the Federal Government can help. I argue that this is \nwhere the Federal Government has a duty to step in and protect \nconsumers from being gouged. As I said, California is adding 20,000 new \nmegawatts itself which is the equivalent of forty new average-sized \nplants, without any Federal prompting.\n  Lastly, I am also quite surprised that the Vice President, in his \nremarks yesterday, essentially said that wind, solar, geothermal and \nother renewable energy sources are still too far into the future and \nthe future is all fossil fuels.\n  Even if that were true, the truth of the matter is that nuclear \npower, for instance, takes years and years to cite and there is nothing \nthis administration can do to help with the supply we need this summer \nand next summer.\n  I, again, urge my colleagues to support Senator Gordon Smith and I \nand force FERC to take action and address the problem. The alternative \nmay be an economic disaster for the entire country this summer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate on \neducation reform for the last few days. I think it is interesting we \nare talking about two different things. I hear Senator Wellstone and \nSenator Kennedy talk about money. Everything is about money. We are \nabsolutely convinced if we don't have reform of our public education \nsystem, throwing the rest of the Federal budget at it will not work. We \nwill not see improvements if we don't reform the underlying system.\n  Our public education system is failing. It is failing because there \nis such a variation of standards. Some of our public schools are \nterrific, but they are not all terrific. Some are even abysmal. That is \nnot the standard of quality for public education we should stand for in \nthis country. We are trying to reform the system so there will be a \nstandard under which any child in this country who is educated in our \npublic schools will be a child who can reach his or her full potential \nso that no child will be left behind. We are trying to set a minimum \nstandard that every child must meet or, if the child doesn't, that we \nwill give that child help.\n  We have seen the high school dropout rates. They are alarming in some \nareas of our country. What is interesting, when we go to the root of \nthe problem and we talk to these young people who have dropped out of \nhigh school in despair, there is a basic reason. The basic reason is \nthey can't read.\n  Why not go down to the third grade and catch these young people who \nare having problems reading and give them a chance to have the full \nability to absorb the education they are receiving? If we shuffle them \nfrom one grade to the next grade to the next grade, a social promotion, \nand they still can't read in the 10th grade, who is surprised that the \nchildren are frustrated? They are sitting in classes, trying to learn \nalgebra, math, science, history, and geography, and they don't have \nthird grade reading skills. Of course they are going to be frustrated.\n  What we are proposing is an accountability, a standard, that says \nevery child will be tested in the third grade. If that child isn't \nreading at grade level in the third grade, we are going to hold them \nback. We are going to give them tutors. We are going to give them the \ntools they need to be able to participate in their education and in \nthis country the future.\n  That is what reform is. Reform is not just throwing more money at the \nproblem. Reform is getting parents involved, in getting teachers, in \ngetting principals involved, in letting the local school districts make \nthe decisions about what will be the best for the individual children \nin that district. That is what reform is. It is not throwing money at \nit and having regulations coming out of Washington, DC.\n  We are trying to set a standard by which every child in this country \nwill be able to read at grade level in the third grade. I think we are \ngoing to see the test scores soar across our country if we can get over \nthe hurdle of talking just about money and start talking about reform.\n  Reform includes accountability. A lot of people wring their hands and \ntalk about tests: We don't want tests; we don't want too many \nartificial tests; we don't want teachers teaching to the tests. If we \nare testing for the basic skills, why wouldn't we teach to the test and \nimprove what the children are learning? If we teach to the test and the \ntest is fundamental reading, fundamental math, fundamental science, \nfundamental history, then we need to have a standard by which to judge \nwhat is happening in our schools.\n  Another reform is reporting, making sure that parents have the tools \nand the information to make the best decisions for their children. In \nfact, if a parent doesn't know how the school is doing and how the \nchildren in the school are doing, how can they know their children are \ngetting the best opportunity that is available?\n  In my State, we have a report card. It is called the Just For Kids \nProgram. The test scores of every elementary and junior high school--\nand we are going now through the high schools--in Texas will have a \nreport card that shows the test scores and how the test scores have \ngrown in that particular school. If that school is compared to other \nschools in the same socioeconomic, demographic area and that school \ndoes not compare well, the parents then have the information and the \nparents will be able to say to the principal, wait a minute, why is \nthis school not performing? We want to give parents the ability to \nquestion. We think by questioning, we can see improvements.\n  We are talking about reform, not money. We are talking about doing \nthings a different way. We are talking about reading at grade level in \nthe third grade so in the eighth grade the child will have the chance \nto learn the higher math, the history, the algebra. We are talking \nabout accountability testing, to see if the children are keeping up, to \nsee if we can go to the heart of the problem, if there is one, and fix \nit while we still have a chance, before the young person has, in utter \nfrustration, dropped out of high school. We get them at the lower level \nand we give them the chance to compete.\n  We also have report cards. We have report cards so parents will be \narmed with knowledge. Parents can go to the principal and say, why \nisn't this school performing? That is the most powerful force we can \npossibly have. If there is a coverup, if there is no test, if there is \nnothing by which the parents can judge the performance, of course, \neveryone is going to be silent and we will have continued failure.\n  These are the elements of reform that will make a difference in the \nsystem. This is what we are talking about when we talk about doing \nthings in a different way in our country. We are not talking about just \nthrowing more money at it, although the President's plan does increase \neducation spending by over 11 percent, the largest increase of any part \nof his budget.\n  Yes, we are going to spend more money but we are going to make sure \nthat the money goes directly to the school districts with standards \nthat we would ask them to meet. We would ask them to meet those \nstandards in their own way, not in some federally mandated way that \nmight not be right for the children in those particular school \ndistricts.\n  I am very pleased that we are finally on this bill, and I hope we are \ngoing to come out with something that will show the parents of this \ncountry that there really is hope; there is hope for a different way; \nthere is hope for the future for their children in public schools.\n  Mr. President, I am now very pleased to yield the floor to the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask to proceed for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of a variety of sections \nof this piece of legislation. I certainly want to second the comments \nof the Senator from Texas, who has pointed out some of the significant \nstrengths of the bill.\n  Let me talk about one specific area that I think needs clarity, and \nthen some additional amendments I hope to offer to give parents more \noptions.\n  The question of quality education I think we all understand is \nparental involvement. It is a good teacher, a good principal, but, most \nimportantly it is a parent who gets involved in their child's daily \nactivity of going to school and learning. Unfortunately, the Federal \nrole in education has historically undermined the ability of the parent \nto be a participant in that activity. In fact, title I, as it has been \nstructured over the last 25-30 years, has been a school-based, \nbureaucracy-based funding mechanism. It has not been directed at \nbenefiting the child so much\n\n[[Page S4071]]\n\nas benefiting the bureaucracy which in turn theoretically benefits the \nchild. As a result, I would argue that that is probably one of the \nprimary reasons title I has failed, and ``failure'' I define is the \nfact that today the low-income child reads at two grade levels below \ntheir peers, and that is the same level of inefficiency or inability \nthat the low-income child was reading at 20 years ago.\n  We have seen a huge amount of money spent on title I over the last 20 \nyears--$120 billion--but we have seen, in fact, no improvement in the \nperformance of low-income children. So they have been, even though we \nhave been spending a lot of money on the program, left behind.\n  This bill tries to address that issue. One of the ways it addresses \nit is as follows. It attempts to empower the parents, giving the \nparents a little bigger say in how their children are taught. If you \nare a parent and you are in a failing school, under today's rules, you \nhave no rights. Your child is stuck in that school and there is \nvirtually nothing you can do to help your child. Under this bill, what \nwe say is if a school fails in the first year, we are going to come in \nwith some additional resources to that school, significantly additional \nresources, and we are going to try to help that school improve. But if \nthe school is failing in the second year, we are going to do some other \nthings to try to improve that school. We are going to replace some \npeople. We are going to try to dramatically improve the curriculum and, \nagain, we are going to fund that. But if by the third year the school \nis still failing, we are going to say to the parent: All right, you \nhave the right to do something with your children to try to improve \ntheir education because it is very obvious that you are not getting the \nbenefit you need as a result of the way the school is functioning.\n  Unfortunately, I would like to have accelerated that so it would \nhappen in the second year, but the agreement is that in the third year \nif a child is in a failing school that has failed for 3 years, the \nparent will have the right to get that child supplemental assistance \noutside the school system so that if that child is failing in reading \nor that child is failing in math, the parent, at the parent's option, \nwill be able to take their child and get additional assistance for that \nchild after school or maybe during recess time, however the school \nwants to set it up, so that that child can go away from the school to a \nSylvan Learning Center, to another public school or to a private \nparochial school for the purposes of getting remedial assistance in the \nacademic area where the child needs help.\n  The child still remains a pupil in the public school system. This is \nnot an option of leaving the public school system and going into a \nprivate school system. Rather, this is an option of allowing the parent \nto get supplemental assistance for that child and allow the child to \nhave the assistance he or she needs in order to bring the child up to \nspeed because he or she has been in this failing school now for at \nleast 3 years--they may have been in it longer--and they are way \nbehind. Under most scenarios, you are going to find they are way \nbehind. So this is an attempt to bring them back up to speed with \nspecial tutorial support.\n\n  What does this mean? For the first time it empowers the parent to do \nsomething when their child is stuck in a failing school. Who are we \ntalking about? We are not talking about middle class parents for the \nmost part. We are certainly not talking about wealthy parents. What we \nare talking about for the most part are single moms, many of them in \nurban societies, who have virtually no options for their children, and \nwe are going to give that single mother an option. We are going to \nallow that single mother to take her child and get some assistance in \nmath or reading.\n  That language has been agreed to and put in this bill. Some have \ncalled it choice. It is not a choice; it is sort of hybrid of choice. \nIt was an idea I came up with more than 3 years ago and got consensus--\nin fact, so much consensus that folks on the other side are announcing \nit was their idea. We are happy to have many authors of it because it \nis a good idea. But it really is the first step in the effort to try to \nempower parents.\n  The second step is equally important. It is not in the bill, \nunfortunately. That is to take a few schools that we know are failing \nand that have failed year in and year out and say to the parents of \nthose kids in those schools: We are going to give you a full option of \nchoice. We are going to put the pressure on that school to perform, and \nif it does not perform we are going to allow you to put your child in \nanother school, either a public school or a private school. Under this \nbill there is an option to take your child out and put them in a public \nschool after being in a failing school, but there is no option to go to \na private school.\n  Now, this is the classic choice situation. This is what we call \nportability. The idea is instead of having the money go to the school \nsystems which have taken this money and produced year in and year out a \nfailing school, to say to the parents: The money is going to go to your \nchild; it is going to be strapped on the back of your child with a \nbackpack, and you can take that money and your child and you can put \nthem in a different learning climate. But when you do that, the \nconditions are going to be that your child has to learn. That is the \nonly thing we are going to hold you to. Your child is going to have to \nstart to achieve as a result of leaving that school and going to \nanother school, whether public or private. Your child is going to have \nto start achieving at the level that they should have achieved to be \ncomparable with or equal to a child in their grade level who is in a \nschool that is performing well.\n  We are going to expect academic achievement, and we are going to have \naccountability standards expecting academic achievement for you, the \nparent, having the right to take your child and the money that is \nsupposedly supporting your child, the Federal money--and, really, we \nare only talking about low-income parents; we are not talking about the \ngeneral population--to another school.\n  Now, does this idea work? Yes, it does. This idea is already being \nused in Milwaukee, for example, and it has been extraordinarily \nsuccessful. It is being used in Arizona, and it has been successful. \nThe fact is, there are a lot of school systems out there that are \nwilling to pursue this type of idea.\n  It should be noted that we are not going to suggest that this be done \nunilaterally by the Federal Government or that the parent have the \nunilateral right to make this decision. Rather, what we are suggesting \nis that there be two conditions present. First, that before this option \nof a choice or portability is given to the parents, the local school \ndistrict, the local elected public school district, must opt into the \nprogram.\n  You will probably say that will never happen. It will actually \nhappen. That is what happened in Milwaukee. The local elected officials \nwho were responsible for education decided in this case that it wasn't \nthe school district but it was the town council that decided they \nwanted to give parental choice. They wanted portability. If a local \nelected board, which is charged with the education responsibility of \nthe children in that school district and, therefore, has the \nresponsibility for public education, decides that as one of the \nelements of its educational system it wishes to give parents of kids \nwho are in failing schools where the school has failed for at least 3 \nyears the option and the ability to move that child to a private \nschool, they will have that option but only if that idea is supported \nby the public entity which has legal authority over the public school \nsystem.\n  It is not a top-down decision. It is not even a unilateral parental \ndecision.\n  The second condition we have is that no title I money will be used \nfor this exercise. This will be a new funding stream so that the \nportability initiative or the choice initiative--however you want to \ncall it--will not be a drain on title I funding in the school districts \nbut, rather, will be a separate funding stream that will be available \nto the community that decides to opt into this.\n  So as to the argument that this is going to somehow undermine the \npublic school system, we punch a hole in that balloon by pointing out \nthat the public school system makes the decision to go down this road. \nAs for the argument it is going to undermine the funding mechanisms for \ntitle I kids, we punch a hole in that by making it clear\n\n[[Page S4072]]\n\nthat the funding mechanism is independent of the title I dollars and, \ntherefore, has no impact at all on title I.\n  Those two red herrings can then be set aside, although I am sure we \nwill hear a lot about them when the amendment is offered.\n  The real argument is, interestingly enough, by the Washington Post, a \npaper with which I don't often agree, editorializing this last Saturday \nin favor of giving parents some options--especially low-income parents, \nand especially single mothers in urban communities who have no options \ntoday as a result of giving them those options and bringing competition \ninto the school system, and it is competition that produces quality in \nour society, whether you choose to go to a Burger King over a \nMcDonald's because of the competition or a McDonald's over the Burger \nKing. In education we have no competition today. We have no force for \nimprovement that comes from the marketplace or that comes from the \npressure of having to perform in order to get clients.\n  This will introduce that into the system, and, most importantly, it \nwill give hope to parents--in particular, single moms, especially in \nurban communities, mostly from minority districts--hope that their \nchildren will have the opportunity to live the American dream and that \ntheir children will have the opportunity to be educated.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Alabama in allowing me \nto go first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor his steadfast leadership on matters involving education. He has \nserved on the Education Committee, on which I serve now, for quite a \nnumber of years. He is a champion and a visionary and a person who \nreally cares about children and wants to improve education in America. \nHe has been very successful in making that happen.\n  I had the opportunity last week to spend a day with Dr. Rod Paige, \nthe President's Secretary of Education. Dr. Paige is an extraordinary \nindividual. He has lived the kind of life we want to happen in America. \nHe grew up in Monticello, MS. His parents were both educators. He \nplayed ball and coached at Jackson State. He then went on to become \ndean of the education school at Texas Southern, and was on the school \nboard at Houston. Houston was looking for a new superintendent of their \neducation system. They were troubled about how they were getting along. \nThings weren't going well. There are 207,000 students in that system. \nIt is the seventh largest education system in America that had a number \nof children who had difficulty with the English language, with a \ndiverse racial and socioeconomic makeup. It was a real challenge.\n  When he took over, only 37 percent of the students in that school \nsystem were passing the basic Texas test. He took it on with a passion \nthat this could not continue. He had been a dean of an education \nschool. He said: If I knew what I know now about training teachers, I \nwould have done things a lot differently when I was dean. But he still \ntook over that system, and it was in trouble.\n  He identified schools that were failing, and he did not allow it to \ncontinue. He took action on failing schools. He cracked down on \ndiscipline. He said we must have discipline. We cannot have a school \nsystem that has a reputation that it is not safe to come to it and \nwhere teachers continue to feel unsafe and where students don't feel \nsafe. He improved discipline dramatically.\n  He ended social promotion--the idea of just passing children along \neven if they are not learning the basic requirements of that grade. He \nsaid that cannot continue.\n  He began a rigorous system of testing--not because he wanted to harm \nthe children or because he wanted to pigeonhole students, but he wanted \nto find out diagnostically as part of the education process where they \nwere academically.\n  He said quite convincingly that if a child reaches the fourth grade \nand they are way behind in reading and math, they probably will never \ncatch up. You have a rare opportunity in those early grades to \nconstrict failure and turn it around. That is what he decided to do. He \ndid those things.\n  As a result, in 5 years, from 1995 to the year 2000, he nearly \ndoubled the number of students passing that basic Houston, TX, test. It \nwent from 37 percent to 73 percent, one percentage point below doubling \nthat figure in just 5 years.\n  I think that is an extraordinary achievement. He said he was able to \nachieve some additional financial support, but not much really until \nthe last year after he had proven that he could achieve success.\n  What he said they did was the very thing I just mentioned. They did \nnot want to leave a child behind. How do you leave a child behind? You \ndon't test them. You let them go by law to a school that is \ndysfunctional, that is not working, and that is not effective. You \nwon't let them go to any other school in the system. They don't have \nmoney to go outside the system. You just say: Tough luck, child. We are \ntaking care of it. We are giving that school as much money as we give \nthe next school. But you have to go there even if it is a failing \nschool.\n  Dr. Paige said we cannot do that anymore. I know the Senator from New \nHampshire is a strong believer in choice. So is Dr. Paige. Most school \nsystems, I am sure, wouldn't adopt the option that we provide them. But \nHouston did. Dr. Paige said: It did not hurt the public schools. It \nmade us better, and in fact after a period of years with our test \nscores going up, our success rate going up, and our discipline problem \ngoing down, the number of students coming to the public schools \nincreased. We were drawing people from private schools. He said public \nschools can and will win the battle if they do the things necessary to \nachieve success.\n  I will just echo that. I taught a year. My wife taught 4 years. Our \nchildren attended public schools for most of their career. My two \ndaughters graduated from one of the big inner-city schools in Mobile, \nAL. We were on the PTA and have a lot of great friends who are \nteachers. I have visited 25 schools in Alabama this past year.\n  I think I have some appreciation for what education is all about. \nYes, we want to get as much money as possible for education. In fact, \nthe Federal Government has increased federal spending on education by \n50 percent since 1994.\n  This year's budget has an additional 11.5 percent proposed increase \nfor education. But it is deeper than that. We have to ask ourselves: \nWhat is happening with the money we are spending? There are States that \nspend a lot more money than other States. There can be schools in the \nsame town, in the same system, receiving the same amount of money per \nstudent, and one school is functioning well and maybe the another one \nis not.\n  We have to ask ourselves: What is occurring in our school systems \nthat is not healthy? There is a legitimate concern that public policy \nhas responded to the system. We have tried to do what the system says; \nand the system says, basically, we do not want testing and \naccountability; we just want more money. Just give us more money, and \nwe will do better.\n  For the most part, schools in the United States have had increased \nfunding per student over the last decade or more. But, unfortunately, \nthe numbers have not gone up. The Federal Government has spent $125 \nbillion in trying to narrow the gap between low-income students and \nupper-income students, and the gap has not narrowed, it has widened in \nsome areas.\n  We still have very disturbing test scores in math and science that \nshow we are not competitive with the rest of the industrial world. I \nthink that is so obvious as to be without dispute.\n  What is it we are doing wrong in education? You go to Japan, and they \nhave classes with 50 or 60 children in a class. We have much smaller \nclasses than that, but our numbers are not where we they need to be. So \nwhat is the problem?\n  I think Dr. Paige and the President's plan is focusing on a couple of \ncore events: Do not let a child fall behind. Leave no child behind. \nFind out at the earliest possible time if they are not keeping up. Do \nwhat needs to be done to then intervene. Do not let parents think that \njust because Billy is going\n\n[[Page S4073]]\n\nto school every day, that Billy is learning at a legitimate rate and \nprogressing effectively. Those tests will tell on the school. They will \ntell on the students. And the parents will be much more engaged.\n  Alabama has done that. My State has stepped forward. It has one of \nthe toughest testing systems in America. It demands that students meet \ncertain minimum standards. The students are achieving more.\n  Some say: I just don't like these tests mandated by the Federal \nGovernment. They direct policy in teaching and teachers have to teach \nto the test. But if the test is a good test, and the test determines \nwhether or not a child can handle basic math or can read and write, and \nteachers are teaching to that test, I say, well done. I say that is \nprogress.\n  We need good testing, developed by the States, that will test basic \nreading and math improvement skills. If we know that, if we are \nknowledgeable about whether or not they are making progress, then we \ncan help that child get even better. If they are not making progress, \nwe can confront it. If a teacher or school is consistently failing, and \nnot meeting those standards, perhaps at that point we need to confront \nthe leadership at that school. Maybe we can find better leadership and \nimprove those test scores. Because the American taxpayer, the American \ncitizen, is entitled to know whether or not their money is producing \nresults. How much more basic can it be? We are talking about giving \nmore money and having no accountability?\n  In the 4 years I have been in this body, I have learned that many of \nour friends on the other side of the aisle say: You just want to send \nmore money to the schools without accountability. And I do want to send \nmore money to the schools with less strings and less paperwork. I \ndefinitely believe in that. But the question is, what is \naccountability? What do we mean when we say ``accountability''?\n\n  If you listen to many in this body, accountability is whether or not \nan individual school gets the money that we appropriate and that they \ndo with it precisely what is said here. That is what they determine to \nbe accountability. We have 700 Federal Government education programs. \nCan you imagine that--700? It is hard to believe.\n  So they say, you cannot consolidate those problems. You cannot send \nthe money down to an elementary school that wants to revamp its entire \nreading program, to spend $20,000 to develop a program that will be \neffective for the next decade to improve reading in their school where \nthey have a vision and a passion for it and they just can't wait to do \nit. They don't have the money, and we say: No, you can't do that. You \nhave to spend it for one of our little 700 projects.\n  What I have learned is--and as I have thought about it--that is a \nwrong view of accountability. Accountability is having a learning \ncurve. Are children improving? Are they better able to read now than \nthey were last month or last year? That is what accountability is. You \ncannot do that without testing. Almost every school system knows that. \nVirtually every school system tests, although there is a fierce, \ndogmatic, determined group of advocates who resist testing in every \nshape, form, or fashion. They fight it every way possible, with every \nkind of possible excuse.\n  But I repeat again, if you love those children, if you want to see \nthem reach the highest and best economic and social potential in the \nworld, you want them to be able the read and write. You want them to be \nable to do basic math. You want them to reach the highest possible \nachievement in trig, in chemistry, and physics, and the highest form of \nmathematics in their school systems. We want them to reach their \nfullest potential. That will not happen if they are not progressing \nsteadily every year.\n  So I believe we can do better. I believe if we focus on learning, and \nif we give our principals and our teachers more freedom to use the \nFederal resources in a way most effective for learning, they will use \nit that way. If we say: You will get even more freedom if your test \nscores improve, such as they did in Houston, the children will benefit \nfrom that additional freedom. I assure you, the local people will be \nmore willing to support a school that is showing progress than one that \nis not showing progress.\n  I will share this story. There is a principal in Alabama named \nDorothy Robinson. A number of years ago, she was a teacher in a rural \nschool in the county in which I grew up. She also grew up there and \ntaught in Packer's Bend. We call it ``across the river.'' Packer's Bend \nwas an isolated area across the river from the main part of the county. \nThey had a small school, and it was in big trouble. Test scores were \nnot good. The school was not in good shape. The county was about to \nclose it. They said they would.\n  Dorothy Robinson said: Don't close it. Give me a chance. I believe I \ncan turn this school around. It was on academic alert by the State. It \nwas the smallest high school in the State. She started that summer, got \nstudents together, and they helped clean up the school. They got \nparents involved to an extraordinary degree. She called her teachers \ntogether, and they decided they could improve test scores. They were \ngoing to do the things necessary to make that school be an effective \neducational institution. She worked at it, and was highly successful; \nand 4 years later they were running test scores as high as any in the \ncounty.\n  It was a really tremendous achievement done without any great \nappropriation of money, done by leadership and a determination to hold \nstudents accountable. She challenged them to be their very best. She \ndid not put up with excuses. And she moved them forward. In fact, the \nsuperintendent of education in Alabama has now hired her to help him \nset up programs for similar schools throughout the State.\n  Those kinds of improvements are happening in America. We need--as a \nSenate, as a Congress, and as a U.S. Government--to develop policies \nthat help those success stories occur more often. We need to help them \ndecide what to do fundamentally; and that is, to find out whether \nchildren are learning properly and to give those schools more freedom \nand flexibility to do that. If the schools continue to fail to teach \nour children, we need to give those children some option to reach \noutside that school. Because it is wrong; it is not right at its most \nfundamental level, to say to a poor child who has no other option but \nto go to public school: You must go to this failing school. You just go \nthere anyway.\n\n  This is what we do in American today mostly. The President is saying, \nif you can't get your school operating at the basic level, give them \nsome options, give them some choices. But fundamentally, if we do the \nthings Dr. Paige did in Houston, if we do the things Ms. Dorothy \nRobinson did at Packer's Bend, every school can move to the highest \npossible level. We can without any doubt substantially improve the \nlearning of children all over this Nation without any tremendous \nincrease in funding. It can be one of the greatest things this Nation \nhas ever done, not to leave a child behind, make sure every one is \nprogressing to their fullest potential.\n  We can do this. I am excited about it. The President was a Governor \nof a large State. He ran for Governor promising to do something about \neducation. He achieved some great improvements in Texas education, and \nhe wants to do it for America. It is not a pipe dream, it is a vision \nthat can be achieved and made a reality. I hope this Congress will not \njust continue business as usual, not just continue to function as an \narm of the establishment, but that we will confront our failure to come \nup with innovative solutions for improvement and to increase \nsubstantially the learning that occurs in classrooms in America, those \nmagic moments when a child and teacher gel and they learn. It is a \nthrilling thing. We need to further that and not the bureaucracy.\n  I look forward to the continued debate on this. It is time to bring \nthis bill up and make some changes for the better in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I begin by complimenting the Senator from \nAlabama and before him the Senator from New Hampshire, both of whom \nmade extraordinarily important points about the need for improvement in \nour education in the United States and about the single ingredient that \ncan do more to enhance their performance than any\n\n[[Page S4074]]\n\nother single thing; that is, more choice, more freedom in our education \nsystem, choice for parents so that their kids have a chance, and \nfreedom of local schools to experiment and to do what is in the best \ninterest of the kids in their local communities rather than having \npolicies dictated from Washington, DC.\n  In starting this process, I had very high hopes that we would be \nconsidering legislation in this Chamber that embodied this concept of \nchoice, of more freedom for parents and students to go to the schools \nthat were succeeding rather than being relegated to the poorer schools \nthat characterize all too many of our communities today. I had hoped we \nwould be able to pass and enact legislation that embodied an entirely \nnew approach to education in our country.\n  Sadly, I no longer have those hopes because the bill that came to us \nfrom the committee to the floor is a bill which does not embody all of \nthe President's ideas as he put forth. It is, in effect, the lowest \ncommon denominator, a bill that represents the consensus of all of \nthose people who had anything to do with it and, as a result, instead \nof embodying those new principles, those principles of reform, relies \nfar too heavily on the ideas of the past, the old model of Federal \neducation which assumed that improvement in student performance could \nbe secured through bureaucratic initiative alone. The old model ensured \nthat when policy details were hammered out, there was a seat at the \ntable for any special interest with a vested interest in existing \narrangements but literally no voice for students and parents.\n\n  Of course, the old education model was built on the premise that \nCongress' commitment to expanding opportunities to the disadvantaged, \nas well as to overall academic excellence, could be measured primarily \nby how many taxpayer dollars were spent. I believe we need a new model, \nand we should begin by recognizing that if we want to see revolutionary \nimprovement in education, we will need to consider the benefits of a \nsystem that is more dynamic than the monopoly model in place today.\n  An old rancher friend of mine told me, if you want to get out of a \nhole, the first thing you have to do is stop digging. The hole that our \neducational system is in today means that we have to stop making it \nworse by continuing the same policies. The only way we are going to \nimprove is if we allow freedom and choice of the local communities and \nthe parents to do what they think is best for their kids and for their \nstudents.\n  We have to begin by declaring independence from special interests. In \ncovering other areas of public policy, the news media constantly \ninsinuate that politicians are putting the well-being of the special \ninterests that help their campaigns ahead of the consumers' well-being. \nThat pretty well sums up the relationship between many politicians and \nthe defenders of the status quo in education. We need a debate about \nthe premise that more spending equals better results in education \nbefore we pass legislation influenced by that premise.\n  In fact, the history of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nmakes it clear that spending more taxpayers' money does not buy better \nresults. As an alternative hypothesis, I submit we will improve \neducation to the extent that we provide more freedom for families to \nobtain the kind of education they know is best for their children. I \nhope we will legislate accordingly.\n  Let's look at the state of elementary and secondary education in our \ncountry today. America is not educating a workforce that meets the \nneeds of the 21st century, let alone the needs of each student. Last \nyear Congress authorized the issuance of 297,500 new visas for highly \nskilled temporary workers to come to our country, and we had just \nraised the ceiling 2 years before. The reason? Not enough qualified \nAmerican workers were available to fill the jobs in the new American \neconomy. This situation is not likely to reverse itself based upon \ncurrent trends.\n  The results from the third international mathematics and science \nstudy show that American high school seniors rank 19 out of 21 \nindustrialized countries in math and 16 out of 21 nations in science. \nOver the past decade, the number of college degrees earned overall has \nincreased by 25 percent, but the number earned in the fields at the \nheart of the new economy--engineering, computer science, and things of \nthat sort--has grown by only 1 percent.\n  Moreover, too many people are being left behind in our education \nsystem: 37 percent of fourth graders test at the so-called below basic \nlevel in reading. That means essentially they are illiterate. For \nHispanic fourth graders the proportion is 58 percent. For African \nAmerican youngsters it is 63 percent. That is unacceptable. Only a \nthird of all fourth graders have attained proficiency in reading. Since \n1983, over 10 million Americans have reached the 12th grade without \nhaving learned to read at a basic level. Over 20 million have reached \ntheir senior year unable to do basic math.\n  As President Bush has repeatedly noted, too many of America's most \ndisadvantaged youngsters pass through public schools without receiving \nan adequate education. The President has correctly identified these \nshortchanged young Americans as victims of the soft bigotry of low \nexpectations.\n  For some the response to these problems will be to call for more \nmoney. I might note that Republican majorities in the Congress have \nprovided more money; for example, a record increase of 18 percent last \nyear. We will see even bigger increases this year given the priority \nPresident Bush has placed on this in his budget. But simply spending \nmore money on schools and school personnel has not produced educational \nimprovements.\n  Since 1965, real per pupil expenditures have increased from less than \n$3,000 to more than $7,000. During the same period, reading scores on \nthe National Assessment of Educational Progress have been static. So we \nhave well more than doubled the spending per pupil on education, and we \nhave no improvement in the test scores. Between 1960 and 1995, average \nclass size fell from 25.8 to 17.3. Inflation-adjusted average salaries \nfor U.S. public school teachers grew 45 percent from 1960 to 1995. Over \nthat same period, SAT scores plummeted.\n  As Secretary of Education Ron Paige has noted:\n\n       After spending $125 billion over 25 years, we have \n     virtually nothing to show for it.\n  Education special interests and the politicians who represent them \nhave lost the battle. Their last resort is to say we are not spending \nenough money. But we don't need a bidding war. What we need are reforms \nthat will bring results.\n  President Bush's original plan contained a number of worthwhile \nreforms in existing education programs. It called for cutting Federal \nredtape while bolstering accountability through meaningful assessments.\n  In addition to its accountability provisions, that plan contained a \nmodest school choice provision. To the President's great credit, the \nBush blueprint recognized that competitive pressure, and the threat of \nit, is essential to triggering the meaningful accountability that can \nspur improvement. That is the insight upon which we should be building.\n  We know that the benefits of education freedom are real and they are \ndramatic. One talented researcher, Harvard's Caroline Hoxby, has found \nthat expanding choice raises the demand for teachers with initiative \nand strong academic backgrounds. Currently, these are the teachers most \nlikely to leave the profession.\n  Professor Hoxby also found that when families are given a real choice \nof schools--as, for example, they have been in Cleveland and \nMilwaukee--significant improvements in test scores, graduation rates, \nand future incomes are registered by the students who leave their old \nschools and by those who stay because those schools have responded to \nthe challenge of competition and have improved accordingly.\n  Unfortunately, efforts to ally public policy with an agenda of \npromoting freedom in education have had only limited success. I am very \nproud that Arizona was ranked No. 1 last year on the Manhattan \nInstitute's Education Freedom Index, which ranked all 50 States. My \nState's reforms, for example, have led the way with the type of reforms \nI think we need at the Federal level, including the most liberal \ncharter school law in the country, a law\n\n[[Page S4075]]\n\nthat has led to the opening of more than 400 charter schools in \nArizona, which is about a third of all the charter schools in the \ncountry; open enrollment, which allows parents to enroll children in \nany public school and has the funds to follow the student; finally, an \nidea I plan to propose as a Federal policy--a tax credit that offsets \ncontributions Arizona families make to organizations that help give \nstudents the opportunity to attend a school of their choice.\n  This tax credit proposal builds on an idea that has already taken \noff, thanks to private philanthropists. In 1997, two distinguished \nbusiness leaders, Ted Forstmann and John Walton, invited applications \nfor 1,000 partial tuition scholarships for families in the District of \nColumbia. Nearly 8,000 applications were received. In 1998, they formed \nan organization called the Children's Scholarship Fund to apply the \nidea on a national basis. They planned to offer 40,000 scholarships, \nand 1.25 million applications were received.\n  This is an idea whose time has come. It is a concept Americans \nembrace. As impressive as these numbers are, these testimonials were \noffered by parents who have been pleading for better options.\n  One mother said the following about her experience:\n\n       We would not be able to afford this without your help. Our \n     daughter is really excited to be learning spelling and \n     grammer (which was not being taught in public school). She's \n     an aspiring writer and thinks this is great. My son has \n     autism, and his new school had more services in place for him \n     on the first day of school--without me even asking--than \n     we've been able to pull out of the public school in six \n     years! They both love their new schools and are doing well.\n\n  Here's another mother's testimony:\n\n       I am so excited that my son has been chosen to receive a \n     scholarship . . . One evening I sat on my bed and cried \n     because I really wanted him to attend a private school but I \n     know that I cannot afford all of the tuition. Therefore your \n     scholarship fund was my only hope.\n\n  Yet another mother wrote,\n\n       I cannot begin to tell you how grateful I am for this \n     opportunity to send my children to a private school. As a \n     low-income mother of four wonderful children with great \n     potential, I would not be able to provide this change for \n     them without your help.\n\n  This particular mother goes on to say,\n\n       I have chosen a school that will help nurture the seeds of \n     greatness in them. I am sure that with this opportunity to \n     succeed, my children will be successful and contribute \n     greatly to society in the future.\n\n  In 1997, leaders in my state settled on a plan to help the private \nsector to satisfy that vast unmet demand for options.\n  They instituted a state credit that allows Arizona residents to claim \na dollar-for-dollar income tax credit for donations to school tuition \norganizations--like the Children's Scholarship Fund.\n  Thanks to that program, 4,000 Arizona students--nearly all of them \nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds--have received scholarship assistance \nthat has made it possible for them to enroll in a school of their \nchoice.\n  The number of organizations offering scholarships in the state has \nshot up from two to 33.\n  Arizona's leaders understand the need for adequate resources for \neducation.\n  Last fall, Arizona voted to spend an additional $438 million on \neducation.\n  But first they laid the predicate to ensure that the money would be \nwell-spend by reforming the system.\n  We should do the same.\n  If we define success as success in sending more of taxpayers' money \nto sustain a system that cannot improve and will not change, we may do \ngreat things for the buildings and personnel involved in education, but \nwe will have left behind the children.\n  We should be judged by our willingness to make changes that promote \ninnovation, competition, and parental choice--in short, freedom.\n  Those are the changes that will ensure no child is left behind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask, of the hour I have, I be allowed \nto take 10 minutes as in morning business to introduce a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wellstone pertaining to the introduction of S. \n805 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Perhaps the best way to talk about this legislation \nand why I have been opposed to the way we are proceeding, is to do two \nthings. I will start by reading. I don't want to plagiarize. I was a \nteacher.\n  I say to my colleague from Rhode Island, I can be relatively brief \nand do this in 15 or 20 minutes--is that not brief? I was a teacher; \nthat, for me, is brief. I know Senator Reed from Rhode Island has come \nto the floor.\n  I will speak about what we are and are not doing in this legislation, \nfirst of all, by quoting Jonathan Kozol. Jonathan Kozol has \nunbelievable credibility because this man has written some of the most \neloquent and powerful books ever written about children and education. \nI don't think there is any question about it. It is what the book \nreviewers say. It is what people in education say. Jonathan's first \nbook was called ``Death at an Early Age'' and was about him having lost \nhis job as a teacher in Boston for assigning a poem by Langston Hughes \nbecause the children were all African American, and he wanted them to \nknow about Langston Hughes.\n  He has written so many books. I will quote some of what Jonathan \nKozol has had to say about this legislation and where we are heading. \nHis words are better.\n  He starts out:\n\n       Standardized tests in the third grade measure 7 years of \n     learning for privileged children, but only 4 years for lower \n     income kids who got no Head Start opportunity.\n\n  Think about that for a moment. In other words, the wealthiest \nchildren typically receive 3 years of rich developmental preschool \neducation at an average cost of about $15,000 a year, while half of the \neligible children of poverty don't even get one year of Head Start.\n  And in the poorest areas, as Jonathan's last two books have been \nabout the PS 30 school in the South Bronx, 75 percent of the children, \nnot one of whom comes from a family with an income of over $10,000 a \nyear, are excluded from Head Start. So any standardized tests given in \nthe third grade is not a test of ``school's success.'' ``It is a test \nof wealth or poverty. A third grade test for children whom we rob of \nHead Start is not school reform but punitive hypocrisy.''\n\n  Those are the words of Jonathan Kozol. Believe me, I wish they were \nmy words. I agree with them. That is why I come to the floor and state \nI could not believe I heard some colleagues on the other side talking \nabout how, if the schools do not succeed after 1 or 2 or 3 years, then \nthere will be severe consequences, and on and on and on. I will say it \nagain. Some of the harshest critics of these teachers in these schools \ncould not last 1 hour in the classrooms they condemn. But at age 8, let \nus be clear about this, for these third graders, this is not a test of \nschool success. It is a question of which kids by age 8 had rich \nprekindergarten education--which kids were able to come to school ready \nto learn. How many children were challenged, nurtured, and all of the \nrest. So basically you have one group of kids who had it all. You had \nanother group of kids who did not even have a chance to be in Head \nStart because we fund Head Start at 50 percent of what is needed for 4-\nyear-olds even less for three year olds and only 3 percent of what is \nneeded for 1 and 2-year-olds. And the Head Start program is to do \nwhat--to give children from disadvantaged backgrounds a head start.\n  Jonathan's conclusion: A third grade test for children or for the \nschool, which is also supposed to be a reflection of how the teachers \ndo, is not school reform but ``punitive hypocrisy.''\n  I will offer an amendment that will say that we will not mandate \nthese tests in every school, in every district, in every State until we \nfully fund title I.\n  Another amendment is going to be we should not do it until we fully \nfund Head Start. I will be interested to see how colleagues vote.\n  Jonathan Kozol goes on and says--``and, please, this is my battle \ncry. This is my plea. This is my prayer.'' He says: ``Nationally \nenforced testing with no national guarantee of equal opportunity to \npass the test is ethically unjust.'' I would like to see a Senator come \nout here and argue with me on\n\n[[Page S4076]]\n\nthat. So you have school funding for pupils in the poorest school \ndistricts of America that range around $6,000 per child, and you have \nschool districts in the richest communities that range in the area of \nabout $24,000 per child. In New York City, poor kids in the Bronx last \nyear got $8,000 to pay for their education while children in the \nwealthy suburbs got $18,000 to $20,000. Teachers in the richest \ndistricts got $20,000 more in annual pay than New York City teachers.\n  So the White House bill will test the poor against the rich and then \nannounce that the poor are failing. Federally required tests without \nfederally required equity amounts to clubbing these children over the \nhead after systematically cheating them. I want to say this in this \nChamber because that is exactly what we are doing. That is exactly what \nwe are doing. We know in advance which kids will fail. So this is a \nplan not for reform, not for equality, but for guaranteed humiliation \nchildren.\n  I am sorry, I know where ``leave no child behind'' comes from. That \nis the mission statement of the Children's Defense Fund. I heard a \ncolleague--I will not use names because we are not supposed to be \npersonal--come to the floor and say the money is not the answer. We \nneed to give the children tools to do well. And then this colleague \njumped to talk about the tests. Does the test assure a good teacher? \nDoes the test assure that we are going to be paying teachers well so we \nhave good teachers? Does the test assure a smaller class? Is the test \nthe tool that brings about the technology in the schools or the good \ntextbooks? Does a test rebuild a crumbling school building? Does the \ntest assure that the children come to kindergarten ready to learn? The \ntest does not assure any of that.\n  We cheat these children. We do not even fully fund Head Start, and \nthen we fail them and club them over the head and we call this reform. \nI want nothing to do with this unless we are going to have an honest \ncommitment of resources.\n  My friend Jonathan Kozol goes on to say that the testing advocates \nassume that teachers are afraid--I have heard some of this discussion--\nto be held accountable. He says this is a liability against the future. \nAnd he is right. No good teacher--I have two children who teach. I am a \nproud Jewish father. I think they are great teachers--No good teacher \nis afraid to be held accountable for what she does or what he does with \nchildren, but it is manifestly unfair to ask accountability from \nteachers when the Congress is unwilling to be held accountable for its \nbehavior in shortchanging kids and basically cheating them from the \nhour of their birth, and then clubbing them over the head with a \npunitive exam.\n  Senators should be ashamed to go along with this.\n  Now, I am going to make one other point from Kozol, although I could \ngo on and on. This excessive testing is degrading and it is distorting \ninstruction. Teachers, and I quote from Kozol, are turning to robotic \ndrill and grill routines because they are terrified of sanctions--loss \nof funding--if their student scores are not high enough. And this \nmandate from the Federal Government, an unfunded mandate, is going to \nrequire every school and every school district, every child from age 8 \nevery year to be tested. And what is going to happen is the teachers \nare not going to be able to encourage the students to have questions. \nThey are not going to be able to encourage curiosity or humor or \ndelight of any kind. All those trips to the museum and all that art and \nall that music and all of those other activities, they will go by the \nwayside as everybody will be drill teaching to drill tests. And this \npasses for reform?\n  I wish there were more colleagues present so they could get angry at \nme. I think people in these school districts, people down in the \ntrenches think we are crazy. I go to a school about every 2 weeks and I \ndo not find people coming up to me, whether it is in rural or whether \nit is suburban or inner city, saying we need more tests. I have people \ncome up to me and say: God, we need more teachers, or we need more \ncounselors; we need affordable housing because our third graders are \nmoving three and four times during the year and it is hard for them to \ndo well in school.\n  It is hard when the children come to school hungry. It is hard when \nthey come to school with an abscessed tooth because they do not have \nany dental care and can't afford it. We need afterschool programs. Why \ncan't you invest in Head Start, child care, and make sure the kids are \nkindergarten ready. We need smaller class sizes. Our buildings are \ndilapidated. I wonder how U.S. Senators would do if the toilets didn't \nwork, or if it was cold during the winter, or there was no air \nconditioning, or we didn't have access to the fax, or we didn't have \nthe books we needed, and we didn't have adequate facilities. How would \nwe do as Senators?\n  A lot of children are having to learn under these conditions.\n  That is what I hear about. I do not hear people coming up to me \nsaying: Please, Federal Government. Mandate that we have tests every \nyear.\n  But this is what we call reform.\n  Then, to add insult to injury, the estimates that we are getting from \nour States is, wait a minute; to do the testing the right way, if there \nis a right way, is going to cost at a minimum over $2 billion. Some \nestimates are as high as $7 billion. The White House has a few hundred \nmillion dollars for this.\n  Whatever happened to my Republican colleagues' outrage about unfunded \nmandates?\n  In addition, in St. Paul, MN, after you get to a school where only 65 \npercent of the kids are low income, or, say, 60 percent, there is no \ntitle I money left. We fund about 30 percent of the children who can \nget the help.\n  The President is calling for a total increase of $670 million or \nthereabouts because we have to have these Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax \ncuts with over 40 percent of the benefits going to the top 1 percent. \nNow we hear we are going to have several hundred billion over X number \nof years spent on the Pentagon. Then there will be missile defense, and \nall the rest.\n  Where are the resources?\n  My final point today is that I am disappointed. I said before we \nactually brought this bill up, and certainly before we proceed with \nthis bill I am going to keep saying this. We should have an agreement \non some of the policy questions that I know Senator Reed and others are \ngoing to talk about, and also whether or not there is going to be a \ncommitment on resources because this will just be a mockery. Senators \nwill rue the day they voted to mandate this and made every State, every \nschool district, every school, every kid, and every teacher go through \nthis and they did not provide the resources for IDEA and for kids with \nspecial needs or for title I or so kids can be kindergarten ready. You \nwill rue the day.\n  Democrats, my colleagues, this is not reform. You should stand up \nagainst it. If there is not a commitment--I don't mean authorization, I \nmean the commitment of resources, appropriations, and I mean now--we \nshould fight this all the way. We should say to people in the country: \nGod knows we are committed, but we are not going to let this be an \nunfunded mandate, where you will have to raise your property taxes.\n  As Jonathan Kozol said, we are not going to have a Federal mandate \nfor testing without a Federal mandate of equal opportunity for the \nchildren to get a good education to do well.\n  So I will offer an amendment to title I which says that the new \ntesting set to go into effect in the school years 2005 and 2006 shall \nnot be required to go into effect in that year unless title I has been \nappropriated at $24 billion, nor will it have to go into effect in \nsubsequent years until such sums are necessary are appropriated to \nfully fund title I.\n\n  This is put up or shut up time. If you are serious about \naccountability, but you are equally serious about making sure children \nhave the same opportunity, then I think you should vote for it.\n  There will be seven test quality amendments, which are really \nimportant so that we do this right.\n  I have another amendment that says the assessment should be used for \ndiagnostic purposes only.\n  That is basically what we are talking about right now. That is what \nwe should be using the tests for, diagnostic purposes. Let's not talk \nabout using these tests to start bashing these kids over the head and \nthese schools and teachers over the head.\n\n[[Page S4077]]\n\n  Finally, a transition teaching amendment that I have been working on \nwhich will be a bipartisan effort which expands and enhances the \ncurrent transition teaching program to ensure that funds are targeted \nto the high-poverty and high-need school districts. The program will \nensure funds are used on activities that have proven effective in both \nrecruiting and retaining teachers. This is critical because so much of \nthe need for teachers is rooted in the high attrition rate in the \nfield. 73% of teachers in Minnesota leave the field for reasons other \nthan retirement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the notes that Jonathan \nKozol sent to me be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Standardized tests in 3rd grade measure seven years of \n     learning for privileged children, but only four years for \n     low-income kids who got no head start opportunity.\n       The wealthiest children receive typically three years of \n     rich developmental preschool, at average cost of $15,000 a \n     year, while half the eligible children of poverty get not \n     even one year of Head Start and, in the poorest urban areas, \n     75 percent are excluded from Head Start.\n       Any standardized test given in 3rd grade, therefore, is not \n     a test of ``school success''--it is a test of wealth or \n     poverty. A 3rd grade test for children whom we rob of Head \n     Start is not ``School Reform'' but punitive hypocrisy.\n       Nationally enforced testing with no national guarantee of \n     equal opportunity to pass the tests is ethically unjust. \n     School funding per-pupil ranges from $6,000 in the poorest \n     districts of America to $24,000 in the richest. In the New \n     York City area: poor kids in the Bronx last year got $8,000 \n     while children in the wealthy suburbs got $18,000 to $20,000. \n     And incidentally teachers in the richest districts get \n     $20,000 more in annual pay than NYC teachers.\n       The White House bill will test the poor against the rich--\n     and then announce ``The poor are failing.'' Federally \n     required tests without federally required equity amounts to \n     clubbing children over the head after systematically cheating \n     them.\n       We know in advance which kids will fail. So this is a plan, \n     not for reform, not for equality, but for guaranteed \n     humiliation of our victims.\n       We will learn nothing from another layer of tests that we \n     do not already know. Kids in the Bronx, for example, already \n     take six standardized exams beginning in 3rd grade: three \n     sets of tests in math and reading each, year after year.\n       These tests, according to the principal of P.S.30, take up \n     one quarter of the year. Twenty-five percent of teaching time \n     is lost to tests, pre-tests, and test preparation.\n       In other words, one-fourth of the school budget is already \n     being wasted by repetitive exams. Another set of tests will \n     simply waste more money. Every week devoted to a test is a \n     week of lost education.\n       Some of my colleagues in the Senate are under the \n     impression that ``tests'' represent a ``form'' of education. \n     They do not! Tests do not teach reading: Only well-paid \n     teachers in small classes do. ``Testing'' is a symbolic \n     substitute for ``educating.'' Don't substitute a symbol for \n     the real thing.\n       Kids who are cheated of Head Start, Title I, small classes, \n     and well-paid teachers learn absolutely nothing from a \n     national exam except how much their nation wants to punish \n     and embarrass them.\n       Standardized tests are the worst kind of tests, but these \n     are inevitably the ones the White House will require, because \n     they are the easiest to compare numerically.\n       Many of the brightest kids can write beautifully and read \n     perceptively but cannot regurgitate answers for a multiple-\n     choice exam.\n       A friend of mine once taught to a student, a boy named \n     Anthony from New York City. He failed every standardized exam \n     he was given, but today is in college because his teacher \n     took time to read his stories!\n       Nationally standardized exams will stereotype boys like \n     Anthony as ``failures'' and convince them to drop out of \n     school before we even recognize their gifts. No standardized \n     exam will ever identify the true potential of a gifted \n     child--only his ``test-taking savvy.'' We'll lose too many \n     kids as a result.\n       Standardized exams will also take the highest toll on poor \n     black and Latino kids.\n       The most poorly funded urban districts are overwhelmingly \n     black and Hispanic. Giving more tests, instead of more \n     opportunity, will simply drive more minority children out of \n     school and push larger numbers of black adolescents into the \n     streets--then into the prison system.\n       New York already spends 10 times as much to incarcerate a \n     child in juvenile prison (nearly $90,000) as to educate that \n     child in public school. In California, prison guards get \n     higher salaries than teachers. Testing without educational \n     equality will increase the prison population while it \n     demoralizes and stigmatizes kids of color.\n       Testing advocates also assume that teachers are afraid to \n     be held ``accountable.'' This is a libel against teachers.\n       No good teacher is afraid to be held accountable for what \n     she does each day with children.\n       But it is manifestly unfair to ask ``accountability'' from \n     teachers when Congress is itself unwilling to be held \n     accountable for its perfidious behavior in short-changing \n     kids to start with--cheating them from the hour of their \n     birth--then clubbing them over the head with one more frankly \n     punitive exam.\n       ``One-way accountability'' is unacceptable. Senators, we \n     should be ashamed to go along with this.\n       Excessive testing is already degrading and distorting \n     instruction. Teachers are turning to robotic ``drill-and-\n     grill'' routines because they're terrified of ``sanctions'' \n     (loss of funding) if their students' scores aren't high \n     enough. The White House plan will make this even worse.\n       Teachers are increasingly afraid to encourage questions, \n     curiosity, humor, or delight of any kind during the school \n     day because they're being told that every minute must be \n     calibrated to an item that may be on an exam.\n       Urban schools, as a result, are being turned into pedagogic \n     bootcamps in which children lose not only equal opportunity \n     but also all the joy and sweetness that should be a part of \n     childhood. In this way, we rob the poorest kids twice.\n       And it seems that the best teachers hate the testing agenda \n     most. They will not remain in public schools if they are \n     forced to be drill-sergeants for exams instead of educators. \n     Hundreds of the most exciting and beautifully educated \n     teachers are already fleeing from inner-city schools in order \n     to escape what one brilliant young teacher (a graduate of \n     Swarthmore) calls ``Examination Hell.''\n       The dreariest and most robotic teachers will remain. The \n     glowing and passionate teachers will get out as fast as they \n     can. Who will you find to replace these beautiful young \n     teachers?\n       This is another way of robbing urban and poor rural \n     children of the opportunities that Senators give their own \n     kids.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield such time to the Senator from \nRhode Island as he requires. I will reserve the remainder of my time, \nif there is any, for parliamentary remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank Senator Wellstone for his articulate \nand very passionate discussion of the issues today. I, too, am \nconcerned that we are moving forward on legislation that has not yet \nbeen finalized. Technically, we voted this morning to proceed to S. 1, \nthis piece of legislation. But we recognize and understand that this \npiece of legislation, the committee print, has already been overtaken \nby events and negotiations, and that what we will ultimately be \nconfronted with on the floor is still being written.\n  When there are so many important and outstanding issues that have yet \nto be resolved, it is, indeed, premature and, I think, unfortunate that \nwe would begin this debate.\n  S. 1, the committee bill, was carefully and thoughtfully considered \nin committee, and it represents accommodation between the \nadministration's proposal and the ideas of the committee members in \nboth Republican and Democrat caucuses. I hoped it would come to the \nfloor as the vehicle by which we could discuss educational reform in \nthe United States. But as I indicated, this has been overtaken. The few \nhundred or so pages, for all practical purposes, are irrelevant.\n  What is being discussed today is how we will deviate from the agreed-\nupon committee print. That committee product represented a balancing of \nseveral important principles.\n  First, there was the principle of enhanced accountability, the \nprinciple that I recognized, indeed, in the last ESEA reauthorization \nin 1994 and fought strenuously for to increase accountability, \nrecognizing that unless we had agreed-upon educational standards and \nways to evaluate those standards, we were not going to make significant \neducational progress in the United States.\n  The second principle is flexibility, to give the States more \ndiscretion and authority to ensure that their plans are developed, \ncarried out, and evaluated.\n  The third principle is increased resources, because without adequate \nresources, testing and flexibility will lead, in my view, to very \nlittle progress, and may be even detrimental, as my colleague from \nMinnesota suggested.\n  But today we still do not have a resolution of the funding. We have \nan agreed-upon authorization number in this bill. But we have not seen \nthe administration come forward and pledge the same kind of resources \nthat they\n\n[[Page S4078]]\n\nare about to announce for the Department of Defense and for other \nareas.\n\n  If this is truly the No. 1 domestic priority in the United States--\nthe education of our young people--then we can put our money where our \nmouth is; we can put the resources to work. To date, we have no real \nresolution. So, we are in danger of having a testing scheme and \nflexibility but without the resources to make it all work.\n  But in addition to that issue, there is still the issue to be \nresolved in terms of accountability. What I think we would all concede \nis a tough accountability standard within this legislation is now being \nwatered down and diluted because, frankly, it has suddenly dawned on \nmany people, particularly the State education officials and Governors, \nthat real accountability costs money, and not just Federal money.\n  When we really measure the progress of education and the progress of \nindividual schools throughout this country, and we commit to making \nthese schools all successful, we are not just talking about some extra \nFederal dollars, we are talking about a profound shift in spending at \nthe State and local levels, to make sure that truly no child is left \nbehind. So it comes as no surprise to me that suddenly, having figured \nit out, the States are very concerned about accountability.\n  So you have three major issues which form the core, the foundation of \nthis legislation, that are now in flux subject to continuing \nnegotiation. In that context, I believe it is inappropriate to proceed. \nThat is why I voted this morning not to proceed to the bill, so we \ncould wait until we have real language we can talk about, debate, and \nstudy before we consider the bill in the Chamber. We should wait until \nwe have real resources committed--not just reauthorization language but \na real commitment to appropriations. When we do those things, then I \nthink we are ready to move forward. But we have, in any case, taken up \nthis debate.\n  We have seen over the last several weeks and months an attempt to \nwork on a bipartisan basis to develop legislation, understanding that \nwhen we came to the Chamber more controversial elements would be \nintroduced, such as the Straight A's Program, which is essentially a \nblock grant for the States rather than categorical programs. There \nwould be discussions on school vouchers and charitable choice. We \nunderstood that those issues would be debated in this Chamber. But the \nassumption was at least we would start with the language we had worked \non, the language we agreed upon, the language in the committee proposal \nof S. 1. That, again, seems to be overtaken by events, overtaken by \npending negotiations, and, as a result, rendering this particular \nversion of the legislation obsolete as we begin.\n  We have seen in these negotiations language on some of the \ncontroversial elements, but we have not seen a resolution yet. For \nexample, with regard to Straight A's, this is a proposal that \nessentially would provide a block grant to the States to operate the \neducational programs without regard to the categorical provisions of \nexisting programs.\n  One of the problems of the Straight A's proposal is that it is not \nyet clear whether States participating in this program on an \nexperimental basis could use Federal resources for vouchers. I think \nthat is an important point that should be resolved before we consider \nit in this Chamber, not hurried in while we are still in the midst of \nthe debate.\n  Also, there are additional problems we have. It is not quite clear \nwhether key provisions with respect to title I will still be part of \nthe Straight A's Program if the State is operating under one of these \npilot programs.\n\n  One of the provisions that is particularly important is parental \ninvolvement. In the 1994 ESEA reauthorization, in title I, we \nunderstood that parents were a critical aspect of education. But the \nexisting title I law before that was merely suggestive of parental \ninvolvement. So in 1994, we put in real requirements for parental \ninvolvement, authorizing the States to use a certain amount of their \ntitle I moneys--in fact, we directed them to use it for parental \ninvolvement, to develop parental involvement plans.\n  I believe the title I moneys, the title I program, should be infused \nwith parental involvement. But as the current draft of the Straight A's \nseems to suggest, they are going back, prior to 1994, and making \nparental involvement simply something that might be done, could be \ndone, should be done. I think we know enough about the role of parents \nin education to make this an important part of education, not simply an \noptional provision of educational policy in the United States.\n  As I mentioned before, there still is this issue of accountability. \nWhat will be the standards? Who will set the standards? It is clear \nthat there will be increased testing. This testing raises significant \nquestions. Most of the States, if not all the States, engage in rather \nelaborate testing already. Most of the States are acting under the \nprovisions of Goals 2000.\n  The 1994 ESEA reauthorization embarked on a very elaborate process of \nsetting State standards: What a child should know, developing \nevaluations so those standards are tested, and imposing a scheme of \nevaluations--not every year for every child, but a scheme that made \nsense to a particular State.\n  Now we are saying, no, one size does fit all for every child, every \nyear, for grades 3 through 8. That puts a lot of practical pressure on \nthe States because if you are trying to harmonize your standards with \nyour evaluation, it takes time. Some States have found out it is not \npractical to give a test to every child every year because the tests \nhave to be very individualized to capture all the nuances of those \nstandards.\n  My sense is--and I have talked to educational experts in the States--\nthe sheer requirement to test every child every year for grades 3 \nthrough 8 will inexorably leave the States to adopt standardized \ntesting which may or may not capture the standards in that particular \nState. So this testing regime could unwittingly move away from one of \nthe central elements we all agree on--standards carefully thought out \nand evaluations that measure those standards.\n  In these ongoing discussions, there is also included the notion of \nsupplemental services, the idea that in failing schools there will be \nmoney given for supplemental services. It seems to me that raises a \nvery profound question: Are you interested in merely giving a few \nchildren this option, because given the caps on this program, all \nchildren, even in the failing schools, may not be able to realize this \nprogram? Or are you interested in fixing the schools so that not only \nthat class of children but succeeding classes of children will enjoy \nexcellent education in a reformed, revitalized school? It seems to me \nwe are diverting resources from the main point, to fix our schools, \ngiving some children access to some supplementary education \nalternatives. That is another issue.\n  Then there is the issue of charitable choice, which will come up, \nwhich raises profound issues about civil rights. What is the policy if \nwe are going to use this approach by encouraging charities and \nreligious groups to become more involved, more directly involved in \nFederal funding? Does that impose requirements on these groups to \nrecognize civil rights laws in hiring? Does that impose requirements in \nthe type of curricula they can use?\n  All of these are very difficult questions, and they have to be \naddressed. I believe they should have been addressed as best we could \nbefore we brought this bill to the floor.\n  There are some other practical issues here, too. It goes back to the \noverarching concern. The overarching concern is, who is going to pay \nfor all this? It has been estimated by the National Association of \nState Boards of Education that testing alone of every child in grades 3 \nthrough 8 could cost between $2.7 and $7 billion over 4 years. That \ntype of money is not in the appropriations language I am seeing in the \nPresident's budget. That type of commitment is certainly not there. And \nthat is just for testing alone. That is just to diagnose the problem.\n  But we all recognize that simply identifying children who are falling \nbehind and schools that are falling behind is just the first step, the \nhardest step of fixing the problem.\n\n  As my colleague from Minnesota pointed out, we hear time and time \nagain money is not the problem. Well, it is a refrain we seldom hear \nfrom other departments when they come in and say they have to confront \nnew issues, new changing forces in the\n\n[[Page S4079]]\n\nworld. The classic example is the problem with defense. We are all \nreading this week that it is likely the Secretary of Defense will \nrecommend an increase of $25 billion a year in defense spending to \nadjust to new threats, new technologies, new opportunities. I am not \nhearing anyone say to him: Money is not the problem. Reorganize, \nevaluate your forces better.\n  Resources is not the sole answer, but it is an important part of \ndealing with the issue. So we have to do that.\n  Again, we are not seeing that type of commitment, that real \ncommitment. Without that real commitment, we will not be able to \nattract the kind of teachers we need; we will not be able to provide \ncontinuous professional development so that teachers stay current on \nteaching techniques; we will not be able to fix school buildings so \nthat children believe they are going to a place that is held in esteem \nby their community, a place that is treasured enough so that it is \nmaintained. If you go to the schools in many parts of this country \ntoday, you find they are decrepit, that they are obsolete. They are \nplaces that no one would go voluntarily and certainly no one would go \nwith the sense of excitement and joy that every child should bring to \nschool. We will need more money to fix those schools.\n  We are going to proceed on this debate. One of the presumptions of \nthis debate, for those who are suggesting that we engage in a regime of \ntesting without adequate resources--one of the presumptions is the \nsense that our schools are failing America. There is another \nperspective. The perspective is that this Congress and preceding \nCongresses, State Governors, and State assemblies have for years and \nyears been failing our schools. We have not been giving them the \nresources they need. We have not been recognizing that educational \nproblems today, in many cases, result from problems of health care for \nchildren, problems of poverty for children, problems of housing for \nchildren. Until we recognize these issues and until we confront these \nissues, not just rhetorically but, more importantly, with real \nresources and a real commitment, to say that our schools are failing \nAmerica is missing a much larger point.\n  What have we done truly to give these embattled teachers and \nstudents, these difficult schools, the help they need to succeed, not \njust a mandate to test and evaluate, but the support so that every \nchild goes to school ready to learn? That was the first core principle \nof our reform movement, which President Bush's father began a decade or \nmore ago.\n  There are still too many children going to school without adequate \nhealth care, coming from homes that are dangerous because of exposure \nto lead in paint on the walls. There are still too many children who \nwill fail because they don't have these types of supports and these \ntypes of help. As we consider this bill, we have to recognize that \ngroup as well.\n  There are many things that will be debated in the course of the next \nfew days in terms of education reform. I hope we can debate and I hope \nwe can successfully adopt provisions that will decrease the size of \nclassrooms throughout the country, knowing that children perform better \nwhen they have a smaller ratio between the teachers and the students. I \nhope we improve the quality of the physical condition of our schools--\nbetter classrooms, modern classrooms, and safer schools. I hope we can \nimprove the quality of our teachers and principals by providing real \nprofessional development. I hope we can improve our school libraries, \nand add additional school counselors. If we can do that, then we can \ntake this legislation and make a real contribution to the quality of \neducation in the United States.\n  I hope we can do that. I hope we can do that on behalf of the \nthousands and thousands of youngsters who are going to school today and \nthe generations to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time from \n4:15 to 6:15 be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees for postcloture debate. Further, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Carper be recognized first for up to 15 minutes, to be followed \nby Senator Enzi for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, my grandparents were born around the \nbeginning of the 20th century and lived for much of the 20th century. \nIn the early part of the last century, my grandparents and their \ngeneration--actually my parents and their generation--were able to find \njobs and become employed not so much because of the strength of their \nminds but because of the strength of their backs.\n  As we moved throughout the 20th century, the time came when more and \nmore it was important that we knew how to read and how to write, knew \nhow to do math and eventually to use technology, if we were going to \nget some of the better jobs available in our country. As we now move \ninto the 21st century, that will be only more true.\n  The last century has been called by some the American century. If the \n21st century is to be another American century, it is important that \nour young people have the kind of skills that will enable our employers \nto be successful in an increasingly competitive world marketplace.\n  I believe among the reasons we have been remarkably successful as a \nnation over the last century is that we have taken our core democratic \nvalues, our democratic principles, combined those with the free \nenterprise system, and added to that a belief in free public education \nnow for just about everybody in our country. Blending those disparate \nelements together, we ended up with an economic engine, as we close one \ncentury and walk into the next, that is, frankly, unrivaled by any \nother on the face of the Earth.\n  That was yesterday's news. The question is, How are we going to fare \nfor the next 100 years? For the past decade or so, we have heard \nincreasing cries of concern that too often the skills our young people \nare bringing out of the high schools from which they in many cases \ngraduate are not preparing them for college, not preparing them \nadequately for the workforce. We have heard calls from all levels of \ngovernment, particularly State and local, to do something about it.\n  As a Governor for the last 8 years, I know full well we have done a \nlot more in the States than just wring our hands and cry in anguish. We \nhave done a great deal to try to ensure that my children and the \nchildren of the generation of kids in school with them and those to \nfollow, when they graduate with that diploma, will really mean \nsomething. It will mean that they do know how to read and understand \nwhat they have read, that they do know how to do math--in some cases \npretty complex math--they know how to use technology, they know how to \nthink, and they are prepared to go on to be successful in college and \nin the world and in life.\n  Throughout the country over the last 7 years--maybe the last 8 \nyears--States have been involved in adopting academic standards. What \nis an academic standard? It spells out in a State such as Delaware, or \nany other State, what we expect students to know and to be able to do, \nsuch as standards in math, science, English, social studies, and in \nother subject areas as well. If you look at the 49 States that have \nadopted standards, most of them spell out clearly what they expect \ntheir students to be able to do in math, science, English, and social \nstudies.\n  In recent years, maybe a bit more than half of our States have \ndeveloped tests to measure student progress in the standards in math, \nscience, English, and social studies that those States have adopted. \nThey give those tests usually every year. In our State, it is annually \nin the spring, and it is given to students in grades 3, 5, 8 and 10.\n  Now, almost half of the States have taken the next step toward \ndeveloping accountability. What is accountability? There is a lot of \nconfusion about what is accountability. Accountability says there ought \nto be consequences--some positive and some maybe not so positive--for \nstudents who fall short of the mark or for those who do well or for \nschools or districts that fall short or do well. There ought to be \naccountability for parents as well and also for politicians and for \neducators.\n\n[[Page S4080]]\n\n  As we take up the education debate in the Senate this week, we are \nliterally trying to figure out what is the appropriate Federal role \nwith respect to the education of our children. My boys play soccer in a \nYMCA rec league in Wilmington, DE. They play on a variety of fields \naround the city of Wilmington. One of the fields is a field that is not \nlevel. In fact, if I can use this folder as an example, about half of \nthe game they are running downhill on this one field. Teams like to be \nrunning downhill. At the end of the first half, they switch and they \nhave to go in the other direction. The team running downhill for the \nfirst half ends up having to run uphill for the rest of the game.\n  A lot of kids in life don't have the luxury of changing sides of the \nfield. For a lot of their lives, they play the game running uphill. The \nrole of the Federal Government, for kids who spend a whole lot of their \nlives running uphill, is to try to level that playing field a little \nbit. For the kids born in tough situations, maybe with parents not \nengaged in their lives, or who don't value education, or maybe they \ndon't even have parents, we must make sure those kids aren't hopelessly \nbehind when they walk into kindergarten at age 5. If they are \nhopelessly behind and are coming from a real difficult situation in \ntheir home lives, they may need help to catch up with their other \nclassmates.\n  I don't think anybody in Washington expects the Federal Government to \nbe the primary funder or mover and shaker in education in America. That \nis not our role. Our role is to try to level the playing field and to \nhelp ensure that States adopt academic standards for their students, \nand that not just some kids have a chance to meet the rigorous \nstandards but that all kids have a chance to meet the standards their \nStates have adopted.\n  As we debate this issue this week, and perhaps next week as well, we \nare trying to figure out what can we do that is helpful, that builds on \nthe reforms being adopted and implemented in the States. It does no \nharm; in fact, it does a lot of good.\n  We have to consider that between 0 and age 5, kids will learn about \nhalf of what they know in their lives. If we waste the first 5 years, \nit is tough to get them back. We know that there is a lot more we can \ndo in terms of parent training. A lot could be done in our States with \nrespect to ensuring that healthier babies are born and raised. We can \ntry to provide assistance with respect to quality child care and \nprograms such as Head Start and make sure kids - and parents--are given \na bit of a boost at the age of 3 or 4 and find themselves better \nprepared to be successful at the age of 5.\n  Those are appropriate roles for the Federal Government. When kids \nwalk into kindergarten at 5, what is an appropriate role? The Congress \nand the President have said it is to provide hope in smaller class \nsizes.\n  We have also said it is important to provide extra learning time for \nkids who need extra time. We are joined in the Chamber by Senator \nSpecter of Pennsylvania and Senator Graham from Florida. Senator \nSpecter may be able to learn a little faster than the Senator from \nDelaware, but the Senator from Delaware can learn, too. I might just \nneed some extra learning time.\n  One of the things we have done in Delaware and in other States, \nthrough programs such as title 1, is we provide extra learning time for \nkids who need it to reach the academic standards that have been set.\n  We also know that one of the best things that could happen to ensure \nthat a kid is successful in school is to have a terrific teacher such \nas Mrs. Anderson, my first grade teacher, and Mrs. Swane, my fifth \ngrade teacher--teachers who really make an impact. Mrs. Anderson helped \nme read at the age of 5 and 6 in my first grade class. We need teachers \nwho love kids, who can teach and who know their stuff. One of the \nthings that we can do at the Federal level, working with State and \nlocal school districts, is to help recruit the best and brightest to be \nteachers, to make sure they have the tools that will at least help them \nhave a shot at being successful in the classroom and to ensure that \ntheir professional development continues.\n  Another area where the Federal Government has been involved is in \ntechnology--trying to infuse technology into public school classrooms. \nDelaware was the first State to wire a public school classroom for \naccess to the Internet. I think we have the best ratio of computers to \nkids in the country. We spend a lot of money to train teachers to use \nthe technology effectively in the class, to integrate technology into \ntheir curriculum, to bring the outside world into the classroom and \nmake the learning come alive.\n  I am pleased that the legislation coming before us focuses, in part, \non technology. One of the best things it does is to say we encourage \nteams in schools across America to figure out how to work at their \nschools, how they can incorporate technology into their curriculum. \nThat is a perfectly appropriate role for us.\n  Among the other things we can do is provide some help when students \nare disruptive. An amendment will be offered later this week by John \nKerry and myself that will say if a school district wants to use some \nof the moneys in this legislation for establishing alternative schools \nfor chronically disruptive students, they would have the ability to do \nso.\n  Lastly, our legislation, in providing for accountability and \nconsequences for schools that do well and those that don't do well, \nsays we want to put schools on sort of a 10-year glidepath to making \nsure that all the students are able to come closer to meeting the \nstandards set by their States, and each year that a school district \nfails to meet the State's own progress chart--imagine a stair step, if \nyou will, of 10 steps. The first year that happens, the school gets \nsome extra money for assistance. The second year, if they fall short, \nwe provide more technical assistance. By the time the fourth year \ncomes, we require that school district to institute public school \nchoice to provide, for that child who is in a failing school, their \nparents an opportunity to send them to another public school that is \nnot failing or to take advantage of extra learning time provided, in \nsome cases, by a private vendor after school.\n\n  We say if a school is failing after 4 years, that school has to be \nreconstituted as a charter school or turned over to a private sector \nvendor to run that school or simply the school is reconstituted with a \nnew administration and new faculty. But while we call for some serious \nsteps in our accountability plan in this legislation to require public \nschool choice when schools are failing children in some cases, and to \nrequire as one of three options the establishment of charter schools, \ntransforming existing schools into charter schools, those are options \nthat cost money.\n  One of the amendments that will be proposed by Senator Gregg, myself, \nand others is legislation saying if we are going to mandate public \nschool choice, we need to provide assistance. If we are going to \nrequire, as one of the three options, turning a failing school into a \ncharter school, we need to provide resources there as well.\n  Let me close with this point as I approach the end of my 15 minutes. \nI honestly believe there is more before the legislation that we will be \ndebating this week to unite us than divide us. Most Members, including \nDemocrats and Republicans, and I believe this President, understands \nthe need to invest more money in programs that work to raise student \nachievement, targeted to kids who need the help the most. I will not \nquarrel whether 10 percent, 15 percent, or 20 percent increases, or \nmore, are enough, but we all understand we need to invest more \nresources targeted to the kids who need it, in programs that work to \nraise student achievement.\n\n  The second area where we are in agreement, generally, is that the \nmoney we provide from the Federal Government should be provided \nflexibly. We should not try to micromanage what is going on in the \nschools. We should say, here is the money to use; target it for kids \nwho need it most. You figure how to best use it in your school and \nschool district to help your kids.\n  As we provide more money and we provide the money more flexibly, it \nis critically important we demand results, that we call for and require \naccountability. There have to be consequences. They do not have to be \nnegative. There have to be consequences to make sure we are not \nthrowing good money after bad money.\n\n[[Page S4081]]\n\n  We will debate a lot of issues in this Senate Chamber this year. For \nmy money, I think for our taxpayers' money, this is maybe one of the \nmost important issues we will consider. It will go probably as far in \ndetermining whether we will continue to be the superpower in the world \nwe have today 100 years from now. All the rest that we do, we can \ndebate and decide.\n  I look forward to joining my colleagues in this debate, doing what is \nbest for kids. The approach we take, I hope, is what I call the ``tough \nlove'' approach, demonstrated when we took up welfare reform 5 years \nago. A certain toughness in the approach was adopted and there is a lot \nof love and compassion, as well. There will be a similar approach. We \nwill be successful and our children will be successful not just in this \ndebate but in what follows.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset I commend my distinguished \ncolleague from Delaware for his statement on the issues of flexibility \nand local control and accountability. In a few months in the Senate he \nhas made a distinct contribution. It is good to share the train with \nthe Senator from Delaware. I have done so with his distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Biden, for many years. Those hours on the train \nenable some Members to learn more about each other and to come to \nbipartisan agreements on a great many of the issues. At the outset, I \ncompliment the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I rise today to support S. 1 and to talk about the motion \nto proceed on which we have gotten cloture and are now debating, with \nsome limitations on each Senator's time, but still debating whether to \nproceed on debating education.\n  I haven't heard anybody who hasn't said that education is the most \nimportant thing on which we have to work. For a week we didn't get to \ndebate education. Now we are only getting to debate proceeding to \neducation. We ought to be talking about the issues and the amendments \nand getting a bill done and through here.\n\n  Talking to the folks back in my school districts, right now what they \nare concentrating on is the end of the year, graduation for seniors. \nImmediately after that happens, they need to be planning for next fall.\n  We are talking about elementary and secondary education \nreauthorization, which is where we outline in what programs schools can \nbe involved. Don't you think they kind of need to know that when they \nstart planning for fall? If they do not know by the time they start \nplanning for fall, then they have to delay what we are talking about \nfor a year. So it could be a year and a quarter before any of the \nreforms that all of us agree on can go into effect.\n  When I listened to the debate this morning, the discussion was over \nhow much money would be put in this bill. This bill is not an \nappropriations bill. This is an authorization bill. This is where we \ntalk about what programs can be done. Later we talk about how much \nmoney to spend on those programs.\n  One of the reasons I find it particularly fascinating that the \nDemocrats have done a little filibuster on the amount of money is that \nthis is the first time the Republicans have been in charge when we have \ngotten to do a reauthorization of education. I have to tell you, we are \nreally excited about it because there is some tremendous potential in \neducation out there.\n  We are talking about the amount of money in the authorization bill. I \nfind that particularly interesting because I went back to see how much \nthey talked about money the last time this was authorized. The last \ntime this was authorized the Democrats were the majority and the \nPresident was a Democrat. Do you know how much additional money they \ninsisted be put in for the authorization of programs? No additional \nmoney. Money was not part of authorization. The Democrats have been in \nthe reauthorizing lead for 35 years, and the amount of money has not \nbeen the issue in the authorization bills.\n  So what is the difference now? A little chance to pound on the \nRepublicans and reduce the amount of civility and bipartisanship that \nhas already been shown on this bill. That should not happen.\n  The plain truth is that without reform any increase would be just \nanother drop in the $400 million--$400 billion; I have to start \nthinking in these Washington terms--a drop in the $400 billion \neducation bucket. If money were our answer, we would not be here today. \nSo we did not talk about it for 35 years. We did not talk about it the \nlast time.\n  The Federal Government provides 6 percent of the education dollar. We \nforce 50 percent of the paperwork. We are the time waster generators.\n  So we are going to increase that a little bit. Even under most \ncircumstances it will not get much higher than that, and that is \nbecause we do expect the States to make the major effort. That is where \nthe people live. That has been the tradition and the method for funding \neducation.\n  This is a difficult area. One of the reasons it is difficult is \nbecause everybody has been to school, so that makes each of us and \neverybody who listens to any debate on education an expert. We do have \npeople in our lives who have influenced us tremendously. Some of the \ngreatest influence we get is in that period of time we spend in school, \nwhich is some of the most contact we get with adults when we are kids.\n\n  Besides having gone to school, I also get some input from my \ndaughter, who is a seventh grade English teacher in Gillette, WY, an \noutstanding English teacher. I am really pleased with the progress she \nmakes with her students. I get to see that firsthand and hear about it. \nI have to say, while she has been teaching, she has also earned two \nmaster's degrees. She just finished up the master's degree in \nadministration so she can at some time be a principal. She would much \nrather be a teacher, but she has seen where a lot of the money goes.\n  We do need to get more money into the classroom for teachers so we \ncan recruit and retain good teachers. My wife has a master's degree in \nadult education and emphasizes education quite a bit.\n  Some of my best mentors in my life have been people with whom I \nworked in the legislature who worked in education. On the State level, \nit is a much bigger deal than it is here because that is where the \nmoney comes from and that is where the decisions are made for the kids. \nEven at the State level what they do is defer the decisions, some of \nwhich we are trying to do, to the school boards themselves. That is a \nvery important trend, and that is provided for in this bill.\n  We are not talking about the amount of money, although some would \nlike to distract the discussion so it talks about the amount of money. \nWe need to be talking about how we are going to educate our kids, how \nwe are going to reform the process.\n  I do, first, want to applaud the entire committee for unanimously \nadvancing this important bill before the full Senate. We did invest \ntremendous resources in attempting to reauthorize ESEA last year, and I \nam pleased we made it our first priority this year. I am also impressed \nwith the support of the new administration in seeing President Bush's \nNo. 1 priority take the next step in the legislative process. In the \nhistory of Presidential initiatives, I believe the work of this \nadministration will serve as a model for bipartisanship on policies of \nnational significance.\n  Frankly, I was stunned to hear the suggestions last week that our \nPresident has not taken any bipartisan initiatives. At both the staff \nand principal level, the White House has been actively engaged for \nweeks on negotiating this powerful education reform bill that we have \nbefore us today. I applaud the product. I thank all the parties for \ntheir investment of time, energy, and willingness to compromise--the \nnecessary ingredients for bipartisanship without which we would not be \nadvancing the bill today.\n  This is my fifth year on the Education Committee. The normal \nEducation Committee process is to have a markup that lasts 2 to 3 weeks \nand then come out along party lines. This, one of the most innovative \nbills that we have worked on, took 2 days and it came out unanimously. \nThat has to be a record for the Education Committee on any of the bills \nwith which we deal. That is bipartisanship. Unanimous is about as close \nas you can come.\n\n[[Page S4082]]\n\n  This education reform bill, the BEST Act, reflects an understanding \nof the variation in needs between urban, suburban, and rural schools. \nThe bill arguably addresses the concerns of all stakeholders in our \nchildren's education, and it does so in a bipartisan way. I believe the \nbill has struck meaningful compromise and reflects a strong but \nappropriate role for the Federal partnership in elementary and \nsecondary education.\n\n  The State of Wyoming has invested tremendous amounts of time and \nmoney in developing high standards for learning. That has been a \npriority for quite a while--high standards of learning, reliable \nassessments, strong parental involvement, and other research-based \neducation innovations. The BEST Act builds upon that work and \nsolidifies the shared commitment to academic achievement for all \nchildren.\n  The State of Wyoming also has a Web site where you can check on the \ngrades of any of the schools. They take the testing they do and they \nshow how well, by school, the report cards come out for those schools. \nSo they have had strong assessments.\n  The State of Wyoming is currently facing a crisis in education. We \ncall it a teacher shortage. It is not about class size. It is about \nteachers' salaries and a dwindling supply of qualified educators, \nparticularly in light of the new high standards which the students must \nmeet, which are on this Web site. But this is a problem for which the \nFederal Government can help provide a solution.\n  Under title II of our bill, the focus is not only on preparing \nteachers but on helping schools recruit and retain high-quality \nteachers. Reducing the class sizes will be an allowable use of funds \nunder this title, if that is the unique need of the particular school.\n  I have to say, in Wyoming a lot of the schools have small class \nsizes. Even if they combined all of the classes into one class, it \nwould be a very small class. We have some very small towns in Wyoming. \nIt has been very important through this process to maintain the \ncapability for those small schools to operate as well.\n  This bill also emphasizes the need to improve the access to education \ntechnology and to use it in the process of improving academic \nachievement. I like to think our State is a forerunner in that. Again, \nthat is because of our distances. It is a way that kids who are not in \nour urban centers--and our biggest urban center is now 53,293 people--\nwill still be able to get a diversified education.\n  The goal of eliminating the duplicative administrative application \nprocess and allowing schools to have one pot of funds for the range of \ntechnology uses, including teacher and administrative staff teaching, \nwill make a difference. The digital divide will shrink and technology \nwill become even more relevant as an educational tool.\n  I have to divert for a moment and talk about some of the innovations \nin technology.\n  About 10 days ago I happened to tour a school that deals with migrant \nworkers. I found that they had received a grant for laptops. The \nlaptops are assigned to these children of migrant workers, and I \nsuspect to other workers as well. But it has all of the course work on \nit. It plugs into a modem that dials an 800 number to give their \nhomework to the teacher to grade. It allows them to talk on line with \nthe teacher. There is also an 800 phone number they can call to talk to \nthe teacher. It is a very successful program. It was started with an \nold blue school bus that went around to migrant worker camps and \nfollowed the migrant workers. They gutted the bus. They put in a desk \nand some folding chairs. They started a school. They have progressed \nnow to the point where they can accommodate a lot more kids using this \nlaptop network and some teachers who can be accessible at any time the \nstudents have an opportunity for it.\n  There are some technological innovations out there that will help \nrural students and ones who move a lot. They are included in this bill.\n  Very importantly, the bill clarifies the purpose of the President's \nrequirement that States expand existing assessments and take on the new \npractice of participating annually in the NAEP test, which is the \nNational Assessment of Educational Progress test, which many States, \nincluding Wyoming, currently administer to students.\n  These clarifications go a long way in addressing the fundamental \nconcerns by all parties that the Federal Government not enact \nadditional unfunded mandates and that the States continue to retain the \nflexibility to design their own standards of learning for students \nversus nationalized standards or tests. We will have to debate a little \nbit this interaction between anything that looks like a national test \nand a State test which follows the things kids in that area of the \ncountry need besides their basic education.\n  While it is not a part of the reauthorization, we would be remiss in \nmeeting our commitment to the education of all children if we did not \nalso prioritize funding of the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct.\n  As we advocate meaningful education reform, I look forward to the \ncontinued support for strong increases in funding of IDEA but recognize \nthat is part of the appropriations process and not part of the \nauthorization process. Fully funding this important but costly Federal \nrequirement is as critical as requiring academic success in our \nclassrooms. It is something we have been working toward and will \ncontinue to work toward.\n  Throughout the consideration of the different elements of the BEST \nAct, I plan to discuss in more detail those that will most help \nWyoming's children succeed.\n  In spite of increases in the Federal investment in elementary and \nsecondary education, it does remain a fraction of the overall \nexpenditures--less than 10 percent. I think the figure being used here \nis 6 percent, and also 7 percent has been used.\n  I remind people that 50 percent of the paperwork is generated by our \nvery small funds. We force people to spend a lot of time for the money \nthat comes from the Federal Government.\n  I had a high school principal who took a leave of absence and came \nback to Washington to work in my office for a semester. He spent most \nof that time down at the Department of Education. He had been filling \nout these Federal forms for what seemed to him a lifetime, and he \nwanted to know what happened to them.\n  Let me tell you what the results were. He was pleased to find out \nthat the forms are scrutinized in detail, that every ``t'' has to be \ncrossed and every ``i'' has to be dotted; everything has to be on the \nform. He was disappointed to find out that was the last use of that \nform. It isn't used to help any kid anywhere, but it maintains a job in \nthe bureaucracy in Washington for that person who is making sure the \nform is completely filled out. That is not helping any kid in my State.\n  If they do not put that information together and package it somehow \nso it is helpful to them, we ought to eliminate the form--actually, a \nlot of forms. I mentioned that 50 percent of the paperwork is generated \nin Washington.\n  We have to help the schools maximize their dollars. I believe we can \nhelp improve our kids' academic experience because of this.\n  Planning for next year requires quick passage. I mentioned that. If \nwe don't have quick passage, we are getting past the planning stage for \nthe next academic year; we will be forced to have the reform kick in 1 \nyear later.\n  We need to get on with this process. I hope we can have everybody get \non board, end the filibuster that is in process, compromise on some \ntime, and get the bill debated and move on to a better treatment of the \nkids of this country.\n\n  I look forward to seeing this bill overwhelmingly adopted by the \nSenate and signed into law as quickly as possible. We cannot afford to \nshirk our commitment to reform and putting children first.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New York that I do \nhave a unanimous consent request I want to offer. I believe that we \nwill be having\n\n[[Page S4083]]\n\nsome Senator from the other side of the aisle to discuss it with me \nbriefly. It should not take too long. I thank the Senator for her \ncourtesy in letting us do this now.\n  Mr. President, obviously we need to go forward with the discussion, \nthe general debate, and the amendment process on the education reform \npackage. Earlier today, the vote on the motion to proceed was an \noverwhelming 96-3. I thought that was a clear indication that we were \nready to go to S. 1, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  I had the impression that we would have time spent this afternoon \ndiscussing education--not actually on the bill because time is allowed \npostcloture to talk about the bill in general, but that we would be \nable to go to the bill itself and begin debate on the bill at 6:15 or \n6:30 this evening and tomorrow we would actually be into the amendment \nprocess. That seemed a fair way to proceed.\n  I am being told now that there is objection to us even proceeding to \ngeneral debate on the bill itself. Also, I have the impression--and I \nam glad to see Senator Daschle in the Chamber; maybe he can clarify \nthis for me--part of the reason is, Senators do not want to go to the \nbill and begin the amendment process until the substitute has been \noffered because they do not want to offer an amendment to the \nunderlying bill and then have to offer it later to the agreed-to \ncompromise bill. But I would be glad to ask consent or work out an \nagreement that any amendment that is offered before then would be \napplied to the compromise managers' amendment that might be offered \nlater.\n  My concern, I say to Senator Daschle, and to Senator Kennedy, who I \nsee just coming into the Chamber, is that a lot of good work has been \ndone. It has been bipartisan. The administration has been involved. It \nhas been understandable that it took some more time. My attitude on \nthat is, if more time is needed, let's take it. But now we are on the \nverge of going through a second week without actually getting on the \nbill.\n  I know a lot of Senators are going to want to speak in general debate \nand will have amendments to offer, and it is going to take some time. \nThe idea that we could spend, hopefully, time tomorrow on general \ndebate and begin the amendment process, decide how we are going to deal \nwith perhaps amendments on Friday, and begin to make progress seemed to \nbe a very positive thing.\n  So I hope we can go to the bill and begin debate on it this \nafternoon, tonight, and then be prepared to have more time tomorrow in \ngeneral debate, if we need to, and then go to the amendments.\n  Before I ask consent, I will yield to Senator Daschle to see if we \ncan get an agreement worked out so that if there are amendments that \nare offered, they would apply to not only the underlying bill, S. 1, \nbut to any compromise amendment that is agreed to. I did discuss that \nwith Senator Kennedy, and he did not think that would be a problem.\n  I would be glad to yield to Senator Daschle for a response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader \nyielding. Let me say, he has attempted to reach me earlier, and I have \nbeen tied up in important meetings. I did not know he was trying to \nreach me until just a few minutes ago. But I apologize for not getting \nback to him sooner.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand. We both are running from meeting to meeting.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Senator Lott and I talked about this very question last \nweek. I understand his desire to move to the legislation. I said I \nwould be supportive of an effort to do that. But there are two \noutstanding issues. The one that we talked about last week, and \ncontinues to be a very big concern, is what kind of a commitment we can \nget from the administration on overall funding. I had indicated at that \ntime when we discussed this matter last week that even though that is \ncritical to all of us, and even though many of our colleagues believe \nmore strongly in that than any other question, that I was prepared to \nmove to the bill even if we had not yet completed our discussions with \nthe administration and our Republican colleagues about that, in spite \nof the fact that many of our colleagues were very concerned about \ntaking that approach.\n  The second issue, of course, has to do with having the language. The \nmajority leader puts his finger on one of the concerns we have, but \nthere are two. The first concern, of course, is what happens if you \noffer amendments. And, of course, that is subject then to a unanimous \nconsent agreement that we accommodate Senators who have offered \namendments in good faith. And I guess there isn't the confidence, at \nleast right now, that we might even be able to get a unanimous consent \nagreement that allows Senators the confidence of knowing that even \nthough they are amending the substitute that they have not yet seen, \nthat it would be accommodated if ultimately we agreed to that \nsubstitute.\n  So I think the larger question is one that many of our colleagues \nhave expressed to me personally, even as late as in the last half-hour, \nand that is that they are just uncomfortable moving to a bill for which \nwe have not been given any information. I think a lot of our \nnegotiators are talking back and forth, and they are attempting to \nresolve the outstanding differences.\n  The problem is that I will say at least 90 percent of our caucus has \nnot seen even the first draft of the substitute. They are \nunderstandably concerned about committing to a motion to proceed before \nthey have had a chance to even look at it. I think what I made clear to \nthe majority leader last week was that we had to at least resolve the \nlanguage issue before we could make the motion to proceed.\n  I also supported, as 95 of my colleagues this morning did, the motion \non cloture to proceed. But I am very uncomfortable asking my colleagues \nto accept language that they have not seen yet. I am told that we are \nvery near this point of agreement that would then allow us to print a \ndocument that we could share with all of our colleagues and I think \nsubstantially increase the confidence levels about what it is we are \nagreeing to on the motion to proceed.\n  So I hope that our colleagues could work extra hard in the next few \nhours and through the night and present us with an agreed-upon \nsubstitute tomorrow that we could share with our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle so that we could all vote for the motion to proceed. \nI think there would be a strong vote for it. But that is really the \nessence of my concern.\n  I am willing to put aside, for the moment, the funding question, even \nthough, as I say, I cannot tell you the depth of feeling there is in \nour caucus about proceeding without some agreement. But I think it is \nvery difficult for us to agree on a substitute prior to the time we \nhave even seen it.\n  So I again reiterate what I thought I expressed to the majority \nleader was my concern last week, and that would be the reason we would \nhave to object at this time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond, Senator Daschle \nmentioned to me last week that there was a need to see the language. I \npassed the word that certainly that should be made available. I am \nsurprised. While I have not been directly involved in all the \nnegotiations, I thought that everybody was familiar with all that was \ngoing on and that basically Senator Kennedy and others have the \nlanguage, know the language, and if there is any outstanding language, \nthey would know what that is.\n  So for a week we have been saying, let's share the language, and \nlet's move on. Maybe the problem is that the language is continuing to \nbe modified. But how long does that go on? We talk about the regular \norder, the legislative process. The way you usually do it is you call \nup a bill, and a managers' amendment is offered, amendments are \noffered. I do not know if we can ever get every word agreed to. I \nassume there are going to be Senators on both sides of the aisle who \nare going to offer some amendments to make further changes.\n  But my urging would be--on both sides of the aisle--let's give them \nthe language. Somebody has some language somewhere. I am being assured \nRepublicans are not hiding in the corner, holding back language that \nthey won't share. If there is anything that Senator Kennedy is not \naware of, I am\n\n[[Page S4084]]\n\nnot aware of it. I would urge that we get that language agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask the majority leader if he would yield for just a \nshort response?\n  Mr. LOTT. Sure.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The majority leader is right. I think part of the \nlanguage is agreed to, and I think a lot of our colleagues have seen \nthat. But I think it is fair to say that both sides of the aisle would \nagree that a very significant part of this whole effort is the issue of \naccountability. And it is on accountability that we are still hung up, \nthat we have this moving target. We have evolving language that still \nhas yet to be nailed down.\n  Were it not for the fact that accountability is so important, I think \nthere would be a lot more interest in trying to see if we could resolve \nthis matter. But it is a key question. Because it is, and because this \nmoving target seems to be one that continues to change as we go from \nhour to hour and day to day, that is the issue.\n  However, I will join with the majority leader, I would love to see \nboth sides come together, finalize the language, and offer amendments \nif we are not satisfied with it.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have always observed in a legislative body you have to \nhave a closer. You have to have somebody who says: This is good enough; \nlet's go for it. We have had all of last week and now half of this \nweek. We continue to negotiate.\n  I guess I will have to assume some responsibility because if I had \nknown we were not going to be able to go to the education bill--the No. \n1 priority in almost everybody's mind in the country--we could have \nbeen considering other legislation.\n  I have continued to hope that with one more half day, one more day, \nwe could get going; we could have a full debate and offer amendments.\n  If I had known we were going to be stalled out on education, I would \nhave gone to other issues, and maybe that is what we ought to do now. \nIf I understand correctly, Senator Daschle indicates he doesn't think \nthis idea that any amendment would be considered to be applicable to \nthe bill or the substitute, that we might not get an agreement to do \nthat, but would it help if we could do that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Again, that would help a good deal, but that does not \nsolve the other problem. There are many on our side who feel so \nstrongly about this issue of accountability that they want to be able \nto see the language prior to the time they are asked to vote on the \nmotion to proceed.\n  I have to respect the wishes of those colleagues who have made that \nfact known to me. Clearly, it would help if we had that language. It \nwould solve part of the problem.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time is \nremaining postcloture on the motion to proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will take 1 minute to calculate.\n  Mr. LOTT. I assume there must be 24, 25 hours remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-six hours 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I guess if we run off all of that time, it would be \ntomorrow night or Friday before we could get to general debate on the \nbill. I hope we will not have to do that. Maybe there is some plan to \nhave language available tonight for some press conference announcing \nthat language tomorrow. Is there some indication that maybe we could go \nto the general debate in the morning? Do we know? I guess what I am \nasking is, are we going to have to run off the full 24 or 25 hours?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield, that is not my \nexpectation. As I said, both sides have been working to try to resolve \nthe outstanding difference. I was hoping by now we would have resolved \nit. I was hoping we would be able to say that we now have a draft we \ncan share with everybody. Unfortunately, that is still not the case. I \ncan't imagine that this is going to go on much longer.\n  Mr. LOTT. Could I inquire of Senator Daschle, would it be his \nrecommendation that we set aside education and try to go to other \nlegislation for the balance of this week? I hate for us to let the rest \nof this evening, tonight, and tomorrow go without making progress on \neducation or any other bill. If he thinks we should consider that, \nmaybe he and I could talk after we leave here.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to talk to the majority leader about \npossibilities we might entertain.\n  Mr. LOTT. I confess, what I am trying to do is to put pressure on all \nparties, not just on the Democratic side or the administration, \neverybody. Let's come to some sort of agreement one way or the other. \nLet's get started.\n  I had planned to ask unanimous consent that we would yield back all \ntime and proceed to the bill itself at 6:15, but it is obvious Senator \nDaschle believes now that he would be in a position to have to object, \nso I will not go through that exercise.\n  I do emphasize to all that everybody agrees we have a monumental, \nhistoric opportunity to get major education reform and increases in \nfunds for education. I hope we can get to the bill itself within the \nnext half a day at a very minimum.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I appreciate the dialog that just \noccurred between the leaders because, certainly, it is critical that \nthe debate on education commence and that we do everything within our \npower to provide more resources, greater opportunities, and \naccountability to our children around the country.\n  As a new Member to this body, I am one who shares the concern about \nactually seeing the language of the bill and trying to be sure that we \nknow what it is we are debating and that the people back in our States \nwho we represent have a chance to be part of this debate by being able \nto read and study and provide comments about what it is we are \nconsidering in the Senate. I know it may, from time to time, be a \nlittle frustrating, but until we actually have a bill with language \nthat will determine the future of education funding from the Federal \nGovernment for 5 to 7 years, it is a wiser course for us to be prudent \nand thoughtful and to wait until we actually know what it is we are \ndebating and what the potential impact of these provisions could be on \nthe lives of real children. After all, this debate is going to set the \nstage for how much or how little we as a Nation will do for elementary, \njunior high, middle, and high schools.\n  I am particularly concerned about the impact we will have on our \nneediest children, those who are too often left behind. We still have \ntoo many children who are not reading at grade level and who are being \ntaught by uncertified teachers, and too many who are in overcrowded \nclassrooms and dilapidated school buildings. I know that all of us on \nboth sides of the aisle agree that we can do better than this. We can't \njust sign a blank check or decide that we can proceed on bill language \nwe have not even seen and discharge our responsibilities to the \nchildren we represent in this body.\n  Many of my colleagues and I have serious concerns about the substance \nof the bill. For example, the block grant demonstration program, so far \nas we are aware of it without having seen the language of it, does not \ntarget enough funds to our highest-need districts and will mean less \ncontrol for local school districts on how best to invest their Federal \neducation dollars. Because we have not yet seen the final version of \nthe bill we are considering, we don't know whether there is a genuine \ncommitment to devote the resources necessary to make the promise of \ngreater accountability a realistic outcome.\n  Just as we expect teachers, administrators, and students to abide by \na high standard of accountability, we should bring our backroom \nnegotiations to the floor of the Senate for all of us to hear. That is \nwhy I voted to proceed with the bill. But we should do it on the basis \nof an actual bill. I, for one, am willing to wait and to be patient \nuntil we actually get the bill and then to proceed in an expeditious \nmanner.\n  If we look at where the negotiations are and what we are attempting \nto achieve, we have a great opportunity to accomplish some very \nimportant goals for the people of this country. We all share the goal \nof improving our Nation's schools. We agree that everyone should be \nheld more accountable for turning around failing schools. There is a \nbipartisan agreement that is very strong for ensuring that all children \nshould be taught by high quality teachers and that parents should know \nthe\n\n[[Page S4085]]\n\nquality of the schools their children attend.\n  This bill, so far as it is reported to us, does a tremendous job of \nstrengthening accountability. I applaud Senators Kennedy and Bingaman \nfor leading the negotiations that have resulted in important \naccountability provisions.\n  Some have asked: Why don't we just call it quits. Let's just put in \nmore accountability. Let's just test our children every year from third \nthrough eighth grade. We don't need to do any more than that.\n  I ask: What is it we are attempting to achieve? If all it does is to \nput more accountability on the already existing testing systems that \nevery one of our States have employed, what is it we hope to achieve?\n  The answer is that in order to have real accountability, we have to \nmarry those accountability measures with targeted additional resources, \ninvested wisely, that will really make the difference as to whether the \ntests actually create better educational outcomes.\n  Resources would make a difference for children such as Delano Tucker, \na fifth grader from PS 41 in the Bronx, who wrote me that his entire \nfifth grade class was asking for help to improve education. Here is \nwhat Delano said:\n\n       We need more books, but we can't do that without more \n     money. My second reason is we need more teachers because \n     classes are too crowded. The third reason is children are \n     passing without knowing how to read.\n\n  We don't need to get a bunch of experts or Senators who can come up \nwith a better analysis than what Delano just gave us. We need better \nteachers, more books, less crowded classrooms, and we should not be \npassing children who don't know how to read.\n  Resources would make a difference for the nearly 168,000 children who \ngo to school every day in overcrowded classes in New York City. We are \nlosing teachers every single day because teachers can't teach in the \nkind of circumstances that we are presenting for the state of education \nin many of our cities.\n  One New York City parent recently shared her thoughts with me, \nwriting that:\n\n       I am a parent of two young children--one in kindergarten \n     and one in third grade. They are both bright, but they suffer \n     from learning difficulties, in part, because they are trying \n     to learn in classes of 28 children. They are unable to get \n     the individual attention they need because they are competing \n     for the teacher's attention with so many.\n\n  How can we expect children in classes that are that crowded, given \nthe difficulties and issues that children bring to school today, to be \nable to get the same quality of education that we know works so well \nwhen classes are smaller in the early grades?\n  Resources would have made a real difference for the fourth grade \nteacher at the 82-year-old Mechanicville Elementary School, just north \nof Albany, NY, who last year was struck in the head by concrete from \nthe ceiling as she was teaching because the school was in such \ndisrepair.\n  My colleagues and I have heard similar stories from students and \nteachers in every State around the country. Although education is, and \nalways will be, a local issue, it has to be a national concern. Some of \nthe most severe problems in education today require national solutions. \nI think that is why we are here today debating education.\n  How will investing in school repairs and renovations help to raise \nstudent achievement? I think the answer is self-evident, especially if \nyou have a teacher hit in the head with concrete falling from the \nceiling. We know from research that children benefit when they attend \nschool buildings that are in good physical condition.\n  A 1996 study of large urban high schools in Virginia found that \nstudent achievement was as much as 11 percentile points lower in \nsubstandard buildings as compared to standard buildings.\n  Another study found that the quality of air inside public school \nfacilities may significantly affect students' ability to concentrate. \nIn fact, the evidence suggests that children under 10 are more \nvulnerable than adults to the types of contaminants found in school \nfacilities. We have seen reports and studies about working conditions \nin urban schools, concluding that they ``have direct positive and \nnegative effects on teacher morale, their sense of personal safety, \ntheir feelings of effectiveness, and on the general learning \nenvironment.'' That kind of scientific conclusion is reinforced by the \nexperience of students in Mount Vernon, NY, who go to school with air \nducts that are so old and so clogged up and filled with pigeon and rat \ndroppings that they can't even breathe decent air; or the students in \nCohoes, NY, who go to a school that banned the use of chalk because \nthey have inadequate ventilation, and the chalk dust would hang like a \ncurtain in the air.\n\n  Too many of our students are trying to learn in cramped trailers such \nas in this photo taken in Queens. These may be so-called ``temporary'' \ntrailers, but they can end up representing a big part of a child's \neducational experience.\n  Too many of our children are in hallways with many distractions and \nfar too little room. This photo represents a common sight in schools in \nNew York. This is not a classroom. This is a hallway. The children \naren't in a classroom that you and I remember, where there is a chalk \nboard, a teacher's desk, and the desks of the children, and bulletin \nboards with pretty displays. This is a hallway and this is their \nclassroom.\n  I don't know how much longer we can keep hearing stories about \nhallway classrooms, falling concrete, conditions in the classroom that \nare unhealthy, and not recognize that we should be helping our school \ndistricts, many of which cannot possibly afford to raise their property \ntaxes. We can't ask hard-pressed parents to put even more money into \nthe property tax base. We should be helping the parents in those school \ndistricts.\n  During this debate, I will do everything I can to urge my colleagues \nto support Senator Harkin's efforts to include authorization for an \nemergency renovation and repair fund that would certainly make a \ndifference for some of the schools we just saw.\n  I will also be offering my own amendment to examine the impact of \ndilapidated schools on the health of our children. It is simply \nunacceptable in America in the beginning of the 21st century that our \nchildren should have to attend schools that not only impair their \nability to learn but even make them sick.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from New York yield for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the Senator from New York has \nhad experience in the past in dealing with issues such as we are trying \nto deal with here. Is that true?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes, that is.\n  Mr. REID. Would she tell the Senator from Nevada some of the things \nshe has worked on in the past?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. As the Senator points out, I have been involved in \nimproving education and reforming our accountability measures since \n1983, when ``A Nation At Risk'' was first issued by then-President \nReagan's Commission on Education. I was one of the first in our country \nto ask for much stricter accountability, to test not only students but \nalso teachers, and to hold schools to a very high standard. If they did \nnot succeed in passing 85 percent of their children beyond a level of \nacceptable learning outcomes, the school would be in danger of being \ntaken over. That was 18 years ago.\n  So there is really nothing new in what we are discussing today, as \nthe Senator from Nevada knows so well. We want to do the best job we \ncan in raising standards; yes, we do. That is something many of us have \nworked on, and we have actually seen some positive results in some of \nour schools over the last 18 years. But we know there have to be the \nkind of conditions in learning circumstances in our classes, in our \nschools, that will enable these accountability measures to be \nsuccessful.\n\n  Mr. REID. I will ask one final question to the Senator from New York. \nWe know that there has been talk from the other side saying throwing \nmoney at the problem doesn't solve anything. The Senator from New York \nrealizes that. But would the Senator also acknowledge that money is \ngoing to help some of these problems?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. As the Senator knows, when somebody says money doesn't \nmake a difference, they are talking about somebody else and somebody \nelse's money. Every one of us in this body goes to the extra length of\n\n[[Page S4086]]\n\nmaking sure that our children and any children we care about are given \nthose kinds of resources that will enable a child to learn.\n  Money is not the only answer to what we need to do if we are serious \nabout zeroing in on those children most in need. Most of our schools in \nthis country are doing a fine job.\n  I live in a district in New York that is one of the best in the \nentire country. Many of the other districts in our suburbs and rural \nand city areas are producing good students who care about learning. Our \nreal problems are in those areas with concentrated poverty.\n  I have seen the Senator from Connecticut come into the Chamber. He \nhas a passion about getting our resources targeted where they can do \nthe most good. So to anybody who says money is not the only answer, of \ncourse, I say money is not the only answer, but money helps when \nmarried to accountability and invested in getting rid of conditions \nsuch as the ones I am showing here on the picture where there are so \nmany children in this classroom, where it is impossible for even the \nbest trained teacher to be able to communicate effectively with these \nchildren. This is a classroom where the children are coming from \nbackgrounds where English is not their first language, coming from \nconcentrated poverty, often difficult family situations.\n  So when somebody says we don't want to throw money at it, I say, \nthat's right. I want to target money to make sure we clean up our \ndilapidated classes and schools and that we provide lower class size so \nthat the teachers who are willing to go into our hard-to-teach areas \nwill be able to have a decent chance to reach these children; to \nrecruit and retain teachers who come in with idealism and find \nthemselves in situations such as this and within a year or two are \ngone.\n  For me, there isn't a contradiction here, as the Senator from Nevada \nknows so well. We need to have the kinds of accountability that is \neffective and will work but without the resources we are not going to \nbe successful.\n  We are going to find, as I have said in the past, that we are just \npassing out thermometers in the midst of an epidemic. We are going to \nfind that everybody has a raging fever, but we don't have the resources \nor the will to help them get well. We can do both. That is what this \nopportunity provides.\n\n  I appreciate the concern of the Senator from Nevada. We have to have \na good debate. It is only fair, if we are asking that we invest more \ndollars in education from the Federal Government, we be able to justify \nthe use of those dollars and we tell our constituents and our \ncolleagues where they will go. I have pointed out they go to helping \nclean, repair, and construct schools we need. Second, they go to \nreducing class size. The situation shown in this picture is \nunacceptable.\n  We are under court order in New York City to have only certified \nteachers in the classes. That sounds great, and I am for it, but in \norder to have certified, qualified teachers go into a situation such as \nthis, we will have to make a contract with these teachers that this \nsituation will improve; they will find they will have a chance, \nactually, to teach; otherwise, they will vote with their feet and \neither leave to go to a suburban district where they are paid a lot \nmore, in a lot better situation, or they will leave teaching \naltogether.\n  I am not talking about something that is anecdotal. We have research \nfrom Project STAR in Tennessee that demonstrates children assigned to \nsmaller classes in grades K-3 received better grades, higher test \nscores, and were less likely to drop out of school or be held back \nthrough their entire educational careers. This is a research study that \nhas gone on for 15 years in the entire State of Tennessee. I applaud \nthe State because they made the investment to evaluate what they were \ndoing.\n  We found that the children who benefited the most were poor and \nminority children. By all means, test them and find out if they are \nfailing. But be fair and give them a chance to succeed. That is what we \nare calling for when we ask for reduced class sizes.\n  We know if we don't recruit teachers we will not be able to continue \nteaching anybody. Right now we have a national crisis when it comes to \nrecruiting and retaining teachers. There isn't any more important \nfactor than teacher quality in improving student achievement. Yet if \nyou are a young teacher placed in a situation such as this, if your \nclassroom is a hallway, as I have seen in some schools in New York, a \ncloset, that makes it very difficult to teach.\n  I recently heard from a constituent in Farmingdale, NY, who told me \ntheir elementary school alone needs 16 new teachers for kindergarten. \nIn Buffalo, 231 teachers retired last year, compared with an average of \n92 retirees in each of the preceding 8 years.\n  We can't just mandate that school districts go out and hire \ncertified, qualified teachers without providing some resources to make \nthat possible. We tried that in New York City. The court order said \nhire only certified teachers and put those certified teachers into the \nclasses where the kids are most at risk. So the school district went \nout, hired 2,000 certified teachers, assigned them to schools as \ndepicted in this picture and the previous pictures, and the 2,000 \ncertified teachers wouldn't take the job. Who can blame them? They are \ncertified teachers, qualified; they pass the tests; they have taken the \ncourses; they are assigned to a school where the conditions to teach \nare impossible.\n  If we are going to say let's only have certified, qualified teachers, \nthen for goodness' sake, provide help to districts such as those I \nrepresent so we can actually recruit and keep those certified, \nqualified teachers. I strongly believe this bill should include a \nteacher recruitment section. I am working with a bipartisan group to \noffer an amendment to help school districts meet the demands for \ncertified teachers.\n\n  Let me turn now to title I. I would like to paint a picture of what \nfull funding for title I means for the children of New York City. \nYesterday, several of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle \ncame to the floor to talk about the failure of title I to improve \nstudent learning and dismissed the idea that fully funding title I \ncould result in increased student achievement.\n  I want to be sure the American people have the facts about title I. \nThe real fact, as presented by the independent, nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service, is that in fiscal year 2001 Congress \nprovided school districts with only one-third of the resources needed \nto fully serve eligible students in order to help close the achievement \ngap. Even with this limited Federal investment, our school districts \nhave shown real gains in reading and math.\n  In 1999, the Council of Great City Schools found fourth and eighth \ngraders in urban schools boosted their performance in reading and math. \nIn fact, 87.5 percent of the urban school districts showed reading \ngains in Title I schools and 83 percent showed math gains. Moreover, \nthe study found that the percentage of title I students in urban \nschools below the 25th percentile had been declining over 2- and 3-year \nperiods while the percentage of title I students between the 25th and \n50th percentile was increasing.\n  There are those who will still deny these facts and make the claim \nthat title I doesn't make a difference. I often think Washington is the \nonly evidence-free zone in our country. The facts are the facts. Title \nI does make a difference. Imagine the results if cities such as New \nYork, Buffalo, Rochester, or Syracuse were able to assist all our title \nI eligible students rather than just a third of them. It would mean, \nfor example, in New York City, we could lower the current threshold and \nserve an additional 99,295 children. The city could invest in \nstrategies that work better. We could provide extended time initiatives \nthat we know make a difference with children. We could expand early \nliteracy intervention, and intervention strategies, have classroom \nprofessional development for teachers.\n  As we look at the bill, we need to look at a full investment in title \nI. It is not just a game of imagination but a real investment in \nstudent improvement that will pay off down the road. I will support \nSenator Dodd and Senator Collins in their efforts to include full \nfunding of title I in this bill.\n  Finally, let me touch on the issue of testing. In 1983, I called for \nstudent tests, high-stake student and high-stake teacher tests. I take \na back seat to no one when it comes to using testing and other measures \nof accountability to find out how well we are\n\n[[Page S4087]]\n\ndoing and hold ourselves accountable. But let's be sure the tests are \nactually going to accomplish the purpose for which they are intended. \nWe need to look at how children do from year to year, to help teachers \nmodify and individualize curriculum, and provide parents with timely \ninformation. We have to make sure that if they take a test in the \nwinter, they get the results that winter, not the following fall when \nthe children have moved on. We have to help schools know what the \nstandard should be so they are not teaching to the tests but they are \ntrying to measure the standards they have set. And we have to help pay \nfor the tests.\n  In New York alone, it would cost $16 million to comply with these new \nFederal testing requirements. Only $8 million would be provided by the \nFederal Government; the other $8 million is from scarce State \nresources. We need to be sure we are fair to our States. If we are \ngoing to mandate testing, let's not make it an unfunded mandate. Let's \nprovide the resources needed. If we do develop and implement the tests, \nwe need to have the resources to ensure that our children from the most \ndisadvantaged circumstances can pass and excel in those tests. I think \nthat means smaller classrooms, modern schools, quality teachers.\n  As we go forward in this debate, I hope we will think hard about the \nimpact we will have on our children, and that we do everything we \npossibly can to make sure we don't just pass a bill but we really do \nprovide the resources to reform education and produce better results \nacross our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Twenty-five minutes \nremains on the Republican side and 22 minutes remains on the Democratic \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no time is requested, it \nwill be deducted from both sides equally.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to be notified when I \nhave taken 3 minutes because I think it is very important that we \ndiscuss education reforms.\n  I think all of us have the same goal. Every one of us believes that \npublic education is not meeting the standards we envisioned for this \ncountry when we established public education as the basis for \ndemocracy. The question is, How do we do better? We have been adding \nmore money for education for the last 50 years, but we have not seen an \nimprovement in test scores or in the actual quality of education of our \nchildren who are graduating from public schools.\n  There are some public schools that are terrific. Those are the \nschools where parents and teachers and principals work together, where \nthere is an openness, where the principal welcomes the parents to be a \npart of the process. But the schools that are failing are the schools \nthat are afraid of accountability. There are teachers who do not want \nto have tests. Why don't they want to have tests? You can only assume \nthey are concerned that they will not pass and that their students will \nnot pass. That is not acceptable.\n  We have to have accountability. We have to have information for \nparents. Parents must know which schools are failing. If those schools \nare failing, we need to know how to bring them up to the higher \nstandards. The best way to do that is to look at other schools that are \nalike in demographics, to allow them to see what the good schools with \nthose demographics are doing: What are they doing right? That is what \nour reforms are meant to do.\n  We are focusing on accountability. Yes, it will hurt in some ways. It \nwill hurt if you fail. But wouldn't we rather have a failure early in a \nschool career, so we can correct it and give that child the real chance \nin life? Or do we want to continue social promotions with failing \nprograms so the child never has the chance to reach his or her full \npotential? I do not think that is what we want. We want to let the \nchild succeed. To do that, we need accountability. We might need \nfailure so we know what the problems are and we can bring them up to \nstandard.\n  That means we need to support the programs that work. We need to \nreduce bureaucracy. We need to increase flexibility. We need to empower \nparents. There is an absolute tie between parents who are involved and \nstudents who are successful. That is not based on the intellectual \ncapacity of the student. When the parent is involved, the student does \nbetter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has elapsed.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum because I have two more speakers on our \nside. Until I hear they are not going to make it, I am going to reserve \ntheir time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask to be notified when we have 15 \nminutes left. I assume that will give me about 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to talk about what the \nPresident's education plan does. The Democrats are claiming they have \noffered more spending on education. In fact, the President has proposed \nan 11.5-percent increase in overall education spending for fiscal year \n2002. This is an increase of $4.6 billion, to almost $54 billion next \nyear.\n  Included in this spending increase are key areas that we think will \ntarget the young people who need the help the most. It triples funding \nfor children's reading programs, because we know if a child cannot read \nat grade level, that is a child who is going to fail. There is no \nquestion about it. Time after time after time, when high school \ndropouts or junior high school dropouts have been talked to and \nlistened to, the problem is they can't read. Of course they are \nfrustrated if they can't read. Of course they miss the key points in a \nhistory lesson or geography lesson or a math lesson. If they can't \nread, they don't have a chance. So we are targeting the spending \nincreases at reading programs at the very earliest level.\n  That is why we want to test at the third grade level to see if a \nchild is falling back at the third grade, because we can catch that \nchild, we can save that child, if we can test at the third grade and \ngive the child the extra help so he or she will have the chance to read \nat grade level and compete and absorb what is being given as their \neducational opportunities.\n  A 30-percent increase is in this budget for Hispanic-serving \ninstitutions and historically black colleges and universities. Those \nare two areas that are doing great work. I have worked very hard for \nHispanic-serving institutions because I know if we put the money there \nand we give them the counseling they need in those universities, we \nwill have good, productive citizens. Our high school dropout rate among \nHispanics is the highest of any ethnic group in our country, and that \nis unacceptable. So we want to go for the Hispanic-serving institutions \nand give them that extra help so they will be able to graduate their \nyoung people into the good jobs that are available in our country.\n  The historically black colleges and universities do great service. I \nam going to give a graduation speech this weekend at Paul Quinn \nCollege, a historically black college that is doing a wonderful job of \neducating young people. They have a program at Paul Quinn College where \nthe young men go out and mentor the high school students in some of the \ndisadvantaged areas of Dallas. It enriches both the student who is \nbeing mentored and the mentor himself.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Collins, has arrived. I am going to ask \nher to talk about this subject because she is one of the leading Senate \nexperts in\n\n[[Page S4088]]\n\nthis education field. She is on the committee. She is making the \ncontributions. She knows this bill, and she knows what it can do for \npublic education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me start by thanking my good friend \nand colleague from Texas for her kind comments and for her leadership \nin this area. I have enjoyed working with her on a number of \neducational issues. We will be bringing one up later this week.\n  No endeavor is more important to our Nation's future than ensuring \nthat all children receive a good education. In a real sense, the future \nof our country rests on the shoulders of our Nation's educators and \ndepends upon the decisions we make today on how best to educate our \nleaders of tomorrow. I believe that this comprehensive education reform \nbill may well be the most important legislation the Senate debates this \nyear. I am hopeful that we will pass a bill that keeps the \ninspirational promise made by President Bush ``to leave no child \nbehind.''\n\n  In many cases, education is the difference between prosperity and \npoverty, hope and despair, dreams fulfilled and lost opportunities. \nBetween Silicon Valley and Wall Street, many Americans still live in \nthe shadows of the new prosperity. Education is the best, perhaps the \nonly way, to close the every-widening economic gap in America. Indeed, \nthe economic gap in America is largely an education gap. And, education \nis the best way for us to stoke the fire of our nation's economic \nengine.\n  The President deserves tremendous credit for making education his top \npriority and for setting a goal that inspires us all. This should not \nbe, and I hope will not be, a partisan debate, but rather a bipartisan \ndiscussion on how we can best achieve the goal of leaving no child \nbehind. I am convinced that, working together, we can help states, \ncommunities, local school boards, educators, and parents improve our \npublic schools significantly.\n  The Better Education for Students and Teachers, or BEST, Act is an \nexcellent start. The BEST Act demands a great deal from all of us. It \nwould require parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, school \nboard members, state legislators, governors, and federal officials to \nwork together to ensure that our children reach high standards of \nacademic excellence. It would give our schools more flexibility in \nspending federal funds while holding them accountable for what really \ncounts: improved student achievement. The legislation requires schools \nto answer the fundamental question: ``Are our children learning?''--\nrather than, ``Was that federal paperwork completed correctly?'' It \nchanges the focus from paperwork and process to results and \naccountability.\n  During the past four years, I have visited more than 60 schools all \nover the State of Maine, from Kittery at the southern tip, to Jackman \nin the west, Rockland on the coast, and Fort Kent in the north. I have \nseen firsthand the excellent work of Maine dedicated teachers. The \nquality of instruction taking place in Maine schools is impressive, and \nit is producing results. Maine's scores on national tests prove that \nour State's public schools are among the best in the nation. Moreover, \nMaine's public schools strive to provide a good education for all of \nour children regardless of their family income or where they live in \nour State.\n  A report issued last year by the Council of Chief State School \nOfficers shows that, low-income students in Maine are performing nearly \nas well as the average of public school students in our state. Yet even \nin Maine, nearly one in four students has not acquired a level of \nliteracy that is acceptable by most standards. Even in our strongest \nstates, too many children are being left behind!\n  Eighteen years ago, the landmark study, ``A Nation at Risk,'' warned \nof declining performance in American schools and turned the nation's \nattention toward reforming public education.\n  Today, however, too many schools, particularly in our inner cities, \ncontinue to fail to provide a solid education to their students. \nAlthough the United States spends more than $660 billion a year on \neducation, nearly 60 percent of our low-income fourth graders cannot \nread at a basic level.\n  The Federal Government takes a secondary role to States and \ncommunities in terms of funding and overseeing our public schools, and \nthat is how it should be. The Federal role is, nevertheless, important, \nparticularly for helping disadvantaged students.\n  Unfortunately, Washington has not always been helpful, nor has it \nbeen successful in achieving that goal. After spending $125 billion of \ntitle I funding for disadvantaged students over 25 years, there is \nlittle to suggest that we are making progress in narrowing the \nachievement gap. Fewer than a third of fourth graders can read at grade \nlevel. If you look more closely at test scores, over time, you will \nnotice the better students improving their performance while the worse \nstudents are getting worse. You also see a persistent achievement gap \nbetween students from a disadvantaged families and their more affluent \npeers. Although title I was created to put economically challenged \nstudents on even ground with their peers, recent data from the National \nAssessment of Education Progress (NAEP) prove that the program has not \nachieved the goal of narrowing the gap in achievement.\n  A state-by-state analysis of scores from the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress, the only test to measure student achievement \nnationwide, reveals troubling statistics that should give us pause, \nand that should cause us to ask what we should do differently. Many of \nus believe that more money and more resources are needed, but we can't \npour more money into a failed system. We need to increase the dollars, \nbut we also need to demand change.\n\n  For example, let's look at the scores. There has been virtually no \nchange since 1992 in fourth grade reading scores. As you can see from \nthis chart, the line is flat despite the increase in expenditures over \nthis 30-year period.\n  The analysis found that only two states--Georgia and Massachusetts--\nreduced the gap between white students and black or Hispanic students \nin fourth-grade math. No state did so in eighth grade, leaving gaps as \nwide as 56 points in Washington, DC, and 35 points in New Jersey. In \nreading, only Delaware reduced the gap.\n  Overall, only 32% of fourth-graders were deemed to be ``proficient'' \nor better in reading in 2000. Nearly four in 10 students nationally \ncontinue to read below a basic level, meaning they have serious \nproblems understanding even simple texts.\n  Sixty-three percent of African-American fourth-graders, 60 percent of \nchildren in poverty, and 47 percent of children in urban schools fell \n``below basic'' in their skills, meaning they have less than even a \n``partial mastery'' of the material.\n  Again, look how flat these scores are, whether you are looking at the \n4th graders, the 8th graders, or the 12th graders. This is the system \nthat cries out for change. We have increased the amount of money we are \nspending. I support more investment in education. But we need to face \nthe reality that what we have been doing in far too many cases has not \nbeen working. It has not focused on improving student achievement or on \nensuring that every child gets a good education.\n  The Federal Government has spent a great deal of money on education \nprograms over the past 35 years without a great deal to show for it. \nThese statistics show that a new approach is needed, and a part of that \nnew approach needs to be an increased focus on reading and literacy.\n  These results are particularly distressing given that researchers in \nrecent years have reached a consensus on the best practices to teach \nreading. The research, however, has yet to find its way into many \nclassrooms.\n  This is one reason why the Reading First Initiative in S. 1 is so \nvery important. We need to put proven teaching methods into the hands \nof our educators. We know that if our classroom teachers are not \noffered extensive training in the area of literacy, then many of our \nchildren will not learn to read to the best of their ability. The \nReading First Initiative makes professional development a top priority \nand it establishes an early reading intervention program that, I \nbelieve, will make a real difference.\n  I have worked extensively with the President and the Department of \nEducation in this area, and I am very\n\n[[Page S4089]]\n\npleased with the results that we have come up with. Earlier this year, \nI introduced the Early Reading Intervention Act to address the urgent \nneed to improve reading skills. The reading portion of the BEST Act is \na synthesis of the President's plan and my legislation.\n  It simply does not make sense to test a child's reading ability for \nthe first time in third grade and discover the child's reading skills \nare far below his or her peers, when, at that point, the chances of the \nstudent learning to read at grade level by the end of elementary school \nare less than 25 percent. Yet, that is what occurs far too often with \nfar too many of our children. By contrast, if a child is tested and \nreceives help in kindergarten or first grade, that child has a 90 to 95 \npercent chance of becoming a good reader. Since reading is learned more \neasily and effectively during the early grades, it makes sense to \nidentify reading problems and language-based learning disabilities \nearly when intervention can make a difference.\n  Our goal--the goal set forth by the President--must be for all \nstudents to read by the third grade. By achieving this goal, we can \ndecrease the number of students who will need special education and \nensure that every child--all of our students--have the necessary tools \nto handle the curriculum in the future years.\n\n  An investment of $5 billion to ensure that every child in America can \nread by the third grade is a serious and long-term commitment. It is a \nsignificant first step toward improving our Nation's failing report \ncard for the best way to ensure that no child is left behind is to \nensure that every child knows how to read.\n  I am also very pleased that the BEST Act contains the Rural Education \nInitiative, which I introduced with my colleagues, Senators Conrad, \nGregg, Enzi, Hutchinson, Roberts, Dorgan, Burns, Hagel, Allard, and \nThomas. This important legislation will give small rural school \ndistricts more flexibility by allowing them to combine small, \ncategorical grant programs into a single grant that can be used to \ntarget local needs. It will also provide these rural schools with \nsupplemental funds to compensate them for their inability to compete \nwith larger school districts for a number of Federal education grants.\n  As I look forward to the important education debate ahead, I see \ngreat opportunity. I see a constructive debate not about whether the \nFederal Government has a role to play in educating our youth but about \nhow it can best promote excellence in all of our public schools and for \nall of our children. I see a President with a vision for how we can \nreshape and reinvigorate our educational system and a commitment to \ndoing what it takes to help our students succeed. And I see Senators, \nall of whom have listened to those who know best--our parents, our \nteachers, our school board members and our administrators back home who \nhave ideas on how to make the BEST Act even better.\n  Now is the time for us to lay a new foundation for the education of \nAmerica's youth. It is time for us to seize this tremendous opportunity \nand to unite behind the inspiring goal the President has set forth of \nleaving no child behind.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time under the control of the majority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The minority manager has offered me 5 minutes of his \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first of all, I commend the Senator from \nMaine for not only her excellent presentation but for her work on the \ncommittee. She is an invaluable member of our committee. I want to give \nher the accolades she deserves for what she has done to help us during \nthis difficult time of trying to define how we can best improve the \neducational capacity of our Nation.\n  Today, the Senate begins its consideration of the Better Education \nfor Students and Teachers Act. The BEST Act is an opportunity to \ncombine our efforts with those of President Bush to guide the course of \nthe No. 1 issue facing our Nation today: the education of our children. \nThe BEST Act represents a bipartisan blueprint for meaningful education \nreform. We are putting forward an elementary and secondary education \ninitiative that provides the necessary tools for every child to receive \na quality education.\n  The BEST Act will strengthen accountability across the board to \nimprove student performance, expand assessment programs so that parents \nand schools will have an accurate measurement of how well their \nchildren are learning, provide the funds necessary to prepare, recruit, \nand train highly qualified teachers, develop reading programs to ensure \nthat all students will be able to read by the third grade, create \npartnerships for States and colleges and universities to strengthen K-\n12 math and science education, and provide for emerging technology \nactivities that will boost student achievement.\n\n  BEST builds upon current law and requires States to create a single \naccountability system which will provide the mechanisms for moving all \nstudents toward proficiency. States must assess students in grades 3-8 \nannually in mathematics, reading and science. The results of these \nassessments will provide parents and the public an effective, highly \nvisible measure of success and failure. Just as parents receive report \ncards to see how their children are performing in school, they will now \nbe able to get report cards to see how the school is performing for \ntheir children.\n  If schools are not measuring up to the standards, BEST requires \nStates, local education agencies, and schools to improve overall \nperformance. These tough, new accountability standards are the \ncornerstone of BEST.\n  BEST creates new programs to help our children learn to read at an \nearly age. These programs are Reading First and Early Reading First. \nPresident Bush has set as a goal for the Nation that all students be \nproficient readers by the end of the third grade. This is critically \nimportant. An engineer will tell you that without a deep and strong \nfoundation, you cannot build a tower. An educator will tell you that \nwithout strong and deeply rooted reading skills, you cannot reach a \nhigh academic level. Young students who cannot read--with speed, \naccuracy and understanding--are likely to fall further behind from \ntheir peers in reading ability and in all other subjects. Research has \nproven that the sills which make learning to read possible develop at a \nmuch earlier age. The Early Reading First demonstration program in BEST \nwill provide preschool-age children who are 3 and 4 years old with the \nopportunity to gain the important language and pre-literacy skills \nidentified by rigorous research.\n  BEST also recognizes that an investment in better teachers is an \ninvestment in our Nation's young people. Children can make greater \nacademic gains if they have a knowledgeable and caring teacher leading \ntheir classroom. The bill takes a flexible approach that allows States \nand educational agencies to adopt successful models that will best meet \ntheir needs. Previous programs are combined to lessen the burden on \nschools and States. BEST puts an emphasis on innovative professional \ndevelopment program to maximize opportunities for teachers. At the same \ntime, the bill requires professional development to be tied to \neffective strategies for increasing teacher performance and student \nachievement. BEST demands strong accountability in combination with \neffective approaches to get the best from our teachers and students.\n  Student achievement in the United States has fallen behind many other \ncountries in the areas of math and science. BEST includes important new \ninitiatives designed to improve upon performance here.\n  An enormous improvement in math and science education at the K \nthrough 12 level is necessary if today's students want good jobs and \nthe U.S. wants to stay competitive in the world economy. If American \nstudents are not prepared to fill high-tech jobs that require advanced \nmath and science skills, then those jobs will go elsewhere or people \nwill come from other countries to fill them. To achieve this, BEST will \nallow for the establishment of math and science partnerships between \ninstitutions of higher learning, States, and\n\n[[Page S4090]]\n\nschool districts. These partnerships will help our teachers become more \neffective, improve student achievement, and help keep our economy \nstrong and vital.\n\n  BEST will also provide assistance to help eliminate the digital \ndivide in the nation's schools. It is very important that we not \nseparate technology from learning. Technology must not be used for it's \nown sake. Technology must be used to improve student outcomes. BEST \ncontains strong accountability provisions to ensure that this occurs.\n  We are faced with an opportunity to do what is right for the children \nof our country. We have a chance to improve their education, and to \nimprove their lives. This bill increases accountability in the \neducation delivery system on all fronts. It provides strong new \nassessments to ensure that all of our children are well served by their \nschools. It authorizes the necessary resources required to have first \nrate educational opportunities available to all children in this \nnation.\n  Mr. President, we are starting today on bringing forward the \nPresident's proposal which is the cornerstone of the future of this \nNation's ability to improve its education. I praise the President for \nbringing this very excellent bill forward. We have worked hard on it on \nthe committee. I am confident we will pass it and that it will become \nlaw.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak \nuntil someone from the Democratic side comes to reclaim their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee that is going to bring forth the education bill. I am \nvery optimistic we are going to have a bill. I thank him for working so \nhard in a very bipartisan way to produce a bill. The reforms are pretty \nwell agreed to. Both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate are coming \ntogether to say: We need a change. Business as usual in our education \nsystem is not going to cut it anymore. There are too many children \nfalling behind and nobody in this country wants that to happen. Every \none of us knows our democracy depends on a well-educated populace.\n  Most people would agree that the variations in the standards of our \npublic schools across the country mean we are not succeeding in the \nmandate for a quality public education system. That is why Chairman \nJeffords and Senator Kennedy, Senator Collins, Senator Frist, Senator \nGregg, Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas, Senator Sessions of Alabama, and \nSenator Enzi have worked so hard to make sure this bill does not fall \nby the wayside.\n  I am a little frustrated that it has taken so long to get this bill \nto the floor. After all, this is a bill we have debated before. We \nactually debated it last session. It was not passed. We are back again. \nSurely there are divisions, but let's get the divisions out there. \nLet's get them out there. Let's make the decisions and let's reform \npublic education so that every child in our country will have the \nopportunity to reach his or her full potential with a public education. \nThat is our goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Oregon if his State has a \ntesting program with accountability that would be something we would \nwant to have as a nation. Has he had experience with accountability in \nthe State of Oregon?\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, we do have testing. I do not \nthink it is on the scale that we are contemplating in this bill.\n  What I hear, as I travel the State of Oregon, over and over again \nfrom parents is: We would like to give more resources to education. We \nwould like more accountability for that. We would like better results \nfor that.\n  I commend the Senator from Texas and others on the committee, Senator \nCollins, and our friends on the Democratic side who are focusing on \nsome very significant reforms in this bill. If I can cut through the \narguments I am hearing, as I have listened and presided today, often we \ntend to confuse what we are about, whether we are about developing a \nsystem of employment for adults or whether we are about developing a \nsystem for educating children. If we can keep the focus on educating \nchildren, there are all kinds of things that become possible in terms \nof testing, not just kids but teachers as well, to make sure we are \ndelivering results, that we are giving parents more choices so we give \ntheir children more chances.\n  In a nutshell, that is what I want to vote for: more resources but \nalso more reform. If we do that, the American people will look at our \nwork as Republicans and Democrats and thank us for generations to come. \nThere is not a single thing we could do more significantly for the \nfuture of our country, for the parents and their children, than to \nprovide more resources and to demand more reform. We keep our \nstewardship then.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Oregon. That is why \nPresident Bush has worked so hard to make this a priority to say that \nthere is nothing more important we can do than to provide a quality \npublic education for every one of the young people in our country.\n  I ask the Senator from Oregon if he would like the floor. If so, I am \nhappy to yield.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I gave my speech because of the \nquestion of the Senator from Texas. I thank her for that opportunity.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Oregon. I am pleased that \nhe, too, is committed to reform. All of us know that if we are going to \ngive every child a chance, we are going to have to make some changes. \nAnd some of those are going to be hard changes, there is no question \nabout it.\n  Some of the people who are in the system today don't want testing. \nThey don't like testing. I can understand that. But what is the \nalternative to accountability? What is the alternative to finding out \nwhat is wrong in our system?\n  If we can't admit that we have some weaknesses in the system and try \nto correct them, we will never get any better. What we want to do is \nfind the weaknesses in the system and correct them while there is still \na chance.\n  Let's correct the reading weaknesses in the third grade rather than \nin junior high school because we will have wasted years if we are not \nable to give a child a chance with the full capability to read in the \nthird grade. Instead, if we wait until junior high school, we have \nwasted 6 years--6 years. Why would we do that?\n  It is time to take the bold steps. The President has asked us to do \nso. We have a bipartisan, general consensus in Congress, and I think it \nis time for us to act. I don't see any reason to start saying, well, if \nwe amend one bill, then maybe we are going to have a substitute and \nwhat would that do to the amendment? Come on, can't we figure that out? \nCan't we say that all of the amendments passed by this Senate will go \non to the final bill after the amendments are made, and if there is a \nsubstitute, they would go to that substitute? That is not rocket \nscience. If we can't figure that out, then we have no business being \nhere.\n  So I think it is time for us to act. We are wasting time. We have \nbeen talking about going to the education bill now for a week and 2 \ndays. We are going to lose another day today if we don't start \nimmediately to actually debate this bill. I hope that we will do that.\n  I want to outline a few more of the points of the bill, and I think \nthis is a very important one. The plan is going to allow students who \nare trapped in failing schools to leave those schools by using title I \nfunds to transfer to a higher performing public school or a private \nschool if that is passed. I would like to see that because I want a \nparent to have all of the options. I don't want only parents who can \nafford private schools for their children to have the best. I want \nevery parent to have the best. What could be more frustrating for a \nparent than to see their child in a school that is not performing and \nknow that that child is never going to have the full chance in life and \nthe parent can't change the school because the parent can't afford a \nprivate school or a parochial school. Why would we do that? We have the \nalternative.\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\n  In addition, education savings accounts will be increased to $5,000 \nand expanded from K through 12, not just college anymore.\n  We also include additional dollars for States to use to control \nviolence and other crimes in schools because there is no doubt that in \nour country, if children are not safe and secure in their schools, they \nare not going to have the optimum learning environment. No doubt about \nit, they must have secure schools and drug-free schools.\n  Parents will be given a greater flexibility for their child's best \ninterest. School districts will be given greater flexibility. This will \nbe accomplished by decreasing administrative costs and paperwork. When \nI do townhall meetings in my State, teachers come in and say: Get rid \nof the paperwork. Let me teach. Let me spend my time with the students \nfinding out what they need and helping them learn.\n  One teacher came to a townhall meeting that I had with a stack of \npapers this big and said that is what she had been working on all week. \nInstead of being in the classroom or counseling children after class, \nshe was filling out forms this thick. That is not what is going to \nimprove public education. It is the attention a teacher can give to \nchildren, to assess what their weaknesses are and bring them up to \nspeed.\n  We are going to provide technology assistance, and math and science \ninstruction will be reemphasized, as well as basic literacy. \nPartnerships between schools and higher education institutions will be \nencouraged, and new Federal initiatives such as Reading First K through \n12, and Early Reading First Preschool will offer States incentives to \nimplement rigorous literacy education.\n\n  We have solved a problem in my home State of Texas. The University of \nNorth Texas has an accelerated math course for high school math \nprodigies, so that high school students with math aptitude can go to \nthe University of North Texas and take college courses and get their \nhigh school degree with accelerated capabilities to go into college. \nThis is so that you don't hold back the students who are already beyond \nhigh school competency. You give the child a chance to grow at his or \nher level and competency capability. It is quite exciting. I would love \nto see that happen all over our country, where an innovative, higher \neducation institution would offer programs for high school students. I \nhope we will be able to encourage that by passing the bill that is \nbefore us.\n  We are also going to try to help teachers help themselves. They \ndeserve recognition and assistance. The President's plan will allow \nteachers to make tax deductions of up to $400 to help defray costs \nassociated with out-of-pocket classroom expenses. I don't know a \nteacher that doesn't spend money from his or her own pocket to try to \nhelp the child get the tools the child needs in class, the crayons, or \na ruler, or a tablet to write on, because the child comes to school \nwithout the proper school supplies. Many times, the child's family \ndoesn't have the money for the school supplies. The teacher digs in her \npocket and puts the money out and buys the supplies for the kids. That \nteacher does it because that teacher is dedicated. But we want to help \ndefray those out-of-pocket costs. We want to give those young people \nthe opportunity to have everything they need but not at the personal \nexpense of the teachers. We don't pay teachers enough for the work they \ndo anyway. The last thing we should expect is for them to defray the \ncost of their young people's school supplies out of their own \npocketbooks.\n  Mr. President, as I close today, I want to say that there is nothing \nmore important that we will do in this session of Congress than to \nreform public education, to make sure that public education gives every \nchild the opportunity to reach his or her full potential. Yes, we think \nprivate schools are great and, yes, parochial schools are great, and \nthey are a part of the option that a parent might have. But what we are \nresponsible for is to make sure that every child has access to a public \neducation that is quality and that competes with any other school in \nthe world. That is what will keep our democracy strong, and that is \nwhat will fulfill our responsibility as Members of the U.S. Senate.\n  I can't wait to get to this bill because I have some amendments I \nwant to offer that would provide creativity for our school districts, \nthat would try to encourage more people to come into the classroom with \nexpertise in an area--maybe not a teaching degree but someone with an \nexpertise. I want to offer single-sex school classes in public schools \nas another option, which is now available in private schools but not in \npublic schools to any great degree. I am going to talk about those \namendments later.\n  I want to get on to this bill so that we can pass these reforms and \nso that the next school year that starts in September will be a school \nyear that is different from the past 25 years and will have more \noptions and more creativity and more capabilities for the young people \nof our country to excel.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my colleague in entreating to get \nthis bill moving. I am proud to serve on the committee. It is badly \nneeded.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I respond to the Senator from Virginia and mention \nthat he, as a very senior member of the Senate, asked to go on the \nEducation Committee because of his interest in improving our public \nschools. I appreciate he made that a priority. His contribution is very \nmuch one that has helped this process this year.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I may say to my colleague, at the time our conference \nwas allocating that last seat, I knew of the interest of the Senator \nfrom Texas. She extended to this Senator certain courtesies I shall not \nforget, enabling me to have that as my third committee. I thank the \nSenator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4091-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

I was \nUnder Secretary of the Navy beginning in February 1969, together with \nour most beloved and distinguished former colleague who sat behind me \nmany years, Senator Chafee, who was the Secretary. Senator Chafee and \nI, then Secretary of the Navy and Under Secretary Warner, were a very \nclose working team. I have searched my mind many times as to what he \nwould say were he here today. I think I can safely represent to the \nSenate that my remarks today would be very close to, if not exactly, \nwhat my dear friend, our former Senator and former Secretary of the \nNavy, would have said about our colleague, Bob Kerrey, this \ndistinguished officer of the U.S. Navy.\n  I came to know him in the many years we served together in the \nSenate. We often sat together on the floor. I remember distinctly going \nover to his side of the aisle. We reflected on those days together of \nVietnam. He shared with me some very personal insights with regard to \nthat conflict and how they affected his life.\n  I am also very respectful of Senators McCain, Cleland, Hagel, and \nJohn Kerry. I have, likewise, had the benefit of listening to them and \nsharing with them my recollections of that incredible period of \nAmerican history. I served in the Pentagon beginning in February 1969, \nleaving in 1974, for 5 years plus a few months during some of the most \nintense periods of that conflict. I visited Vietnam on occasions, as \ndid Secretary of the Navy Chafee, and then when I became Secretary of \nthe Navy, succeeding Chafee, of course, my visits continued. I have \nbeen on the fire bases, in the hospitals, where the wounded were \nbrought back.\n  I remember one story, the former Commandant of the Marine Corps, \nGeneral Krulak, came to see me just before his confirmation to review \nvarious procedural matters with regard to his confirmation. We were \nthere with General Mundy. He was then Commandant of the Marine Corps. \nWe spent an hour together in a very thorough analysis of his \nbackground. I was doing it on behalf of then-Chairman Strom Thurmond. \nGeneral Krulak got up to leave. This is a moment I shall never forget \nin my career as a Senator.\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\n  He said: Senator Warner, this is not the first time we met. I was a \nlittle taken aback. I was thinking, where had I met this fine officer? \nI had known his father. He said: I was wounded in Vietnam, and I was in \nthe process of being evacuated. I was on a stretcher with other men who \nhad just been wounded, and the helicopter was coming in to take us out. \nSomeone came up and grabbed me by the big toe and shook that toe. He \nsaid to me: Captain, you are going to be all right; you are going to \nmake it. He said: I am here today to say, I made it, and you were that \ngentleman, as Secretary of the Navy, who grabbed me by the toe.\n  I had no recollection because I visited with so many wounded and \ninjured in that period on my visits to Vietnam. But it is a personal \nrecollection of that period that I shared with another distinguished \ncombat veteran who did a wonderful job as Commandant.\n  Bob Kerrey and I traveled together, I remember so well, on a trip to \nBosnia. We were coming into that zone where the war had just passed \nthrough not more than a day, if even as much as a day. Homes were \nburning. The ordnance was clearly visible, and the escort officers we \nhad were somewhat concerned. I remember Kerrey fearlessly walking \nthrough areas. I was there by his side. We visited with a number of \ndetainees who had been captured. You learn about an individual when you \ndo a trip such as that. I became very close to him. We bonded together \nin many respects on that trip to that war zone on that particular day, \nthe several days we were together.\n  I reposed unquestioned confidence in his judgment, his honesty, and \nhis integrity, being his boss in 1969, as Under Secretary of the Navy, \nat that time when these incidents happened. Indeed, the Medal Of Honor \ncame up through the Navy Secretariat. I remember it quite well. Senator \nChafee and I sat down, and Senator Chafee, then being the Secretary, \naffixed his name to that citation for his heroic actions.\n  This has been a personal experience to watch very carefully, to study \nand read the many pieces that have been written, to watch him in his \npublic appearances and study his face very carefully, his eyes and his \nmannerism, as he, I think in a very forthright manner, shared with the \nAmerican public, and, indeed, those in Vietnam who watched, his \nheartfelt expressions about this incident. It was a tragic incident.\n  I ask unanimous consent two articles which appeared in today's media \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 1, 2001]\n\n                         The Consequence of War\n\n                            (By James Webb)\n\n       The Vietnamese government is happy to trot out witnesses \n     from the supposed atrocity conducted by Bob Kerrey's Navy \n     SEALs at Thanh Phong. It is doubtful that they would be so \n     cooperative if questions were asked about Communist killings \n     in places such as My Loc.\n       In April 1969, the Marine rifle company to which I was \n     assigned was operating in the An Hoa Basin of Vietnam, west \n     and south of Danang. In addition to our routine of long-range \n     combat patrols and defensive positions along a vital and \n     heavily contested road, it was decided that we would provide \n     security for a ``town meeting'' hosted by the South \n     Vietnamese government's district chief, who had been \n     criticized for living in the distant and more secure confines \n     of Danang. Over the space of a few days, visits were made to \n     nearby hamlets, where 30 delegates were chosen to attend the \n     meeting. After that, the district chief and his senior aide \n     were brought in on the morning convoy.\n       A thatch-covered ``hooch'' at the bottom of our perimeter, \n     about the size of a typical American living room, was chosen \n     as the meeting place. Shortly after the meeting began, a Viet \n     Cong assassination team raced through the thick foliage, hit \n     the hooch, and fled. My rifle platoon was returning from a \n     combat patrol as explosions rang out to our front. In seconds \n     a Viet Cong soldier sprinting down the trail collided with my \n     point man. I can still see his young face, adrenalized and \n     madly grinning, as he was captured. And I remember the sight \n     of the others as we reached the hooch.\n       The floor inside was covered with an ankle-deep mix of \n     blood, innards, limbs and bodies. I and several others waded \n     into the human mire, emptying bodies from the hooch and \n     finding medical care for those who had survived. Nineteen \n     people were dead, including the district chief and his aide. \n     The aide's right arm was blown off near the elbow, its \n     tendons like slim white feathers, as if he had been reaching \n     to catch a grenade.\n       Nearby an older woman sat motionless against a wall, her \n     face stunned and her dark eyes piercing, untouched except for \n     a small, square hole in her forehead. I thought she was alive \n     until I grabbed her arm. The wounded squirmed on the floor, \n     reaching past dead bodies as they crawled in the muck, \n     covered thickly with blood and twisting among each other like \n     giant fishing worms.\n       We cleaned out the hooch, evacuated the wounded, washed at \n     a nearby well, and went back to our war. By the next day this \n     incident was over, a little piece of history in the long and \n     ugly journey of a combat tour. But in the coming months as I \n     reflected on them, the killings at My Loc raised an important \n     distinction, which has become even more relevant with the \n     media firestorm over Bob Kerrey's ill-fated SEAL patrol in \n     the Mekong Delta.\n       Civilians have a terrible time in any war zone--fully one-\n     third of the population of Okinawa was killed in 12 weeks of \n     fighting on that island in 1945. But in a guerrilla war, the \n     support or control of the local population, rather than the \n     conquest of territory, is the ultimate objective. Civilians \n     become enmeshed in the actual fighting, inseparable from it.\n       They fight among themselves for political dominance of a \n     local area. They form an infrastructure and quietly support \n     one side or the other when it moves through their village. \n     They suffer greatly when battles are fought on top of them, \n     and when emotions overcome logic and troops snap, as at My \n     Lai. But the villagers of My Loc and others like them, \n     clearly noncombatants, were killed purely as a matter of \n     political control, for having met with a South Vietnamese \n     government official and given some legitimacy to his \n     authority.\n       Any American who directed a similar slaughter, or \n     participated in it, would have been court-martialed. This \n     distinction was basic to our policy in Vietnam, and it seems \n     to have been lost by many over the past week. The body \n     language and word choices of many media commentators \n     indicates clearly that a larger issue--how history will judge \n     our involvement in Vietman--is still very much in play, and a \n     big part of that issue is to continue to demean the American \n     sacrifices in that war.\n       Words like ``atrocity'' and ``massacre'' are routinely \n     being thrown about, with some even calling for Nuremberg-like \n     trials for Americans' war crimes in Vietnam. Aggressive \n     reporters have played ``gotcha'' with every Kerrey statement. \n     How could he say it was a moonless night when the charts say \n     it was a half-moon? (Try clouds. Or canopy. Or vegetation.) \n     Did he take one shot or many shots at the first outpost? Did \n     he kneel on a guy when his throat was getting cut?\n       For many who went through extensive combat in Vietnam, such \n     parsing brings back an anger caused by memories not of the \n     war but of the condescending arrogance directed at them upon \n     their return, principally by people in their own age group \n     who had risked nothing and yet microscopically judged every \n     action of those who had risked everything and often lost a \n     great deal. Combat in a guerrilla war requires constant moral \n     judgments, in an environment with unending pressure, little \n     sheep, and no second chances for yourself or the people you \n     are leading when you guess wrong. Were we perfect? No. Were \n     we worse than Americans in other wars, or our enemy in this \n     one? Hardly.\n       Which brings us to the recent attention given the Kerrey \n     patrol. There is much in the New York Times magazine story to \n     make one uneasy. They key ``witness'' from the village where \n     the incident took place is the wife of a former Viet Cong \n     soldier, who now has told Time magazine that she did not \n     actually see the killings. She and the other Vietnamese \n     witness, who was 12 at the time of the incident, live in a \n     communist state where propaganda regarding America's ``evil'' \n     war efforts is one of the mainsprings of political \n     legitimacy--not the best conditions to produce honesty in \n     cases with international implications.\n       The one member of Mr. Kerrey's SEAL team to allege extreme \n     conduct did not pass the credibility test with Newsweek \n     magazine when the story was considered there. CBS's ``60 \n     Minutes,'' which co-sponsored the investigation, seems to \n     have an affinity for stories about Americans committing \n     atrocities, having rehashed My Lai as the best way to \n     remember the 30th anniversary of 1968, the year that brought \n     the worst fighting, and highest American casualties, of the \n     war.\n       Most important, to one practiced in both combat and \n     journalism, a key and possibly determinative piece of \n     information seems vastly underplayed. According to the Times \n     magazine story, archive records of Army radio transmissions \n     indicate that two days after the incident, ``an old man from \n     Thanh Phong presented himself to the district chief's \n     headquarters with claims for retribution for alleged \n     atrocities committed the night of 25 and 26 February 69. Thus \n     far it appears 24 people were killed. 13 were women and \n     children and one old man, 11 were unidentified and assumed to \n     be VC.''\n       Given the tone of the story, this radio transmission was \n     probably included because it refers to the Kerrey patrol as \n     having committed an atrocity. But a closer reading would \n     appear to confirm the position of Mr. Kerrey and the five \n     others on the patrol that they took fire and returned it, \n     with the loss of civilian lives an unfortunate consequence.\n       This piece of evidence is perhaps the most objective \n     account available of the results of the Kerrey patrol, coming \n     as it does from a\n\n[[Page S4093]]\n\n     time near the incident, from a man who was asking for \n     retribution and thus was hardly trying to cover things up. It \n     also coincides with Mr. Kerry's recollection of 13 or 14 dead \n     civilians in the village before the team left the scene, as \n     any Viet Cong soldiers would most likely have been on the \n     other side of the villagers who were killed, perhaps even \n     using them as a screen while attempting to escape.\n       As has often been said over the past week, we will never \n     know the exact details of what occurred. But is a seven-man \n     patrol operating independently at night far inside enemy \n     territory killed 11 Viet Cong soldiers after coming under \n     fire, it would seem they hit their assigned target. And the \n     loss of civilian life that accompanied this brief but brutal \n     firefight adds up not to an atrocity or a massacre, but to a \n     tragic consequence of a war fought in the middle of a \n     civilian population.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Times, May 1, 2001]\n\n                         Scales of Culpability\n\n                         [(Georgie Anne Geyer)\n\n       In days long gone by, when we lived far simpler lives, \n     according to the corny but nevertheless accurate truism, we \n     agreed that to genuinely know another human, you needed to \n     walk awhile in his moccasins.\n       In those days, too, the press in particular held as its \n     central maxim the idea that we journalists were blessed with \n     our wondrous positions in order to tell the relative truths \n     that keep people sane (journalism is news, not ``truths'') \n     and to relate rather than judge. Walk in anyone else's \n     moccasins today trying to understand another's life? Not \n     really interested.\n       Instead, in journalism and in politics as well, the \n     response to trials, scandal and tragedy has boiled down to \n     most news-gatherers (1) having no common experience with the \n     prolific targets of their fleeting attention, and (2) not \n     hesitating to publicly reveal every delicious tidbit they can \n     unearth. Thus, they become prosecutor, judge and jury.\n       As you may perhaps have guessed, I'm being so critical \n     because of the evolving case study of Nebraska's respected \n     senator, Bob Kerrey.\n       The retired senator, now president of the New School \n     University in New York, has long been one of our most \n     responsible public servants. Thoughtful, intellectual, known \n     for his integrity: Those are only a few of the small \n     accolades he has merited in a capital so often these days \n     filled with incompetence and greed.\n       Recently, in a series of revelations whose genesis, at \n     least as of this writing remains unclear, a tragic story has \n     been unfolding about him in different venues of the press.\n       In short, the story is that, in a midnight raid on a \n     supposed Viet Cong village in 1969, Mr. Kerrey led a Navy \n     SEALs raid. He believed his nervous and inexperienced unit \n     had been fired upon by the village, and so they bombarded it. \n     But when they entered, they found only the bodies of 13 \n     Vietnamese women and children or more.\n       For those of us who were in Vietnam (I was there for a \n     total of 10 months as a foreign correspondent for the Chicago \n     Daily News in 1967, '68, '69 and '70), such accidents of war \n     were so common as to be barely commented upon. In fact, what \n     exactly did Americans at home expect of these young men and \n     women, having sent them into such a hopeless and agonizing \n     morass, barely prepared and on such an imprecise, futile \n     mission?\n       On any given night there, our soldiers were in dark jungles \n     or mountain ranges. They didn't know where the ``enemy'' \n     was--or why in God's name they were there at all. They didn't \n     speak the language, understand the culture, or see the great \n     ``geopolitical importance'' their leaders safely at home in \n     their air conditioned Washington offices seemed so insistent \n     upon giving to ``Vietnam.''\n       There were some sadists and psychopaths in the U.S. \n     military then--and there were plenty of them in the anti-war \n     movement, as well--but Bob Kerrey was certainly not one of \n     them. Indeed, in all of the reporting on his bleak and \n     tormenting memories of that night, Mr.Kerrey has spoken \n     repeatedly of how he has ``never made by peace with what \n     happened that night.''\n       Nor should the fact that his own fellow SEALs offer \n     dirrerent versions of that night by really surprise anyone. \n     Thirty-two years ago, a moonless night in a strange and \n     unknown country, told the enemy was all around them. . . . \n     Why, most of the families I know would tell different stories \n     abut what they had for dinner last night.\n       Still, even having said this, at least two additional \n     points need to be made: about the men truly responsible for \n     those moonless missions in Vietnam and about the coverage of \n     this Bob Kerrey story.\n       For there are people who deserve to suffer as Mr. Kerrey \n     has--haunted and profoundly regretful for what he did under \n     his country's orders in the name of his people. They had the \n     real responsibility. Robert McNamara, the supercilious \n     weapons maven, Lyndon Johnson (remember how he just resigned \n     midstream when the war wouldn't go his way?), the fall-in-\n     line joint chiefs of staff, not one of whom resigned over the \n     war, even John F. Kennedy and Harry S. Truman. I haven't \n     heard of much trauma or many sounds of remorse from these \n     men, let alone any seeking of forgiveness. And, remember, \n     too, that the American people voted enthusiastically for many \n     of these ``strategists'' of war.\n       There are also people in the media for whom ``Vietnam'' is \n     less a country or even a war than another way to ``get'' \n     public officials.\n       Most of the media do not cover stories overseas these days. \n     (If you watch the news discussion shows, few of the \n     participants go out in the field to actually report anymore.)\n       That's precisely why they can be so judgmental of the men \n     and women our country sends out to do its dirty work. \n     Judgmentalism is fun. It builds bylines and reputations, and \n     if it hurts a few public lives here and there, well, that's \n     what those guys should have expected when they went into \n     public office. Given all of this, Bob Kerrey continues to \n     look like the hero everyone has thought him.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I was personally impressed by these articles, the first \nwritten by former Secretary of the Navy Jim Webb appearing today in the \nWall Street Journal, and the second in the Washington Times, written by \nGeorgie Anne Geyer. I have not sat down with Ms. Geyer in some time, \nbut in my course of these 23 years in the Senate, I have had the \nopportunity to be interviewed by her. She is a very thoughtful and \ncareful journalist. In this article she recounts that she spent some 10 \nmonths in country covering that war.\n  Jim Webb, of course, was a highly decorated combat Marine officer: \nNavy Cross, second highest decoration next to the Medal of Honor; \nSilver Star; Purple Heart; and, coincidentally, he was a naval aide to \nme and to John Chafee as a young captain and major in the Marine Corps \nin that period of time. He briefed me prior to trips I would take to \nVietnam. Through the years I have valued his friendship enormously.\n  I also had another personal experience. I remember one day there was \na knock on my Senate door and in walked Jan Scruggs, who asked if I \nwould help his group in their struggles to build the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial. I cannot think of a greater honor I have had as a Member of \nthe Senate than working, as I often refer to myself, as a private in \nthe rear ranks of Jan Scruggs' group of individuals, who conceived and \nput together this magnificent memorial to the men and women who \nsacrificed so much in that conflict.\n  I think I worked with him 6 to 7 years. I went to many meetings with \nmany stormy sessions in either my Senate office or across the hall in \nthe Armed Services Committee, and in the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I \nremember we would thrash out, in a highly contentious way, certain \naspects of the design and development of that historic memorial. Now it \nstands as just an extraordinary reminder of that period. Its symbolism \nis different to every person who comes up to look at it.\n  But in the course of those years, I relived, with so many of those \npeople, their experiences in that conflict. Therefore I have had, if I \nmay say, some modest association with the men and women who fought in \nthat conflict, and I have shared with them many times their thoughts \nand concerns and recollections of the stresses and hardships that they \nhave carried with them to this day.\n  So I find these articles to be very compelling and I urge my \ncolleagues to read them. I think they provide thoughtful, objective \nthinking to help in the interpretation of that chapter in history which \nwas so difficult to understand, particularly Senator Kerrey's mission \non that fateful night in Vietnam.\n  Americans must understand that war is a terrible thing. Since the \nbeginning of history, wars have imposed the harshest of consequences, \nnot only on the combatants in uniform but so often on the innocent \ncivilians who get entrapped between the lines or in the path of the \nadvance or in the path of the retreat. And they have paid a price. I \nthought both Jim Webb and Ms. Geyer treated that subject thoughtfully \nbased on their own firsthand observations and experiences in country in \nVietnam.\n\n  So I attribute a great deal of credibility to these two authors, \nparticularly because of my long personal knowledge of Jim Webb. I say, \nwith great respect to him, his career in the military far exceeded \nanything I ever did with my two brief periods of active duty, one just \nin the training command at the close of World War II, and the second \nfor a brief tour of duty in Korea with the 1st Marine Air Corps.\n  To the extent I was able to observe others in a combat situation in \nKorea,\n\n[[Page S4094]]\n\nas basically a staff officer--I never put myself in the category of \nthose who rightfully claim combat status, but I did stay in the same \ntents, eat in the mess, slept in the bunkers with them--they are a very \nspecial breed, these young men and women who fought wars in harm's way \nto preserve our freedom.\n  Today I do my very best as a member of the Armed Services Committee \nto provide for a means of showing my respect for them and, indeed, my \ngratefulness to the American military for training me as a young person \nand for providing me with the GI bill of rights.\n  I have many emotions as I stand before the Senate tonight to express \nthese views. I got to know Jim Webb well when he was in the office of \nthe Navy Secretary and I tried to counsel him as best I could on his \ndecision to leave active duty--which largely was not of his choosing \nbut was dictated by facts very personal to him. Had he stayed in the \nMarine Corps I think he was destined to the highest of rank and the \ngreatest of responsibility. He had to make a tough decision to leave \nthe Corps and pursue other challenges. I mentioned, of course, for a \nbrief period he became Secretary of the Navy. I was very proud of his \nservice as Navy Secretary.\n  Several facts which I note from these articles and which I note from \nmy own observation, again, are unquestioned. So many statements have \nbeen made by my distinguished colleagues about the honor and integrity \nof Bob Kerrey. His bravery and valor have been recognized many times, \nincluding being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  I know during the Vietnam war we asked many young men--I repeat that, \nwe, the United States of America, we the Congress of the United States \nand the President, the Presidents of the United States--asked many \nyoung men, and some women in a combat support status, to undertake very \ndifficult missions under the most extreme and dangerous of conditions. \nThey put their lives at risk to accomplish sometimes unclear missions \nwhile trying to minimize casualties within their own units.\n  Recently, I discussed this with members of the Armed Services \nCommittee staff, combat veterans from Vietnam. We followed these \nstories about Senator Kerrey. We sat down and exchanged our own views. \nI deferred to them because two of them were in the thick of battle and \nthey talked about the number of times throughout that war as veterans \nof ground combat that they took risks, themselves, personally, and \nrisks to their men who were with them, to provide some measure of \nprotection to the innocent non-combatant persons who had gotten \nentrapped in those battles in the dark nights and dusty days in that \ndeep canopy.\n  Yes, they did take personal risks themselves. As near as I can \ndetermine, then-Lieutenant Kerrey, Robert Kerrey, took those risks \nhimself.\n  They did so to protect the civilians in the combat zone. In that \nperiod of time, it was very difficult to determine who the enemy was; \nimagine that--who the enemy was. It was a very complex conflict into \nwhich we injected our men and women.\n  So we will never know exactly what happened that February night in \nthat Thanh Phong, Vietnam, battle. But I respect the word of my former \ncolleague, Robert Kerrey, and I urge other Senators to read these \narticles and decide for themselves. I believe each of us ought to make \nour own determination about this situation.\n  I conclude my remarks with a salute to the men and women who fought \nin that conflict and share with them my complete understanding, as near \nas I can base it on my own experiences. I salute them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4094-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RESIGNATION OF DIRECTOR FREEH\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the principal reason for my seeking \nrecognition is to comment briefly on the announced resignation of FBI \nDirector Louis Freeh. He has tendered his resignation effective in June \nof this year. I believe Director Freeh has done an outstanding job in a \nvery difficult position.\n  I had considerable opportunity to work with Director Freeh in my \ncapacity as chairman of the Subcommittee on the Judiciary and when I \nchaired the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Judiciary Subcommittee \non Terrorism in 1996 had extensive hearings on Ruby Ridge, with Randy \nWeaver isolating himself, and action by the Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms units and FBI that led to a shootout which regrettably caused \nthe death of a U.S. Marshall, Randy Weaver's wife, and Randy Weaver's \nyoung son.\n  During the course of that investigation, FBI Director Freeh had the \ncourage to stand up and change very deeply ingrained policies in the \nFBI, changing their rules of engagement and their use of deadly force. \nI think that took some doing in the face of institutional opposition.\n  He led an outstanding FBI investigation into the bombing on Khobar \nTowers, personally making a number of trips overseas. That is a matter \nwhich has yet to see a final resolution, but there has been very able \nand excellent investigative work done by the FBI in that matter in a \nvery difficult circumstance, working with officials from Saudi Arabia.\n  Director Freeh did a good job in campaign finance reform, taking \npositions which were sometimes in conflict with the Attorney General, \ntechnically his superior, in the Department of Justice, although the \nFBI Director has unique status, really, in that he has a 10-year \nappointment. So there were times when Director Freeh found it necessary \nto take stands in opposition to the Attorney General of the United \nStates and sometimes even in opposition to the President of the United \nStates. While I didn't always agree with some of the details, it was my \nview it was a strong performance on the part of FBI Director Louis \nFreeh.\n  I think the Director also did an outstanding job in expanding the \nFBI's role in combating organized crime internationally, and his tenure \nhas seen a vast expansion of FBI offices around the world carrying on \nvery important counterespionage work and counterterrorism work. There \nhas been an excellent level of cooperation established between the FBI \nand the CIA under the CIA leadership of George Tenet and, before that, \nJohn Deutch, with the FBI directorship under Louis Freeh.\n  There have been difficulties during Director Freeh's tenure with the \nFBI crime lab and with the investigation of Dr. Wen Ho Lee--on that \nsubject, the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \nCourts is continuing the inquiry--and also with the allegations as to \nthe Hanssen case, the alleged spy.\n  But I think, overall, Director Freeh's tenure with the FBI has been \noutstanding. He brought to the position unique credentials, having been \nan FBI agent and assistant U.S. attorney, a Federal judge, and he had \nthe capacity to know law enforcement while also understanding civil \nrights. When the problems arose in Ruby Ridge, he did not hesitate to \nchange the longstanding FBI policies on the use of deadly force in \nrecognition of civil rights, at the same time maintaining very strong \nlaw enforcement standards.\n  I think the President will have a difficult replacement assignment in \nfinding another Director who can measure up to what Director Freeh has \ndone. It is certainly a fact when law enforcement has faced tough \nissues, they have moved ahead and made many assignments to the FBI. \nDirector Freeh's response on changing the FBI's use of deadly force was \nin sharp contrast to the refusal of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms \nunits, and even the Secretary of the Treasury, to make changes when \nthere had been clear-cut fault established as to the Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms unit.\n  I salute Director Freeh on the announcement of retirement and note \nhis very excellent work and say we will have a tough time finding \nsomeone to fill those big shoes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4094-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4094-S4095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MIDDLE EAST PEACE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a ``Commentary'' on the mideast peace process.\n  There being no objection; the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4095]]\n\n            [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Apr. 27, 2001]\n\n                   Mideast Peace Process Must Resume\n\n                      (By U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter)\n\n       Escalating violence has deadened the Middle East peace \n     process. As usual, all sides look to the United States to \n     influence the parties to end the violence and resume the \n     quest for peace.\n       In mid-April, at the request of Egyptian President Hosni \n     Mubarak, I met with Palestinian Chairman Yasir Arafat in \n     Cairo. When I arrived for our 10:30 p.m. meeting, Arafat said \n     that as we spoke, Israeli helicopters and missiles were \n     attacking Palestinians in Gaza. He did not mention that the \n     Israeli action was in retaliation for mortars fired into \n     Israel earlier that day.\n       Our discussion, which lasted until nearly midnight, was \n     interrupted every few moments by aides bringing him the \n     latest dispatch on the fighting. I told Arafat I was \n     convinced Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon would not \n     resume the peace process until the violence ended.\n       Since the sequence of events demonstrated that Israel was \n     responding to Palestinian provocation, it was up to Arafat to \n     demonstrate his best efforts to stop the violence. After all, \n     it was Arafat's famous letter of Sept. 9, 1993, that induced \n     then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon \n     Peres to shake Arafat's hand at their historic meeting with \n     President Clinton on the White House lawn four days later. In \n     that letter, Arafat renounced violence and promised to punish \n     any Palestinian who violated that commitment.\n       Arafat responded that he had made an unequivocal \n     declaration at the recent Arab summit. When his statement was \n     examined, it was obvious it was so conditional as to be \n     meaningless. I then asked Arafat why he had rejected former \n     Prime Minister Ehud Barak's generous settlement offer on \n     major concessions on Jerusalem and additional territory on \n     the West Bank. Arafat said he had accepted the Barak \n     proposal. Again, on examination, there were so many ifs, ands \n     and buts that his response was meaningless. Our meeting ended \n     with no realistic hope that any significant action could be \n     expected from Arafat.\n       The situation was equally bleak when I traveled on to \n     Beirut and Damascus. Hezbollah, backed by Iran and Syria, had \n     continued to attack Israeli border settlements from Southern \n     Lebanon, leading Israel to bomb Syrian radar. Beirut once \n     touted as the Paris of the Middle East, has not recovered \n     from Lebanon's civil war because of factional quarrels and \n     Syria's continuing dominance of the country.\n       In Damascus, Syria's foreign minister Farouk Shara agreed \n     with Sharon that Israeli-Syrian peace talks on the Golan \n     Heights would be pointless at this time. Before President \n     Hafez al-Assad's death, the parties had come very close to a \n     settlement but were now back to square one.\n       Notwithstanding the bleak prospects, the Bush \n     administration, aided by Congress, must push the parties back \n     to the bargaining table. There is no doubt that the countries \n     involved listen to Uncle Sam. When Secretary of State Colin \n     Powell criticized Sharon's tough retaliation as ``excessive \n     and disproportionate,'' Israel modified its tactics.\n       Congress has spoken emphatically: 87 senators and 209 House \n     members wrote on April 6 to the President calling for the \n     closing of the Palestinian office in Washington if the \n     Palestinians did not stop inciting violence. I have urged \n     President Bush to appoint a special envoy for the Middle East \n     just as President Richard Nixon used Henry Kissinger for \n     shuttle diplomacy and Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, \n     George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton assigned envoys such as \n     Dennis Ross to the peace process. President Bush may soon \n     find it necessary to become personally involved like his \n     predecessors.\n       The escalation of Israeli-Palestinian violence may \n     encourage other terrorist groups, such as Hamas and Islamic \n     Jihad, to attack not only Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, but also \n     U.S. interests around the world. The peace process cannot be \n     abandoned; one way or another, a way must be found for \n     Israelis and Palestinians to live together on that tiny \n     parcel of hallowed and historic land. Our vital national \n     interests in the region make it imperative that the United \n     States actively pursue a resumption of the Middle East peace \n     process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4095-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BILLIE PENN\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

A man who allegedly \nattacked two men after calling them gay was arrested and charged with \naggravated assault, bias harassment, and bias assault.

He left the party and confronted \ntwo men in the parking lot, making obscene comments about their sexual \norientation, before attacking them. Witnesses say he began punching and \nkicking the two victims, one of whom suffered bleeding from the mouth \nand eyes and was treated at a local hospital.

Mr. President, recently, in a remote area of Vietnam, a \nhelicopter with 16 passengers and crew aboard went down in a central \nVietnamese jungle. Vietnamese officials reported that there were no \nsurvivors. The passengers on this aircraft included seven American \nheroes. One of those heroes, I am sad to report, was from New Mexico, \nMajor Charles Lewis II. Major Lewis was an Air Force ROTC graduate of \nMayfield High School and New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, NM. \nHe was an outstanding student and deeply committed to his country \nthrough his service with the Air Force. We are shocked and saddened at \nthe loss of Major Lewis and these American heroes.\n  In connection with the recent ``National Former Prisoner of War \nRecognition Day'', I salute Major Lewis and his downed colleagues. \nMoreover, I salute the heroic contributions of all those who serve in \nthe Joint Task Force Full Accounting, JTFFA, and the U.S. Army Central \nIdentification Laboratory Hawaii, CILHI, whose noble mission is to \nresolve the cases of Americans still unaccounted for during America's \nwars. We especially honor the unsung victims of this tragic accident \nwho were carrying out our nation's abiding commitment to account for \nand honor the lives of POW-MIAs lost in the conflict in Southeast Asia \nthree decades ago. They were part of an advance team scheduled to begin \nrecovery work at six MIA sites in Vietnam beginning this month.\n  Since 1973, the JTFFA and CILHI have conducted investigations and \nexcavations that have accounted for 603 American POW-MIA personnel. \nSince 1985, with the full support of cooperative Vietnamese assistants, \nmembers of the Joint Task Force and the Central\n\n[[Page S4096]]\n\nIdentification Laboratory have undertaken the most challenging \nassignments to locate and identify former American prisoners of war or \nservicemen missing in action. Some excavations have consumed months of \npainstaking labor under very difficult conditions to retrieve the \nsmallest items of evidence to help identify American casualties. Much \nof the work is done by hand in order not to disturb potential evidence. \nOur service personnel such as those who lost their lives last month \nhave routinely exposed themselves to significant dangers in the quest \nfor honoring our former POW-MIAs. Sadly, they lost their lives in their \ndeeply patriotic quest.\n  I call on all Americans to pause and remember Major Lewis and the \nbrave men and women of the Joint Task Force and Central Identification \nLaboratory who have given their lives in such a noble cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4096-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEDICATION OF THE PAUL G.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and \nrecognize the achievements of a distinguished Floridian and former \ncongressman, the Honorable Paul Rogers. The National Institutes of \nHealth is dedicating the Paul Rogers Plaza at Bethesda, MD on June 12, \n2001 in recognition of his phenomenal efforts and ardent advocacy for \npublic health and medical research.\n  Paul Rogers represented Florida's 11th District in the House of \nRepresentatives from 1956 to 1979, where he earned the distinguished \nand fitting title, ``Mr. Health.'' During his twenty-four years of \nservice in Congress and eight years as the Chairman of the House \nSubcommittee on Health and Environment, he consistently demonstrated \nhis heartfelt commitment to improving medical care and technology and \npreserving our fragile environment. His extensive list of legislative \naccomplishments and contributions is too great to fully recount, but \nthere are several legislative achievements that are particularly \nnoteworthy. The National Cancer Act, the Clean Air Act, the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, and the Medicare-Medicaid Anti Fraud and Abuse Act \nare just a few of Paul Rogers' endeavors that continue to impact our \nnation today.\n  It is fitting that the National Institutes of Health has chosen to \nhonor him with a permanent plaque at the Paul Rogers Plaza, as I am \ncertain that the beneficial effect of his public service on the health \nof American people will continue to be felt for many years to come. \nPaul Rogers' foresight in the areas of medical research and \nenvironmental regulation brought about cutting edge policies that \ncontinue to protect Americans everyday. His prolific efforts helped \nbring these critical issues to the forefront of our nation's agenda.\n  As we continue to debate and develop new legislation aimed at \nimproving the health of Americans and our environment, we should take a \nmoment to consider and thank the men and women, like ``Mr. Health,'' \nwho initiated this crusade. I am extremely pleased that Paul Rogers' \ntireless efforts are being duly recognized by the National Institutes \nof Health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4096-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4096-S4097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    U.S. POLICY TO CHINA AND TAIWAN\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, these past few weeks have been eventful \nones in our relationship with China.\n  President Bush announced a robust arms sale package for Taiwan. It \nincluded several major weapons systems and, of greater long-term \nsignificance, it provides for increased cooperation and coordination \nbetween our two military forces. He also announced the end of the \nannual review of arms needs, putting our support for Taiwan's defense \non a more regular and less political setting.\n  We secured the release of our reconnaissance plan's crew that was \nbeing held on Hainan Island. Subsequently, there were several \nimportant, albeit inconclusive, meetings with Chinese representatives \nabout the return of the plane and about establishing future rules of \nengagement to ensure that there will not be a repeat of this \nirresponsible Chinese action.\n  President Bush made a potentially dangerous gaffe in an interview \nwhere he seemed to reverse precipitously a two decade old policy that \nhas resulted in relative stability across the Taiwan Strait. I believe \nthat the trilateral relationship among the PRC, Taiwan, and the United \nStates, and the ``One China'' policy must adapt and evolve. But change \nmust be made with extreme care.\n  The United States approved a visa for former Taiwan president Lee \nTeng-hui to visit for a month, and we have agreed to issue a transit \nvisa for current Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian, although the \nconditions set on President Chen's visit are still under negotiations.\n  China continues to hold as a prisoner Gao Zhan, an innocent scholar \nwho is a permanent resident of our country with a U.S. citizen husband \nand son. They also hold several other American citizens of Chinese \norigin.\n  Some of these developments are infuriating and frustrating. After our \nplane was downed, some in Congress called for revenge, retaliation, and \nretribution. Proposals include that congress reverse its approval of \nPNTR, Permanent Normal Trade Relations, for China; that the United \nStates oppose holding the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing; and that we \nreduce or cease military-to-military relations with China.\n  Our long-term interests with China require a carefully measured \ncourse of action. We cannot allow emotion to obscure our policy \nobjectives. And we cannot determine China policy based on vague \nideological images.\n  Like all Americans, I am outraged by the behavior of the Chinese \nGovernment in holding the crew of our reconnaissance plane and \ndemanding an American apology, when the blame was so clearly with a \nreckless Chinese pilot following reckless orders.\n  I congratulate President Bush on his handling of the first foreign \npolicy crisis of this administration. He kept emotions in check. He \nrejected the advice of those who wanted to take precipitous action. He \nsecured the safe release of our crew without giving China the kowtowing \napology they demanded.\n  President Bush's decision last week on which defense items to \ntransfer to Taiwan was also responsible and correct. It will provide \nTaiwan with the hardware and the ``humanware'' it needs to defend \nitself, while avoiding actions that would have been unnecessarily \nprovocative vis-a-vis China. Unfortunately, he followed this measured \ndecision with a ``shoot from the hip'' comment on a possible U.S. \nresponse to Chinese military action against Taiwan. That remark has \ncreated unnecessary confusion uncertainty, and potential instability \nacross the Taiwan Strait.\n  We need to look at what is good for U.S. interests, not what is bad \nfor China. There is no room for emotion as we defined the relationship \nwe want with China and determine how to move them in the right \ndirection.\n  Last year Congress approved, by a wide margin, legislation granting \nPermanent Normal Trade Relations status to China once they join the \nWorld Trade Organization. The benefits of incorporating China into the \nworld trade community were clear.\n  American farmers, businesses, and workers would be well served by a \ngrowing and liberalized economy in China. Economic growth in China \nwould, over the long term, lead to a larger middle class making its own \ndemands on the government for greater accountability and personal \nchoice, just as happened in South Korea and Taiwan. Membership in the \nWTO would bring international disciplines to the Chinese economy. And \nthe reformers, led by Premier Zhu Rongji, would be strengthened.\n  The events of the last few weeks have not changed this calculation. \nIf anything, nurturing growth in our economic and trade relationship \nwith China is more important than ever.\n  Let's be clear about what happened in China while our crew was \ndetained on Hainan Island.\n  The delay in releasing our crew members was a reflection of a \nmonumental struggle for China's future between reformers led by Premior \nZhu Rongji and President Jian Zemin, on one side, and the old guard, \nincluding the People's Liberation Army, the managers of most state-\nowned enterprises, and many entrenched politicians, on the\n\n[[Page S4097]]\n\nother side. That is, a battle between those who we hope will be China's \nfuture and those who should be made part of China's past.\n  One manifestation of this struggle is political and perhaps \nincreasing military friction with the United States. Taiwan remains the \nNo. 1 flashpoint. Add disputes over human rights, political prisoners, \narrest of American citizens and permanent residents of Chinese origin, \nTibet, regional policies, weapons transfer. These issues will remain \nwith us for years. if not decades.\n  Our decisions must be measured through one optic: What are the core \nAmerican strategic and economic interests vis-a-vis China?\n  First, we want stability in the Asian region. We must ensure that \nChina does not threaten this stability. That means committing the \nUnited States to being a full participant in Asia--economically, \npolitically, and militarily. This includes ensuring peace across the \nTaiwan Strait, and that means providing Taiwan with the tools necessary \nfor its defense and assisting with the peaceful resolution of the \nChina-Taiwan issue.\n  Second, we want to help in the transformation of China from a \ntotalitarian state with a nonmarket economy toward a more liberalized \npolitical and economic regime. That means incorporating China into the \nworld trade community while insisting on respect for basic human \nrights.\n  Third, we want full access for American goods and services to the \nlargest country in the world with the fastest growing economy. That \nmeans completing China's accession to the WTO, granting them PNTR, and \nsupporting our businesses' efforts to penetrate the Chinese economy. It \ndoes not mean revoking China's established normal trade status.\n  To isolate China and to seek retribution might feel good, but it \nwould not do good. Even worse, it threatens our core long-term \ninterests. We should responsibly protect our interests and confront \nChina when situations warrant. But reason, not emotion, must guide our \ndecisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4097-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today marks an important day in the \nhistory of national passenger rail transportation. Today is the \nthirtieth anniversary of the American National Passenger Rail \nCorporation, Amtrak. As we mark Amtrak's birthday, we need to \nunderstand that the demands on our national passenger rail system are \nchanging. Amtrak can no longer be solely a link to a bygone era, when a \nlong train ride was the only way to get from one city to another. The \nAmtrak of the next 30 years must be a faster, more competitive \ntransportation option for the American traveler. A population that is \nmore mobile than ever before but faces gridlock on our highways and \ncapacity limitations in our skies demands this of Amtrak. Our Nation's \npassenger rail system has already begun to change in the Northeast \nCorridor, where in just four months, Amtrak has shuttled over 55,000 \npeople between Washington and New York on four daily high-speed trains. \nThis unexpectedly high ridership has helped Amtrak beat revenue \nestimates for the Northeast Corridor by four percent. Overall, \nridership in the Northeast is up eight percent over last year.\n  It is my hope that the Congress commemorates Amtrak's thirtieth \nbirthday by passing legislation this year that allows Amtrak to \ncontinue to improve high-speed rail service in the Northeast Corridor \nand replicate that success in the Northeast. The High Speed Rail \nInvestment Act is Amtrak's future. This legislation would allow Amtrak \nto sell $12 billion in tax-exempt bonds to finance the development of \nhigh-speed rail corridors throughout the country, and would allow for \ncontinued track improvements in the Northeast Corridor. Though Amtrak \nwill raise $12 billion, the High Speed Rail Investment Act will cost \ntaxpayers only about one-third of that amount. I am proud to be working \nclosely with my colleagues Senators Biden and Hutchinson, as well our \nleaders, Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, to enact this legislation \nthis year, and I am excited to see that the bill has 55 cosponsors and \nwide bipartisan support.\n  On Amtrak's birthday, I hope each one of us will take a serious look \nat the importance of inter-city passenger rail to our Nation. Inter-\ncity passenger rail is a critical link to our Nation's history, \nreminding us of how we used to travel this glorious country. And that's \na link which many members of Congress have taken great pains to \nmaintain in their states and districts. At the same time, in many \nplaces, such as the northeast, a modern inter-city passenger rail \nnetwork is not a luxury, it is a necessity. Amtrak's challenge of late \nhas been to satisfy both of these roles while trying to act like a \nprofit-making company. This task has not been easy for a quasi-\nindependent government agency that, for its whole life, has operated \nunder many Congressionally-imposed burdens but has received sporadic \nand insufficient financial support from the federal government.\n  I think we are all aware that Amtrak is subject to unique political \npressures that private companies do not face. And I think we all know \nthat those pressures, which often require the company to operate \nunprofitable routes, influence the company's bottom line in a negative \nway. But high speed rail has proven to be a financial success in the \nNortheast, and is projected to add $180 million annually to Amtrak's \nbottom line when all 20 Acela Express trainsets are in operation. High \nspeed rail is a good investment for Amtrak, and it's a great investment \nfor our nation's transportation infrastructure.\n  It is time to bring Amtrak into the 21st century by creating an \neffective, truly inter-modal transportation network. Let's make high \nspeed rail service an indispensable element of our transportation \ninfrastructure--our overburdened highways and skyways require it and \nthe traveling public demands it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4097-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SUE HENSLEY\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievements of the ROTC Program at Providence College on the occasion \nof their 50th Anniversary.\n  ROTC dates back to 8 January 1951, when the Very Reverend Robert J. \nSlavin, O.P., President of the College,\n\n[[Page S4098]]\n\nreceived word that the Department of the Army had approved the \nestablishment of a Reserve Officer Training Corps within the \ncurriculum. On 19 September 1951, Colonel Roy P. Moss, officially \nopened the Military Science Department of Providence College Transport \nCorps Unit. In 1951-52, the original student enrollment was 512 cadets \nand in 1953, the first class of seven received commissions in the \nTransportation Corps.\n  In the 1954-55 academic year, the unit was re-designated as a General \nMilitary Science program. In 1956, a rifle range was built and had its \nofficial inauguration as Company K-12. During the Vietnam era, the ROTC \nprogram at PC provided many qualified officers and as a result of the \nROTC Vitalization Act of 1964, students from local colleges without \nprograms became eligible to participate. The act also resulted in both \nfour-year and two-year ROTC scholarships going into effect.\n  In the late 60's and early 70's, changing public opinion lead to a \ndecline in enrollment in programs throughout the country until the \nrevitalization of ROTC began in the 1973-74 academic year as women were \nallowed to enroll. In 1982, Bryant College was added to the Patriot \nBattalion and along with Brown University, Johnson & Wales University, \nUMASS Dartmouth, Rhode Island College, the Community College of Rhode \nIsland, Bristol Community College. As of May 2000, 1,690 officers have \nbeen commissioned through the Providence College Program.\n  The ROTC Program at Providence College was recognized in 1996 as one \nof the top programs in New England and the New York area. As it \ncelebrates this milestone in the history of the program, we pause to \nrecognize the many students who have learned about the history and \nstructure of our military and who have gone on to study tactical \noperations and military instruction as well as advanced techniques of \nmanagement, leadership and command. These proud cadets have earned \nscholarships and upon graduation are Commissioned Officers in the Army.\n  The strength of this program lies in patriotism and dedication to \nduty. The Patriotic Battalion faculty and staff are indeed to be \ncommended for the success of the program and for the significant part \nthey play in instilling leadership and good citizenship in these young \npeople. I would respectfully ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nthe proud tradition of the Providence College ROTC Program on the \noccasion of its 50th Anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4098-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATIONS TO ED HILL\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes \nto congratulate Ed Hill, the new president of the International \nBrotherhood of Electrical Workers, IBEW, on his election.\n  You know, when I think about all the hard work and long hours \npresidents Hill and Barry have put in over the years, I am reminded of \na story that one of my heroes, the great Hubert H. Humphrey liked to \ntell.\n  It was Humphrey's 65th birthday, and he was celebrating with his \ngrandchildren. One of the grandkids looked up and said, ``Grandpa, how \nlong have you been a Democrat?''\n  Humphrey thought about that for a moment, and replied, ``Well, I've \nbeen a Democrat for 70 years.''\n  His grandson said, ``Grandpa, how could you have been a Democrat for \n70 years when you're only 65 years old?''\n  ``Easy,'' Humphrey answered, ``I've put in a lot of overtime.''\n  Well, Ed Hill has put in a lot of overtime on behalf of the IBEW and \non behalf of all Americans.\n  You know, I like to tell people you go to any town in America rural \nor urban, big or small and you will see the IBEW's work on display. \nWhether it is lighting our homes, or heating our schools, or bringing \nthe Internet to our libraries, it is clear that the IBEW's work is \ncritical to our families and our economy.\n  Ed Hill hails from Beaver County, PA, and he is got a long history \nwith the IBEW. Ed joined IBEW Local 712 in his hometown back in 1956 \nand worked his way up to business manager in 1970. He became part of \nthe IBEW staff in 1982, and, by 1994, he was a vice president in charge \nof operations in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Delaware.\n  In 1997, Ed became the IBEW's second highest-ranking officer, and he \nworked hard to bring the latest technology to IBEW's operations. He \nalso spent long hours building the membership of IBEW-COPE to record \nlevels and making new strides in grassroots activism and \ncommunications.\n  For over 100 years, the IBEW has been a leader in the union movement \nin America. Whether they were providing energy to our war efforts \nduring World War II, creating one of the best apprenticeship programs \naround, or providing workers with the cutting edge skills they need to \nkeep up with current electricity needs--IBEW was always ahead of the \ntimes.\n  I know that Ed Hill will continue this proud tradition. I thank him \nfor his dedication and commitment, and I look forward to working with \nhim in the coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4098-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate to Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4098-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nwithdrawals and nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4098-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 3:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of it reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 256.

A bill to enhance the management and promotion of electronic \nGovernment services and processes by establishing a Federal Chief \nInformation Officer within the Office of Management and Budget, and by \nestablishing a broad framework of measures that require using Intermet-\nbased information technology to enhance citizen access to Goernment \ninformation and services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with my \ncolleagues the ``Electronic Government Act of 2001''. Members of both \nparties understand that using new information technologies wisely can \ncreate a better\n\n[[Page S4102]]\n\ngovernment more in touch with the needs of the public. That's why I am \nhappy to be joined in this endeavor by such a distinguished group of \noriginal co-sponsors, namely Senators Burns, Bingaman, Fitzgerald, \nDaschle, McCain, Carper, Durbin, Johnson, Kerry, Leahy, and Levin. Our \nlegislation will provide the leadership, coordination, expertise, and \nresources necessary to utilize the Internet and create a more \nefficient, citizen-oriented government. Harnessing the Internet and \nother information technologies to deliver government programs, \nservices, and information more effectively is critical to ensure that \nthe Federal government remains a vital, positive presence in society.\n  Efforts to promote electronic government, which is still in its \ninfancy, are advancing around the world. Federal, state, and local \ngovernments are using web-based technologies to enhance citizen access \nto information, provide round-the-clock services, save money on \nprocurement and other transactions, and stimulate citizen \nparticipation. Citizens who have discovered the benefits of conducting \nbusiness with government from their homes, and when it is convenient \nfor them, are using the Internet to file their taxes, renew licenses \nand registrations, apply for college loans, and bid on government \ncontracts. In some cases businesses are able to use the Internet to get \nadvice about existing regulatory requirements and citizens to comment \non proposed rules.\n  These examples are exciting and encouraging. However, the reality is \nthat all but a handful of the applications now being put online by \nFederal agencies are developed in relative isolation. E-Government \ncurrently is a loose-knit mix of ideas, projects, and affiliations \noften not well coordinated, sometimes overlapping in its goals and \nredundant in its expenditures. Though there are some remarkable \ninnovations championed by visionary government employees, many other \nefforts are hampered by traditional models of government management, \nand ``stove-pipe'' conceptions of agency jurisdiction. We are in \nessence taking the often confusing, overlapping and inefficient maze of \ngovernment programs as they now exist and simply transferring them onto \nthe Internet.\n  This is not the best way forward. We can and must take full advantage \nof information technologies to overcome the often arbitrary boundaries \nthat exist between agencies, and to provide the public with seamless, \nsecure online services. A functional approach focuses on delivering \nservices to the citizen, organized according to the citizens' needs, \nand without regard to where the jurisdiction of one agency stops and \nanother begins. The greatest challenge in many cases is realizing how \nthe new technologies have created new opportunities, and reconfiguring \ngovernment processes accordingly. Seizing these opportunities will \nrequire leadership, coordination, and meaningful communication with \nagency decision-makers.\n  This legislation is designed to help accomplish that goal, first by \nestablishing a Federal Chief Information Officer, or CIO, in the Office \nof Management and Budget. As many have pointed out, a Federal CIO is \nessential to provide government-wide coordination, leadership, and \nvisibility to e-Government efforts. In fact, a recent survey revealed \nthat 49 state governments already have Chief Information Officers to \naddress government-wide information technology issues. The Federal CIO \nwill have the necessary ties to relevant government agencies so that \nshe or he is able to lead e-Government efforts, and will also work \nclosely with state and local governments, with the private and non-\nprofit sectors, and with the public. The Federal CIO will review \nagencies' information technology planning and performance, will ensure \ncompliance with existing information statutes, and will be empowered to \naddress other issues of concern such as online privacy and computer \nsecurity.\n\n  The CIO will also direct expenditures from an E-Government Fund, \nwhich would promote the innovative, cross-agency projects that are \nextremely difficult to fund at present but absolutely necessary for the \nkind of integrated service delivery possible today. The legislation \nauthorizes $200 million for each of the next three years for the Fund, \nand contains criteria governing its use. Every year the federal \ngovernment spends $40 billion on information technology, and not always \nefficiently. In comparison the E-Government Fund represents a modest \ninvestment in a new kind of government venture: the virtual realignment \nof government services and information in pursuit of citizen-centered \ngovernment.\n  Many of the improvements achieved by this legislation will be \naccessible from a centralized online government portal, which will \nbuild on the FirstGov website launched last year by the General \nServices Administration. The FirstGov website is an important first \nstep, but there is much room for improvement. In those instances where \nagencies have cooperated to create truly integrated websites, as with \nStudents.gov, the portal provides a demonstration of how citizens \naccessing the government through a single website may easily reach a \nwide range of information and services. But this type of site is the \nexception. Our E-Government bill will lead to more integrated sites, \nlinked to the centralized portal. It will also create a directory of \ngovernment web pages, so that citizens can easily find the help they \nneed with a few clicks of the mouse rather than with cumbersome \nsearches that often produce hundreds of thousands of results, sometimes \nin no discernable order.\n  New information technologies can be harnessed in many creative ways \nto better serve the public. Among other provisions, the legislation \nwill expand online access to judicial information, establish an online \nnational library, and promote research into how information \ntechnologies can be used to improve our planning for and response to \nnatural disasters. The Internet can also be used to facilitate public \nparticipation in democratic processes, as the Department of \nTransportation has proven; its docketing system has been placed \nentirely on-line, so that individuals can easily find the rulemaking \nthat interests them, review comments, and file comments of their own \nfrom a home computer. Our bill requires other regulatory agencies to \nestablish similar systems. Of course, the provisions in our bill only \nscratch the surface of what is possible. More importantly, the \nlegislation establishes a process by which our government can transform \nitself.\n  Our citizens will not be fully comfortable engaging in transactions \nover the Internet unless they are confident that their personal \ninformation is kept secure and private. That's why the E-Government Act \ncontains strong new protections requiring agencies to complete detailed \nassessments of privacy considerations when they procure new information \nsystems or initiate new collections of personal information. The bill \nalso empowers the Federal CIO to review agencies' computer security \nplans.\n  This legislation is a work in progress. The bill already reflects the \ninput and insights of many individuals and organizations, including \nthose who participated in the E-Government interactive web site \nlaunched by Senator Thompson and myself last year. I also want to \nacknowledge the important contribution made by Senator Bingaman; we \nhave incorporated his share-in-savings legislation from the last \nCongress as a provision. Because this is a work in progress, we will \ncontinue to seek comments and feedback on the legislation, and I expect \nthat this bill's provisions will change as we work to achieve a broad \nconsensus. E-Government should not be a partisan issue; it concerns how \nwe will respond to the opportunities of today and tomorrow to achieve a \nmore responsive government for us all. I hope to work with the \nAdministration, which has already expressed an interest in e-\ngovernment, with Senators from both parties, and with others committed \nto this issue, to develop a bill that we can all support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation and a \nsection by section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 803\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly \n     transforming societal interactions and the relationships \n     among citizens, private businesses, and the Government.\n       (2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in \n     applying advances in information technology to enhance \n     Governmental functions and services, achieve more efficient \n     performance, and increase access to Government information \n     and citizen participation in Government.\n       (3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government \n     are developed and presented separately, according to the \n     jurisdictional boundaries of an individual department or \n     agency, rather than being integrated cooperatively according \n     to function.\n       (4) Internet-based Government services involving \n     interagency cooperation are especially difficult to develop \n     and promote, in part because of a lack of funding mechanisms \n     to support such interagency cooperation.\n       (5) To take full advantage of the improved Government \n     performance that can be achieved through the use of Internet-\n     based technology requires new leadership, better \n     organization, improved interagency collaboration, and more \n     focused oversight of agency compliance with statutes related \n     to information resource management.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To provide effective leadership of Federal Government \n     efforts to develop and promote electronic Government services \n     and processes by establishing a Federal Chief Information \n     Officer within the Office of Management and Budget.\n       (2) To establish measures that require using Internet-based \n     information technology to enhance citizen access to \n     Government information and services, improve Government \n     efficiency and reduce Government operating costs, and \n     increase opportunities for citizen participation in \n     Government.\n       (3) To promote interagency collaboration in providing \n     electronic Government services, where this collaboration \n     would improve the service to citizens by integrating related \n     function.\n       (4) To promote interagency collaboration in the use of \n     internal electronic Government processes, where this \n     collaboration would improve the efficiency and effectiveness \n     of the processes.\n\nTITLE I--OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 101.

Executive agencies are required to publish an \n     online agency directory, accessible by electronic links to \n     the federal telephone directory, including contact \n     information for principal departments and employees.\n\n                   Sec. 204: Online National Library\n\n       Requires the establishment of an online national library as \n     a collaboration between several federal agencies, including \n     the National Science Foundation, Smithsonian, and the Library \n     of Congress, to provide public access to educational resource \n     materials. The materials will be functionally integrated \n     without regard to the boundaries of the contributing \n     institutions. For the development, expansion and maintenance \n     of the national library, NSF and the Library of Congress are \n     each authorized $5,000,000 for FY 2002, and such sums as may \n     be necessary each fiscal year thereafter.\n\n                        Sec. 205: Federal Courts\n\n       Requires each federal court to establish a website that \n     would include public information such as location and contact \n     information for courthouses, local rules, docket information \n     for each case, and access to written opinions issued by the \n     court, in a text searchable format. Documents filed \n     electronically, and those converted to electronic form, shall \n     also be made available. The Judicial Conference may \n     promulgate rules to protect privacy concerns. The existing \n     PACER electronic docketing system will no longer be required \n     to charge fees to users. Court websites are required to be \n     established no later than 2 years after the Act's effective \n     date, with access to documents filed electronically no later \n     than 4 years. Any court may elect not to comply with any \n     requirement of this section, but Congress is notified of all \n     such decisions and the reasons for the decisions.\n\n                     Sec. 206: Regulatory Agencies\n\n       Requires that agencies post on their websites all \n     information about the agencies' regulatory proceedings that \n     is required to be published in the Federal Register. Agencies \n     must accept submissions in regulatory proceedings by \n     electronic means (including e-mail and fax). Agencies shall \n     also establish electronic dockets for online rulemaking. \n     Electronic dockets shall make available all agency notices, \n     publications, or statements related to each rulemaking, and \n     all submissions made pursuant to the rulemaking. Agencies can \n     opt out of the section's electronic docket requirement. \n     Websites are required to be established no later than 2 \n     years after the Act's effective date, with submission by \n     electronic means no later than 4 years.\n\n  Sec. 207: Integrated Reporting Feasibility Study and Pilot Projects\n\n       Requires the Federal CIO to conduct a study on the \n     feasibility of integrating federal information systems across \n     agencies by addressing the feasibility of (1) integrating \n     data elements used in the electronic collection of \n     information, (2) developing software for assembling, \n     documenting, and validating the accuracy of electronically \n     submitted data, (3) developing a distributed information \n     system, involving at least 2 agencies, that provides public \n     access to the information holdings of an agency, and (4) \n     incorporating other data elements related to the purposes of \n     this section. To collect information for the study, the \n     Federal CIO will implement no more than 5 pilot projects that \n     integrate data elements with the goals of reducing \n     information collection burdens by eliminating duplicative \n     data elements, and establishing interoperability between \n     public databases. The resulting report, which shall be \n     submitted to Congress within three years of the date of \n     enactment, will include recommendations that Congress or the \n     executive branch can implement to reduce the burden on \n     reporting and strengthening public access.\n\n  Sec. 208: Online Access to Federally Funded Research and Development\n\n       Provides for the formation of an interagency task force to \n     review current databases of federally funded research and \n     development, then develop recommendations on standards for \n     the collection and dissemination of essential information \n     about such data that addresses both public availability and \n     agency coordination and collaboration. No later than 1 year \n     after enactment of this Act, the Federal CIO will promulgate \n     standards and regulations based on the recommendations, and \n     determine which agencies should maintain databases and a \n     website providing online access to the information. The \n     respective agencies will then develop any required databases \n     and a centralized, searchable website. The website will be \n     operational within 2 years after the date of enactment. \n     $1,000,000 is authorized for FY 2002, $5,000,000 for FY 2003, \n     and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2004 \n     through 2006.\n\n  Sec. 209: Common Protocols for Geographic Information Systems (GIS)\n\n       Requires the Department of the Interior, in consultation \n     with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \n     private sector experts, and other interested parties, to \n     facilitate the development of common protocols for geographic \n     information to maximize the electronic compatibility of \n     geographic information from various sources and promote the \n     development of interoperable GIS technologies for low-cost \n     use and sharing of geographic data by government entities and \n     the public. The Federal CIO will oversee the agency \n     initiative and promulgate the resulting standards.\n\n            Sec. 210: Share-In-Savings Program Improvements\n\n       Encourages the use of the share-in-savings contracting \n     approach (in which the contractor is paid from the savings \n     realized) for IT projects, and allows the agency conducting a \n     project to retain a portion of the savings realized, and use \n     those funds to acquire additional information technology. If\n\n[[Page S4114]]\n\n     the share-in-savings pilot projects are successful, the GSA \n     Administrator may provide general authority to executive \n     agencies to use the contracting approach.\n\n  Sec. 211: Enhancing Crisis Management Through Advanced Information \n                               Technology\n\n       Provides for a 2-year study, conducted by the National \n     Academy of Sciences, to develop a research and implementation \n     strategy for effective use of IT in crisis response and \n     consequence management of natural and manmade disasters. The \n     study will identify opportunities for research and \n     development on enhanced technologies for improving \n     communications with citizens at risk, enhancing the use of \n     remote sensor data for planning, advance warning, and \n     response, building more trustworthy systems for \n     communications in crises, and facilitating coordinated \n     actions among responders. $800,000 for FY 2002 would be \n     authorized for the research.\n\n        Sec. 212: Federal Information Technology Training Center\n\n       Requires the establishment of an IT training center to (1) \n     analyze the personnel needs related to IT on an ongoing \n     basis, (2) design curricula, training methods and training \n     schedules, and (3) recruit and train federal employees in IT \n     disciplines at a rate that ensures that government's needs \n     are met. The curricula will cover a broad range of IT \n     disciplines, will be adaptable to varying levels of \n     expertise, and will include the use of self-paced courses, \n     online courses, on-the-job training, and remote instructors. \n     $7,000,000 is authorized for the Office of Personnel \n     Management for FY 2002, and such sums as may be necessary \n     each fiscal year thereafter for developing and operating the \n     training center.\n\n                 Sec. 213: Community Technology Centers\n\n       Provides for a study by the Department of Education to \n     evaluate the best practices being used by Community \n     Technology Centers (CTC's) that receive federal funds; the \n     resulting report will include an evaluation of CTC's best \n     practices, a strategy for establishing a network to share \n     information and resources as CTC's evolve, an analysis of \n     whether CTC's have been deployed effectively throughout the \n     country, a database of all CTC's receiving federal funds, and \n     recommendations for enhancing the development of CTC's. The \n     Federal CIO will work with relevant agencies and the private \n     and non-profit sectors to provide assistance to CTC's, public \n     libraries, and other institutions that provide computer and \n     Internet access to the public. OPM will provide IT training \n     curricula, and the Department of Education will develop an \n     online tutorial. The Department of Education will be \n     authorized $2,000,000 for FY2002, $2,000,000 for FY2003, and \n     such sums as are necessary in fiscal years 2004 through 2006.\n\n            Sec. 214: Disparities in Access to the Internet\n\n       Provides for a non-profit, non-partisan organization \n     selected by the Federal CIO to conduct a study of how \n     disparities in Internet access influence the effectiveness of \n     online government services. The study will include \n     recommendations on how to ensure that online government \n     initiatives will not have the unintended result of increasing \n     any deficiency in public access to government services. The \n     section also provides that when promulgating policies and \n     implementing programs that provide services over the \n     Internet, the Federal CIO and agency heads shall ensure that \n     the availability of government services has not been \n     diminished for individuals who lack access to the Internet. \n     The Federal CIO and agency heads are also directed to pursue \n     technologies that make government services and information \n     more accessible to individuals who do not have access to the \n     Internet. $950,000 is authorized in FY2002 to carry out this \n     section.\n\n   Sec. 215: Accessibility, Usability and Preservation of Government \n                              Information\n\n       The section establishes an Advisory Board on Government \n     Information comprised of members from federal agencies, and \n     from the public, private and nonprofit sectors. Based on \n     information provided by each agency, the Board will recommend \n     standards for (1) establishing permanent public access to \n     government information disseminated on the Internet, (2) \n     developing inventories of government information, and (3) \n     cataloguing and indexing government information. Based \n     on these recommendations, and after public notice and \n     opportunity for comment, the federal CIO will promulgate \n     standards and issue regulations, which agencies will then \n     implement. Specifically, this section requires that the \n     following steps be taken:\n       Permanent Public Access: The Board will make \n     recommendations on standards for permanent public access to \n     government information disseminated on the Internet, \n     including a definition of the types of information to which \n     the standards apply, and the process for implementing \n     permanent public access (due 30 months after enactment). The \n     Federal CIO will issue regulations requiring standards for \n     permanent public access, and agencies will implement the \n     standards. Agencies are also required to report annually on \n     their efforts in this area.\n       Inventories of Government Information: The Board will \n     identify all classes of government information, and recommend \n     which classes of information should be inventoried and how \n     the inventories should be conducted. The Federal CIO will \n     then issue regulations describing the scope and timetables \n     for the inventories. Completed agency inventories will be \n     posted online and linked to the federal government portal. \n     Agencies are also required to inventory their websites, and \n     electronically post the inventories, within 180 days of the \n     Act's effective date.\n       Cataloguing and Indexing of Government Information: The \n     Board will review cataloguing and indexing standards \n     currently used by federal agencies, and determine whether \n     they are in the public domain and interoperable (due 18 \n     months after the Act's effective date). The Federal CIO will \n     issue regulations requiring interoperable standards that are \n     in the public domain. The Board will also review completed \n     agency inventories and existing statutory and regulatory \n     requirements, and recommend which government information \n     should be catalogued and indexed, and the priorities for \n     completing that work. The Federal CIO will then issue \n     regulations specifying which government information shall be \n     catalogued and indexed, and setting timetables. Indexes and \n     catalogues completed by agencies will be posted on a \n     centralized searchable database, which will be linked to the \n     Federal Government portal.\n       Agencies will also determine, after public comment, which \n     information to make available on the Internet, and shall \n     develop priorities and schedules for doing so (due 1 year \n     after the completion of agency inventories).\n\n    Sec. 216: Public Domain Directory of Federal Government Websites\n\n       Requires the development, through interagency \n     collaboration, of a public domain directory of federal \n     government websites on the Internet. The directory will be \n     based on a taxonomy of subjects used to categorize Federal \n     Government websites, and will be linked to the Federal \n     Government portal.\n\n                Sec. 217: Standards for Agency Websites\n\n       Requires the federal CIO to promulgate standards and \n     criteria for agency websites no later than 1 year after the \n     Act's effective date. These standards include requiring links \n     to (1) privacy statements, (2) descriptions of an agency's \n     mission and statutory authority, (3) electronic reading \n     rooms, (4) agency regulations, rules and rulemaking \n     materials, (5) information about the organizational structure \n     of the agency, and (6) an agency's strategic plans. The \n     standards will also include minimum requirements to aid in \n     navigating websites, such as speed of retrieval of search \n     results, the relevance of the results, and tools to \n     aggregate and disaggregate data.\n\n                      Sec. 218: Privacy Provisions\n\n       Specifies that an agency will conduct a privacy impact \n     assessment before developing or procuring an information \n     system, or initiating a new collection of personally \n     identifiable information that will be processed \n     electronically. The assessment will be submitted to the \n     federal CIO and include a description of: the information to \n     be collected, the purpose for the collection and reason each \n     item is necessary, any notice that will be provided to \n     persons from whom the information is collected, and any \n     choice that an individual who is the subject of the collected \n     information has to decline to provide the information, the \n     intended uses of the information and proposed limits on other \n     uses, the intended users or recipients of the information and \n     any limitations on reuse or redisclosure, the retention \n     period, whether and by what means the individual who is the \n     subject of collected information has access to that \n     information, and security measures to protect the \n     information.\n       The section also requires the Federal CIO to establish \n     guidelines mandating the posting of privacy notices on agency \n     websites, and lists information that must be included in \n     privacy policies. The Federal CIO will also promulgate \n     guidelines requiring agencies to translate privacy policies \n     into a standardized machine readable format.\n\n          Sec. 219: Accessibility to People with Disabilities\n\n       Specifies that all actions taken by the federal government \n     under this Act will comply with section 508 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n\n   Sec. 220: Notification of Obsolete or Counterproductive Provisions\n\n       Specifies that if the Federal CIO determines that any \n     provisions of this Act is obsolete or counterproductive, as a \n     result of changes in technology or any other reason, the \n     Federal CIO will notify the Committee on Governmental Affairs \n     of the Senate and the Committee on Government Reform of the \n     House of Representatives.\n\n\n     Title III: Authorization of Appropriations and Effective Date\n\n                Sec 301: Authorization of Appropriations\n\n       Except for those purposes for which the Act specifically \n     provides an authorization, authorizes to be appropriated such \n     sums as may be necessary to carry out the Act for fiscal \n     years 2002 through 2006.\n\n                        Sec 302: Effective Date\n\n       Specifies that the Act shall take effect 120 days after the \n     date of enactment.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Burns, Senator Bingaman, Senator Fitzgerald, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Carper, Senator Durbin, Senator Johnson, \nSenator Kerry, Senator Leahy, and Senator Levin today in introducing \nthe E-Government Act of 2001. I believe that this bill will play an \nimportant role in making the federal government more responsive to our \ncitizens.\n\n[[Page S4115]]\n\n  Currently, it can be very challenging for most Americans to find the \ninformation they need about their government. For example, if someone \nwas looking for information on an issue pertaining to international \ntrade, he or she would have to look at the web sites of the Department \nof Commerce, United States Trade Representative, International Trade \nCommission, possibly the Department of State or Agriculture, and a \nmyriad of House and Senate Committees to find the information they \nseek. This process will undoubtedly frustrate the average American, and \nreinforce feelings of a remote, confusing government. Today, less than \none percent of current interactions between government and citizens are \nonline. There is clearly need for improvement.\n  This legislation will help create a coordinated government electronic \npolicy. By establishing a Federal Chief Information Officer to operate \nwithin the Office of Management and Budget, the federal government will \nuse staff and resources more effectively to promote e-government and \naddress the nation's other pressing information policy issues. In \naddition, the bill establishes an Interagency Information Technology \nFund to break down existing bureaucratic barriers, and set up a ``one-\nstop shopping'' portal that will make it easier for the public to \naccess information. Finally, the bill will task the Office of Personnel \nManagement to respond to the shortage of skilled Information Technology \nprofessionals in the federal government.\n  This bill is not simple, and I realize that some issues it raises \nmust still be resolved. I believe that the Administration and relevant \nCongressional oversight committees must be involved in this process. I \nknow that my colleague, the Chairman of the Government Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Thompson, will examine this issue, and I would like \nto work with him to resolve any issues that he, or any other Member, \nmay have with this legislation.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It \nis important that we seriously examine how to use the Internet and \nother electronic commerce processes to make the federal government more \nopen to public scrutiny.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Schumer, Ms. \n        Collins, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 804. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to require \nphased increases in the fuel efficiency standards applicable to light \ntrucks; to require fuel economy standards for automobiles up to 10,000 \npounds gross vehicle weight; to raise the fuel economy of the Federal \nfleet of vehicles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to be joined \nby Senator Olympia Snowe to introduce this important legislation to \ngradually phase-in the fuel efficiency standards for SUVs and light \nduty trucks by 2007.\n  I would also like to thank the other cosponsors: Senators Charles \nSchumer, Susan Collins and Jack Reed.\n  Put simply, this is the single most effective action we can take to \nlimit our reliance on foreign oil, save consumers at the pump, and \nreduce global warming.\n  Today, the U.S. has 4 percent of the world's population, yet we use \n25 percent of the planet's energy.\n  So as the world's largest energy consumer, I believe it is our \nresponsibility to make every effort to be the world's leader in \nconservation.\n  Specifically, the results of this bill would be substantial. It \nwould: Save America one million barrels of oil a day; reduce oil \nimports by 10 percent; and prevent 240 million tons of carbon dioxide \nemissions from entering the atmosphere--this is the single biggest \ncause of Global Warming.\n  Today, the fuel economy standard for passenger vehicles is 27.5 miles \nper gallon, while the standard for SUVs and light duty trucks is 20.7 \nmiles per gallon due to a loophole in the 1975 law.\n  The result: SUVs and light trucks now comprise nearly half of new car \nsales, bringing the average fuel economy of all the nation's new \nvehicles to its lowest point since 1980.\n  The Feinstein-Snowe legislation would: Phase in fuel economy \nstandards for SUVs and all other light duty trucks on the following \nschedule: By 2002, SUVs and light duty vehicles must average 22.5 miles \nper gallon; by 2005, SUVs and light duty vehicles must average 25 miles \nper gallon; and by 2007, SUVs and light duty vehicles must average 27.5 \nmiles per gallon; require that vehicles up to a weight of 10,000 pounds \nmust qualify for fuel efficiency standards by 2007. The current limit \nis 8,500 pounds; increase the fuel economy of new vehicles comprising \nthe federal government fleet by 6 miles per gallon by 2005.\n  Last year, former Senators Slade Gorton, Richard Bryan and I fought \nan uphill battle to try and find a way to increase these fuel economy \nstandards.\n  But, we were stymied by the auto industry and their supporters in \nCongress.\n  Ultimately, at the end of the session, we reached an agreement that \ndirected the National Academy of Sciences to study whether, in fact, we \ncould raise fuel efficiency with sacrificing safety or competitiveness.\n  Recently, the automakers have said that they will not actively oppose \nincreases in fuel efficiency standards.\n  The Big Three manufacturers have promised a voluntary increase in \nefficiency for SUVs by 25 percent by 2005.\n  This is an important step forward, but we need to do more. I believe \nthis bill is the best way to do that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n        Bennett, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Bunning, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, \n        Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Schumer, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 805. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nresearch with respect to various forms of muscular dystrophy, including \nDuchenne, Becker, limb girdle, congenital, facioscapulohumeral, \nmyotonic, oculopharyngeal, distal, and emery-dreifuss muscular \ndystrophies; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is the Muscular Dystrophy \nCommunity Assistance, Research And Education Act of 2001. It really is \nthe MD CARE Act. I thank Senators Cochran and Collins, especially, for \ntheir assistance. There are 20 colleagues who support this legislation. \nIt is about equally divided between Democrats and Republicans, thank \nGod, because of what this piece of legislation is about.\n  To look at the record of research on these debilitating and deadly \ndiseases is to realize that despite our country's enormous resources, \nsometimes people are left behind. Today, despite all the advances in \nmedical science, victims of muscular dystrophy--which afflicts tens of \nthousands of individuals every year in America--have no cure and no \neffective treatments available to them.\n  I became engaged with the muscular dystrophy community when I was \napproached by several families in my home state of Minnesota with \nchildren suffering from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is the \nmost prevalent form of muscular dystrophy affecting children and it is \nthe most deadly.\n  Children with DMD are most often not diagnosed before the age of two \nor three years. Because it is sex-linked, the disease only strikes boys \nbut in reality, it strikes the entire family.\n  DMD children don't begin to walk until late, and then in an unusual \nmanner. They frequently fall and have difficulty getting up. Climbing \nstairs is a major ordeal.\n  By age 9 these children start to rely on a wheelchair and by their \nteen years reliance becomes total.\n  Most tragically, the disease is characterized by a continued rapidly \nprogressive muscle weakness that almost always results in death by 20 \nyears of age.\n  I have three children, ages 36, 31, and 28. I cannot imagine this.\n  Children afflicted with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy have no ability \nto produce the protein dystrophin, the protein that binds the muscle \ncells together. It is an exceptionally cruel disease that slowly robs \nboys of their independence and ultimately immobilizes them, leading \ninvariably to an early loss of life.\n\n[[Page S4116]]\n\n  Sadly, the federal response to this disease has been inadequate. This \nyear, in an NIH budget of more than $18 billion, research into Duchenne \nand Becker Muscular Dystrophies totals just $9.2 million. Only $17 \nmillion was devoted last year to all of the muscular dystrophies \ncombined. If you want to understand why there is nothing available to \ntreat DMD children, you need look no further than the weak federal \nresponse to this disease. The gene that is flawed in this disease is \nreadily identifiable, and has been so for 14 years. Astonishingly, \nhowever, the pace of research on DMD actually slowed down after the \ngene was discovered.\n\n  One DMD child back in Minnesota that I have become especially fond of \nis Jacob Gunvalsen. Jacob is an adorable 10-year-old. He loves to play \nwith his siblings out on his parents' farm, draw pictures for his \nfamily's refrigerator and play video games. Jacob and his mother Cheri \nGunvalsen have made quite an impression on several members of Congress, \nand Jacob's picture adorns the desks of numerous health care \nlegislative staff throughout Washington. This is because like so many \nother parents facing the day-to-day experience of living with a child \nsuffering from this debilitating disease, Cheri is focused on leaving \nno stone unturned in her quest to help improve her son's chance of \nsurvival. One day, Jacob drew a picture of himself, and in a cloud \nabove his figure he wrote the words, ``What I want most in the world is \na cure for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy''. I say to my colleagues, \nthat's what I want, too. Today, we are getting one step closer to \nmaking Jacob's wish come true.\n  David Mesick, also of Minnesota, is the Chairman of the Parent \nProject Muscular Dystrophy, a national voluntary health organization \ncommitted to promoting medical research efforts specific to Duchenne \nand Becker muscular dystrophies. Through David's leadership and the \norganization's efforts, the muscular dystrophy community has \nsuccessfully increased Congress' awareness of this devastating disease. \nToday, their voices are being heard here on the floor of the Senate. I \nhave been moved by the number of families in Minnesota and elsewhere \nwho have been affected by this disease, and I have been moved even more \nby their tenacious response. We can support this community by improving \nfederal research efforts and public programs to address the needs of \nindividuals with muscular dystrophy.\n  Mr. President, passage of this legislation will improve coordination \nof research not only into Duchenne's, but into all the various forms of \nMuscular Dystrophy. It authorizes the National Institutes of Health \n(NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to \nestablish separate Centers of Excellence to promote basic and clinical \nresearch, epidemiology, data collection and assessment on the various \nforms of muscular dystrophy. These steps are needed to ensure a long-\nterm commitment by the federal government to the treatment and cure of \nmuscular dystrophy.\n  I am neither a scientist nor a physician. But I am told that it is \nhighly probable that sooner or later gene therapy will be able to cure \ndiseases of this nature. For diseases like Duchenne's muscular \ndystrophy, involving flaws on a single, identifiable gene, the outlook \nis even more positive. Yet the words `sooner' and `later' have profound \nconsequences in the lives of tens of thousands of Americans and their \nfamilies. With the introduction of the MD CARE Act, we move a step \ncloser to giving those families hope. I encourage my colleagues on the \nSenate HELP Committee to work steadfastly to move this crucial \nlegislation through the Senate, and I urge all colleagues to support \nit.\n  I also think of Eric Anderson who is such a good friend of my son. \nDavid and Eric came to Washington. So many of the families who came, \nand many came with their children, were so young and their children \nwere so young. Time is not neutral for them. There is an excellent \nchance we can make a real breakthrough in finding a cure. It is not too \nmuch that these families ask for and it is not too much to pass this \nlegislation and try and push forward a commitment to the funding, a \ncommitment to this research.\n  This is one of those diseases. I hate to label, so few are affected, \nbut for these children and these families, they are not too few in \nnumber. These are their lives. These are their hopes. These are their \ndreams. This is their pain. This is their agony. I want to turn this \ninto hope. I ask all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I am very pleased this has strong bipartisan support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON:\n  S. 806.

A bill to promote youth financial education; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE, Mr. President, today I am introducing the Youth \nFinancial Literacy Act to address an important issue in education: \nteaching students the basic principles of financial literacy.\n  Unfortunately, when it comes to personal finances, young Americans do \nnot have the skills they need. Too few understand the details of \nmanaging a checking account, for example, or using a credit card. It is \ntime to make sure that our education system teaches our children all \nthe skills they need, including the fundamental principles involved \nwith earning, spending, saving and investing, so that they can manage \ntheir own money and succeed in our society.\n  We have just finished tax season, and a recent survey by the non-\nprofit JumpStart Coalition reveals that the average high school student \nknows very little about how taxes will affect her take-home pay. The \nstudy also found that, on average, only 36 percent of surveyed high \nschool students could correctly answer basic personal finance \nquestions, and only 33 percent of students believed that financial \nissues strongly impacted their daily lives.\n  Young people today face an exceedingly complex financial system that \nis laced with pitfalls. Credit card companies lure naive college \nstudents, encouraging them to spend liberally. Music companies offer \nextraordinary deals such as ``8 CDs for one penny!'' and then trap \ncustomers into purchasing unwanted music every month. Many of our \nchildren are simply unaware of the dangers of these kinds of offers.\n  We also must make sure that the next generation is prepared to deal \nwith the challenges they will find in the workplace. Rather than \nproviding specific benefits, many companies are now encouraging \nemployees to buy\n\n[[Page S4117]]\n\ntheir own health insurance coverage and arrange their own retirement \nplans. The onus is now on the worker, who will need to understand the \nins and outs of benefits programs in order to best provide for \nthemselves and their families.\n  This Congress is seeking to change the rules governing bankruptcy. I \nagree with the proponents of that legislation about the importance of \nholding Americans accountable for their financial obligations, indeed, \nour economy depends on the willingness of people to pay their bills and \nact responsibly, but this legislation will mean that people who have \nbeen plunged into debt must negotiate a more complex system and face \nvery serious consequences. It will be all the more critical that the \nnext generation learns how to better manage their money to stay out of \ndebt.\n  It is time for our schools to take on the challenge of preparing our \nchildren to succeed in every way, including their financial decisions. \nYoung people need to learn the skills that will help them stay out of \ndebt, maintain a good credit record, and save money for the future.\n  In New Jersey, I am happy to say that many have already started the \nball rolling on financial literacy education. My state allows local \nschools the option of offering financial education in high school, and \nthe New Jersey Coalition for Financial Education is working with the \nNew Jersey Department of Education to develop and implement core \ncurriculum standards. Some in the business community have decided to \nhelp out as well. In South Orange and Maplewood, the Allegiance \nCommunity Bank has partnered with the Saturn Corporation to provide \nfinancial education to local schoolchildren. We in Congress ought to \nrecognize and support more effort like these.\n  I am not alone in advocating the importance of financial literacy. \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said recently that ``Improving \nbasic financial education at the elementary and secondary school levels \nis essential to providing a foundation for financial literacy that can \nhelp prevent younger people from making poor financial decisions.'' In \nWisconsin, Governor Scott McCallum has introduced a program to help \nhigh school teachers integrate financial literacy into their \nclassrooms.\n  Today, I hope to elevate the discussion of this issue by introducing \nthe Youth Financial Education Act, which would provide grants to states \nto help them develop and implement financial education programs in \nelementary and secondary schools, including helping to prepare teachers \nto provide financial education. It would also establish a national \nclearinghouse for instructional materials and information regarding \nmodel financial education programs.\n  We must not sit idly by while so many of our children lack financial \nliteracy. So I ask for my colleagues to join me in support of the Youth \nFinancial Literacy Act, to help ensure that our next generation is \nprepared to meet the challenges of the new economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Craig, and Mr. \n        Burns):\n  S. 808. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe occupational taxes relating to distilled spirits, wine, and beer; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join my \ngood friend and colleague, Senator Fred Thompson, today in introducing \nlegislation that will repeal the Special Occupational Tax, SOT, on \ntaxpayers who manufacture, distribute, and sell alcoholic beverages. \nThe special occupational tax is not a tax on alcoholic products but \nrather operates as a license fee on businesses. The tax is imposed on \nthose engaged in the business of selling alcohol beverages. This is an \ninequitable tax that has outlived it's original purpose and is a clear \nexample of an antiquated approach to federal taxation. Believe it or \nnot, this tax was originally implemented to help finance the Civil War.\n  The SOT on alcohol was dramatically increased during a budget process \nin 1988 and has unfairly burdened business owners across the country. \nFrom Thompson Falls to Sidney, from Chinook to Billings, small \nbusinesses are burdened with yet another tax in the form of the (SOT). \nAccording to the AFT, there are 480,427 locations nationwide that pay \nSOT's every year, including 458,603 retailers. These retail \nestablishments account for $114 million out of $126 million in SOT \nrevenues.\n  In Montana, there are 3,378 locations, including 3,172 retail \nbusinesses, which pay more than $1 million dollars in the SOT every \nyear. Seasonal resorts in Whitefish and Yellowstone, ``mom and pop'' \nconvenience stores in Butte, and bowling alleys, flower shops, and \nrestaurants across Montana and the United States pay the Federal \ngovernment almost $100 million per year for the privilege of running \nbusinesses that sell beer, wine, or alcoholic beverages. For example, a \nsmall business owner in Helena, Montana runs several convenience stores \nand a few restaurants. The SOT for each establishment is $250. As a \nresult, he pays $1750 a year in SOT payments that are in the nature of \nbusiness license fees. In fact, a chain of four neighborhood food \nstores pays the same annual tax as the nation's largest single site \nbrewery or distillery $1,000. This is not what Congress had in mind 150 \nyears ago, and I don't believe it is a situation we want today.\n  Repeal of the SOT on alcohol is supported by a broad-based group of \nbusiness organizations enjoys wide-spread bipartisan support on Capitol \nHill. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House this year \nand bills have been considered in previous Congresses, but for one \nreason or another, the laws were not enacted. The GAO has examined the \nefficacy of the SOT several times and found it fundamental flawed. The \nstaff of the Joint Committee on Taxation recommended in its recently \nreleased study on tax simplification that this special occupational tax \nbe eliminated.\n  It is time for us to move forward and enact legislation to repeal the \nSOT on alcohol. We urge our colleagues to join us in this endeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 809. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to sell \ncertain land to the town of Kingston, Nevada, for use as an emergency \nmedical air evacuation site and for other public uses; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Town of \nKingston Emergency Landing Strip Conveyance Act.\n  The residents of Kingston in southern Lander County, NV, depend on an \nemergency landing strip owned by the Bureau of Land Management, BLM. \nKingston is a small rural town of 780 people located on an island of \nprivate land in central Nevada, which is surrounded by public lands \nowned by the United States Forest Service and the BLM. Lack of private \nland around Kingston constrains the growth, economic diversity, and \npublic services available to those who live in or visit Kingston. The \nlocal Fire and Rescue maintains an agreement with Medic Air of Reno to \nprovide 24-hour emergency medical service to this landing strip. \nHowever, BLM cannot re-issue an airport lease to the Kingston Town \nbecause the strip does not meet FAA standards.\n  This bill will convey 144.88 acres to the Town of Kingston. Seventy \nacres will be conveyed at fair market value and 74.88 acres at no cost. \nThe 70 acres to be conveyed at fair market value includes the main \nlanding strip. The 74.88 acres to be conveyed at no cost includes the \nbalance of the approach; and the disposal of this land for no \nconsideration will benefit the United States because it is an isolated, \nsegregated parcel that would be difficult to manage for public use. I \nhope that Congress will pass the Town of Kingston Emergency Landing \nStrip Conveyance Act for the benefit of rural Nevadans, federal \nmanagers, and the residents of Kingston.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 809\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONVEYANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the lease by the Secretary of the Interior of certain \n     land to the town of Kingston,\n\n[[Page S4118]]\n\n     Nevada, for use as an emergency airstrip has expired;\n       (2) rather than renew the airport lease (which would \n     require certification by the Federal Aviation \n     Administration), the Secretary and the Town desire that the \n     parcel on which the main landing strip is situated be sold to \n     the Town for fair market value as determined by the \n     Secretary;\n       (3) adjacent to that parcel is other land, most of which, \n     if the airstrip parcel is sold to the Town, would be isolated \n     from other land administered by the Secretary and would \n     therefore be difficult for the Secretary to manage;\n       (4) it would in the best interests of the United States and \n     the Town for the Secretary to convey to the Town both the \n     airstrip parcel and the adjacent parcel, at the fair market \n     value of the airstrip parcel; and\n       (5) the parcels have been determined to be suitable for \n     disposal in the Shoshone-Eureka Resource Management Plan and \n     Environmental Impact Statement.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Adjacent parcel.--The term ``adjacent parcel'' means \n     the parcels of land in the State of Nevada, comprising 74.88 \n     acres, described as Mount Diablo Meridian, T16N, R44E, \n     section 31, lot 4, E1/2NESE, S1/2SWNESE, S1/2S1/2NWSE.\n       (2) Airstrip parcel.--The term ``airstrip parcel'' means \n     the parcel of land, with a landing strip running on an \n     easterly bearing and a portion of a landing strip running on \n     a southerly bearing, in the State of Nevada, comprising 70.00 \n     acres, described as Mount Diablo Meridian, T16N, R44E, \n     section 31, N1/2SESW, N1/2SWSE, N1/2SESE, SESESE.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior, acting through the Director of the Bureau of \n     Land Management.\n       (4) Town.--The term ``Town'' means the town of Kingston, \n     Nevada.\n       (c) Conveyance.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to valid existing rights and \n     paragraph (2), the Secretary shall convey to the Town all \n     right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the \n     airstrip parcel and the adjacent parcel, totaling 144.8 \n     acres.\n       (2) Conditions.--\n       (A) Airstrip parcel.--The Secretary shall convey the \n     airstrip parcel under paragraph (1) by direct sale, at fair \n     market value.\n       (B) Adjacent parcel.--The Secretary shall convey the \n     adjacent parcel under paragraph (1) for no consideration.\n       (d) No Reservations.--The patent by which the conveyance \n     under subsection (c) is made shall contain no reservations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 810. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe amount of the charitable deduction allowable for contributions of \nfood inventory, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto remedy the shortage of food donations that plagues food banks and \nother organizations dedicated to ending hunger in America.\n  It is a sad truth that hunger continues to persist even as our \neconomy has broken records over the past decade. If we take a look at \nthe dynamics of the restaurant industry, new construction, long lines \nfor tables, oversized portions of food, it is obvious that food supply \nis not the problem.\n  The problem is waste. America wastes 96 billion pounds of food each \nyear. And in doing so, we allow 31 million people to go hungry. This is \nunacceptable in a society that has bountiful food resources and an \ninfrastructure of local and national food banks willing to accept \ndonations of surplus food. Perhaps the most awful statistic is that \nwhile many of us wait in line to purchase, or to be served, abundant \namounts of food, many hungry American families will wait in line at \nfood banks and never receive a meal. Last year we failed to meet more \nthan 20 percent of the demand for food at area food banks. That means, \nin effect, one out of every five families is sent home hungry,\n  Why is there such a shortage of donated food? Well, our Internal \nRevenue Service makes it more economical to throw food away rather than \ngive it away. While the tax code permits restaurants to deduct half of \nthe difference between the cost of donated food and its market value, \nthe IRS often will tell a restaurant that donated food has no market \nvalue for deduction purposes simply because the food was not sold \nthrough normal retail distribution channels. For instance, a restaurant \nmay have its own extra-stringent ``freshness'' standard where they \nproudly sell food that has been ``off the grill'' for less than 10 \nminutes. Well, we all know that this same food, if properly maintained, \nwill remain wholesome for much longer, and that area food banks have a \ndesperate need for such food.\n  But when the IRS fails to assign an appropriate market value to \ndonated food, the deduction is meaningless. Donating food requires a \nbusiness to incur additional costs of storage, transportation, and \nlabor. If a business cannot, at the very least, recoup these additional \ncosts, they actually lose money by donating food instead of throwing \nthe food away. What we have then, Mr. President, is an IRS that is \neffectively administering tax policy that discourages, rather than \nencourages, private industry from helping to feed needy families. We \nall learned in church that it's better to give than to receive. \nUnfortunately, at the IRS, the motto seems to be: it's better to throw \naway than to give away.\n  Another reason that excess food fails to reach needy families is that \ntoo many businesses are ineligible to deduct food donations because of \nan outdated restriction in the tax code. Many small restaurants, farms, \nand franchises are organized as ``s'' corporations, limited liability \ncorporations, or sole proprietorships. The current law, however, limits \nthe deduction to traditional ``c'' corporations. If we are serious \nabout feeding needy families through charitable donations, then the \nGovernment needs to enlist a new army of small businesses in the fight \nagainst hunger.\n  To eliminate these two major barriers in the fight against hunger, \nthe Feeding Needy Families Act would define the market value of donated \nfood without penalizing businesses for setting high internal standards. \nThis codifies the decision of the United States Tax Court in Lucky \nStores, Inc. v. Commissioner, 95 T.C. 420 (1995), where the court held \nthat the market value of donated bread was the full retail price for \npurposes of calculating the deduction. The bill also expands the \ndeduction to any entity that is kind enough to expend the effort \nnecessary to donate surplus food, whether it be an ``s'' corporation, a \nlimited liability corporation, or a sole proprietorship. Removing these \nlegal, logistical, and financial roadblocks will go a long way to \nensure that excess food flows from table to table rather than from \ntable to trash.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Lincoln in introducing this \nimportant legislation. I ask unanimous consent to include in the \nRecord, following the text of my statement, a copy of the bill. I also \nwould ask unanimous consent that the Record include letters of support \nfrom the Salvation Army, USA Harvest, Kentucky Harvest, Northern \nKentucky Harvest, the National Association of Chain Restaurants, and \nthe National Restaurant Association.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 810\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It has been my experience over the last 14 years that \n     there is truly a need in our nation for the effort that is \n     put forth in this bill. Tragically the average age of \n     homelessness today is 9 years old. Your legislation will \n     certainly go a long way in assisting the 120 USA Harvest \n     chapters in helping feed our nation's less fortunate \n     children.\n       The encouragement that this bill will provide those people \n     and organizations in the food business to partner with USA \n     harvest is going to make a significant difference in the \n     quality of life for many millions of Americans.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                      Stan Curtis,\n      Founder and Chairman USA Harvest.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Kentucky Harvest,\n\n                                    Lexington, KY, April 26, 2001.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of our hunger relief \n     program, we write to thank you for your plan to introduce the \n     ``Good Samaritan Tax Act'' in the Senate. By clarifying the \n     charitable deduction allowable for contributions of food and \n     extending the deduction to all business entities willing to \n     donate food, the Good Samaritan Tax Act will help ensure that \n     our program will have access to additional wholesome food. \n     This food will be used to continue our fight against hunger.\n       It is a shame for good food to go to waste. However, \n     significant costs are associated with the systematic \n     distribution of food by restaurants to those in need. \n     Distribution and transportation systems, quality control \n     assurances, record keeping and compliance systems must be \n     developed and maintained to safely get food to those who are \n     in need.\n       We believe that the Good Samaritan Tax Act will help the \n     food service industry offset these costs, and therefore \n     encourage the contribution of their excess food to \n     organizations such as ours.

By clarifying the charitable deduction allowable for \n     contributions of food and extending the deduction to all \n     business entities willing to donate, the Feeding Needy \n     Families Act will help ensure that our program will have \n     access to additional wholesome food.\n       In fact, Northern Kentucky Harvest will benefit greatly by \n     your new bill. In the past, many company-owned restaurants \n     participated in our program where excess food was donated and \n     distributed to feed the homeless and less fortunate in \n     Northern Kentucky. However, when these restaurants were sold \n     to local franchisees, they no longer participated due to the \n     inability to receive ``credit'' for their food donation to \n     defray costs associated with the donation. As a result, many \n     homeless and less fortunate people went without food. This \n     bill gives us another opportunity to reclaim ``wasted'' food \n     and give the less fortunate ``hope'' for another day. Your \n     bill means a great deal to the success of eradicating hunger.\n       Please support this bill and allow us to make a difference \n     in our community by trying to overcome hunger.\n           Sincerely,\n     William E. Henderson III.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           The Salvation Army,\n\n                             Louisville, Kentucky, April 19, 2001.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of our hunger relief \n     program, we write today to thank you for your plan to \n     introduce the ``Good Samaritan Tax Act'' in the Senate. By \n     clarifying the charitable deduction allowable for \n     contributions of food and extending the deduction to all \n     business entities willing to donate food, the Good Samaritan \n     Tax Act will help ensure that our program will have access to \n     additional wholesome food. This food will be used to continue \n     our fight against hunger.\n       It is a shame for good food to go to waste. However, \n     significant costs are associated with the systematic \n     distribution of food by restaurants to those in need. \n     Distribution and transportation systems, quality control \n     assurances, record keeping and compliance systems must be \n     developed and maintained to safely and efficiently get food \n     to those who are in need.\n       We believe that the Good Samaritan Tax Act will help the \n     food service industry offset these costs, and therefore \n     encourage the contribution of their excess food to \n     organizations such as ours. This additional food will help to \n     ensure our ability to continue to assist those in need.\n       Thank you for your support in the fight against hunger.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Howard Sparks,\n     Director, The Salvation Army Service-unit.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Council of\n\n\n                                            Chain Restaurants,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2001.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the National Council \n     of Chain Restaurants, we are writing to express our support \n     for the ``Feeding Needy Families Act''. This bill, which you \n     introduce today, provides tax incentives to encourage \n     business contributions of food items.\n       The National Council of Chain Restaurants (``NCCR'') is a \n     national trade association representing forty of the nation's \n     largest multi-unit, multi-state chain restaurant companies. \n     These forty companies own and operate in excess of 50,000 \n     restaurant facilities. Additionally, through franchise and \n     licensing agreements, another 70,000 facilities are operated \n     under their trademarks. In the aggregate, NCCR's member \n     companies and their franchisees employ in excess of 2.8 \n     million individuals.\n       Your legislation is necessary to clarify the charitable \n     deduction allowance for contributions for food, helping \n     ensure the nation's food banks and donation centers can \n     continue the fight against hunger. As welfare reform kicks \n     in, many people making the transition between public \n     assistance and independence are turning to charitable food \n     distribution programs for assistance.\n       Unfortunately, the IRS is exacerbating the problem with its \n     interpretation of the charitable donation sections of the \n     Internal Revenue Code. The code is designed to encourage \n     charitable donations of food by allowing a deduction equal to \n     cost plus one-half the difference between cost and fair \n     market value. However, the IRS maintains that when food \n     cannot be sold through normal distribution channels (i.e., \n     food left over when a restaurant closes for the night), its \n     retail value is zero and the taxpayer's deduction is limited \n     to cost only.\n       Distribution and transportation systems, quality control \n     assurances, record keeping and compliance systems must be \n     developed and maintained to safely and efficiently get food \n     to the needy. These processes involve significant costs. The \n     ``Good Samaritan Tax Act'' will help the food service \n     industry offset these costs, and therefore encourage the \n     contribution of food to the needy, by codifying the fair \n     market value of donated food. It also extends the deduction \n     to any trade or business, not just corporations.\n       We thank you for introducing this common-sense legislation \n     and offer our assistance to ensure its enactment into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Terrie M. Dort,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              National Restaurant Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the 844,000 restaurant \n     locations nationwide, the National Restaurant Association \n     offers it's support of the Feeding Needy Families Act, which \n     would provide more equitable tax treatment for food that is \n     donated to charities.\n       As you know, under the current tax code, businesses do not \n     receive the same tax deduction for charitable donations of \n     food as they do for other inventory. Food that is not sold \n     through normal distribution channels is considered by the \n     Internal Revenue Service to have no market value. In effect, \n     businesses are penalized and charities suffer because it \n     makes more economic sense for businesses to discard the food \n     than to donate it. The Feeding Needy Families Act would \n     correct this discrepancy in the tax code by allowing \n     businesses to take deductions on a fair market value basis \n     rather than just deducting the cost of raw materials.\n       As I am sure you can imagine, the effort and cost involved \n     in preparing perishable items to be donated can be \n     considerable. The food must be carefully collected, packaged, \n     and transported in a timely manner before it can be \n     distributed to food banks, soup kitchens, homeless shelters \n     and other organizations that serve the hungry. Because of the \n     additional work involved, we are concerned that it creates a \n     disincentive for businesses to donate food. That is why the \n     National Restaurant Association supports this legislation as \n     a means of providing strong incentives for businesses to \n     donate food--a much needed and valuable commodity.\n       We appreciate your support in moving this issue forward and \n     we hope that you will be successful in enacting the bill \n     without any modifications this year as restaurants are an \n     important resource in helping the millions of Americans that \n     do not get enough food to meet their basic needs.\n       Thank you for supporting the Feeding Needy Families Act and \n     we look forward to working with you in passing this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Steven C. Anderson,\n       President and Chief Executive Officer.\n     Lee Culpepper,\n       Senior Vice President, Government Affairs and Public \n     Policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Nebraska (for himself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 811. A bill to amend title 36, United States Code to designate the\n\n[[Page S4120]]\n\noak tree as the national tree of the United States; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation designating the oak tree as an official national emblem. \nThis day bears especially great significance for me as a United States \nSenator from Nebraska, since Arbor Day was first celebrated in our \ngreat state.\n  The original seed of this day was planted in 1872 by J. Sterling \nMorton, a newspaper executive and an environmentalist ahead of his \ntime. Mr. Morton moved from Michigan to Nebraska City, where he \ndiscovered a tree-less prairie. In effort to bring some shade to the \nstate, he collaborated with Robert Furnas to promote the idea of a \nstatewide holiday dedicated to tree planting.\n  Mr. Morton authored many articles on the benefits of trees as he \ngarnered support for the idea of an Arbor Day. He also became active in \nNebraska Territory politics, where he continued to voice his aspiration \nfor a forested prairie. While Morton is revered as the Father of Arbor \nDay, it was then-Governor Furnas who made the observance official in \n1874 with the first proclamation designating Arbor Day in Nebraska.\n  Since then, with the exception of one year, Nebraskans have \ncelebrated Arbor Day with pride. The one million trees that were said \nto have been planted on the very first Arbor Day--not to mention all \nthe ones since--have had a tremendous impact on the landscape and on \nthe lives of Nebraskans. The influence of that first observance has \ncontinued as each year, during planting season, people from around the \nglobe observe the Nebraska-born tradition of Arbor Day.\n  Considering the historical significance of Arbor Day to Nebraska, I \nam proud to sponsor this legislation to designate the oak tree, \nselected by Americans in a nationwide vote, as an official emblem of \nthe United States. By formally designating a national tree, we honor \nthe past and plant hope for an even greener future.\n  After all, an oak tree is an appropriate metaphor for the history of \nour country. The United States has grown from the acorn of colonialism \ninto a strong, branching entity. Like a maturing oak, our roots are \ndeepening, and with each passing year, our core strengthens.\n  J. Sterling Morton, as he expounded on the indifference of trees to \ntheir worldly surroundings, once wrote, ``There is no aristocracy in \ntrees.'' To his sentiment, I would add that, ``Instead, there is only \nthe humble root of democracy.'' The oak, the symbol of our democracy, \nwill always serve as reminder of the vitality and strength that \npermeates our national--as well as natural--history.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Senator Mike Crapo for cosponsoring \nthis legislation and for his support of this effort. I also want to \ncommend each of the voters who participated in the selection process, \nsponsored by the National Arbor Day Foundation. The involvement of \nthese American citizens has made this legislation possible.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Ben Nelson in \nintroducing legislation to designate the oak tree as America's National \nTree.\n  I am pleased to support an effort that recognizes the importance of \ntrees in our lives and our nation's heritage. Trees provide a number of \nsocietal benefits and, as a renewable resource, can provide these \nbenefits generation after generation when properly managed. From our \nnation's reliance on wood and wood products to the environmental \nbenefits of cleaner air and water, trees are an integral part of our \nlives.\n  Trees produce oxygen, lower ambient air temperature, release moisture \ninto the air, retain particulates, create habitat for wildlife, and \nstore carbon-dioxide. Trees can produce wind breaks, provide shade, and \nstabilize soils. Trees provide a multitude of products that are used in \nour daily lives.\n  In a national effort that culminated in a nationwide vote, the public \nchose the oak tree as America's National Tree. I appreciate the \npublic's involvement in this effort and recognize that the oak tree is \nAmerica's most widespread hardwood. As an Idahoan, I am partial to \nIdaho's state tree, the White Pine, but support the people's choice. \nThe ``King of Trees'' has long been valued for its shade, beauty, and \nlumber and is a fitting symbol of America's strength and diversity.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to support the public's \nchoice for a national tree. I appreciate Senator Nelson's efforts to \nadd a national tree to the list of national observances, which includes \nour national anthem, motto, floral emblem, and march.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4120-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4120-S4121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 78--DESIGNATING MAY 2001, AS ``OLDER AMERICANS \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Mr. CRAIG submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 78\n\n       Whereas older Americans are the foundation of our Nation;\n       Whereas the freedom and security our Nation now enjoys can \n     be attributed to the service, hard work, and sacrifices of \n     older Americans;\n       Whereas older Americans continue making significant \n     contributions to our communities, workplaces, and homes by \n     giving freely of themselves and by sharing their wisdom and \n     experience through civic leadership and mentoring;\n       Whereas the older Americans of tomorrow will be more \n     socially, ethnically, and economically diverse than any past \n     generation, which will impact upon our Nation's ideas of \n     work, retirement and leisure, alter our housing and living \n     arrangements, challenge our health care systems, and reshape \n     our economy;\n       Whereas the opportunities and challenges that await our \n     Nation require our Nation to continue to commit to the goal \n     of ensuring that older Americans enjoy active, productive, \n     and healthy lives, and do so independently, safely, and with \n     dignity; and\n       Whereas it is appropriate for our Nation to continue the \n     tradition of designating the month of May as a time to \n     celebrate the contributions of older Americans and to \n     rededicate our efforts to respect and better serve older \n     Americans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 2001, as ``Older Americans Month'';\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe such \n     month with appropriate ceremonies and activities that promote \n     acknowledgment, gratitude, and respect for older Americans.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nhonoring May as Older Americans' Month.\n  I am here today to celebrate May as Older Americans' Month. For 38 \nyears May has been the official month during which we pay tribute to \nthe contributions of our 44 million older Americans. It is during this \nmonth that we as a nation recognize older Americans for their service, \nhard work and sacrifice that helped assure us the freedom and security \nwe now enjoy.\n  Not only should we take this time to show our appreciation and \nrespect for America's seniors, but also to acknowledge that today's and \ntomorrow's seniors will continue making significant contributions to \nour communities through their wisdom and experience; in the workplace, \nin civic leadership and in our homes.\n  We must also recognize that 77 million baby boomers will soon be \nretiring and must begin to address some of the challenges this influx \nwill bring. Social Security and Medicare modernization, including the \noption for prescription drugs, must be addressed before this generation \nretires.\n  As the new Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am \nlooking forward to the opportunities and challenges that await us as we \ncontinue our commitment to the goal of ensuring that senior citizens \nenjoy active, productive and healthy lives, and do so independently, \nsafely and with dignity. This Committee is celebrating its own \nanniversary this year and I am proud to say that for 40 years, it has \nplayed a role in studying problems and opportunities related to older \nAmericans.\n  In addition, this year I believe we have special reason to celebrate. \nLast year, Congress was able to pass the reauthorization of the Older \nAmericans' Act. As you all know, this reauthorization was 5 years in \nthe coming. I was an original cosponsor of legislation to update and \namend the Act and strongly supported the legislative goal of making the \nprograms and services under\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n\nthe Act more responsive to the needs of America's seniors.\n  With this reauthorization Congress was able to add an important \ncomponent to the Act. The program authorized $125 million to establish \na new National Family Caregiver Support Program to provide grants to \nstates to provide information and services to family caregivers. \nBecause of the importance of this program, the Special Committee on \nAging will be holding a hearing May 17 to examine its implementation.\n  In the tradition of Older Americans' Month, I am introducing a \nresolution in the Senate calling on the people of the United States to \nobserve the month of May 2001 as Older Americans' Month and to \nencourage all Americans to promote awareness through ceremonies, \nprograms, and other activities that promote acknowledgment, gratitude, \nand respect for American seniors.\n  I ask all of you to celebrate with me Older Americans' Month this \nMay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4121-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 79--DESIGNATING MAY 1, 2001, AS ``NATIONAL CHILD CARE \n                           WORTHY WAGE DAY''\n\n  Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. \nCleland, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Feingold) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nsupporting National Child Care Worthy Wage Day, which I hope will being \nattention to early childhood education and the importance of attracting \nand retaining qualified childcare workers.\n  Every day, approximately 13 million children are cared for outside \nthe home so that their parents can work. This figure includes 6 million \nof our nation's infants and toddlers. Children begin to learn at birth, \nand the quality of care they receive will affect them for the rest of \ntheir lives. Early childcare affects language development, math skills, \nsocial behavior, and general readiness for school. Experienced \nchildcare workers can identify children who have development or \nemotional problems and provide the care they need to take on life's \nchallenges. Through the creative use of play, structured activities and \nindividual attention, childcare workers help young children learn about \nthe world around them and how to interact with others. They also teach \nthe skills children will need to be ready to read and to learn when \nthey go to school.\n  Unfortunately, despite the importance of their work, the committed \nindividuals who nurture and teach our nation's young children are \nundervalued. The average salary of a childcare worker is about $15,000 \nannually. In 1998, the middle 50 percent of child care workers and pre-\nschool teachers earned between $5.82 and $8.13 an hour, according to \nthe Department of labor. The lowest 10 percent of childcare workers \nwere paid an hourly rate of $5.49 or less. Only one third of our \nnation's childcare workers have health insurance and even fewer have \npension plans. This grossly inadequate level of wages and benefits for \nchildcare staff has led to difficulties in attracting and retaining \nhigh quality caretakers and educators. As a result, the turnover rate \nfor childcare providers is 30 percent a year. This high turnover rate \ninterrupts consistent and stable relationships that children need to \nhave with their caregivers.\n  If we want our children cared for by qualified providers with higher \ndegrees and more training, we will have to make sure they are \nadequately compensated. Otherwise, we will continue to lose early \nchildhood educators with BA degrees to kindergarten and first grade, \nlosing some of our best teachers of young children from the early years \nof learning.\n  In order to bring attention to childcare workers, I am sponsoring a \nresolution that would designate May 1st as National Child Care Worthy \nWage Day. On May 1st each year, childcare providers and other early \nchildhood professionals nationwide conduct public awareness and \neducation efforts highlighting the importance of good early childhood \neducation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in recognizing the importance of \nthe work and professionalism that childcare workers provide and the \nneed to increase their compensation accordingly. The nation's childcare \nworkforce, the families who depend on them, and the children they care \nfor, deserve our support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/01/senate-section/article/S4121-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 355.
