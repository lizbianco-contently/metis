Madam President, several weeks ago I wrote to President \nBush and suggested it is time--perhaps past the time--to have an \neconomic summit in this country to talk about the challenges we are \nfacing with this American economy.\n  It is interesting, if you look at what has happened. We had gone \nthrough a\n\n[[Page S8628]]\n\nperiod of almost unprecedented growth and opportunity. The 1990s was a \nperiod in which people were working. We had increases in the number of \njobs available, home ownership, personal income, and the stock market \nwas moving up. The economy was growing.\n  It solves a lot of problems in a country when you have an economy \nthat is growing. There is no social program that is as good as a good \njob that pays well, and people who are trained and skilled and able to \nassume those jobs.\n  But in recent years--the last year and a half, 2 years--we have hit \nsome rough water here, and the economy is not doing well. We have a \nseries of things that have happened.\n  Early in the President's term, he proposed a fiscal policy with a \n$1.7 trillion tax cut, the bulk of which goes to the upper income folks \nin the country. And he said: Well, we are going to have surpluses for \n10 straight years.\n  I was on this floor and said--I am the conservative on this--I don't \nthink you ought to predict, with any precision, what is going to happen \n10 years from now. We don't know what is going to happen 3 months from \nnow or 3 years from now, let alone 10 years from now.\n  The President, and others here, insisted: No. We are going to have \nall these surpluses, and this money belongs to the American people. \nLet's give it back. Let's lock it in, and do it now.\n  In a matter of months, we had a war on terrorism, the terrible and \ntragic attack on this country of September 11. We have a recession that \noccurs shortly after this new fiscal policy is developed, which \nprobably was occurring even as it was being developed. And then we have \na series of corporate scandals, scandals unlike any we have seen in our \nlifetime, certainly, and perhaps in a century or so. In addition to \nthat, we see a stock market that begins to collapse.\n  So all of these things, coming together, have dramatically changed \nwhat is happening in Government. Big budget surpluses have now turned \nto big budget deficits. And it is as if nothing has happened. We have \nthe administration, the President, and others acting as if: Well, \nnothing has really changed. There is no need to be talking about these \nthings.\n  Of course there is a need for us to be talking about them. Things \nhave changed in a dramatic way. As a result of that, I think we ought \nto come together and have an economic summit of some type with the \nPresident, to talk about what kind of fiscal policy can put this \ncountry's economy back on track, so that those who are out of work can \nfind work, so that those whose life savings in their 401(k)s, that have \nbeen dissipated, can begin to see them grow once again, so that the \neconomy produces opportunity and jobs once again.\n\n  This isn't going to happen just by accident. It is going to happen if \nwe take a look at what is not working and what are the potential \nsolutions to make it work.\n  I understand the discussion in the last few weeks has been all Iraq \nall the time. I am not suggesting it is not important. That is a very \nimportant matter, a serious and deadly issue for this country. It is \nalso the case, however, as the newspaper tells us this morning, that \nthe President is out 2 days a week campaigning across the country and \nfundraising and so on. He has a right to do that as well. But if he has \nthe time to do that, then he also has the time to work with us to \nconstruct a fiscal policy that relates to what we face today.\n  Today we face an economy in trouble. We face a war on terror. We face \nbudget surpluses that have turned to budget deficits. We face a stock \nmarket in great turmoil. We face a a circumstance of well over 6 \npercent of our population out of work, unable to find jobs. It is time \nfor us to stop, take stock, and evaluate what works and what doesn't. \nHow do we put together a plan that moves this country toward economic \nopportunity and economic growth once again? I understand why some want \nto ignore it, but it is not the right thing for this country.\n  I have been chairing hearings for the last 8 or 10 months on the \nsubject of corporate scandals. That is an important issue. It has also \nplayed a role in injuring the feelings of people and the confidence \nthey have in the economy. There is a difference in how we view those \nissues.\n  For example, I was trying to offer an amendment to the corporate \nresponsibility bill that passed the Senate. I was blocked by the \nRepublican side. Regrettably, that amendment is not now law. The rest \nof the bill is law. The amendment is very simple. It says, if you are a \ncorporate executive and you are taking a company into bankruptcy, the \n12 months before you run that company into the ground, if you are \ngetting bonus payments and incentive payments, we have a right to \nrecapture them and force a disgorgement of those payments. You should \nnot get incentives and bonuses when you run a company into the ground.\n  Since I was blocked from offering that and it is not now law--I will \ncontinue to try--the Financial Times came out with an analysis. They \nsaid that the 25 largest bankruptcies in America occurred in the last \nyear and a half; 208 corporate executives took $3.3 billion in \ncompensation out of those corporations before those corporations were \nrun into the ground. I will hold a hearing on that in the next couple \nweeks.\n  There is something fundamentally wrong with what is going on in those \nareas. We have people who don't want to talk about it. The \nadministration doesn't want to talk about it. That is not the issue \nthey want to bring to the floor and have a debate on. But that is what \nwe should have a debate on. How do you establish confidence in this \neconomy if you don't clear up those kinds of problems?\n  So whether it is corporate scandals, a troubled economy, a recession, \na war on terrorism, a stock market that acts like a yo-yo, we need to \nput the pieces of this puzzle together again. It is not going to get \nput together by people just ignoring the issue.\n  One of the significant issues facing our country at this moment is an \neconomy that is in very serious trouble. It does no service to our \ncountry to deny that. Let's try to find a way to fix it. There may not \nbe a way where one party says, we have all the answers, or the other \nside says, we have all the answers. Maybe the answers are the best of \nwhat both have to offer, instead of getting the worst of what each has \nto offer. In order to get there, you have to sit down and talk about \nit.\n\n  I urge the President to respond to these requests for an economic \nsummit, to sit down with us and talk about what is wrong with the \neconomy and how you put this back together towards an economy and a \nfuture of economic growth and opportunity once again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8628-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8628-S8631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL AND DOMESTIC SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota \nfor raising what I think is an important and timely issue; that is, \nwhat are we going to focus on, what will be our interest, what will be \nthe real objective and issue we will make the centerpiece for our \ndiscussion over the next 7 weeks before the election on November 5.\n  It is very clear what the President wants to focus on. He wants to \nfocus, it appears, exclusively on the issue of Iraq. Of course, we all \nconcede that national security is our No. 1 priority. I happen to \nbelieve, as most do, that Democrats and Republicans have stood together \nsince September 11 of 2001. We have provided the President the \nresources with the authority, and we have told him we will stand \nshoulder to shoulder with him in fighting a war on terrorism.\n  There is little disagreement on Saddam Hussein and Iraq. I haven't \nheard a single Member of Congress from either party in either Chamber \nstand to defend Saddam Hussein. This man is a thug. He has been a \nthreat to his own people, to the region, and certainly, if he is \ndeveloping weapons of mass destruction, then they could be a threat way \nbeyond that region of the world.\n  We have to take it very seriously, as we have. I thought we made real \nprogress last week. There was a time in early August when voices from \nthe White House were telling us: We are just going to have to go it \nalone. The United States will have to take on Saddam Hussein by itself. \nIncidentally, we don't need congressional approval. We have father \nBush's war approval which\n\n[[Page S8629]]\n\nwill be good enough for son Bush as President.\n  I disagree with that, but that was an argument being made out of the \nWhite House. There was also a suggestion that the President and the \nUnited States need not go to the United Nations to talk about \ninspections; that we would just, frankly, achieve regime change on our \nown.\n\n  Thank goodness cooler heads prevailed. Thank goodness, last week, the \nPresident not only acknowledged that he would come to Congress for any \napproval before we would go to war, he also went to the United Nations \nin New York on September 12 and made a historic speech, calling on the \nUnited Nations to live up to its responsibility, its mandate, in terms \nof the power and weaponry of Iraq, and basically said to the United \nNations: It is time for us to prove this organization has a future.\n  Good news followed. This morning's paper suggests that Iraq got the \nmessage, a message delivered not just by the United Nations but by a \nlot of nations that historically had been at least friendly with Iraq \nand have now said they have no choice, they have to reopen their \ncountry to meaningful inspections. If the press reports are accurate, \nSaddam Hussein has said he will allow U.N. inspections on an \nunconditional basis now. That is a dramatic mark of progress. I hope \nthe White House will take yes for an answer. I hope the White House \nwill realize that we can seize a historic opportunity to send \ninspection teams in to find out exactly what is going on in Iraq.\n  If it is threatening to us, to anyone in the region, or to the people \nof Iraq, we have to use the authority of the United Nations to make \ncertain that it becomes a peaceful situation. I think progress has been \nmade. I will tip my hat to the President and to those in the White \nHouse for that fact.\n  But mark my words, there are some who will not take yes for an \nanswer. They won't be satisfied that the U.N. is living up to its \nresponsibility if it sends in inspectors. They will not be satisfied \nthat Saddam Hussein has said: We are opening our borders. They will \nsay: We can't trust him. It will never work. Let's prepare to invade.\n  That makes a mockery of the President's visit to New York last week, \nto the United Nations. He has called on the United Nations to act. Now \nit is time to give them an opportunity to act. We should respond \naccordingly. If it is successful, if we can bring Iraq under control \nthrough this fashion, without a war, without the loss of innocent life, \nthen thank goodness we can consider that alternative, and we should \npursue it. If not, of course, there is another day for us to consider \nthe options that may be at our disposal.\n  That is the issue of national security. I have to tell you, as I \ntravel around the State of Illinois, there are people who want to talk \nabout other issues of security; for example, health care security.\n  The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Michigan, has been a leader \non the issue of prescription drugs. As I go about the State of \nIllinois, people are interested in Iraq, but I still run into people, \nsenior citizens in particular but ordinary families as well, who talk \nabout the fact that they cannot afford to buy the prescriptions they \nneed to keep themselves and their children healthy. I don't see the \nkind of fervor and desire coming out of the Republican side when it \ncomes to health care security as there is for national security.\n  When it comes to health care security, the cost of health insurance, \nI went yesterday to speak to the Illinois State Chamber of Commerce. \nThe members who were gathered there of the major corporations in \nIllinois agree with the major unions in Illinois that the cost of \nhealth insurance is bankrupting our system. Businesses cannot afford to \nbuy insurance for the owners of the business, let alone for the \nemployees. The premiums go up 25, 35 percent a year. Labor unions are \nseeing every increasing dollar amount on an hourly basis eaten up \ncompletely by the cost of health insurance increases.\n  Have we heard a word from this administration about health care \nsecurity, about the cost of health insurance? Of course not.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I also heard the Senator from North Dakota speak this \nmorning. It appears that I am hearing the fact that we can talk about \nIraq and, at the same time, we can deal with some of these economic \nissues with this staggering economy. Is that what the Senator is \nsaying?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly right. I say this to the people at the \nWhite House who make up the schedule: Can you give us 4 hours a week on \nthe economy? Pick the 4 hours and let's talk about it in realistic \nterms. Let's talk about health security 1 hour a week. Can we do that? \nCan the White House find time in the busy schedule of dealing with \nnational security and making campaign trips to raise money for \ncandidates to give us 1 hour a week to talk about health care? I don't \nthink that is too much to ask. And I think Congress ought to \nreciprocate. We ought to be answering in terms of what we can do to try \nto lift the burden, whether it is the cost of prescription drugs or the \ncost of health insurance for businesses and families across America.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator served in the House of Representatives. Is the \nSenator aware that this administration--a Republican administration--\nhas significant control and direction that it can give to the House of \nRepresentatives, which is led by the Republicans?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Absolutely. The Speaker of the House almost has \nunilateral power to set the business for the House, now controlled by \nthe President's party.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator acknowledge that the House basically has \nbeen doing nothing? We have appropriations bills that we are waiting \nfor them to do. I have not heard the President say one word about the \ninaction of the House. Has the Senator?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have not. The Senator is aware of the fact that we have \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights that has gone nowhere in conference with \nthe House and Senate, and there are issues we have tried to raise time \nand again--energy, for example--and all of these things have died in \nconference.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator also acknowledge that this bill, which is \nvery important to constituencies all over America, on terrorism \ninsurance--and the President went to Pennsylvania a couple weeks ago \nand said: I am for hardhats, not for trial lawyers. Does the Senator \nrealize that is lost because the Republican House will not let us even \nhold a meeting on this bill?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am aware of that. I say to the Senator from Nevada that \nI heard from not only businesses and developers and unions but from \nordinary people about terrorism insurance. There is a fear--legitimate \nfear--if we don't pass something soon, it is going to have a dramatic \nnegative impact on employment.\n  We are already losing jobs. That is another issue the White House \nwon't discuss. I have talked about national security and health care \nsecurity. There is an income security thing, as well--not only the loss \nof jobs in this country but terrorism insurance plays right into this. \nWhat is the President doing? What is Congress doing? Can the President \ngive us 1 hour a week on the economy, 1 hour a week on income security, \nto talk about what we can do to increase the number of jobs? A meeting \nin Waco, TX, in August for a day is not enough. It takes a bipartisan, \nhonest effort and to engage the Congress in doing something. Let's pass \nthe terrorism bill. Let's have the President call on Democrats and \nRepublicans to get it done this week. We should do it this week. If we \ndo not, we are not meeting our responsibility.\n\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will further yield, the Senator is aware \nthat the newspapers in Washington indicate that the President has been \nin Iowa, over the period of a year, I think 11 times. The Senator is \naware that Iowa is where the first primary is held. The Senator from \nIllinois is aware that Iowa is where there are close elections.\n  I would like the Senator to respond, isn't it necessary that the \nPresident be more engaged in what is going on in domestic issues rather \nthan politicking around the country?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is the very point I am making. I concede that the \nPresident is the leader of his party, and every President has spent \ntime trying to help his party and its candidates. I\n\n[[Page S8630]]\n\ndon't begrudge any President doing that as we come close to an \nelection. As I travel in my State, the people are more focused on the \nproblems that families are running into when it comes to the basic \nnecessities of life than on the next election. They are hoping this \nPresident and all candidates will address issues as basic as income \nsecurity, health care security, and, may I add, pension security.\n  This is something that has become a devastating issue for families in \nIllinois. Former steelworkers worked a lifetime and paid in \nreligiously, week after week, month after month, year after year, with \nthe promise that when they retired, they would have a pension and \nhealth care. They now find themselves high and dry with bankrupt \ncompanies. I haven't heard a word from the administration about pension \nsecurity. This really hits a lot of people close to home.\n  I grew up in an area in Illinois that had a lot of steel mills. I \nused to apply there for jobs in the summer and hope that I could get \none of those great-paying jobs. I have gone to meet with displaced \nsteelworkers. I see tough men, muscular people, who worked hard their \nwhole lives, who just don't take much foolishness at all, break down \nand cry in front of me because at age 59 they have lost all their \nhealth insurance protection. These are retirees who really followed the \nrules and did what they were supposed to do in America. Can we ask the \nPresident for 1 hour a week to talk about pension security--Just 1 \nhour? I think that would be an indication the President is listening to \nthe people across America in terms of the economic issues.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. It has been discussed on the floor that we have held up in \nthe other body, which has the ability to move very quickly, terrorism \ninsurance, Patients' Bill of Rights, election reform, energy policies \nfor this country, bankruptcy reform. So we know things are held up \nthere.\n  Now, I say to my friend from Illinois, I am kind of a hawk. I was the \nfirst Democrat to support President Bush when he wanted to go into Iraq \nthe first time. I consider myself a hawk rather than a dove. I am \nlooking very closely at Iraq and I think we need to do that. But in \ndoing that, is the Senator aware that Lawrence Lindsey, the President's \nchief economic adviser, indicated in the Wall Street Journal yesterday \nthat the war in Iraq will cost this country about $200 billion? Is the \nSenator also aware that I had a conversation with the chief executive \nofficers of the airlines last Thursday in my office? The first thing \nthe spokesperson, the chief executive officer of one of the largest \nairlines in the world, told me was: If there is a war in Iraq, we all \ngo broke.\n\n  That was told to me in my office last week: If there is a war in \nIraq, we all go broke, all the major airlines in America.\n  So the Senator is aware we not only need to focus on Iraq--the \nmilitary aspects of it--but also what it does to the domestic policy, \nwhich the President is ignoring. Is the Senator aware we need to also \nconsider that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is a very important point, not to mention the most \nbasic concern, of course. If we go to war, lives of Americans will be \nlost. Innocent people will die. War should be the last decision we \nmake, the last option we take. Thank goodness, we now have movement \nthrough the United Nations. I am asking that the President and the \nWhite House, now that progress is being made, spend some small portion \nof their time focusing on the economic issues the Senator from Nevada \nraises. I have talked about health care security, income security, \npension security. I will add a fourth one--Social Security.\n  We realize the President's tax package of last year is going to take \n$2 trillion out of the Social Security trust fund over the next 10 \nyears--$2 trillion--with no promise to repay any of it at a time when \nthe baby boomers, by the millions, will start arriving and asking for \nSocial Security. Social Security is our contract with America--our real \ncontract--the one that comes from the heart. We have had it since the \ndays of Franklin Roosevelt. Is it too much to ask this administration \nto give us an hour a week to focus on Social Security and its future, \nand Medicare, talk about the reimbursement for health care for senior \ncitizens and hospitals and providers across America? These are real \nissues. I certainly have hospitals in rural areas and hospitals in the \ninner city struggling to survive at this point in time.\n  When you talk about the issues on which we should be focusing, \nnational security is important, and I think it ought to be No. 1 on the \nagenda; but, for goodness' sake, don't ignore the rest of America and \nthe lives we have to lead and the impact that our failure to act is \ngoing to have. That is why I look at 7 weeks before the next election \nand say to the President and the White House: Give us an hour a week at \nleast to talk about the economy in this country, about the need to \nbreathe life back into this economy.\n  It is only 2 years ago we were doing so well. We had all of this \naccumulation of wealth. People saw their retirement plans growing. They \nwere making plans to leave their jobs early and enjoy a comfortable \nlife with their families.\n  People were seeing their stock portfolios improving to the point \nwhere they were considering options. They knew they had money to send \ntheir kids to college. Now look what we are up against, and not a word \nfrom the White House. One little meeting in Waco, TX, does not make \neconomic policy for America.\n  Where is this administration? Where is this President? Where is the \neconomic leadership this country needs?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Las Vegas, Clark County, has the sixth largest school \ndistrict in America. About 250,000 students go to school in the Las \nVegas area in one school district. Chicago, I am sure, is larger than \nthat; is that not true?\n  (Mr. CARPER assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is true.\n  Mr. REID. Has the Senator heard coming from the White House during \nthe past 2 months, 3 months, a single word about education?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, I have not. I say to the Senator from Nevada, he \njoined me and Democrats and Republicans in passing the No Child Left \nBehind legislation the President asked for to put more resources in \neducation. The Senator from Nevada is just as aware as I am that when \nthe President's budget came up, he did not fund his own programs. He \ndid not put the money into the schools as he promised.\n  As I go across my State--and I bet the State of Nevada is in the same \nsituation--we have seen a downturn in State revenues, cutbacks in State \nbudgets, schools are suffering. They are saying: Where is that Federal \nmoney President Bush promised us? It is not there, and this \nadministration does not want to talk about that. They do not want to \ntalk about education security for this country. They want to talk only \nabout national security. They do not want to talk about income \nsecurity, pension security, health care security, Social Security, or \ndoing something to make our schools more secure.\n  One has to ask oneself: Is that as good as it gets? Is that the best \nwe can hope for from this White House, to focus exclusively on Iraq and \nthe Middle East? I think it is a mistake.\n  We have made progress. I tip my hat to the President. Let's use the \nUnited Nations. Let's bring Saddam Hussein under control, but for \ngoodness' sake, let's get our economy under control, too. It is really \nout of hand. People across the country--families, small businesses, \nfamily farmers--are suffering as a result.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my friend from Illinois yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Having had the opportunity to preside and listen to the \ndiscussion, I thank him for putting into perspective what our challenge \nis, not only on the national security front; I thank him for focusing \non the fact we are together and stand for safety and security, but also \nthe fact we need to be focused on our economic security as well.\n  Mr. President, I wonder, also, if the Senator might add to his list--\nI know he is aware of the fact we have passed a very important \nprescription drug bill. We had two focuses in the Senate: One, to add \nMedicare coverage and, two, to lower prices for everyone.\n  The point the Senator from Illinois made this morning about the high\n\n[[Page S8631]]\n\nprice of health care for businesses, for our farmers, for everybody is \nalso very much a part of what we passed to lower prices by getting more \ncompetition with generic drugs, opening the border to Canada to bring \nlower prices, giving States more flexibility.\n\n  I wonder if the Senator will comment on the fact that the Senate has \npassed this very important bill, sent it to the House, and it has \nreceived no action this fall. We have nothing yet in committee. We have \nnot seen the President speaking out about the fact we passed a bill \nthat will actually lower prices, bring more competition, address the \nfact that our seniors and our families are having to struggle right \nnow--in fact, right now, as we are here, there are people who are \nwatching C-SPAN 2 saying: Do I eat today or buy my medicine?\n  We had a bill which passed the Senate. We would greatly appreciate \nthe President's leadership in encouraging the House of Representatives \nto pass this bill this fall. We could dramatically lower prices \nimmediately with the passage of that bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Michigan, first, let me \nacknowledge--and I am sure my colleagues know as well--Senator Stabenow \nhas been a leader on the issue of prescription drugs. She has been \ntenacious. Thank goodness she has been. She took a bus trip to Canada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority leader has expired. \nTwenty-eight minutes remain on the other side.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that until someone \ncomes from the other side, we be allowed to use that time. The minute \nsomeone's head pops in that door, we will quit. In the meantime, there \nseems to be no need to have the Senate voiceless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  The point the Senator from Michigan makes is an important one. We did \npass a prescription drug bill. It was not what we wanted. We wanted a \nvoluntary program under Medicare which would be universal and available \nfor all Americans so they could get the benefits of Medicare when it \ncame to prescription drugs.\n  We could not convince our Republican friends to go along with us on \nthat, but we did pass a bill in terms of generic drugs to reduce costs \nfor all families across America, to let States come up with their own \nplans so they could find ways to reduce costs for all the citizens in \ntheir State, as well as the safe reimportation of drugs from countries \nthat have much lower costs. Those are three good issues, but do not \nforget the fourth.\n  Senator Rockefeller's amendment provides that $6 billion, on an \nemergency basis, will be given for Medicaid to States facing high \nunemployment. These States have cut back in reimbursements to providers \nand hospitals. My State is one of them--I bet the State of Michigan is \ntoo--and that $6 billion would come back to the States right now. It \nwould help them keep hospitals open and provide basic health care.\n  We cannot get the House of Representatives to consider that \nlegislation. Now they are talking about dropping everything and coming \nup with a resolution on Iraq. Why is it they can drop everything for a \nresolution on Iraq, but cannot drop everything, when it comes to \nprescription drugs, to move the issue forward?\n  Our bill is there. It is pending. It would be a help to all families \nacross America, not just the families of senior citizens.\n  I say to the Senator from Michigan, we have to keep reminding the \nPresident and the Republican leadership that there are many issues in \nthis country, not the least of which is good quality health care for \neveryone.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator yields, may I ask one \nmore question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. What the Senator said is we can focus on Iraq and that \nthere are many issues the President can help us on: Getting \nappropriations bills passed in the House would help us; doing something \non election reform--we had another debacle in Florida 2 years after the \noriginal debacle; we passed a bill and are waiting to get that out of \nconference. We have the energy bill we need to get out of conference \nwith the House. There is terrorism insurance, bankruptcy--am I missing \nanything?--generic drugs. That is one issue about which the Senator \nfrom Illinois and I did not talk.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. REID. Patients' Bill of Rights. There are so many issues with \nwhich we need to deal in the Congress that the President can help us \nwith if we were not on the one track of Iraq.\n  It seems to me--and one can read about this in the editorial pages \nevery day--that the President could be doing this to divert attention \nfrom these domestic issues. Has the Senator read some of those \ncomments, I say to my friend from Illinois?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have read the speculation. I do not buy it. I do not \nbelieve it, but the point I am trying to make in the course of this--\nand I think we all are--is that the President has made progress. The \nUnited Nations is moving forward. Inspections are going to be ordered. \nSaddam Hussein has agreed to them. That is real progress. I salute the \nPresident for that progress.\n  What I am now saying is, let's focus on America and some of the \nthings we need to do to win the economic war in this country. I am \nasking for a very small pledge of time from the White House to focus on \nthese economic issues that face our country. We can do both. The United \nStates can defend itself, fight a war on terrorism, keep a watchful eye \non Iraq and still be worried about the issues that American families in \nNevada, Illinois, and Delaware think about every day: What about my \njob? What about my pension? How am I going to pay for that health \ninsurance? Can we pay for these prescription drugs? Is Social Security \nreally in good shape for years to come?\n  These are real gut-wrenching issues for real families. I think it is \na responsibility of the White House to get beyond the agenda they have \nfocused on for the last several weeks and open it up to new issues and \nnew concerns that are universal across America.\n  We talked about education. Kids are back in school, and there is a \nlot of concern about whether our schools have the quality teachers they \nneed, whether the kids are going to get the education they deserve. We \nhave to put money back in education. We have to focus on making certain \nwe have afterschool programs for kids who need a special helping hand, \nsmaller class sizes--something we pushed for in the past--make sure \nteachers are paid as the professionals they are. These are real needs.\n  When we talk about filling real needs, I do not want to overlook in \nhealth care a shortage in nursing. I would like the White House to give \nus 15 minutes this week or next week with an idea for the agenda of \nhaving more nurses in America. This is a serious shortcoming in health \ncare in the United States. Hospitals have reduced their number of beds; \nnursing and convalescent homes, the same, for one simple reason: There \nare not enough nurses.\n\n  We need an initiative, a national leadership. I hope the President \nwill not ignore this. When you listen to the agenda we could be \nconsidering, it is substantial, but it gets to the heart of the real \nissues about which Americans are concerned. I sincerely hope we move on \nthat and move on it quickly. We owe it to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8631-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8631-S8632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DOING THE SENATE'S WORK\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know Senators are just getting back \ninto town from the Jewish holiday yesterday. And I hope we can make the \nmost of this week. We have a lot to do, on the Interior appropriations \nbill as well as on the issue of homeland security.\n\n[[Page S8632]]\n\n  As our colleagues are aware, this afternoon we will have a cloture \nvote on the Byrd amendment. I reluctantly filed that cloture vote last \nweek because we are now in the third week of debate on the Interior \nappropriations bill as well as on homeland security. With all of the \nwork that must be done and with all of the issues we must address, we \nsimply cannot prolong this debate indefinitely.\n  Seventy-nine Senators a couple of weeks ago voted for an amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Montana, myself, and others \nresponding to the crisis we now face in drought-stricken parts of the \ncountry. The regions of the country which are experiencing drought are \ngrowing--the Southeast, the Midwest, and the far West--areas throughout \nthe country that have experienced drought conditions, and in some cases \nit is unprecedented.\n  We also have a very serious situation with regard to firefighting, so \nserious that this administration changed its position from one which \nsaid we will not provide any new resources for firefighting--that all \nfirefighting moneys that ought to be dedicated to firefighting this \nfall be taken from the Forest Service budget. They changed from that \nposition to say, we now recognize how serious this situation is, and we \nwill commit $850 million and ask the Congress to support it.\n  You have two very important priorities in dealing with disaster and \ncrisis: One with the Forest Service and firefighting needs. This is \nurgent. This is extraordinarily important to the ongoing effort to \nfight fires throughout the country, especially again in the West. And, \nsecond, as I noted, the drought.\n\n  We have voted for this legislation. We have gone on record on a \nbipartisan basis in support of this legislation. I know there are those \nwho still would like to work out other compromises relating to other \nissues, and if that can be done, I certainly will welcome it.\n  But we simply cannot go on week after week after week without more \nnotable progress, without more of a tangible way with which to address \nthese needs, and, secondly, without a way to recognize that we have a \nlot of work to do in a very short period of time. We have what amounts \nto about 15 legislative days left prior to the time we adjourn for the \nyear. I am troubled, to say the least, by the extraordinary list of \nitems that have to be addressed and the very minimal amount of time \nlegislatively we have to address them.\n  I come to the floor this morning urging colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to recognize the need, to recognize the urgency, to recognize \nthe shortness of legislative time available, and to recognize how \nimportant it is that we move on to accomplish as much as we possibly \ncan in a very short period of time.\n  I can only hope we will get a good vote this afternoon--I would like \nit to be unanimous--on cloture, so at least on this particular \namendment we have the opportunity to move on to other issues, and \nhopefully to a time for final passage on the Interior appropriations \nbill.\n  I will have more to say about homeland security later on in the day, \nbut I must say, this is something that just begs our support, \nrecognizing the prioritization it deserves as we consider the schedule \nand the need that is so clearly a recognition around the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the majority leader makes a very good \npoint. I am struck by what we are debating off the floor, which is \ntimber health. At the heart of that is how we deal with judicial \nappeals, which has brought a new dynamic to that debate on forest \nhealth and how we manage our public lands; that is, not a denial of \njudicial appeals, but also in the area of timber restraining orders.\n  People can file appeals--we do not want to deny that--but also how we \ndeal with the decision-rendering process, which does cause some concern \nwith folks using timber restraining orders as a tool in the process to \nget their way. Basically, that is what we have here.\n  We are on a time line, if we go off this. Those who do not want to \nsee anything move press us into a time line, and then we go on home \nknowing there is a timeframe on that debate.\n  Given the time we have and the leader's decision to double-track \nthese two issues in order to facilitate and deal with these issues in a \nshort time line, we have to take a look at that. I know the leader is. \nI congratulate him for his push on this and to make it a reality. But \nso far, it hasn't come to be and does not get us to where I think we \nwant to be before we go home in October. We want to move forward as \nfast as we can.\n  But also there is lingering debate out there that a lot of folks are \nconcerned about--especially on our forests. I want to bolster the \nleader's contention that drought relief and disaster relief in farm and \nranch country are still with us. Just on Sunday past--here we are in \nthe middle of September with football in the air--it was 92 degrees in \nBillings, MT. The Yellowstone River is as low as I have ever seen it. \nAbove the Bighorn River where it spills into the Yellowstone, you can \nwalk across that river just about anywhere and not get your knees wet. \nWe still have that concern.\n  The leader is right. It passed this body overwhelmingly. It should be \nallowed to move forward with the apparatus in front of us in which to \nget that relief out to our people who are suffering at this time. I \nappreciate his leadership on that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8632-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to speak directly to the issues \nraised both by the majority leader and the Senator from Montana; \nspecifically, with respect to how we are going to resolve issues \nrelated to the health of our forests.\n  I know the discussion has greatly focused on fires and the \ncatastrophic results of fires this year. I am going to talk about that \nto a great extent. But I would like to make a point at the very \nbeginning which I hope we don't lose sight of; that is, fire is merely \none component of the problem we have to deal with. What we are really \ntalking about is the health of our forests, both for the protection of \npeople from catastrophic wildfires and also for the ecological benefits \nthat a healthy forest provides. It provides wonderful recreation for \nour citizens. It provides habitat for all of the flora and fauna we not \nonly like to visit and like to see but to understand that it is very \nimportant for ecological balance in our country. It protects endangered \nspecies. It provides a home for all of the other fish, insects, birds, \nmammals, and reptiles we would like to protect, whether they are \nendangered or not.\n  In order to have this kind of healthy forest, we have come to a \nconclusion, I think pretty much unanimously in this country, that we \nare going to have to manage the forest differently than we have in the \npast.\n  What the debate is all about is how the Congress is going to respond \nto this emergency, not just from the catastrophic wildfires but from \nthe other\n\n[[Page S8633]]\n\ndevastation of our forests that has created such an unhealthy condition \nthat it literally threatens the health of probably somewhere between 30 \nand 70 million acres of forest land in the United States.\n  The administration has come forth with a far-reaching proposal that \nwill begin to enable us to treat these forests in a sensible way. We \nhave legislation pending before us--an amendment by the Senator from \nIdaho--that was put in place as a means of being able to discuss this. \nAnd we have been trying, over the course of the last week or so, to \nnegotiate among ourselves in the Senate to be able to come to some \nconclusion about what amendment it might be possible to adopt as part \nof the Interior appropriations bill so that it will be easier for us to \ngo in and manage these forests.\n  I am sad to say that so far our efforts at negotiation have not borne \nfruit. I think, therefore, it is necessary today to begin to recognize \nthat unless we are able to reach agreement pretty soon, we are going to \nhave to press forward with the kind of management approach that I \nbelieve will enable us to create healthy forests again.\n  Let me go back over some of the ground that has been discussed but \nperhaps put a little different face on it in talking about my own State \nof Arizona.\n  Some people may not think of the State of Arizona as containing \nforests. They may think of it as a desert State. The reality is, a \ngreat deal of my State is covered with some of the most beautiful \nforests in the entire United States--the entire world, for that matter. \nWe have the largest Ponderosa pine forest in the United States. \nPonderosa pines are enormous, beautiful trees, with yellowing bark. It \nis not uncommon at all for them to have a girth of 24 inches and above \nin a healthy forest. They are a little bit like if you want to think of \nthe sequoia trees in California--not quite as big but coming close to \nthat kind of magnificent tree.\n  One hundred years ago, the ponderosa pine forests in Arizona were \nhealthy. These trees were huge. They were beautiful. There were not \nvery many per acre; and that, frankly, was what enabled them to grow so \nwell. They were not competing with a lot of small underbrush or small \ntrees for the nutrients in the soil, the Sun, the water, which is \nrelatively scarce in Arizona, and they grew to magnificent heights.\n  Several things happened to begin to change the circumstances. First \nof all, loggers came in and, seeing an opportunity, cut a lot of these \nmagnificent trees. Secondly, grazing came in, and all of the grasses \nthat grew because of the meadow-like conditions in which this forest \nexisted were nibbled right down to the base in some cases. A lot of \nsmall trees, therefore, began to crop up and crowd out the grasses, and \npretty soon there was not any grass. There was simply a dense \nundergrowth of little trees that began to crowd out what was left of \nthe bigger trees, as well.\n  Then came the fires because these little trees were so prone to \nburning. It is a dry climate. They are crowded together. Instead of \nhaving maybe 200 trees per acre, for example, you might have 2,000 \ntrees per acre or more. But they are all little, tiny diameter trees \nthat are very susceptible to fire. And the big trees that are left, of \ncourse, are susceptible to fire as well because when the lightning \nstrikes, it sets the small trees on fire, which then quickly crown up \nto the larger trees, creating a ladder effect, going right on up to the \ntop of the very biggest trees. It explodes in fire, as you have seen on \ntelevision. That kind of environment is what we are faced with today.\n\n  The old growth has come back. We have some magnificent, big trees, \nbut they are being crowded out by all of these very small-diameter \ntrees and other brush and other fuel that has accumulated on the forest \nfloor. So what happens when there is a fire--whether man set or \nlightning created--is that the fuel begins to burn. It burns quickly \njust like a Christmas tree, if you can imagine, if you have ever seen a \nChristmas tree burn. It quickly burns the smaller trees and underbrush, \nand then catches the branches, the lower branches of the bigger trees, \nand then crowns out, and then you have a big fire.\n  What is the result of the big fires in Arizona this year?\n  First of all, we can talk about the size of the fires. We can talk \nabout the size of the Rodeo-Chediski fire in Arizona. It was about 60 \npercent the size of Rhode Island. This is simply one fire. You can see \nfrom this map the size of the Rodeo-Chediski fire. Here is the size of \nthe State of Rhode Island. If you add in other fires that have occurred \nin Arizona this year, you have a size that exceeds the size of Rhode \nIsland. That is in my State. That is how much has burned in my State--\nabout 622,000 acres in this fire alone.\n  Let me show you what it looks like after that burn. And I have been \nthere. I have walked it. I have driven through it. I have seen it from \nthe air by helicopter. It is a devastating sight. Here it is, as shown \nin this photograph.\n  The ground is gray. It burned so hot that it created a silicone-like \nglaze over the soil. And, of course, it just absolutely takes all the \npine needles and branches off the trees, so all you have are these \nsticks left standing. Some of these, by the way, are pretty good size \ntrees. And there is salvageable timber in here if we are permitted to \ngo in and do that salvaging.\n  But because of the glaze over the soil, the report from the experts \nin the field is that when the rains finally began to come, it did not \nsoak into the soil; it ran off. And what you now find throughout the \ncentral and eastern part of Arizona is massive mud flow into the \nstreams. It kills the fish. It makes the water unpalatable. It \ndevastates the free flow of the water, so it creates new channels and \nerodes the soil. It goes around bridges, and there is one bridge that \nwas very much in danger.\n  It flows into the largest lake in the State, Lake Roosevelt. And \nRoosevelt Lake is the biggest surface water source of water for the \ncity of Phoenix and the other valley cities. There has been great \nconcern that mud flow will affect the water quality and the water \ntaste, as well as damaging the environment for the aquatic life in the \nlake and in the other streams.\n  There are some other sad things about this fire. Just to mention some \nof the devastation, the total of this fire was about 468,000 acres \nburned. The total in Arizona is about 622,000 acres. The structures \nburned in Arizona were about 423, the majority of which were homes and \nsome commercial structures.\n  In the United States, this year alone, we have lost 21 lives as a \nresult of the wildfires, and over 3,000 structures. The impacts on our \nforests in Arizona, the old growth trees will take 300 to 400 years to \nregenerate--300 to 400 years. To have a tree of any good size takes at \nleast 100, 150 years.\n  We have endangered species in our forests, the Mexican spotted owl, \nfor example. The fire burned through 20 of their protected active \ncenters. So I think those who claim to be environmentalists, who want \nto protect a forest by keeping everybody out of it, and rendering it \nsubject to this kind of wildfire have a lot of explaining to do when 20 \nof these protected centers for the Mexican spotted owls were ruined, \ndevastated, burned up in this fire. The recovery time for this habitat \nis 300 to 400 years as well.\n\n  Twenty-five goshawk areas--this is another one of our protected \nspecies--and postfledging areas were impacted or destroyed. Wildlife \nmortalities--and these are just those that were actually documented--46 \nelks, 2 bears, and 1 bear cub, and, of course, countless other small \ncritters.\n  I think it is interesting that air quality is something that is \nfrequently overlooked when you think of these fires. I was up there. I \nknow because I had to breathe it. But just one interesting statistic is \nthat the greenhouse gases from the Rodeo fire emitted during 1 day--\njust 1 day of the fire; and this thing burned for 2 to 3 weeks in a big \nway, and then longer than that in a smaller way--but 1 day's emissions \nof greenhouse gases from the Rodeo fire surpassed all of the carbon \ndioxide emissions of all passenger cars operating in the United States \non that same day.\n  So if we are really concerned about greenhouse gases, just stop and \nthink, all of the emissions from all of the cars in the United States \ndid not equal 1 day's worth of emissions from this one fire. Of course, \nthere were a lot of other fires burning in the country as well.\n\n[[Page S8634]]\n\n  Let me try to put this in perspective in terms of the amount of area \nof Arizona that is subject to this kind of fire.\n  We have about 4 million acres of forest in Arizona that is classified \nas condition 3. That is about one-third of all the forests in Arizona. \nCondition 3 is the area that is in the most danger of catastrophic \nwildfire. Here is a State map of Arizona. And the area in yellow is \npretty much the forested area of our State, with the area depicted in \nred the class 3 area.\n  So you can see that a great deal of our ponderosa pine forest here is \nin very dire condition and needs to be treated as soon as possible.\n  The Grand Canyon is right here. You can see on the north rim, there \nare significant areas that need to be treated. Over here, near the \nNavaho Indian Reservation, there are areas that need to be treated. \nFlagstaff is here; you can see the mountains that rise over 12,000 feet \njust north of Flagstaff. Those areas are very much in danger. You have \nthe Prescott National Forest, Coconino National Forest, the Tonto \nNational Forest. The Apache Indian Reservation is probably the largest. \nThis area is the watershed for Phoenix, the Gila River and its \ntributaries. It provides a great deal of the surface water for the city \nof Phoenix and surrounding areas.\n  These are beautiful mountain areas with a base elevation of over \n7,000 feet. This area over here is 9,000 feet. The mountains rise over \n11,000 feet, covered with ponderosa pines, spruce, fir, aspen, and \nothers trees. All of this area is in grave danger of beetle kill \ndisease, mistletoe, wildfire, and being weakened and dying from \ninsufficient nutrients and water because of the condition of the \nforest.\n  It is a very matted, tightly packed forest with all of the little \ndiameter trees literally squeezing out the big trees that we all want \nto save. It is called a dog hair thicket. It is so thick that a dog \ncan't even run through it without leaving some of his hair behind.\n  Let me show you an example of what the forest used to look like and \nhow it looks today. On the top you see a photograph of 1909. You can \nsee these beautiful big ponderosa pine trees. There are some smaller \nones back here. You have different age growths, and that is the way you \nlike to have a forest so as the big ones grow older and die, there are \nothers to take their place. You see a great deal of grass, sunshine, \nopen space. You can imagine this is a very healthy forest because you \ndon't have too much competition for what the trees need to grow. It is \nalso a wonderful environment for elk and deer and butterflies and \nbirds. It is open. You have plenty of grass for forage and so on.\n  This is the same area in the year 1992. This is the way much of our \nforests look today--absolutely dense, crowded. I am not sure if the \nchart is observable here, but you can see that the forest is now very \ncrowded. Here you have beautiful, large ponderosa pines, a couple more \nback here, but they are being squeezed out by all of the smaller \ndiameter trees.\n  What we are talking about in management is not cutting the big trees, \nnot logging the forest. We are talking about taking out the bulk of \nthese smaller diameter trees that are not doing anybody or anything any \ngood and are clogging up the forests, preventing the grass from \ngrowing. They are ruining the habitat for other animals and creating \nconditions for insects, disease, and catastrophic wildfire.\n  For those who say we don't want to go back to logging, nobody is \ntalking about that. We are talking about saving these big trees, not \ncutting them down.\n  The problem is, a lot of the environmental community is in total \nconcert with this general management. But you have a very loud, \nactivist, radical minority that is so afraid commercial businesses will \nwant to cut large trees, that they want to destroy any commercial \nindustry. In the State of Arizona, there is essentially no logging \nindustry left. We have two very small mills, and the Apache Indian \nReservation has two mills. The Apache Reservation I will get to in a \nmoment because that is where the Rodeo-Chediski fire occurred.\n  What we are talking about here is having well-designed projects, \nafter consultation with all of the so-called stakeholders, with the \nForest Service having gone through all of the environmental planning \nand designating projects, stewardship projects with enhanced value so \nthat they can go to these commercial businesses and say: Can you go \ninto this forest and clean all of this out and make it look like this? \nWhatever you take out of here that we mark for you to be able to take \nout, you can sell that. You can turn it into chipboard, fiberboard. You \ncan turn it into biodegradable products for burning and creating \nelectricity. You can perhaps take some of the medium-size trees and get \nsome boards out of them, maybe some two-by-fours. Can you make enough \nof a profit to do this for us because there is not enough money for us \nto appropriate to treat 30 or 40 or 50 million acres?\n\n  We are talking about a lot of money we simply don't have. You have to \nrely upon the commercial businesses to do that. Some of the radicals \nare so concerned that when they are doing this job for us, they will \nsay: We don't have anything more to do; we want to take the big trees. \nAnd they are concerned that we won't have the ability to tell them no. \nTherefore, they are going to prevent us from cleaning up the forest for \nmaking it healthy again. They will create a condition that results in \nthe catastrophic wildfires I was talking about; in effect, cutting off \nour nose to spite our face.\n  We are not going to do what everybody recognizes needs to be done \nbecause maybe when that is all done, 40 years from now, somebody will \nsay: We want to go after the big trees.\n  Does anybody believe the political environment in that setting is \ngoing to permit us to do that? None of us are going to agree to that. I \ndon't agree to it today.\n  Let me tell you a story. Former Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt \nis a very strong supporter of what we are talking about. An area he \nused to hike in when he was young is called the Mt. Trumbull area on \nthe north rim of the Grand Canyon north of Flagstaff. As Secretary of \nInterior, being BLM land under the jurisdiction of the Department of \nInterior, he was able to do the rules and regulations that enabled us \nto go in and do the clearing. So they hired a couple of brothers that \nhad a small business. They brought some pieces of equipment down from \nOregon. One of them was a very small caterpillar thing that could snip \nall these small diameter trees. They cleaned out a fairly good size \narea. They made enough money to be in business, and isn't that fine. \nWhat they left was a forest that looked more like this.\n  I remember one tree that a BLM person there said: I have to show you \nthis. Here was a tree that looked like a big California sequoia. It was \na big ponderosa pine. The boughs came all the way down to the ground. \nAnd all around it were these small dog hair thicket kind of trees and \nbrush. He said: We have to get them to clean this out because this tree \nis very much in danger of burning. If any spark comes within a mile or \nso, it will just climb up this ladder.\n  That beautiful tree, that was maybe 200 or 300, 400 years old, is \ngoing to go up in flames. That is the kind of tree we are trying to \nprotect. For those who say we want to somehow do logging and so on, I \nsimply say they are wrong; we are not. This is what we are trying to \ncreate, not this.\n  Let's go on to talk about some of the other aspects. In Arizona, \nthere were about 4 million acres classified as condition 3, meaning \nmost subject to catastrophic wildfire. Nationally, there are just under \n75 million such class 3 acres. Out of this, the Forest Service \nidentifies about 24 million as the highest risk of catastrophic fires. \nAnd this definition means they are so degraded that they require \nmechanical thinning before fire can be safely reintroduced.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, we have a very short \nperiod of time in which to treat these acres. According to a 1999 \nstudy, the GAO says we have 10 to 25 years to treat this 30 plus \nmillion acres of class 3 land if we are to prevent unstoppable fires.\n  This shows you what can be done when you treat the acres. This is \nfull restoration, meaning we have gone in and cut out quite a few of \nthe small diameter trees leaving relatively few, mostly larger trees \nper acre. This is exactly what this particular acre had on it when the \ncutting and thinning had\n\n[[Page S8635]]\n\nbeen done, going in and cutting out the small diameter trees.\n  In Arizona you can introduce fire in prescribed burns during the \nmonth of October and November because it is cooler. It is moist, and \nthe fires are not going to get out of control. Fire was introduced here \nin this area in October, the wet month, and you can see that it is \nburning along the ground, burning the fuel that has accumulated on the \nground. It is not going to go through this tree here or these trees \nhere. It may burn some of the smaller trees, but what is going to be \nleft is a nice environment in which you have grasses that can crop up \nthe next spring and reintroduce a lot of species and habit and protect, \nas well, from fire.\n  If lightning were to strike one of these trees and start a fire, it \nwould return along the ground like this. In the hot summer months, once \nit has been treated, it is likely, with all of the fuel having burned \noff the previous winter, the fire will move around the ground and it \nwill not crown out to a higher degree of fire.\n  The reason you cannot treat these forests with fire alone, and you \nhave to mechanically thin and cut out some of the underbrush first, is \ndemonstrated by the next chart. This shows you what happened when we \nleft this many trees per acre. This shows you when you do minimal \nthinning. They didn't do very much thinning, and they reintroduced \nfire, and you can see this fire is starting to climb the trunks of \nthese trees and is going to crown out. You see it coming up along the \ntop of this tree. It is going to catch the crowns of a lot of these \nlarger trees. They are at great risk of burning and a fire starting. \nThis is during the wet month of October when you have a lot of \nmoisture. If you don't take out very many trees, a la this particular \ntreatment here, minimal thinning, and you introduce fire, you are going \nto have a risk of fire in the hot months. It is going to be a very \ngrave risk.\n  Let's turn to the third chart, which shows what happens when you \ndon't do anything at all, you only burn. This demonstrates why you have \nto do thinning first. No thinning was done on this particular acre. \nThis is during the cool, wet month of October in Arizona. They \nintroduced fire, and look at what happened. It got out of control and \ncreated a crown fire. This is the beginning of what the Rodeo-Chediski \nfire looked like.\n  So it is too late in much of our forests to introduce prescribed \nburning. It will go out of control. You have to go in, as I said, and \nthin it out first and then, that fall, you set a prescribed burn and \nyou burn all of the fuel on the ground. Thereafter, the grasses grow \nand everything regenerates and you have a very nice environment.\n  There is another myth. I talked about cutting old-growth trees. When \npeople talk about saving old growth, we need to be careful because the \nreality is that a lot of old-growth trees, particularly in Arizona, are \nnot big trees at all. They are not the ones you necessarily want to \nsave. If you have been on the California coast, perhaps you have seen \ntrees over a thousand years old. Some of the oldest ones are gnarled.\n  Which tree here is the oldest? Interestingly, this smaller tree is 60 \nyears old and this bigger one is 55 years old. This is the younger \ntree--the big one. This tree was in an area that wasn't competing for a \nlot of nutrients, water, and sun. It was in a more open area. It grew \nas you would expect it to--very well, very quickly, and very big.\n  Obviously, this is a tree we are going to want to preserve. It will \nget bigger and bigger. But if you have that area in which the trees are \ncrowded together in these very dense thickets, you can have a tree no \nbigger than this small one after 60 years. In fact, I have another one \nabout the same size that is 88 years old.\n  Old growth would be something over 120 to 150 years. We have trees \nnot much bigger than this that are designated old growth. We desire to \ncreate an environment in which you get these big beautiful trees that \ngrow old and big and create the habitat for all of the fauna I \ndiscussed before for which we are trying to preserve the forests. This \nis an illustration of why you don't want to have arbitrary limits on \ncutting old-growth trees. The tree you want to save is this big \none, not that one, the small one. That makes a much nicer environment \nand one that is better for the wildlife.\n\n  (Mrs. CLINTON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. KYL. Let me now discuss one of the concerns that has cropped up \nduring the discussions about the kind of legislation we want.\n  There are those organizations in the environmental movement that \nunderstand there is too much public opinion in favor of doing something \nto manage our forests now because of this wildfire season, this \ncatastrophic fire season. They understand they have to make some \nconcessions. They have concluded that the best thing to be for is what \nthey call urban/wild interface management. What that is supposed to \nmean is that you can go in and thin the areas right around communities \nand right around people's expensive million-dollar summer homes, and \nthe like, but you cannot go out into the forests themselves.\n  We will put up the chart that shows the class 3 lands.\n  The problem is, first of all, it treats very few acres. This will \nillustrate the point. We don't have very many communities in these \nforests. There are five or six little towns in this whole area here. To \ndo urban/wild interface management alone, by going out a half mile \naround the city limits of those little towns, is going to do nothing to \nenhance the environment in the rest of the forest. It will do nothing \nto protect the habitat of the endangered species out there. Actually, \nit does very little to protect the communities themselves.\n  The Rodeo-Chediski fire--and I will show you the chart later--burned \nwith such ferocity and intensity that the small areas that had been \ntreated provided little or no protection. It was only the areas where \nthere had been a larger area of treatment that were protected as a \nresult of the fire.\n  I can tell you, while the fire was still burning in the eastern area, \nwe helicoptered up to the Rodeo-Chediski lookout and we drove about \nanother 2 miles on a road that divided between an area that had been \ntreated--that is to say, there had been thinning, and I believe \nprescribed burning in the area as well, and on the other side of the \nroad it was not treated. The side that was not treated looked like a \nmoonscape. There was no living thing. Every tree had all of the \nbranches and pine needles burned off--nothing but ghostly, ghastly \nsticks. On the side that was treated, you could hardly see that a fire \nhad gone through there. It laid on the ground, and it burned itself \nout. It was in a large enough area that it did not burn in that area.\n  Unfortunately, where you had just a thin, light, little strip of a \nquarter mile or half mile, the fire jumped right over it. I saw that as \nwell in different areas.\n  Part of the problem is a phenomenon that exists particularly in the \nWest, where you have dry, hot conditions on the ground. The fire crowns \nout, as you have seen on television, and these massive spires of flame \ngo 100, 150 feet in the air, which creates a plume of high, hot air, \nsmoke, ashes, cinders, carried upward, and it looks like a mushroom \ncloud from an atomic kind of explosion because the column of hot air \nrises like this and it creates a mushroom effect. It gets up into the \ncooler atmosphere, 15,000, 20,000 feet, and it cannot rise any more \nbecause the heat doesn't sustain it. The cool air dampens it down and \nbegins to create condensation. Eventually, the weight of the plume that \nhas risen is greater than the capacity of the hot air to sustain it and \nit collapses. The firefighters call it a phenomenon of a collapsing \nplume. What happens then is the whole thing comes crashing down, \ncreating a huge rush of air down on the ground, which pushes out all of \nthe hot cinders, sparks, smoke, and ash out, like this, for 2 or 3 \nmiles.\n  That happened many times in the Rodeo-Chediski fire. I witnessed the \ncreation of one such plume in an area of Canyon Creek, where I have \nbeen hiking and camping. It was devastated by this fire. So it doesn't \ndo you any good to create a bulldozer kind of a firebreak, or a quarter \nof a mile or half mile of thinning, if the fire can spread with such \nferocity. That is what happened over and over in this particular fire.\n  Let me explain that, notwithstanding the fact that there had been \nsome treatment around some of our communities. Just stop and think \nabout this\n\n[[Page S8636]]\n\nfor a moment. About 30,000 Arizonans had to pick up everything they had \nwithin about a 6-hour--I forget exactly how many hours of warning it \nwas, but it was very few hours. They had to pick up what they could in \ntheir pickup trucks and cars and find somewhere else to live for the \nnext 2 weeks. Show Low, AZ, is a town of over 20,000, 25,000 people, \nand in Pinetop and Lakeside and McNary, a few smaller towns, they had \nall had to leave. They could not go back in for anything. A few people \ntried to feed livestock and keep horses and cattle and pets alive, but \na lot was lost when these people had to be gone for 2 weeks.\n  Just think of having to leave your home and not knowing whether it \nwas going to burn or not. Some did burn, but the towns were saved.\n  Interestingly, one of the reasons Show Low was saved was that a \ncanyon to the southwest had been treated. It had been thinned, and \nthere had been prescribed burning in that area I believe 2 or 3 years \nbefore; I have forgotten exactly how long before.\n  When the fire hit that area, the combination of that plus the \nbackfire they lit in this particular canyon prevented the fire from \nreaching the outskirts--it reached the outskirts but prevented the fire \nfrom burning the town of Show Low.\n  Think about that. What we need to do is not treat quarter-mile or \nhalf-mile or even mile-long strips of property around fancy summer \nhomes or small communities but, rather, treat the forest itself--as \nmuch as we can treat, as quickly as we can treat it. Only in that way \nwill we get the environment back to the healthy state it was.\n  Only by treating large areas of the forest will we be able to return \nit to the status shown on this chart, where the small mammals will have \na place to graze, really small animals will have a place to hide from \nthe hawks, which will have a place to get the small mammals. We will \nhave the birds, the butterflies, and more introduced as a result of \nthis kind of treatment.\n  I mentioned before the issue of salvage timber. There is objection \neven to going in and cutting down the trees. I will show a chart of \nthese trees. This is a huge amount of timber that could be salvaged as \na result of the fire. In this kind of landscape, we need to cut some of \nthe trees to lay it down and stop some of the erosion which inevitably \noccurs because of this kind of fire. It will enhance the regrowth of \nthat area. Even seeding and planting does not do any good because the \nwater washes all that material into the streambeds and it does not \ntake.\n  This is timber that has a huge amount of value if it is able to be \nremoved quickly, but disease will set in and deterioration will occur \nwithin a few months. If it is not removed in a 12-to-18 month period, \nit is lost. This is one way to help pay for what we are trying to do. \nRabid, radical environmentalists do not want to even salvage that \ntimber. Why? Again, because it will actually provide some jobs for the \ncommercial timber industry and the mills that would mill the trees into \nlumber. They do not want them to be in existence because they then pose \na threat to the rest of the forest. That is their logic. It is amazing \nlogic.\n  Most of the Rodeo-Chediski fire was not on Forest Service land. \nSixty-some percent was on the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation. \nOne can see on this chart the area of the fire. The green area is the \nApache-Sitgreaves National Forest, and the yellow area is the Fort \nApache Indian Reservation.\n  The White Mountain Apache Tribe relies a great deal on the revenues \nof its timber operations to sustain its tribal operations. In fact, it \nis the tribe's biggest source of revenue.\n  Also significant to the tribe is the revenue it derives from the \nhunting that it permits on its land. The White Mountain Apache Tribe \nfor decades has been very smart about how they have managed their \nforests. They understand that if you are going to have wild turkey, if \nyou are going to have bear, if you are going to have wildcat, huge elk \nthat people are willing to pay $10,000 to hunt, if you are going to \nhave that kind of wildlife that will bring in these kinds of trophy \nhunters who will pay the tribe a lot of money to hunt on the \nreservation, then you have to do a couple of things. First, you can \nonly take out the number of animals necessary to keep healthy herds, a \nhealthy group of bear or lion, or whatever it might be. So they take \nout very few of those animals, just enough to keep the forest ecosystem \nin balance.\n\n  Second, you have to have a healthy forest. You have to have a forest \nthat is not all grown over in this dog-hair thicket environment but, \nrather, the more open forest that I showed before. The reason is that \nthese elk have to have grass on which to graze, as I said. You are not \ngoing to have an environment where the lions are going to be able to go \nafter the smaller critters because there will not be any small critters \nif they do not have places to forage and places to hide.\n  The White Mountain Apache Tribe has been very smart about the way \nthey have managed the forests. They have not been subject to the same \nrestrictions as has the Forest Service. They have been able to do more \nprescribed burns. They have been able to do thinning and utilize that \nsmall-diameter timber in their mills, and they have taken out modest \namounts of medium- and a little bit of larger diameter timber as well.\n  Some environmentalists say: You cannot do that; there has to be a \ndiameter cap of 20 inches, 16 inches, or some number. The tribe has not \nbeen subjected to that. It has asked itself the question--it is the \ntype of question experts, such as Wally Covington from Northern Arizona \nUniversity, ask: Not to define old growth or diameter cap, but take a \nlook at the area and determine its carrying capacity. What will this \nparticular area carry? What did it carry 100 years ago in terms of the \nkinds of trees, and other growth, and the number of trees?\n  When one determines that, then one knows what kind of treatment is \ncalled for. In some areas, you are going to cut all but 150 trees, \nleaving mostly large trees with a few more intermediate-size trees. In \nother areas, you may cut less. It may be that an area is so full of \nmedium-size growth trees, let's say 20-inch diameter trees--you may be \ntaking several of those out or maybe quite a few of those out. It does \nnot mean you are harming the environment. It means you are reducing the \nnumber of stems to the carrying capacity of the land so it can \nrejuvenate, so it can grow back, and the trees left will be the \nmagnificent trees we are trying to preserve. We will have grass and all \nthe rest that is necessary for healthy flora and fauna.\n  That is the idea of this treatment. Over the years, the Apache Tribe \nhas done a good job managing their forests. As a result, they have had \nless of a problem with fire. There are several different areas that \nhave been treated, and in the bear report that followed the devastating \nfire, there is quite a bit of discussion about the kind of timber that \nwas lost, the areas that were not as heavily damaged, and a discussion \nof the areas preserved, by and large, because they had been treated in \nthe past.\n  I find it interesting, by the way, and I am going to digress here--\nlet me make this point. We need to help the Fort Apache Tribe salvage \nthe timber that is salvageable in this area. They do not have the \ncapacity in their mills to do it, but they can mill some of it and then \nsell some of it to others. They have to get to it right away. They are \nmaking plans to do that. They need about $6.7 million to complete this \nproject. I hope we will be able to provide that to them and it will \nhelp sustain the reservation.\n  As to the Forest Service, there are objections already to salvaging \nthe same timber. We do not know where this boundary is when we are on \nthe ground. It is all the same. Why the Apache area can be salvaged but \nnot the Forest Service area I cannot explain. Nobody can rationally \nexplain it. We need to salvage there as well. Yet there are those who \nobject to any opportunity to salvage this timber.\n  One of the ideas for legislation was to have an opportunity to \ncomplete some stewardship projects or enhanced value projects that \nwould in a temporary way--maybe over a 3-year-period of time, for \nexample--treat areas of the forest that have not burned to see how well \nthis kind of management worked.\n  This has been tried in the past. One of the cases is the so-called \nBaca timber sale. When we talk about timber sales, some of the more \nradical environmentalists get all upset because we\n\n[[Page S8637]]\n\nare actually going to sell some timber to a mill that can mill it into \nlumber and build homes and lower the price of homes, by the way, so we \ndo not have to buy all the timber from Canada at higher prices.\n  This Baca timber sale was proposed in 1994 to reduce hazardous fuels \nboth in the interface and to improve forest health. It followed 5 years \nof planning and public participation. All the stakeholders were \ninvolved. But environmentalists appealed and litigated the case for 3 \nyears.\n  The Baca timber sale was in this area. When the Rodeo fire went \nthrough that area, it burned about 90 percent of the proposed area. An \narea that could have been treated, that could have been made healthy, \nthat the fire would largely have skipped around, was left to be ravaged \nby this catastrophic fire. The same environmental groups currently \nthreaten lawsuits that would prevent the restoration of this area, \nwhich is why I mention that.\n  I ask my colleagues, when are we going to say we are no longer going \nto be jerked around by the radical environmentalists' agenda to destroy \nthe commercial timber industry so they never have to worry about any \nbig trees being cut, in the process permitting the forests to burn, \ndestroying the habitat, endangering lives, burning homes, and burning \nup the same trees they want to save, as well as the environment for the \nspecies?\n  I mentioned before some of the species. The goshawk is an example. In \n1996, the Forest Service proposed a project to thin near the nest of \nthe goshawk, partly to reduce the fire hazards that were presented to \nthe goshawk. These radical environmentalists appealed. That year the \nfire burned through the forests, including the goshawk nest. That is \nwhat happens when irresponsible environmentalists have control.\n  What does the control result from? It results from the fact we have a \nlegal system that was designed to provide the maximum environmental \ninput into decisions about abuse by some of the radical environmental \ngroups. Let me cite some statistics from a report released in July by \nthe Forest Service that covered the appeal and litigation activities on \nthe mechanical treatment projects during the last 2-year period. Out of \n326 Forest Service decisions during this study period, 155 were \nappealed, more than half; 21 decisions that were administratively \nappealed ultimately led to Federal lawsuits.\n  What happens with the lawsuits? You get an injunction which prevents \nyou from moving forward with the project. In many cases either it burns \nwhile the project is pending or the Forest Service decided to move on \nrather than fight the appeal. The appeal, therefore, goes away, the \nwork never having been done.\n  In the southwestern region of Arizona and New Mexico, 73 percent of \nall treatment decisions were appealed. Nationwide it was almost half--\n48 percent of the project decisions in fiscal year 2001 and 2002. \nAgain, 73 percent in our area were appealed.\n  We cannot operate that way. The Forest Service is spending half of \nits budget preparing for these projects and fighting them and doing the \nwork in litigation and on appeals to respond to the environmental \ncommunity activity. About half of their budget is spent directly \nfighting the appeals, dealing with the injunctions, or preparing the \nprojects in such a way as to be immune from this kind of litigation, \nwhich almost inevitably appears anyway.\n  On administrative appeals alone in 1999 through 2001, in Arizona--\njust one State--environmental groups filed 287 administrative appeals; \n75 of these were filed by two groups that are very active. In \nlitigation in the last 5 years, the Sierra Club and the Center for \nBiological Diversity litigated 11 projects in Arizona and in 10 years \nlitigated 17 projects, including the Baca timber sale which was 90 \npercent burned while on appeal because of the litigation that ensued.\n  This is what has to stop. The administration, President Bush, has \nvisited these areas and has concluded that the best way to try to deal \nwith this problem is to keep the environmental laws in place so there \nis never any question about the application of the proper standards for \nthe projects that are developed but to make it more difficult for those \nwho are appealing for the sake of delay, to delay projects to the point \nthey are no longer worth proceeding. In other words, move the process \nalong.\n\n  The President's idea is you still have to have sales or projects that \ncomply with the NEPA process where there is environmental review by the \nState holders, but you cannot get a temporary restraining order or \npreliminary permanent injunction in court unless the court decided the \ncase and imposed a permanent injunction on the sale, but you could not \ngo in advance and get that injunction, which is frequently what happens \ntoday.\n  In addition to that, the administrative appeals would be reduced or \neliminated for certain sales. If you want to file suit, you can file \nsuit and go directly to the judge. The hope would be that the judge \nwould decide the case quickly and therefore either the project moves \nforward or it doesn't, but everyone knows they can move forward with \nalternative plans if the project cannot move forward. It seems to me on \na trial basis, a limited basis, that would make sense.\n  What we proposed was we limit this proposal to class 3 areas--in my \nState of Arizona it would be only the red areas--that we limit it in \ntime to maybe a 3-year authorization so we see how it works. If people \ndo not think it works, we do not have to continue it. And that we limit \nthe amount of acres that would be treated--maybe 5, 7, or 10 million \nacres per year, something like that. That, obviously, could be \nnegotiated. And you would limit the way in which the appeals could be \nbrought and have no temporary restraining order or preliminary \ninjunction to be able to stop a particular sale. There would also be no \nlimitation on the salvage projects I mentioned before.\n  Now, would these projects be logging? Would they be clearcut, et \ncetera? Of course not. First, they would have to be pursuant to the \nplans that have been developed by the forests. All of these regional \nplans have long ago discarded any kind of clearcut cutting. They have \nbasically adopted the management theory of reducing the small diameter \nunderbrush and small diameter trees, leaving, by and large, the larger \nolder trees that we want to preserve.\n  Those are the plans in place now. They are the plans that would be \nproposed. If there is any plan that is not consistent with that, \nobviously, people could file a lawsuit and they could go to court and \nsay, judge, this is not consistent with what we had in mind. And the \ncourt, of course, could say, that is right. If the proper environmental \nanalysis had not been done or was inconsistent with the plan, the \nproject could be stopped. That is what we are proposing.\n  As I said before, we have been in negotiations with our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle. I mention in particular Senator Feinstein \nfrom California has been very helpful in trying to find some middle \nground, to craft a plan to permit us, over a very short period of time, \nto be able to treat a small amount of acreage and see how well it \nworks. If it works well, perhaps we could go on from that. We got to \nthe point of having a 1-year authorization, with 5 or 7 million acres \nmaximum to be treated. It would be limited to this class 3 area. And a \nhigh priority would be given to urban wildland interface and to \nmunicipal watershed areas. Even that has not been accepted.\n  The question is whether or not we are going to be able to reach an \nagreement that permits us to fairly quickly pass an amendment, have it \nadopted and sent to the other body so we can begin negotiation for a \nconference report that enables us to send something to the President \nand begin treating these forests or whether we are basically going to \nbe in a stalemate or gridlock with the two different camps in the \nSenate, neither one having the votes to prevail, with the result that \nnothing comes out of this legislative session and we will be left with \nan opportunity missed, and a heightened risk for the forests that we \nwant to preserve.\n  That is the choice before the Senate. I call upon my colleagues who \nhave been working on this to try to find a way to enable us to be able \nto treat some of the acres in good faith, and see how it works, and if \nit does work well, as we predict it will, to enable us to expand that \nto the roughly 30 million\n\n[[Page S8638]]\n\nacres that the General Accounting Office said we need to treat or else \nsee burned.\n  Those are the stakes. I call upon my environmental friends, who are \nmostly concerned about protecting these areas of the forests, to think \nabout the priorities.\n  Do we want to protect the habitat for those endangered species that \nwe all would like to preserve? Do we want to protect the habitat for \nall the other flora and fauna? Do we want to have a healthy forest or \ndo we want, in effect, to let it go to seed, risking catastrophic fire, \ndisease, and insect devastation which will not protect the environment \nbut will destroy it for all the purposes I mentioned before?\n  That is the choice before us. It seems to me there is no better time \nto act and, in fact, this may be the last opportunity to act this year \nin order to achieve this result. I urge my colleagues to find this \ncompromise; if not, to support the kind of effort I propose that is a \nlimited project with very tight constraints--in effect, a pilot or \ndemonstration project to see if we can make this kind of forest \nmanagement work.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, administration budget requests and \ncongressional appropriations bills are a clear reflection of our \npriorities as a nation. As was discussed on the floor earlier today, it \nseems we had, from the administration, a focus on Iraq and nothing \nelse.\n  I am happy to see a bill just came from the House. I would like very \nmuch to see other things coming from the House, not the least of which \nis the rest of the appropriations bills and the matters that are now in \nconference. No. 1 on the top of my list is the terrorism insurance \nbill. We need to have that done.\n  I think now we have the second debacle in a row in Florida. We have \nelection reform that we have passed. It would be nice to finish that \nconference report as well as the Patients' Bill of Rights and the \ngeneric drug bill that seems lost over there sometimes. We have a lot \nof things that we need to complete.\n  And, of course, bankruptcy reform. Senator Carper came to me this \nmorning, here on the floor, and told me how desperately his \nconstituents feel this is necessary to help many different industries. \nSo there are a lot of things we need to do.\n  I listened patiently to the very erudite remarks of the Senator from \nArizona. I would say it is not an either/or situation. It is not a \nquestion of forests burn down or the radical environmentalists caused \nall this. The fact is, what we are proposing is instead of 70 percent \nof the money being spent where there are no people, we reverse that and \nhave 70 percent of the money spent in places such as Lake Tahoe, a \nbeautiful lake shared by California and Nevada. We are very concerned \nabout what happens if a fire occurs there.\n  My friend from Arizona said there are million-dollar homes, that is \nwhat we are trying to protect--and I am sure there are, in the Lake \nTahoe area, some very expensive homes. But remember, this is also an \narea of hotels, motels, and ski lodges and the service people who work \nin those are not millionaires and don't have millionaire homes but they \nneed to be protected. That is what this is all about.\n\n  As I said, the administration budget request and appropriations bills \nare a clear reflection of our priorities as a nation. It is where \nrhetoric meets reality. In an economic downturn, and that is what we \nare in now, it is more important to put people first, ahead of--instead \nof handouts to--corporations.\n  Unfortunately, I am sorry to say, the Bush administration's so-called \nhealthy forest initiative would add to its already impressive list of \ncorporate giveaways. This proposal is anti-community and anti-\nenvironment, plain and simple.\n  My friend is in a neighboring State, Arizona, and I know they have \nsuffered these devastating fires. We have watched them and feel for \nthem. But the answer is not to bash on radical environmentalists. That \nis not the cause of these fires. We have a number of people in America \nwho feel very strongly that the proposals made by my friend from \nArizona, where you basically take away judicial review of decisions \nmade, is wrong. I do not think there are many who would put the League \nof Conservation Voters in the camp of radical environmentalists. In \nfact, I think they are very moderate. They see things the way the \nAmerican people see things--a way to protect the environment. The \nLeague of Conservation Voters will grade all of us, all 100 Senators, \non this amendment and on this vote.\n  I think it would be a shame if, because of the pending Craig \namendment, that the minority would vote not to invoke cloture on this \nmost important piece of legislation. We need to move forward with this \nbill. If cloture is invoked, the Craig amendment falls--no question \nabout that. But we have tried to work something out and we have been \nunable to work it out.\n  My good friend from Oregon, Senator Wyden--who is a consensus \nbuilder, who is a longtime legislator--understands the art of \nlegislation is the art of compromise. He has worked for weeks trying to \ncome up with a compromise. If Wyden can't do it, it cannot be done, \nbecause he is someone who understands legislation and how to work out a \nso-called deal.\n  The League of Conservation Voters will grade us on this amendment in \nits annual scorecard. Whoever votes to agree to this amendment will \nfail, in their eyes, fail to protect the environment. That is what this \nvote is all about today.\n  Like the Bush plan, the Republican amendment is championed as a way \nto address the real fear and suffering of those who live in danger of \nwildfires. Sadly, this is simply a smokescreen for another corporate \nhandout. This is tragic because wildfires have burned roughly 100,000 \nacres in Nevada and more than 6.3 million acres nationwide this year. \nThe fire season is already one of the worst in the record. In Nevada, \nit is past. That doesn't mean we can't still have devastating fires, \nbut this fire season has been bad. The one before it was bad. By \nDecember of this year we may have the grim distinction of it being the \nworst year for wildfires in American history.\n  Faced with this devastation, what is the administration's plan? It \nproposes to suspend environmental reviews of timber projects, making it \neasier for timber companies to harvest large, healthy, fire-resistant \nand, of course, profitable trees. The Republican plan will suspend the \nmain environmental law applicable to our forest, NEPA, the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act. That is the law that forces the Forest \nService to ensure its timber sales don't hurt the environment. It is \nthe avenue through which local people and governments review these \nsales.\n  It would also prevent any meaningful judicial review of timber \ncompany and Forest Service actions. That is what this pending amendment \nwould do. That is because in the Republican plan the issuance of \ntemporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions is prohibited. \nThat is what restraining orders are all about. If you do not have a \nrestraining order, by the time you get to court the trees are gone. \nWhat is the point of judicial review if the trees have already been \nclearcut by the time you walk through the courthouse door?\n  The Republican amendment also fails to target funding to the places \nwhere forests meet our communities, where people and property are at \ngreatest risk. This is not a situation where there will not be work \ndone in areas outside of municipalities, places where people live. But \nwe are saying let's reverse things. Instead of spending 70 percent of \nthe money where there are no people, let's spend 70 percent of the \nmoney where there are people.\n  The Republican amendment does not require that a certain percentage \nof funds be spent on wildlife/urban interface. Instead, it gives the \nForest Service discretion to carve out big tree timber sales and cast \naside community concerns, as they have been doing for such a long time.\n  There is no hard target to protect our communities because that is \nnot what the Republican plan is about. It is about making it easier for \nthe Administration to sell our forests to their favorite timber \ncompanies.\n  We already have a stack of GAO reports detailing the myriad of ways \nthat our forests are mismanaged by our agencies.\n  For example, we know that government agencies do not target funding \nto\n\n[[Page S8639]]\n\nthe wildland-urban boundary where we can best protect lives and \nlivelihoods.\n  According to the President's own budget, only one-third of the fuels \nreduction budget was spent to directly protect people and homes. That \nreport came out in February of this year.\n  Think about that. The Forest Service has a record of spending most \nfunding out in the forests, away from people. That is not an acceptable \nrecord. They support logging of large, profitable--and fire resistant--\ntrees. They place lower value on hazardous fuel reduction projects on \nforests and rangeland around communities.\n  Don't just take my word for it. In response to GAO requests, Forest \nService officials themselves stated that they tend to ``(1) focus on \nareas with high-value commercial timber rather than on areas with high \nfire hazards or (2) include more large, commercially valuable trees in \na timber sale than are necessary to reduce accumulated fuels.''\n  How does the President reward agency mismanagement? By repealing \npublic oversight. The record of agencies in managing our forests \ndemonstrates just how important it is to have that oversight.\n  When my colleagues vote on the Republican plan, they should ask \n``Would it truly help communities threatened by fire?'' The answer is \nno.\n  I hope the minority will vote to invoke cloture and have this \namendment go down. The Craig amendment should fall.\n  The big trees that would fall as a result of this amendment aren't \nthe main cause of the wildfires now scorching many states--including \nmine, the State of Nevada, and of course, all over the West.\n  The real personal and economic danger facing Americans in the areas \nwhere our wildlands meet our communities is being used as the disguise \nfor this latest giveaway to big corporations.\n  The Administration and the Republican amendment don't focus resources \non these areas--a principle embraced in the National Fire Plan and the \nWestern Governors' Association. I don't think they are radical \nenvironmentalists.\n  Instead, they make it easier to squander fire money on projects that \nare far from communities and that threaten to worsen future fires.\n  I am sorry that it appears that it is the modus operandi of the Bush \nAdministration--roll back environmental laws, cut the public out of the \nprocess, keep people in the dark and turn over a public resource to \ncorporations.\n  Corporations can handle anything; any problem in America, turned over \nto corporations. We need oversight of these corporations.\n  In this case, that choice puts people in harm's way--it diverts \ntaxpayer dollars from public safety and, in many instances, to private \nplundering. We should instead spend fire money on projects that reduce \nthe risk to communities in forests and rangeland at high risk of \nwildfire.\n  Mr. President, Nevada has relatively little commercial timber but we \ndo have a terrible hazardous fuels problem that threatens Nevadans from \nCaliente to Reno--all over the State. Past practice proves that \nCongress needs to direct spending these funds to protect communities \nrather than accepting the President's new proposal.\n  Protecting people should be our priority today, not paving the way \nfor companies to remove great trees from our public lands.\n  There could still be work done, and there will be work done in areas \nthat the Senator from Arizona says there should be. What we are saying \nis all the money shouldn't be spent there. We are also asking: Why not \nhave judicial review? Why not have the ability to look at what is being \ndone by these agencies?\n  No one wants these fires to occur. They are devastating. But you have \nto recognize what appeared in, I believe, today's Washington Post--it \ncould have been in yesterday's Washington Post--and what happened in \nMontana 2 years after the devastating fires. They reviewed in depth \nwhat happened there. We know fires have been burning for centuries--\nforever. You need to have these fires occur on occasion. That is why we \nhave prescribed burning in all of the country. It is too bad we had the \nserious problem with prescribed burning in New Mexico. But we need \nprescribed burning. Burning makes for healthier forests. We have to \ndeal with what we are calling for in the amendment that we want to \noffer; that is, have prescribed burning to make healthier forests. We \nwant to improve forests so we have nature doing what it has to do.\n  We know pine trees can only germinate if there is a fire. There is \nnew growth of pine trees after fires, which pop the pinecones, and \ncauses the planting. That is something which is extremely important.\n  We tried to work something out on a compromise basis. We can't do \nthat. The majority leader made the right decision. A cloture motion was \nfiled. We are going to vote on that this evening.\n  I hope the Craig amendment will fall so we can move forward with this \nbill and complete this legislation.\n  I am disappointed we won't be able to offer our amendment. Our \namendment would also not be germane. That is too bad because I believe \nwe should focus on what is going to happen in urban centers--in areas \nwhere there are people. Hopefully, we can get the mix of money being \nspent so that more is done there and not out in the middle of nowhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I cannot sit idly by and not offer some \ncomment on the Senator's statement.\n  No. 1, the Senator has flopped the money in regard to the President's \nbudget. I might add that at least the president completed a budget. \nSeventy percent of this money would go to wildland urban interface, and \n30 percent goes to the less populated areas, not the other way around \nas the Senator from Nevada suggested.\n  In this amendment, we change no environmental law. We deny no one the \nappeal process. Both administratively and judicially, those things \ndon't change.\n  What I am asking Senators and this country to consider are \nenvironmental laws, NEPA, clean water, clean air, and the Forest \nManagement Act, which has been in effect for some 25 years. We have \nbeen operating and managing under those laws for that long without some \nreform. Look at the track record. I'm asking for proof you are right to \ndeny this; prove us wrong.\n  For years and years, I have followed football a little. I guess what \nmakes that game great is there is only one rule book, and it is in \nevery State across the Union. If we want to bring some discipline, look \nat that fact and compare it to what we are doing in our judicial \nsystem.\n  When I look at the appeals process--as the chief of the Forest \nService said the other day, if you get 999 people out of 1,000 to agree \non a management decision, it can all be stopped by one person. That has \nbeen the case ever since these laws were put into effect. We see the \nresult, we get growth, and we burn. We do away with grazing, and we \nburn. If we do away with active management of a renewable resource, \nwhat was there before? We saw younger trees that grew old, matured, \ndied, and regrowth occurred.\n  Once again, look at the track record of the management we have been \nunder for the last 25 years. We see great regrowth and reforestation \neven in clearcuts where that management has worked: New trees, new \nforests, a renewable resource that is in demand by the American public, \nto carry on into the next generation and the next generation, a \nrenewable resource that can be used by all Americans, all Americans; \nthat is, if housing and the use of lumber appeals to you.\n  I realize some folks don't worry about the cost of a home or people \ngetting into their first home. The folks on the other side of this \nissue are less caring about it. The League of Conservation Voters--who \nare a pretty moderate group, have a little radical group among them \nthat actually makes the policy to carry out their appeals process in \nthis situation.\n  Make no mistake about it, if they who want to manage the forests \ndifferently want us to prove why we think this plan would work, then I \nask for the other side to use the same system to prove theirs has \nworked. For 25 years, those management practices have all but \nculminated, in the last 4 years, in the destruction of a renewable \nresource which could have been somewhat prevented.\n\n[[Page S8640]]\n\n  Yes, there will always be fires. They even slash and burn after \nharvest is over. Do you know what? They grow back. They are wonderful. \nThey are beautiful. But what I fear is that the way this system is now, \npeople who have never had any dirt under their fingernails are making \nthe management decisions on a resource that should be used for \ngenerations to come. It just does not make a lot of sense to me.\n  Compare the track records. No money goes to corporations. No law is \nchanged. All rights are preserved. We are saying let's put the football \nat the 50-yard line. Nobody likes to start on their own 20.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, we are attempting to make a very \nimportant policy determination on the management of our public lands. \nMany of us have been on the floor over the last good number of years to \ntalk with some concern about the changing character of our public lands \nand the impending crisis that might occur under the normal climate \ncycles across the United States as a result of catastrophic wildfires \non our forested public lands.\n  Tragically enough, many of the alarms we were talking about were \nbased on studies done over several decades, that inactive management of \nour public lands, in the absence of fire, was allowing a fuel buildup \nthat ultimately could result in catastrophic wildfires.\n  We are now at that point where it has become obvious to the American \npublic, from watching television this summer, and seeing the fires that \nhave raged across the western forests, that something is wrong out \nthere; that this was not a normal environment; that this was something \nthey were not used to; Why were these beautiful forests now burning?\n  They were burning, they are burning--they are still burning--and have \nbeen since mid-June because of public policy that had largely taken \nfire out of the ecosystem but had not allowed a comparable activity in \nthe ecosystem of our forested lands that would remove the underbrush \nand the small trees and maintain the kind of environmental balance that \nwas there prior to European man coming upon the scene a couple hundred \nyears ago, and especially in the last 65 to 70 years when we had become \nvery good at putting out fires in our forests. It is from that \nperspective that brings us to the floor today.\n  A few moments ago, my colleague from Arizona was on the floor talking \nin great detail about the wildfires that swept across his State this \nsummer--the white forests of southwestern Arizona, and the phenomenal \ndamage that occurred there. It nearly wiped out an entire community. It \nclearly destroyed valuable ecosystems and watersheds and wildlife \nhabitat to a point of ultimate devastation.\n  It, in fact, has created such an environment that it denies Mother \nNature, once she has done this damage, the ability to come back and to \ncreate a resilient forest in a reasonably short period of time. By that \nI mean several decades.\n  These fires are now so intense, based on the fuel loading on these \nlands, that it is equivalent to literally tens of thousands of gallons \nof gasoline per acre in Btu's. The fire burns deep into the soil, soil \nloaded with organic materials that absorb and hold water and allow \nplants to flourish, creating what are known as hydrophobic soils. In \nother words, it caramelizes them; it fuses them; it ultimately destroys \nthe ability of these lands to reproduce for decades.\n  Of course, because you have denied the ability of the land to absorb \nwater, when the rains come in the fall, massive landslides, erosion, \nand watershed damage occurs. Right now, in Colorado, with the current \nrainfall, landslides are occurring as we speak. They are not making the \nnational news that the fires that swept across those lands a couple of \nmonths ago did, but they are making the local news because the roads \nare blocked, people cannot traverse the area, watersheds are being \ndamaged, and, of course, the quality of the water that now flows into \nthe reservoirs that supply the urban areas of Denver and other places \nis in question--all because of public policy and a perception that has \nprevailed in public policy for the last several decades that inactive \nmanagement, no management, man's hand not present in the forest, was, \nby far, the better way to go.\n  I am not even questioning the fact that several of the industries \nthat were prevalent in our forests over the last century have lost \ncredibility in the eyes of the American people. I am not even going to \nargue that forest policy of 30 years ago, based on certain attitudes \nand certain images, projected by national environmental groups, has not \nchanged attitudes and has caused us to lose the support of the American \npublic on certain aspects of national U.S. forest policy. I believe \nmost of that is true.\n  But what I also believe is true is that a radical move from one \nposition to the other, and holding the far position on the other side, \nis just as bad as maybe clear cutting policies of 40 or 50 years ago.\n  Many will now argue: But we are saving old-growth forests across our \ncountry by disallowing the human hand to touch the land. I suggest to \nthose who so argue that this year we have lost over 2\\1/2\\ to 3 million \nacres of old-growth forest because we were not allowed to go in and \ntake out the underbrush and the small trees that are below these older \ntrees. And as the fires swept across the land, it took everything, \nincluding the old growth.\n  So radicalism or extremism or a fixed policy on one extreme or the \nother can produce the wrong results. Putting good stewards on the land \nwho understand the science of the land and the science of the forest \nitself is, by far, the better way to go. But in the last decades, we \nhave decided that the policy was bad. I say, collectively, as a \nCongress, we have decided that. So we began to micromanage from the \nfloor of the Senate. Every Senator influenced by some of his or her \nenvironmental friends decided they were the forest experts. They would \nlegislate the particulars or they would deny certain actions that \nshould be happening on the public lands.\n\n  As a result, over the last number of years, we have seen the average \nnumber of fires and total number of acres destroyed per year begin to \nrapidly increase on our public forested lands.\n  What was once an average burn of 1 million, 1.5 million to 2 million \nacres a year is now up into the 6 to 7 to 8 million acres a year. And \nit seems now, if you were to graph it, to be progressively climbing.\n  This year we have now burned about 6.5 million acres of forested \nland--not just burned it but destroyed it. There is hardly a tree \nstanding--watersheds destroyed, land hydrophobic, wildlife habitat \ngone. Mother Nature will not come in there and replace herself for a \ndecade. In the meantime, watersheds will slip and slide off the face of \nthese mountains in landslides, riparian areas destroyed and urban areas \nat risk.\n  We are, therefore, going to sit here, as a Congress, and say: This is \nOK. This is the right thing to do.\n  The majority leader some months ago knew that in the Black Hills of \nSouth Dakota it wasn't the right thing to do, and he was able to work \nwith groups and accomplish for South Dakota some of what we would like \nto accomplish for the rest of the forested States of our country: an \nactive form of management that brings groups together, creates local \npublic interest, understands the dynamics of good stewardship, and \nallows some degree of active management.\n  So for the last several weeks we have worked very closely with a \nvariety of Senators from both sides of the aisle to see if there was \nnot a bipartisan way of accomplishing this. Tragically, some interest \ngroups have some of our colleagues so locked into a single position \nthat they can find no flexibility in their vote.\n  My colleague from Oregon, Ron Wyden, and Senator Dianne Feinstein of \nCalifornia have worked closely with us to try to make some of these \nchanges. They have come a long way. I, too, have come a long way in \ntrying to craft a middle ground that will allow active management on a \nselect number of acres of land to prove to the American public that \nwhat we can do can be done right not only in improving forest health \nbut, at the same time, not damaging the environment and, in a very \nshort time, allowing that land to rapidly improve as wildlife habitat \nand watershed quality land and also be productive for additional tree \nproduction\n\n[[Page S8641]]\n\nfor the housing industry and for the American consumer that would like \nto own a stick-built home.\n  Last week, Senator Domenici of New Mexico and I offered an amendment \nthat we thought was a comprehensive effort to come to the middle \nground, to a position that both sides could support. We took the advice \nof the western Governors who met with the Secretary of the Interior and \nthe Secretary of Agriculture some months ago to express the very \nconcern I and other Western colleagues have expressed about the state \nof at least the western forests and to try to arrive at a collaborative \nprocess that would allow both sides to come together.\n\n  In our amendment, what we have offered is basically allowing a \ncollaborative process to go forward at the State levels to select those \nlands most critically in need of active management for the kind of \nthinning and cleaning that would be most desirable under these areas \nand, at the same time, to recognize the clear protection that would \ncome as a result of existing forest plans, to not override forest plans \nthat most of our States have on a forest-by-forest basis, but to \nrecognize that those are appropriate planning processes, that the \nefforts we would recommend to improve forest health would be consistent \nwith the resource management plans and other applicable agency plans.\n  We would establish a limited priority of action, and that limited \npriority would be in the wildland/urban interface areas. This year, we \nhave lost over 2,100 human dwellings while we have lost 6.5 million \nacres of wildlife dwellings. So the human, in this instance, is \nexperiencing phenomenal damage to his or her dwelling, just as is \nwildlife. As a result of that, we recognize the most critical need of \ntrying to resolve the wildland/urban interface.\n  I see my colleague from West Virginia on the floor at the moment. He \nwas very willing to put additional money into firefighting this year. \nIt is part of this amendment on the floor now.\n  Why? Not only do we need it, but now the Forest Service spends most \nof its time protecting houses instead of protecting trees and wildlife \nhabitat and watershed. Why? Because over the last 25 years in the West, \nevery piece of non-Federal land that is in the timbered areas has found \nit to be a place where people like to live. They have built beautiful \nhomes out there. As a result, we now have a conflict that we did not \nhave 25 years or 30 years ago when fire became an issue on our public \nlands. So we are dealing with the wildland/urban interface areas.\n  The other area I mentioned, now very critical in the West, is the \nmunicipal watershed area. These are the watersheds that provide the \nwater and the impoundment or where water is collected for our growing \nurban areas. Many of those were devastated this year. I was on one in \nDenver, Colorado; now devastated, water that will now flow into the \nreservoirs that will feed the city of Denver. Much of that water will \nhave the result of an acid base produced by the ashes of the forest \nfires that destroyed the watersheds of that area.\n  We also recognize that forested or range land areas affected by \ndisease, insect activity, and what we call wind throw or wind blowdown, \nthose are the areas that are now dead or dying. As a result of that, \nthose are most susceptible to fire. We have recognized the need to get \ninto some of those areas. That would be important to do.\n  Lastly, areas susceptible to what we call reburn, where the fire \nflashes across it, largely kills the trees, and then causes those trees \nto die, making them more susceptible to fire.\n  We have also said that this approach, while extraordinary, will \ninclude only 10 million acres. When I say only 10 million, I am talking \nabout over 300 million forested Federal acres in our Nation under the \ndirection and management of the U.S. Forest Service. These forested \npublic lands encompass a very small amount. This would be showcased \nover a limited period of time with substantial restrictions. So that \nwould be very important, and the process would have some limitations as \nit relates to current law: That we would not allow appeals or \ninjunctions, but that there would be a judicial review process on a \nproject-by-project basis. It would allow the filing in a Federal \ndistrict court for which the Federal lands are located within 7 days \nafter legal notice when a decision to conduct a project under the \nsection is made. In other words, we do provide a legal remedy for those \nwho openly object to any of this activity.\n  As I and others have said, and the President said over a month ago, \nwe will not lock the courthouse door. While we think it is tremendously \nimportant that we begin to deal with forest health, we should not deny \nthe fundamental process in the end. And we would not deny locking the \ncourthouse door so that there could be a review as these actions \nproceeded.\n\n  Those are the fundamentals of what we are proposing to do--a limited \nnature, 10 million acres, to allow the groups to come together on a \nState-by-State basis to meet with the Forest Service and examine those \nacres and the most critical need of action, and to recommend to the \nForest Service those areas, to allow a limited environmental review to \ngo forward and, through that recommendation, then move to expedite the \nprocess in a way that is commensurate with forest health.\n  (Mr. JOHNSON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. CRAIG. If we could treat 5, or 6, or 7 million acres a year, and \nby that, I mean thinning and cleaning, leaving the old growth; our \nlegislation talks about leaving no less than 10 trees per acre of the \noldest trees, and more if it fits the landscape, or the species, or the \nwatershed in which this activity would be going on.\n  But even if we do all of that--if the public would allow us, and this \nSenate were to vote to become active managers of our lands once again--\nwith all of that, the state of our forests is now in such disrepair \nfrom a health, fuel-loading, big-kill standpoint, that in the years to \ncome we are still going to lose 4, 5, 6, 7 million acres a year to \nwildfire. It is simply a situation of human creation by public policy \nthat has denied active and reasonable management on these lands for \nseveral decades now. As a result of that, we have a tragedy in the \nmaking.\n  But if we act, in the course of the next decade we can save 700, 800, \nor a million acres of old growth and watershed and wildlife habitat, by \nthese actions, that might otherwise be burned by wildfire. That is the \nscenario and the issue as I see it. It is also the issue that some of \nour top forest scientists see.\n  Is it a political issue today? Tragically enough, it has been \npoliticized. There seems to be a loud chorus of people out there who \nsay: Do nothing. The tragedy today is that a do-nothing scenario is, \nwithout question, more destructive to the environment than a do-\nsomething scenario could ever be, because it would be total destruction \ninstead of limited damage in some areas that we treat, as we move to \nprotect the old trees and guard against entry into the roadless areas \nat this moment in time, but still allow the thinning, cleaning, and \nfuel removal to come out of these acreages, as proposed by the Craig-\nDomenici amendment that is now pending.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support us and join with us. While the \nfires have dominantly been in the West this year, this is not just a \nwestern issue. We are fortunate to have forested public lands all over \nour country. Here in the East, similar problems are now happening: \nOverpopulation of our forests, even in the hard woods, bug kill, fuel \nloading; and now we are beginning to see more of our forests in the \nEast, along the Allegheny and the Blue Ridge and down into the South, \nbecome ripe for burn during certain seasons of the year.\n  So it is a situation that is now beginning to repeat itself in the \nEast as much as it has since the late 1990s out in the West. So I \nbelieve it is a national issue of substantial importance and one that \nwe ought to spend time debating and understanding.\n  I encourage my colleagues to visit with me, Senator Domenici, or \nothers who have offered this amendment, trying to seek a balanced \napproach to allow the U.S. Forest Service to begin the program of \nselective, active management of thinning and cleaning, using a \ncomprehensive, collaborative approach on a State-by-State basis, with \ninterest groups from those areas, in a way that will begin to restore \nthe forest health of this Nation.\n\n[[Page S8642]]\n\n  We may have a cloture vote at about 5:15. I hope my colleagues will \nnot vote for cloture but will give us an opportunity to vote up or down \non this amendment, as I think we are entitled, because we believe it is \nnot only good policy but it is a critical and necessary vote for our \ncountry.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the Senator from New Mexico want for his \nspeech?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I didn't know whether we had any time left on our side.\n  Mr. BYRD. I believe we have until 12:30 overall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would ask for 5 minutes at this point.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, for not to exceed \n5 minutes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  I have heard most of the statement on the floor by my distinguished \nfriend and colleague, Senator Craig, with whom I am a cosponsor of a \nvery important amendment. We have a number of Democrats and Republicans \nwho have joined us on this amendment. All I want to do is suggest that \nif we are going to have cloture this afternoon, I hope that, with \nreference to a cloture that will take this amendment down, Senators \nwill not do that.\n  We have not had very much time. It is a very important and easy-to-\nunderstand issue. It will be confronted with an opposition amendment, \nwhich we have not seen yet, that will be forthcoming by the majority \nleader and, perhaps, Senator Bingaman. Both of them are moving in a \ndirection of modifying the existing environmental laws that don't let \nus remove certain kinds of trees from our forests that are, by most \npeople, determined to be the kind of trees you should remove. They \neither result in a burndown, or have the result of what is called a \nblowdown where whole portions of a forest are blown over, or they have \njust accumulated and are not growing because there is so much rubbish \nleft over that you cannot get the Sun to do any good. When the fires \ncome, they go from one place to another, right over the top of trees.\n  We want to set the timeframe within which objection can be made to \ngoing in and cleaning up that kind of forest, that it be moved in a \nvery short period of time and not be subject to lengthy court hearings \nbut, rather, that it move expeditiously.\n  We got our idea from an amendment the distinguished majority leader \nattached to a previous appropriation bill. The majority leader did this \nmodification of the environmental laws that restrained removal of \ncertain kinds of forests that were no longer needed and that could be \nused if you took them out of there rather quickly. The majority leader \ndid that in an amendment and made it apply to a certain forest in his \nState and, thus, in the State of the occupant of the chair.\n  I don't have any objection to that amendment today. If the majority \nleader and his fellow Senator who occupies the chair want to do that, \nthat is their business. It is about their State. I didn't come down to \ntalk about changing environmental laws. I waited a couple weeks and \nsuggested that maybe we ought to do the same thing--that we ought to \nget some movement in our forests rather than leave these kinds of trees \nthere.\n  There are many other things wrong with the forests that we are going \nto have to fix. Essentially, over 6 million acres of our forests have \nburned--more than twice the 10-year average--in the current fire \nseason. Twenty-one people have been killed and 3,000 structures have \nburned.\n  It will be more like an experiment. We will take a piece of these \nforests, and we will go in and clear them out within a reasonable \ntimeframe, rather than the unreasonable timeframe that has become the \nprocedure heretofore which, by using the courts and various actions of \nthe courts, imposing NEPA and all of its requirements, whenever groups \ndo not want any of this clearance, they win, just by delay.\n\n  I thought there would be a unification of purpose and we might get \nall the Senators to understand this was not an effort to defeat the \nenvironmentalists. We did not think they ought to necessarily take \nsides in opposition to this issue. It is a very realistic, commonsense \napproach.\n  We will have more time to discuss it in more detail, and we will get \nto discuss it at our respective policy luncheons. I thank the Senator \nfor yielding me the 5 minutes. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the situation with respect to time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes remaining prior to the \nrecess.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may hold the \nfloor beyond the 10 minutes for a reasonably short period of time. I \nwould say perhaps another 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator. He \nwants 3 minutes for a statement. So I yield 3 minutes to him. I do not \nknow why I am accommodating all these Senators like this, but I yield 3 \nminutes. I yield to him without losing my right to the floor for a \nstatement only for not to exceed 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Crapo pertaining to the introduction of S. 2942 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, over the course of the last several months, \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee has endeavored to craft 13--13--\nbipartisan, responsible pieces of legislation which fund every aspect \nof the Federal Government. The Appropriations Committee accomplished \nits goal. Each bill was adopted by the committee without a single \ndissenting vote--not one.\n  This is the largest committee of any committee in the Senate. It is \nmade up of 29 members--15 Democrats and 14 Republicans. So each bill \nwas adopted by the committee without a single dissenting vote: 13 \nbills, not a single nay vote. That is true bipartisan cooperation. In \nfact, if one adds up the rollcall votes for the 13 bills, one would \nhave a tally of 377 aye votes to zero nay votes. That is a record for \nwhich committee members should be proud.\n  As all Senators are aware, the appropriations bills are stuck. They \nare stuck; the ox is in the ditch. The House Appropriations Committee \nhas not acted on five appropriations bills, and the full House has yet \nto pass eight of the bills, leaving the next fiscal year in a dangerous \nposition of starting without Congress having completed action on the \nfunding legislation.\n  Why are we in this predicament? While it would be easy to point the \nfinger at the House of Representatives, the blame basically, truly \nbelongs down the avenue--the other end of the avenue.\n  The White House's Office of Management and Budget remains wedded to \nan arbitrary budget figure that undercuts the Congress' ability to \ncomplete its work in a responsible fashion. The Senate has passed \nappropriations bills that total $768 billion. Every Senator on the \nAppropriations Committee voted for that funding level. Every Senator on \nthat committee voted for that funding level of $768 billion. Every \nSenator on the Appropriations Committee, Democrat and Republican, \nrecognizes that level of $768 billion is a responsible level that \nprovides for the largest Defense spending bill ever, that provides for \na significant increase in homeland security funding, and that \naccommodates just enough to cover the cost of inflation for domestic \npriorities--priorities such as veterans health care, education. These \nare not boondoggle bills. These are responsible pieces of legislation.\n  The House appropriators would be able to complete work on their bills \nif\n\n[[Page S8643]]\n\nthey were able to utilize the same overall figure. I want to say the \nfault is not with the House Appropriations Committee chairman. That \ncommittee would be able to finish its job. But the White House has \ninsisted that the House allocate no more than $759 billion. So the \nHouse is stuck $9 billion below the Senate and weeks behind the \ncalendar for completing its work.\n\n  The House needs to get its work done, but more importantly, the \nadministration needs to provide some flexibility to help us to finish \nthese bills. We do not need political games. We need to complete action \non 13 individual appropriations bills.\n  I know; I worked closely with the chairman on the other side, \nChairman Young, and with the ranking member on the Democrat side, Dave \nObey. I worked closely with them. Their heart is in the right place. \nThey know the Senate and the House ought to go to the higher, top line \nfigure, $768 billion. But it is the administration that has its feet in \nconcrete and its head in the sand. No, it wants to stay right on the \n$759 billion. That is why these appropriations bills are stuck.\n  Just yesterday--listen to this--in an article in the Wall Street \nJournal, Mr. Lawrence Lindsey, head of the White House's National \nEconomic Council, projected that the military costs for this so-called \nwar in Iraq will be $100 billion to $200 billion. They were talking \nabout billions of dollars this year alone. I will say that again: Just \nyesterday, in an article in the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Lawrence \nLindsey, head of the White House National Economic Council, projected \nthat the military costs for this so-called war in Iraq will be $100 \nbillion to $200 billion this year alone.\n  Now, I would consider $100 billion to be quite substantial. That is a \nlot of money, $100 billion. But Mr. Lindsey says it may go from $100 \nbillion to $200 billion this year alone. I consider $100 billion to be \nquite a substantial figure, and I would consider $200 billion to be \ndoubly substantial.\n  Mr. Lindsey, when asked about that level, said: That's nothing. \nThat's nothing--$100 billion to $200 billion, that's nothing? If $100 \nbillion is nothing, Mr. Lindsey, what is $9 billion? How can $100 \nbillion be nothing if the White House is willing to put the entire \nGovernment on autopilot over $9 billion? That is why we are not getting \nthe appropriations bills done. The administration, through its Office \nof Management and Budget, says no more than $759 billion, because he \nhas the authority of the President behind him.\n  I have heard some strange economic plans in my day, but this one \ntakes the cake. How can $100 billion be nothing, as Mr. Lindsey is \nquoted as saying, if the White House is willing to put the entire \nGovernment on autopilot over $9 billion?\n  The growth of the fiscal year 2003 appropriations bills is not for \nthe domestic program. The additional $9 billion in the Senate bills \nwill fund the President's requested increases in the Department of \nDefense and homeland security. For the rest of the Government, that $9 \nbillion is the difference between a hard freeze and a 3-percent \nadjustment for inflation. But those facts do not seem to matter. They \ndo not seem to matter to this administration.\n  In times such as these, the administration should be working with \nCongress to complete action on these appropriations bills, not \nattempting to hamstring Congress at every turn.\n  Obviously, the Office of Management and Budget has adopted a strategy \nthat places the administration's political goals and rhetoric above the \nneeds of the Nation. The political goals come first, apparently, with \nthis administration. What a shame. What a shame. The Office of \nManagement and Budget has signaled that this year politics wins out \nover principle, rhetoric wins out over reality.\n  So much for the new tone the President was going to bring to \nWashington. All this administration wants to do, apparently, is to play \nthe same old games. The administration seems to believe that the \nFederal Government is nothing more than a Monopoly board. The President \nis living on Park Place, but the rest of the country is relegated to \nMediterranean Avenue. The administration has asserted that $768 billion \nis excessive spending for the coming fiscal year, and yet the \nsignificant increases within that total are to fund the President's \nproposal to significantly increase defense spending and homeland \nsecurity funding.\n  I am not against doing whatever is needed to meet the Nation's \nrequirements for defense, and the same is true with respect to homeland \nsecurity. But the Nation should not be forced to cut budgets on health \ncare, on education, on veterans programs, and other priorities here at \nhome just to meet some political goal of the administration. The clock \nis ticking. We do not have time to play these political games. There is \nmore at stake than a simple roll of the dice.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article \nfrom the Wall Street Journal published on Monday, September 16, 2002. \nThe title of the article is: ``Bush Economic Aide Says Costs of Iraq \nWar May Top $100 Billion.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Bush Economic Aide Says Cost of Iraq War May Top $100 Billion\n\n                             (By Bob Davis)\n\n       Washington.--President Bush's chief economic advisor \n     estimates that the U.S. may have to spend between $100 \n     billion and $200 billion to wage a war in Iraq, but doubts \n     that the hostilities would push the nation into recession or \n     a sustained period of inflation.\n       Lawrence Lindsey, head of the White House's National \n     Economic Council, projected the ``upper bound'' of war costs \n     at between 1% and 2% of U.S. gross domestic product. With the \n     U.S. GDP at about $10 trillion per year, that translates into \n     a one-time cost of $100 billion to $200 billion. That is \n     considerably higher than a preliminary, private Pentagon \n     estimate of about $50 billion.\n       In an interview in his White House office, Mr. Lindsey \n     dismissed the economic consequences of such spending, saying \n     it wouldn't have an appreciable effect on interest rates or \n     add much to the federal debt, which is already about $3.6 \n     trillion. ``One year'' of additional spending? he said. \n     ``That's nothing.''\n       At the same time, he doubted that the additional spending \n     would give the economy much of a lift. ``Government spending \n     tends not to be that stimulative,'' he said. ``Building \n     weapons and expending them isn't the basis of sustained \n     economic growth.''\n       Administration officials have been unwilling to talk about \n     the specific costs of a war, preferring to discuss the \n     removal of Mr. Hussein in foreign-policy or even moral terms. \n     Discussing the economics of the war could make it seem as if \n     the U.S. were going to war over oil. That could sap support \n     domestically and abroad, especially in the Mideast where \n     critics suspect the U.S. of wanting to seize Arab oil fields.\n       Mr. Lindsey, who didn't provide a detailed analysis of the \n     costs, drew an analogy between the potential war expenditures \n     with an investment in the removal of a threat to the economy. \n     ``It's hard for me to see how we have sustained economic \n     growth in a world where terrorists with weapons of mass \n     destruction are running around,'' he said. If you weigh the \n     cost of the war against the removal of a ``huge drag on \n     global economic growth for a foreseeable time in the future, \n     there's no comparison.''\n       Other administration economists say that their main fear is \n     that an Iraq war could lead to a sustained spike in prices. \n     The past four recessions have been preceded by the price of \n     oil jumping to higher than $30 a barrel, according to BCA \n     Research.com in Montreal. But the White House believes that \n     removing Iraqi oil from production during a war--which would \n     likely lead to a short-term rise in prices--would be \n     insufficient to tip the economy into recession. What is \n     worrisome, ecomists say, is if the war widens and another \n     large Middle East supplier stops selling to the U.S., either \n     because of an Iraqi attack or out of solidarity with Saddam \n     Hussein's regime.\n       Mr. Lindsey said that Mr. Hussein's ouster could actually \n     ease the oil problem by increasing supplies. Iraqi production \n     has been constrained somewhat because of its limited \n     investment and political factors. ``When there is a regime \n     change in Iraq, you could add three million to five million \n     barrels of production to world supply'' each day, Mr. Lindsey \n     estimated. ``The successful prosecution of the war would be \n     good for the economy.''\n       Currently, Iraq produces 1.7 million barrels of oil daily, \n     according to OPEC figures. Before the Gulf War, Iraq produced \n     around 3.5 million barrels a day.\n       Mr. Lindsey's cost estimate is higher than the $50 billion \n     number offered privately by the Pentagon in its conversations \n     with Congress. The difference shows the pitfalls of \n     predicting the cost of a military conflict when nobody is \n     sure how difficult or long it will be. Whatever the bottom \n     line, the war's costs would be significant enough to make it \n     harder for the Bush administration to climb out of the \n     budget-deficit hole it faces because of the economic slowdown \n     and expense of the war on terrorism.\n       Mr. Lindsey didn't spell out the specifics of the spending \n     and didn't make clear whether he was including in his \n     estimate the cost of rebuilding Iraq or installing a new \n     regime. His estimate is roughly in line with the $58\n\n[[Page S8644]]\n\n     billion cost of the Gulf War, which equaled about 1% of GDP \n     in 1991. During that war, U.S. allies paid $48 billion of the \n     cost, says William Hoagland, chief Republican staffer of the \n     Senate Budget Committee.\n       This time it is far from clear how much of the cost--if \n     any--America's allies would be willing to bear. Most European \n     allies, apart from Britain, have been trying to dissuade Mr. \n     Bush from launching an attack, at least without a United \n     Nations resolution of approval. But if the U.S. decides to \n     invade, it may be able to get the allies to pick up some of \n     the tab if only to help their companies cash in on the bounty \n     from a post-Saddam Iraq.\n       Toppling Mr. Hussein could be more expensive than the \n     Persian Gulf War if the U.S. has to keep a large number of \n     troops in the country to stabilize it once Mr. Hussein is \n     removed from power. Despite the Bush administration's \n     aversion to nation building, Gen. Tommy Franks, commander of \n     U.S. troops in the Middle East and Central Asia, recently \n     said that the U.S. troops in Afghanistan likely would remain \n     for years to come. The same is almost certain to be true in \n     Iraq. Keeping the peace among Iraq's fractious ethnic groups \n     almost certainly will require a long-term commitment of U.S. \n     troops.\n       During the Gulf War, the U.S. fielded 500,000 troops. A far \n     smaller force is anticipated in a new attack on Iraq. But the \n     GOP's Mr. Hoagland said the costs could be higher because of \n     the expense of a new generation of smart missiles and bombs. \n     In addition, the nature of the assault this time is expected \n     to be different. During the Gulf War, U.S. troops bombed from \n     above and sent tank-led troops in for a lightning sweep \n     through the Iraqi desert. A new Iraq war could involve \n     prolonged fighting in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities--even \n     including house-to-house combat.\n       The Gulf War started with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in \n     August 1990, which prompted a brief recession. The U.S. \n     started bombing Iraq on Jan. 16, 1991, and called a halt to \n     the ground offensive at the end of February.\n       With Iraq's invasion, oil prices spiked and consumer \n     confidence in the U.S. plunged. But Mr. Lindsey said the \n     chance of that happening again is ``small.'' U.S. diplomats \n     have been trying to get assurances from Saudi Arabia, Russia \n     and other oil-producing states that they would make up for \n     any lost Iraqi oil production. In addition, Mr. Lindsey said \n     that the pumping equipment at the nation's Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve has been improved so oil is easier to tap, \n     if necessary. Both the Bush and Clinton administrations, he \n     said, wanted to ``make sure you can pump oil out quickly.''\n       On Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said \n     he doubted a war would lead to recession because of the \n     reduced dependence of the U.S. economy on oil. ``I don't \n     think that . . . the effect of oil as it stands at this \n     particular stage, is large enough to impact the economy \n     unless the hostilities are prolonged,'' Mr. Greenspan told \n     the House Budget Committee. ``If we go through a time frame \n     such as the Gulf War, it is unlikely to have a significant \n     impact on us.''\n       The U.S. economy also has become less dependent on oil than \n     it was in 1990, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at \n     Economy.com, an economic consulting group in West Chester, \n     Pa.

Under the previous order, the hour of 2:15 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will now resume consideration of H.R. \n5005, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5005) to establish the Department of Homeland \n     Security, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Lieberman amendment No. 4471, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Thompson/Warner amendment No. 4513 (to amendment No. 4471), \n     to strike title II, establishing the National Office for \n     Combating Terrorism, and title III, developing the National \n     Strategy for Combating Terrorism and Homeland Security \n     Response for detection, prevention, protection, response, and \n     recover to counter terrorist threats.\n       Lieberman amendment No. 4534 (to amendment No. 4513), to \n     provide for a National Office for Combating Terrorism, and a \n     National Strategy for Combating Terrorism and the Homeland \n     Security Response.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under an order previously entered, it is my \nunderstanding the Senator from West Virginia has the floor; is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Under the previous \norder, the Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the \ndistinguished Democratic whip.\n  Mr. President, I want to be sure that Senators understand the \nparliamentary situation in the Senate at this point.\n  Last Thursday, the Senate voted on a motion to table the Thompson \namendment to strike Titles II and III of the Lieberman substitute. \nTitle II would establish a new National Office for Combating Terrorism \nwithin the Executive Office of the President whose Director would be \nconfirmed by the Senate and made accountable to the Congress.\n  That is incredibly important. The National Office for Combating \nTerrorism was viewed by our good colleague, Senator Lieberman as a \ncentral part of his homeland security bill. Title II was carried over \nfrom his original bill that was introduced last May, before the White \nHouse endorsed the idea of creating a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  But the motion to table the Thompson amendment to strike Title II \nfailed by a vote of 41-55 last Thursday. Senator Lieberman conceded the \nvictory to Senator Thompson, and urged the Senate to accept the ``the \nnext best idea.'' Senator Lieberman offered a scaled down version of \nTitles II and III as a second degree amendment to the Thompson \namendment.\n  It was at that point that I gained the floor and have held it until \ntoday.\n  So I find myself in a position that I had not intended--and not an \neasy position. I have often felt, in recent days, as if this 84-year-\nold man--soon to be 85; within a few days--is the only thing standing \nbetween a White House hungry for power and the safeguards in the \nConstitution. That is not bragging, that is lamenting.\n  This is not the way it ought to be. This will not go down as one of \nthe Senate's shining moments. Historians will not look back at this \ndebate and say that we fulfilled the role that was envisioned by the \nFramers.\n  This Senate should have the wisdom to stand for this institution and \nthe Constitution. It is not our duty to protect the White House. It is \nour duty to protect the people--those people out there looking through \ntheir electronic lenses, the people who come here from day to day, \nthese silent individuals who sit up here in the galleries. They do not \nhave anything to say. They are not allowed to speak under the Senate \nrules, but they sit and watch us. They are looking over our shoulders, \nas it were, and they expect us to speak for them. They will help to \nensure that the interests and the rights of the American people are \nprotected. That is what these people want. They want us to assure that \ntheir interests--the people's interests--and the rights of the American \npeople are protected.\n  I have been joined by a few voices on this floor in recent days, and \nI thank them. I feel that at least some Members are beginning to view \nthis legislation as doing much more than merely setting up a new \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I have also heard from citizens across the country who have urged me \nnever to give up. Well, I can assure them that as long as I am \nprivileged to serve in this body I will never give up defending the \nConstitution.\n  I heard Condoleezza Rice last Sunday, and I heard Dr. Rice the Sunday \nbefore.\n  I heard Secretary of State Powell last Sunday on television, and I \nheard him the Sunday before.\n  I have listened to Secretary Rumsfeld, and I have listened to Vice \nPresident Cheney on television.\n  I have listened to various and sundry Senators on television. I have \nlistened to various and sundry other spokespersons on television.\n  I read the op-ed piece of former Secretary of State Shultz in the \nnewspaper Sunday a week ago.\n\n[[Page S8645]]\n\n  I read the op-ed piece of former Secretary of State James Baker in \nthe paper this past Sunday. And I hear many persons in the media--not \neverybody but some in the media--who seem to be intent upon galvanizing \nthis and making this country ready for war. Not one of these people \nhave I heard--maybe I missed it--refer to the Constitution. I take an \noath, and so does every other Senator, to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic. Nobody says anything about the Constitution in this debate \nthat is raging over the country.\n  There is a great fervor, and there is a great wave of opinion being \ncreated. And some in the media are doing it, or helping to create it. \nThey have their minds made up. We are off to war.\n  I can hear the bugles, and I can see the flag. I can see the sunlight \ntinting on the bugles as they pass, and the flag I see going already. I \ncan hear the guns. There is a great fervor here, and I hear the war \ndrums being beaten. It is as though we have our minds made up. It is as \nthough the President is already ready to go. And there is a developing \nhysteria in this country saying: Let us go to war. We have our minds \nmade up.\n  Nobody stands up against that. But the Constitution is a barrier--\nthis Constitution which I hold in my hand. This Constitution says \nCongress shall have the power to declare war. It doesn't say the \nPresident shall have power to declare war. It doesn't say the Secretary \nof State shall have power to declare war. Congress shall have power to \ndeclare war. But who is bothering to mention Congress? Who is bothering \nto mention the Constitution? It has become irrelevant, as far as some \nof the commentators and columnists and editorial writers are concerned, \nit seems to me. That is my impression. The Constitution has become just \nan old piece of paper. It was great 215 years ago but not now. Events \nhave overtaken the Constitution. Nobody mentions it.\n\n  I haven't heard Dr. Condoleezza Rice mention it on her television \nappearances. I haven't heard the Secretary of State mention the \nConstitution. I haven't heard the Secretary of Defense mention the \nConstitution. I haven't heard the Vice President of the United States \nsay a word about the Constitution when he discusses the business of \ngoing to war.\n  Has it become irrelevant? Are we to sit supinely by and be swept up \nin this national fervor that is being developed, that is being created \nto stampede this country into war? Are we to sit silently by?\n  Well, I want to assure the people that as long as I am privileged to \nserve in this body I will never give up defending the Constitution. And \nthe Constitution is front and center to this business that we are \ndiscussing--the issue of war and peace. The Constitution is front and \ncenter.\n  Why, there are some who will get on the national television \nprograms--they do not invite me; I don't expect them to mention the \nConstitution. Why is it? Why is that?\n  Here is the Vice President, the President of this body right here \nunder the Constitution, who can't address the Senate except by \nunanimous consent, but when he is on national television on these \nprograms, why doesn't he mention the Constitution? Is this Constitution \nirrelevant? They take for granted, I suppose, that the United Nations \nis the chief authorizer of America marching off to war.\n  I am for what the President did the other day. He went to the United \nNations. He has pointed the finger, as it were, at the United Nations, \nand said the United Nations has been recreant in its duty and recreant \nin its responsibility to enforce its resolutions. I think he laid down \nan excellent case in making that point.\n  But we also have a duty here. We have a duty to uphold this \nConstitution and what it says about declaration of war and what it says \nabout Congress.\n  Why, it is as though the Constitution is something that went away \nwith the winds of yesterday--gone.\n  I can assure the people I will never give up defending this \nConstitution. It is my sworn duty. At some point, however, I will have \nto relinquish the floor. And when I do, the Lieberman amendment \npresumably will be withdrawn and the Senate will vote on the Thompson \namendment. That amendment, I presume, would pass, and titles II and III \nof the Lieberman substitute will be stricken from the bill.\n  Senator Lieberman may be right that we don't have the votes to defeat \nthe Thompson amendment. But what disturbs me most of all is that such \nan important element of the Lieberman substitute could be stricken from \nthe bill so easily.\n  I am talking about the need to confirm the Director of the National \nOffice for Combating Terrorism. So I just refer to that title as the \nDirector.\n  Now, I don't think we should accept that verdict so easily.\n  It is unbelievable to me that people are not fighting harder for \nthese proposals, not only in title II and title III, but throughout the \nentire bill. The issues raised by this legislation are too important to \nlanguish without more debate in the Senate.\n  I know I am not the only Senator who is concerned about this bill, \nbut I have not heard enough voices speaking out on these important \nmatters. There are many, many unanswered questions which Senators need \nto focus on and explore.\n  Of course, I can't fight this battle alone.\n  Meanwhile, the President and the House Republican leadership are \nalready turning up the heat on the Senate to pass this bill quickly. \nThe President even suggests that delaying this bill will endanger the \nlives of the American people.\n  That is nice rhetoric, Mr. President, but I doubt whether anyone \nbelieves that argument. The people are not endangered by our thorough \nconsideration of this legislation. The mistakes we avoid now are just \nas important as getting the Department in place quickly. What is not \ndone well, generally, must be done over, and unintended consequences \ncan take years to correct.\n  Nevertheless, pressures are building to expedite consideration of \nthis bill. But in taking the floor, I hope to draw attention not only \nto the fallibility of passing this bill without a confirmable White \nHouse Homeland Security Director, but to other portions of this bill \nthat should make Senators question the rush to enact this legislation \nso quickly.\n  My hope is that Senators will consider the gravity of this \nlegislation before they simply jump on board somehow. This homeland \nsecurity legislation will have important consequences not only for the \nlives of all Americans, but for the American way of life as well.\n  Mr. President, the security of the American people, on American soil, \nis, and has always been, our Government's most solemn responsibility. \nSeptember 11 added a new dimension and urgency to that duty.\n  The bill before the Senate seeks to enhance our Government's ability \nto protect the American people from the devastation of another \nterrorist attack by creating a new Department of Homeland Security.\n  I have been for that. I was for that before President Bush was for \nit.\n  That is a very ambitious goal. It is a worthy and honorable goal born \nof commendable intentions. But if we do not move with great caution--if \nwe do not slow down just a little bit--move with great caution--and \ndeliberation in our work, we will risk undermining the very purpose to \nwhich we are dedicated.\n  My concerns about the proposed legislation are many. They are legion. \nWhile we can all embrace the concept of a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity, there are many, many pitfalls ahead for such an endeavor in \nthe complicated new atmosphere of what has been called a ``war'' on \nterrorism.\n  I have made several comments about the threat that this new \nDepartment poses to the civil liberties--hear me now--to the civil \nliberties of the American people. And that is not just hyperbole.\n  Twenty-six leaders of conservative organizations across this country \nreleased a statement this month urging the Senate to exercise \n``restraint, caution, and deeper scrutiny before hastily granting \nunnecessary powers to a homeland security bureaucracy.''\n  So, you see, that was not just Robert Byrd talking. That was not just \nan 84-year-old man, soon to be 85, talking.\n  Let me say that again. Twenty-six leaders of conservative--get that--\nconservative organizations across America released a statement this \nmonth urging the Senate to exercise--and I quote--\n\n[[Page S8646]]\n\n``restraint, caution, and deeper scrutiny before hastily granting \nunnecessary powers to a homeland security bureaucracy.''\n  They wrote that:\n\n       [T]he popular enthusiasm for such a centralization and \n     bureaucratization in the name of homeland security may prove \n     unwise. Proposed legislation not only increases the growth of \n     the federal bureaucracy but establishes an infrastructure, \n     legal and institutional, which, if abused, could lead to \n     serious restrictions on the personal freedoms and civil \n     liberties of all Americans.\n\n  In case there are any latecomers to hearing this Senate, just now, I \nam talking about 26 leaders of conservative organizations across \nAmerica who released a statement this month urging the Senate to slow \ndown. They wrote--and I quote again:\n\n       [T]he popular enthusiasm for such a centralization and \n     bureaucratization in the name of homeland security may prove \n     unwise. Proposed legislation not only increases the growth of \n     the federal bureaucracy but establishes an infrastructure, \n     legal and institutional, which, if abused, could lead to \n     serious restrictions on the personal freedoms and civil \n     liberties of all Americans.\n\n  ``All Americans.''\n  September 11 was a shock to this Nation, and the fear, anger, and \nalarm it engendered have not, as yet, vanished. My concern is that in \nour zeal to see to it that terrorists never again defile our homeland, \nwe will unwittingly cede some of our precious freedoms and blur the \nconstitutional safeguards that have been the basis for our liberties \nand the check against an overreaching executive for 215 years, or \nthereabouts.\n  Let me make it clear that I am not accusing anyone of deliberately \ntrying to exploit our national tragedy.\n  Rather, I believe that in our shock and revulsion, our collective \ndetermination to prevent further horrific attacks may change our Nation \nin fundamental ways that will eventually surprise and dismay all of us. \nHow terribly ironic it would be if it were our response to the \ntreachery of al-Qaida which dealt our constitutionally guaranteed \nfreedoms the most devastating blow of them all.\n  I believe that all of those in Government, those of us in Government \nwho are challenged with confronting the horrible reality of what \nhappened on September 11, have not, even yet, come to grips with \ncertain fundamental realities. We must all begin to face certain \ntruths.\n  Terrorism is a worldwide force, and our ability to prevent it at home \nor contain it abroad is limited--is limited--at best.\n  An enemy in the shadows, living among us and using our own openness \nand freedoms to attack our infrastructure, and to cripple and kill our \ncitizens, is unlike any enemy we have ever before known.\n  No Government Department can ever guarantee complete safety from this \nkind of threat in a world increasingly connected by trade, travel, \nelectronic communication, migrating populations and open borders. But, \nwe can do our best to anticipate vulnerabilities, protect critical \ninfrastructure, and respond to possible devastation or deliberately \nspread disease.\n  Yet, we can never be perfectly safe from the scourge of a terrorist \nattack. That is reality. And handing over our precious liberties and \nhard-won principles on such topics as worker rights, openness in \ngovernment, the right to privacy and civil liberties--that is what is \ninvolved here--will not change that unfortunate and troubling reality. \nSuch a course, blindly followed in the name of fighting terrorism, \nwould be disastrous. Hear me. It is understandable that this \nadministration, or any administration so consumed with the need to \nprevent another such horrific attack, might become so zealous and so \nfocused on that mission that important freedoms could be trampled or \nrelegated to a secondary position in our national life. If we are not \nvigilant, our country could be fundamentally changed before we realize \nit, in ways which we would all come to deeply regret.\n  Let me illustrate what I mean. Recent headlines have provided \nexamples of the administration's strong penchant for secrecy, and its \nrefusal to be confined by the law and the Constitution in its attempts \nto shield its actions from public scrutiny.\n  Last month, a Federal appeals court in Cincinnati issued a direct \nrebuke of attempts by the Administration to circumvent the \nConstitution--there is that magic word--by conducting deportation \nhearings in secret, whenever the government asserts that the object of \nthe hearings might be linked to terrorism. Writing for the three-judge \npanel of the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Damon J. Keith wrote, \n``A government operating in the shadow of secrecy stands in complete \nopposition to the society envisioned by the framers of our \nConstitution.''\n  The Justice Department has already conducted hundreds of these \nhearings out of sight of the press and the public. In doing so, the \nadministration has been able to decide the fate of each of these \nindividuals without recrimination.\n  It may be that all of these hearings were conducted properly and \nfairly, but there is just no way for us to know. Like so many other \nactions that this administration has taken on behalf of our safety, we \nhave no way of knowing whether what they have done was the right thing \nto do. Nobody in this administration or anywhere else is all wise. We \nhave no way of knowing whether the steps they have taken have really \nhelped to secure our safety. And we have no way of knowing whether the \nactions they took may have threatened our own liberties.\n  The administration argued that secrecy is necessary for these \nhearings because subjecting them to public scrutiny would compromise \nits fight against terrorism.\n  The court's concurring opinion addressed the merits of the \ngovernment's position, but it pointed out that a reasonable solution to \nthe administration's concerns could be achieved by requiring the \nGovernment to demonstrate the need for secrecy in each hearing on a \ncase-by-case basis.\n  Ultimately, the Court of Appeals saw the Government's argument for \nwhat it is; namely, a danger to our liberty. The court took the clear-\nheaded, clear-eyed position that excessive secrecy in matters such as \nthese compromises the very principles of free and open government that \nthe fight against terror is meant to protect.\n  Even with the best of intentions to justify the Government's actions, \nour freedoms are easily trampled when officials are allowed to exercise \nthe power of the Government without exposing their actions to the light \nof day.\n  As Judge Keith wrote, ``Democracies die behind closed doors.''\n  We have also seen evidence in the news of what the executive branch \nis capable of when it is allowed to operate behind closed doors. On \nAugust 23, just last month, the front page of the Washington Post \nbrought news of serious abuses of the laws that allow the Justice \nDepartment to conduct certain law enforcement activities in secret. \nThank providence, thank heaven for a free press. That is what we want \nto keep. That is what we want to maintain--a free press.\n  The Washington Post article revealed that on May 17, a secret court \nthat was created to oversee the Government's foreign intelligence \nactivities rejected new rules proposed by the Department of Justice \nthat would have expanded the ability of Federal investigators and \nprosecutors to operate in secret.\n  There you have it again--secret.\n  The Attorney General, John Ashcroft, wanted to tear down the walls \nbetween intelligence officials and law enforcement officials in the \nDepartment of Justice, allowing broad sharing of secret intelligence \ninformation among offices throughout the Department.\n  Mr. Ashcroft wanted to tear down these walls for a reason. The walls \nmake it harder for his Department to circumvent the constitutional \nobstacles faced by his investigators in trying to hunt down terrorists. \nAnd like others in this administration, Mr. Ashcroft has little \npatience or concern for the Constitution now that he is a general in \nthe President's ``war on terror.''\n  I voted for Mr. Ashcroft. I am not one of those who opposed his \nnomination. I was one of the few on this side of the aisle who voted \nfor Mr. Ashcroft's nomination. I have to say, I am disappointed. But \nMr. Ashcroft is not alone. Take a look at this administration.\n  Haven't you heard of the shadow government? That came to light a \nwhile back. All of a sudden, like the prophet's gourd, it just grew up \novernight.\n\n[[Page S8647]]\n\nHere is this shadow government. I had not been told about it. After \nall, I am chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate. I am \nnot the top Democrat in the Senate, but I am the senior Democrat in the \nSenate. I hadn't been told anything about it. I am the President pro \ntempore of the Senate; in other words, the President, for the time \nbeing. If the Vice President is not in the chair, I am the President of \nthe Senate. I hadn't been told anything about a shadow government.\n  Of course, I said time and time again how this great idea about a \nHomeland Security Department, at least the administration's great \nplans, suddenly sprang into existence, like Aphrodite, who sprang from \nthe ocean foam, or like Minerva, who sprang from the forehead of Jove \nfully armed and fully clothed.\n  All of this was a secret. We didn't know anything about this thing \nhatched out of the bosom of the White House--this great plan hatched \nout by four individuals in the bowels of the White House. So this White \nHouse, this administration, has a penchant for secrecy.\n  I am not going to point the finger just at Mr. Ashcroft. I voted for \nhim. On this side of the aisle, I voted for him. He used to serve in \nthis body. But Mr. Ashcroft wanted to tear down these walls for a \nreason. I say again, the walls make it harder, as all walls do, to get \nwherever you are going. The walls make it harder for his Department, \nMr. Ashcroft's Department, to circumvent, get around, the \nconstitutional obstacles faced by his investigators in trying to hunt \ndown terrorists.\n  He and others in this administration apparently have little patience \nand concern for the Constitution--here it is--now that he is a general \nin the President's war on terror. Today is September 17, 2002, in the \nyear of Our Lord; this is the day, 215 years ago, when our forefathers \nsigned their names, the framers of the Constitution signed their names \non the Constitution. They had completed their work, which had begun \nback in May 1787, and they signed their names on this Constitution. \nThis is the day. I will have more to say about that shortly.\n  But this secret court, which was created by Congress under the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, recognized the danger of tearing \ndown these protective walls. The act made it easier for Federal \ninvestigators to obtain evidence through wiretaps or physical searches \nwhen the evidence will be used for foreign intelligence purposes. \nTraditional criminal investigations require a higher standard for \nsearch warrants and wiretaps, to protect the constitutional rights of \nAmerican citizens. By trying to tear down the wall between the two, the \nAttorney General was hoping to lower the bar for obtaining evidence for \ncriminal investigations by expanding access to secret procedures used \nin foreign intelligence.\n  The wall between law enforcement and intelligence has always allowed \nfor cooperation in specific instances. In fact, this is the first time \nin the history of this secret court that an administration's request \nhas been rejected. But this cooperation has previously been allowed to \nprosecute people such as CIA mole Aldrich Ames, whose crime was \ninextricably linked to foreign intelligence. If this wall had fallen, \nthe Justice Department would be allowed to secretly investigate almost \nanyone who made an international phone call.\n  It is well to remember that the Patriot Act, passed in the aftermath \nof September 11, already lowered the bar for bypassing due process, \nprivacy, and individual freedom. The Justice Department argues that the \nPatriot Act also authorizes the elimination of the wall between \nintelligence and law enforcement.\n  Couple this momentum with a new Department primed to root out \nterrorism at home and abroad and a powerful new Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity with intelligence powers that cut across traditional lines of \nauthority, and one can easily see the possibility for abuse and for \nexcess. That is why I am standing on the floor--trying to draw the \nattention of the public, trying to capture the attention of my \ncolleagues, and trying to capture the media's attention. This is what I \nam talking about.\n  In reacting to the court's ruling, the Justice Department said:\n\n       We believe that the court's action unnecessarily narrowed \n     the Patriot Act and limited our ability to fully utilize the \n     authority Congress gave us.\n\n  Get that. It is the phrase ``fully utilize'' that gives me some \nspecial pause. Powers granted to this administration must continue to \nbe checked. Oh, I tell you, they need to be checked. The need for \nchecks on administrative powers is not just hypothetical, it is not \njust constitutional; I wish more would pay attention to that aspect of \nit. It has been well documented by recent Executive actions.\n  The most disturbing part of the secret court opinion is the \nrevelation that the Justice Department has already been abusing this \nsecret process, including 75 specific instances cited by the court in \nwhich FBI, or Justice officials, provided false statements in their \napplications for wiretaps and search orders, including one application \nsigned by then-FBI Director Louis B. Freeh.\n  The court cited these examples as evidence of the need to keep a \nclose eye on the Department's activities in order to prevent an \nenvironment in which cooperation becomes subordinated to the law \nenforcement agenda of the Attorney General.\n  While some of the abuses identified by the court occurred during the \nadministration of former President Clinton, rather than President Bush, \nthe need for oversight applies to every administration.\n  My concerns are not just based on who may be in the White House at a \nparticular moment. My concerns are based in the Constitution. These \nproblems transcend administrations. Administrations may come and go, \nbut the Constitution, like Tennyson's brook, goes on and on forever.\n  The war on terrorism must not be used by the executive branch--any \nexecutive branch. Mr. Bush certainly won't be in office forever. So one \nshould look even beyond this administration, whatever the next \nadministration will be. The war on terrorism must not be used by the \nexecutive branch as an excuse to ignore constitutional liberties behind \nclosed doors and to destroy the delicate checks and balances that have \nmade this Nation a great beacon for freedom to the world.\n  Congress is the leveler when it comes to precipitous actions. The \nSenate, in particular, is the place intended by the Framers for cooling \noff. A calm oasis where reason and cooler heads prevail against the \nheat of passion has always been found on the floor of the United States \nSenate, and I hope that we in this Chamber will again step up to that \ntraditional calling as we consider this matter in these extraordinary \ntimes.\n  In an election year, all politicians like to claim we have an answer \nfor even the Nation's most intractable problems, but in this case we \nunderestimate the intelligence of the American people if we believe \nthat merely offering them a new Department of Homeland Security will \nserve as currency to buy our way out of our continuing responsibilities \nunder the Constitution.\n  The people know that such a Department is no panacea for protection \nof our homeland. They will never forgive us if we are lax in our duty \nto safeguard traditional freedoms and American values based on the \nConstitution as we rush to fashion a new Department, even though that \nDepartment is intended to protect the American people from the \ninsidious danger of a virulent attack on our homeland.\n  In the name of homeland security, Congress must not be persuaded to \ngrant broad authorities to the administration that, given more careful \nthought, we would not grant. The House has already passed legislation \nto grant the President the authority to waive worker protections for \nFederal employees, to place the new Department's inspector general \nunder the thumb of the Homeland Security Secretary, to exempt the new \nDepartment from public disclosure laws, and to chip away at \ncongressional control of the power of the purse.\n  Close examination of the President's plan shows that the \nadministration is seeking more new powers which, unchecked, might be \nused to compromise the private lives of the American public.\n  Congress must never act so recklessly as to grant such broad \nstatutory powers to any President, even in the quest for something so \nvital as protection of our own land. So vital, the war\n\n[[Page S8648]]\n\non terror. We must exercise great caution. We must operate with the \nclear knowledge that once such powers are granted, they will reside in \nthe White House with future Presidents--Republican and Democrat--and \nthey will not be easily retrieved.\n  So once such powers are granted, they will not be easily retrieved. \nThey will reside in the White House. And everyone who knows anything \nabout the Constitution and about our experience in the political arena, \nanybody who knows anything about that, knows that no future President \nwill likely return those powers, likely give up those powers, once they \nhave been granted, and a Presidential veto in the future will be very \ndifficult to overcome, as such a veto is usually difficult to overcome. \nOnce the powers go down that avenue to the other end, they are gone for \na long time, and the only way they can be retrieved is by overriding a \nPresidential veto. And, of course, the Senators and everyone know that \nwill require a two-thirds vote. It will not make a difference whether \nthe President is Democrat, Republican, or Independent; He will want to \nkeep those powers. So be careful about granting them now.\n  Both the House-passed bill and the Lieberman bill substitute broad \nnew authority to the administration to create this new Department, but \nneither bill ensures that Congress remain involved. Neither the House \nbill nor the Lieberman bill ensure that Congress remain involved \nthroughout the implementation of the legislation.\n  Senator Lieberman's bill takes steps to ensure that Congress is \ninformed as the Department assumes its duties, but under his bill this \ninformation comes to us only after the fact. It is not enough just to \nbe told how the administration intends to use these statutory powers. \nCongress needs to retain some prerogatives so Congress can temper and \nshape the administration's exercise of these new authorities and so \nCongress can temper and shape the new Department's exercise of the new \nauthority.\n  So Congress has the responsibility to make sure we do not grant broad \nstatutory powers to the President and then just simply walk away from \nthe new Department, trusting that the administration will exercise \nrestraint. Congress must remain involved to ensure that the orderly \nimplementation of the Department does not flounder and that important \nworker rights and civil liberties do not fall into the breach.\n  Government reorganization is nothing novel. We have had Government \nreorganization before. And we have from time to time found new agencies \ncreated in the spotlight of political pressure and then left to \nlanguish and go awry in the twilight of mundane and practical purpose. \nThis could be a mistake.\n  This administration, since the September 11 attacks, has announced at \nleast three major governmental reorganizations prior to the President's \nproposal to create a new Homeland Security Department.\n  Last December, in response to numerous media reports criticizing the \nNation's porous borders, the administration proposed the consolidation \nof the Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nwithin the Justice Department.\n  Last March, following the mailing of two student visas by the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service to two of the September 11 \nhijackers 6 months after they crashed planes into the World Trade \nCenter Towers, the administration announced the INS would be \nreorganized, split into a services bureau on the one hand and a \nseparate enforcement bureau on the other.\n\n  Last May, following reports about intelligence failures by the FBI, \nthe administration announced a reorganization of the FBI. These \nreorganizations have either produced very little or they have been \nreplaced by subsequent additional reorganization proposals. It is as if \nwe are spinning around in circles with little left to show for all of \nthe energy expended but dizziness.\n  To avoid a similar fate to this new Department, I have an amendment \nto the Lieberman substitute that would ensure that the Congress \ncontinues to play a role. The Byrd amendment would create the \nsuperstructure of the new Department as outlined in the Lieberman bill, \nbut would require Congress to pass separate, more detailed legislation \nto transfer the agencies, functions, and employees to it.\n  The Byrd amendment would not change the intent of the Lieberman bill. \nLet me say this, Senator Lieberman is near the floor. I don't \nnecessarily have to keep the floor for the next hour. I can under the \norder that had been entered. I get first recognition. But there is \nstill an hour in this 2-hour period before the Senate goes back to the \nInterior appropriations bill. I welcome Mr. Lieberman's questions. I am \nhappy to discuss my amendment with him if he so desires before I give \nup the floor.\n  My amendment would immediately create a new Homeland Security \nDepartment. There it is. My amendment would create immediately a new \nHomeland Security Department. My amendment would immediately establish \nthe superstructure of the six directorates outlined by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. The Byrd amendment is not designed as an alternative \nto the Lieberman bill. I refer to it as the Lieberman bill. It is a \nbill that has been reported by the committee which Senator Lieberman so \nably chairs. So I refer to the bill as ``the Lieberman bill.'' Its \npurpose is to strengthen. The purpose of my amendment is to strengthen \nthe Lieberman bill. Its purpose is to ensure a strong Department \ncapable of protecting our people. But its enactment would also ensure \nthat the guiding hand of Congress would be there to help steer the \ncourse and stay the course.\n  What is more, any legislation submitted pursuant to this act would be \nreferred to the Governmental Affairs Committee in the Senate so that my \namendment, the Byrd amendment, would not deprive Senator Lieberman or \nhis committee of their jurisdiction or their expertise as we go about \nimplementing this new Department which will have been created by the \nLieberman bill. And, as I say, my amendment also creates that \nDepartment. My amendment allows the Department of Homeland Security to \nbe established just as Senator Lieberman envisioned. But the Byrd \namendment would give Congress additional opportunities to sift through \ndetails concerning worker rights, civil liberties, secrecy, and various \nduties and functions. Equally important, it would ensure that the \nagencies and the offices to be transferred into the Department can \ncontinue to perform their important work of protecting the homeland \nwhile the groundwork is being laid for their move to the new \nDepartment.\n\n  Just recently we have all noted in the media that--I believe six \npersons were arrested in New York, in Buffalo, NY. Six persons were \narrested. We didn't have any new Department of Homeland Security. There \nis no Department of Homeland Security that has been established. Yet \nthe work of securing our homeland goes forward by the persons who man--\nman or woman, I use the word ``man'' to mean both women and men--the \npersons who are on the borders, who are guarding the ports of entry, \nwho are looking at the huge containers that come into our ports, the \npersons who--right today and last night at midnight and all through the \nhours of this day, yesterday, the day before, and tomorrow--will \ncontinue to do their work even though there is no Department of \nHomeland Security. The FBI was on the job. The FBI has been on the job. \nAnd so the FBI brought about the arrest of these six persons, and they \nare being held.\n  So I say to the President and to anyone else: Nobody is holding up \nthe work of proceeding with the security of our country. The people who \nwill secure this Nation under a Homeland Security Department, if and \nwhen one is established, are the same people who are right now, right \nthis day, securing the homeland. These people have been on the job last \nnight, 6 months ago, and they continue to do this work. They have \nexpertise. They have experience. They are trained, and so on. So nobody \nis holding up the security of the country. Nobody is holding that up. \nThat is going forward, as was seen when the FBI arrested the six \npersons.\n  So this is vital. Ongoing reorganizations can foster chaos and \ndestroy worker morale. Orderliness and careful thought while we \ntransition can avoid overlooked vulnerabilities and missed nuances \nwhich could signal another disaster.\n  With the Byrd amendment, the Lieberman bill would transfer agencies\n\n[[Page S8649]]\n\nand functions to the Department, one and two directorates at a time, \nbeginning on February 3 of next year. This would then give Congress the \nopportunity to gauge and to monitor how the new Department is dealing \nwith transition and what additional changes might be necessary. It \nwould provide a means to quickly address the problems that will \nundoubtedly arise in the early phases of the Department's \nimplementation and to guard against mistakes and missteps.\n  The Byrd amendment would not delay the implementation of the new \nDepartment one whit. It would actually expedite the implementation of \nthe new Department by providing Congress with additional means to solve \nthe quandaries that traditionally plague and delay and disrupt massive \nreorganizations.\n  Here we are talking about 170,000 employees. We are talking about 28 \nagencies and offices--some have said 30. So this is no minor movement. \nThis is a major reorganization.\n  Moreover, the Congress could act to transfer agencies before the end \nof next year, roughly the same time period outlined by the Lieberman \nplan. When I say the Lieberman plan, I am talking about the bill that \nwas adopted by the committee, which Mr. Lieberman ably chaired. And \nthat is the same time period outlined by the House bill. So who is \nholding up anything? Why shouldn't we stop, look, and listen here and \ndo this thing in an orderly way? Do it right. Not necessarily do it \nnow, do it here, but do it right. The Lieberman plan provides the \nPresident with a 1-year transition period, beginning 30 days after the \ndate of enactment, effectively allowing up to 13 months before any \nagencies are transferred.\n  By then forcing the administration to come back to us--which the Byrd \namendment would do--we can insist on knowing more about the plans of \nthe administration with its penchant for secrecy--plans which are now \nonly hazy outlines. So if Congress passes the Lieberman proposal or if \nCongress passes the House proposal, Congress will just be turning the \nthing over to the administration, lock, stock and barrel, and saying: \nHere it is, Mr. President. You take it. You have 13 months in which to \ndo this, but it is all yours. Congress will just go off to the \nsidelines. Congress will have muzzled itself.\n  Whereas in the Byrd plan, the Byrd plan would also transfer these \nagencies. It would create a Homeland Security Department, and it would \nprovide for the transaction, the movement of these various agencies, \ntheir personnel and their assets, into the new Department over the same \nperiod, 13 months, but it would do it in an orderly process in an \norderly way, phased in, with Congress staying front and center and \ncontinuing to conduct oversight in this massive reorganization.\n  We must insist on assurances that in granting more powers to this \nadministration and to future administrations to investigate terrorism, \nwe are not also granting powers to jeopardize the rights, privacy, or \nprivileges of law-abiding citizens.\n  We must insist on assurances that the constitutional rights of \nAmericans remain protected. We must insist that the constitutional \ncontrol of the purse by the Congress is not compromised.\n  We must insist on assurances that Government reorganization will not \nbe used as a convenient device to dismantle time-honored worker \nprotections.\n  We must insist on the preservation of our Government's constitutional \nsystem of checks and balances and separation of powers. We have a \nresponsibility to do our very best as a nation to get this thing right. \nIf we are going to create a new Department, let's get it right.\n  We have a responsibility to ourselves and to future generations to \nensure that, in our zeal to build a fortress against terrorism, we are \nnot dismantling the fortress of our organic law--our Constitution--our \nliberties, and our American way of life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8649-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8649-S8652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Madam President, as I stated earlier, today is September 17, the \n215th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution in 1787. The \nConstitution is not noted for its soaring rhetoric or for the emotional \npower of its language, but it is nonetheless the most important \ndocument in our Nation's history.\n  Bar none, this Constitution that I hold in my hand is the most \nimportant document in our Nation's history. And it was meant, according \nto that eminent jurist John Marshall, to endure for ages--ages. It is \nnot irrelevant. This is relevant. This Constitution is relevant. It is, \nfront and center, relevant to today's issues.\n  The Declaration of Independence--which is also contained in this \nlittle book which I hold in my hand--with its ringing phrases, may have \nbeen a turning point in history, having laid out the case for breaking \nour ties with the Crown and setting us on the path to rebellion and \nliberty. There is no question in my mind but that it was a turning \npoint.\n  But the Constitution is the foundation upon which our subsequent \nhistory was built. In its plain speech, it forms the blueprint for an \nentirely new form of government never before seen in history and, to my \nmind, not yet matched by any other.\n  I am happy to call attention to this day--to the anniversary of the \nsigning of the Constitution.\n  As the Senate has been debating the homeland security bill, I have \nseveral times raised constitutional concerns about the way the homeland \nsecurity bill is structured. In doing so, I have often felt like a \nvoice crying out in the wilderness. Like a tree falling with no one to \nhear it, I have wondered if I was in fact making any progress and \nwondered if I was making any sound while I was talking. Was I making \nany sound?\n  I hope my colleagues and the American people will look at the \nConstitution, and I hope they will read it and they will study it. It \nis not long. It is not a huge volume. It doesn't contain many pages, \nand it isn't difficult to understand. But each time I read it, it seems \nI always find something new. It is like my reading of the Bible. It is \nlike my reading of Shakespeare. I always find what seems to be \nsomething new.\n  The Constitution is not written in fancy, lawyerlike phrases, or \nflowery 18th century language. Every citizen was meant to understand it \nand to participate in the exercise of government--that being the surest \ndefense against tyranny.\n  It is much like the Magna Carta, which indeed is a taproot, and \nbeyond--a taproot from which liberty sprang and a taproot from which \nour Constitution sprang--the Magna Carta, a great charter, the charter \nof the English people, which was signed by King John on June 15, 1215. \nThat was simple, but it was easily understood. It was written for \nordinary people to understand, and it has been read and reread by \nmillions through the centuries.\n  So read the Constitution. Look to history. I believe my concerns will \nbe shared.\n  Article I of the Constitution outlines the powers of the legislature. \nIt vests with the Congress the power to make laws. There it is. The \nfirst section of the first article says that all legislative powers \nherein are vested in the Congress of the United States, which shall \nconsist of a Senate and a House of Representatives. There it is--the \npower to make laws, the powers of the legislature.\n  Also, article I of the Constitution sets forth the qualifications and \nmeans of selecting representatives and the basic requirements for \ncongressional operations.\n  Therein one will find in section 2 where the Constitution sets forth \nthe creation of the House of Representatives, and then section 3 of the \nConstitution lays down the precepts and terms and the basis for the \ncreation of the Senate.\n  The Constitution is a user manual for Congress, the operating \nsoftware of the legislative branch. Article I, section 8, is the \ncritical list of congressional powers, including subsection 18 which \ngrants to Congress the power:\n\n       To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for \n     carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other \n     Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the \n     United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\n\n  You heard it here. Powers may be vested by the Constitution in the \nGovernment and its Departments or officers. But the Congress must pass \nthe\n\n[[Page S8650]]\n\nnecessary laws for those powers to be exercised. It is meant to be a \ncooperative affair, with Congress playing a critical role.\n  Further, in section 9, subsection 7, of article I, the Constitution \nstates that:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular \n     Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of \n     all public Money shall be published from time to time.\n\n  Congress again plays a critical role in providing funds for \nGovernment operations, and requires that the public be kept informed \nabout how those funds are spent.\n  One can trace our Nation's history going back into the centuries and \ncan trace these powers in the colonial governments, in the \nrepresentative assemblies of the Colonies. The people in the Colonies \nhad faith in their representative assemblies. Going back to the history \nof England, this has often been referred to as the ``motherland.''\n  Of course, we all know that the Spanish populated various areas in \nthe South and Southwest, St. Augustine, and New Mexico, and other \nareas. But the individuals who wrote the Constitution, who met in \nPhiladelphia, were British subjects. Some of them were born in the \nBritish Isles. They were English-speaking individuals. They knew about \nthe history of Englishmen, how the English had struggled to secure the \nrights of the people, the power of the purse, to secure the control of \nthe public purse for Parliament.\n  They knew that Parliament was created in the early 1300s during the \nreigns of Edward the First, Second, and Third. And they knew that the \npower of the purse had been lodged over a long period of centuries in \nCommons. That was made very clear by the English Bill of Rights which \nwas enacted by Parliament in 1689.\n  So there it was, the power of the purse, lodged in the hands of the \npeople's elected Representatives in Commons and now in Congress.\n  So Congress, as I say, plays a critical role in providing funds for \nGovernment operations, and the public must be kept informed about how \nthose funds are spent.\n  Part of that process, as I have indicated, by long tradition, has \noccurred during the testimony of Government officials before the \nCongress regarding their budget requests and the manner in which \nprevious appropriations have been spent. In the case of the proposed \nDepartment of Homeland Security, with its 170,000 employees and its \nenormous budget, such openness is equally to be expected, and should be \ndemanded, by the taxpaying public.\n\n  Article II of the Constitution concerns the establishment of the \nChief Executive, concerns the powers of the President, the \nqualifications and means of selecting the President, and his oath of \noffice being required. Article II, section 2, subsection 2 notes that \nthe President:\n\n     shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the \n     Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and \n     Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers \n     of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein \n     otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law \n     . . .\n\n  Well, Madam President, that would seem clearly to include the \nproposed Director of Homeland Security will be certainly one to whom \nthe provision in the Constitution is addressing, except that the \nsubsection continues:\n\n     but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \n     inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President \n     alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\n\n  If the Congress does not wish to provide for accountability or wish \nto have any voice in the selection of important Government officials, \nthe Congress must take deliberate action to divest itself of its \nconstitutional role in the operations of Government.\n  The authors of the Constitution clearly foresaw the growth of \nGovernment and recognized that the Congress could consume itself in \nprocessing the appointments of hundreds of minor officials. However, I \nsincerely doubt that these wise men would expect that a cabinet level \nofficial heading up an enormous department with a mission of grave \nimportance to the Nation would receive less scrutiny and less oversight \nthan so many officials whose positions do not involve the defense of \nour vital domestic security. That does not make sense. It is not \nlogical. It is ludicrous. The Senate would not provide its advice and \nconsent in the selection of the Director of Homeland Security, while \nAssistant Secretaries and Deputy Assistant Secretaries in other \nDepartments are subject to confirmation? I cannot believe that the \nSenate cares less for the Department of Homeland Security and its \nDirector than it does for so many other Government officials with \nsmaller budgets and more narrow portfolios.\n  No, Madam President, I can only surmise that any willingness on the \npart of the Senate to abrogate its constitutional responsibilities and \npowers comes from a lack of attention to the deceptively plain language \nof the Constitution itself. Perhaps we should gussie it up, wrap it \nlegalistic bells and whistles, enshroud it in ``wheras-es'' and ``let \nit therefore be resolved'' clauses, so that it receives the respect \nthat it deserves. But, in fact, even Article III, concerning the \njudicial power of the United States, has no highfaluting lawyer words. \nArticle IV, concerning the powers of the States; Article V, the process \nby which the Constitution may be amended; Article VI, making the \nConstitution the supreme law of the land, and Article VII, regarding \nratification--none of these short Articles contains any obscure, \nopaque, misleading, or confusing language. Really, considering how many \nlawyers were involved in the drafting of the Constitution--a little \nmore than half of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention were \nlawyers--it is a model of clarity and clean writing.\n  Indeed, the men who drafted the Constitution were as much heroes as \nthose who signed the Declaration of Independence, making themselves \nknown as traitors and wanted men in England, traitors to the Crown. \nThey were treasonous. They committed treason. And they could have been \nhunted down and sent off to England and been executed. The Framers of \nthe Constitution undertook a mighty task. They had to preserve the \nNation's hard-won freedom by correcting the flaws in the Articles of \nConfederation that made the Nation weak and vulnerable to attack from \nwithout and rebellion from within. Drawing upon the lessons of history \nand the ideals of the Enlightenment, they set themselves the job of \ndevising a novel form of government that could encompass the great \ndiversity of the new Nation--from the mercantile North to the \nslaveholding South, from the settled East to the frontier West, with \ncitizens from cultures around the globe.\n\n  In Philadelphia, in the hot summer of 1789, after lengthy and \ncontentious debate, after considering and rejecting proposal after \nproposal, and after nearly 600 separate votes, they produced the \nmiracle that is our Constitution. And so there you have it. In over 200 \nyears, it has been amended 27 times, and 10 of the 27 amendments were \nratified early on, by 1791.\n  In today's computer-minded lexicon, the Constitution is the mother \nboard without which our thinking, evolving, machine of Government could \nnot function. It is the enduring standard operating system, running the \ncomplex interactive software of national life. It is our embedded code, \nand when we overwrite it without careful consideration, we may well be \nplanting the worms of our own destruction.\n  When the Executive acquires too much power and freedom of action \nunchecked by the balancing powers and oversight of the legislative \nbranch, our careful system of checks and balances is in danger of being \ncorrupted.\n  So on this anniversary of the signing of the Constitution, we would \ndo well to revisit this miracle of compromise and foresight. We would \ndo well to marvel at the abilities of the men who crafted this \ndocument. We would do well to rededicate ourselves to its careful \npreservation that it might see us through another two centuries and \nmore.\n\n     Our fathers in a wondrous age,\n     Ere yet the Earth was small,\n     Ensured to us an heritage,\n     And doubted not at all\n\n     That we, the children of their heart,\n     Which then did beat so high,\n     In later time should play like part\n     For our posterity.\n\n     Then fretful murmur not they gave\n     So great a charge to keep,\n     Nor dream that awestruck time shall save\n     Their labour while we sleep.\n\n     Dear-bought and clear, a thousand year\n\n[[Page S8651]]\n\n     Our fathers' title runs.\n     Make we likewise their sacrifice.\n     Defrauding not our sons.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Washington Post \ntitled ``Secret Court Rebuffs Ashcroft,'' to which I have already \nreferred, and the New York Times op-ed titled ``Secrecy Is Our Enemy,'' \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 23, 2002]\n\n                     Secret Court Rebuffs Ashcroft\n\n                    (By Dan Egen and Susan Schmidt)\n\n       The secretive federal court that approves spying on terror \n     suspects in the United States has refused to give the Justice \n     Department broad new powers, saying the government had \n     misused the law and misled the court dozens of times, \n     according to an extraordinary legal ruling released \n     yesterday.\n       A May 17 opinion by the court that oversees the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) alleges that Justice \n     Department and FBI officials supplied erroneous information \n     to the court in more than 75 applications for search warrants \n     and wiretaps, including one signed by then-FBI Director Louis \n     J. Freeh.\n       Authorities also improperly shared intelligence information \n     with agents and prosecutors handling criminal cases in New \n     York on at least four occasions, the judges said.\n       Given such problems, the court found that new procedures \n     proposed by Attorney General John D. Ashcroft in March would \n     have given prosecutors too much control over \n     counterintelligence investigations and would have effectively \n     allowed the government to misuse intelligence information for \n     criminal cases, according to the ruling.\n       The dispute between the Justice Department and the FISA \n     court, which has raged behind closed doors until yesterday, \n     strikes at the heart of Ashcroft's attempts since Sept. 11 to \n     allow investigators in terrorism and espionage to share more \n     information with criminal investigators.\n       Generally, the Justice Department must seek the FISA \n     court's permission to give prosecutors of criminal cases any \n     information gathered by the FBI in an intelligence \n     investigation. Ashcroft had proposed that criminal-case \n     prosecutors be given routine access to such intelligence \n     information, and that they be allowed to direct intelligence \n     investigation as well as criminal investigation.\n       The FISA court agreed with other proposed rule changes. But \n     Ashcroft filed an appeal yesterday over the rejected \n     procedures that would constitute the first formal challenge \n     to the FISA court in its 23-year history, officials, said.\n       ``We believe the court's action unnecessarily narrowed the \n     Patriot Act and limited our ability to fully utilize the \n     authority Congress gave us,'' the Justice Department said in \n     a statement.\n       The documents released yesterday also provide a rare \n     glimpse into the workings of the almost entirely secret FISA \n     court, composed of a rotating panel of federal judges from \n     around the United States and, until yesterday, had never \n     jointly approved the release of one of its opinions. \n     Ironically, the Justice Department itself had opposed the \n     release.\n       Stewart Baker, former general counsel of the National \n     Security Agency, called the opinion a ``a public rebuke.\n       ``The message is you need better quality control,'' Baker \n     said. ``The judges want to ensure they have information they \n     can rely on implicitly.''\n       A senior Justice Department official said that the FISA \n     court has not curtailed any investigations that involved \n     misrepresented or erroneous information, nor has any court \n     suppressed evidence in any related criminal case. He said \n     that many of the misrepresentations were simply repetitions \n     of earlier errors, because wiretap warrants must be renewed \n     every 90 days. The FISA court approves about 1,000 warrants a \n     year.\n       The department discovered the misrepresentation and \n     reported them to the FISA court beginning in 2000.\n       Enacted in the wake of the domestic spying scandals of the \n     Nixon era, the FISA statute created a secret process and \n     secret court to review requests to wiretap phones and conduct \n     searches aimed at spies, terrorists and other U.S. enemies.\n       FISA warrants have been primarily aimed at intelligence-\n     gathering rather than investigating crimes. But Bush \n     administration officials and many leading lawmakers have \n     complained since Sept. 11 that such limits hampered the \n     ability of officials to investigate suspected terrorists, \n     including alleged hijacking conspirator Zacaris Moussaoui.\n       The law requires agents to be able to show probable cause \n     that the subject of the search is an agent of a foreign \n     government or terrorist group, and authorizes strict limits \n     on distribution of information because the standards for \n     obtaining FISA warrants are much lower than for traditional \n     criminal warrants.\n       In Moussaoui's case, the FBI did not seek an FISA warrant \n     to search his laptop computer and other belongings in the \n     weeks prior to the Sept. 11 attacks because some officials \n     believed that they could not adequately show the court \n     Moussaoui's connection to a foreign terrorist group.\n       The USA Patriot Act, a set of anti-terrorism measures \n     passed last fall, softened the standards for obtaining \n     intelligence warrants, requiring that foreign intelligence be \n     a significant, rather than primary, purpose of the \n     investigation. The FISA court said in its ruling that the \n     new law was not relevant to its decision.\n       Despite its rebuke, the court left the door open for a \n     possible solution, noting that its decision was based on the \n     existing FISA statute and that lawmakers were free to update \n     the law if they wished.\n       Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have indicated \n     their willingness to enact such reforms but have complained \n     about resistance from Ashcroft. Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-\n     Vt.) said yesterday's release was a ``ray of sunshine'' \n     compared to a ``lack of cooperation'' from the Bush \n     administration.\n       Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), another committee \n     member, said the legal opinion will ``help us determine \n     what's wrong with the FISA process, including what went wrong \n     in the Zacarias Moussaoui case. The stakes couldn't be higher \n     for our national security at home and abroad.''\n       The ruling, signed by the court's previous chief, U.S. \n     District Judge Royce C. Lamberth, was released by the new \n     presiding judge, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.\n       FBI and Justice Department officials have said that the \n     fear of being rejected by the FISA court, complicated by \n     disputes such as those revealed yesterday, has at times \n     caused both FBI and Justice officials to take a cautious \n     approach to intelligence warrants.\n       Until the current dispute, the FISA court had approved all \n     but one application sought by the government since the \n     court's inception. Civil libertarians claim that record shows \n     that the court is a rubber stamp for the government; \n     proponents of stronger law enforcement say the record reveals \n     a timid bureaucracy only willing to seek warrants on sure \n     winners.\n       The opinion itself--and the court's unprecedented decision \n     to release it--suggest that relations between the court and \n     officials at the Justice Department and the FBI have frayed \n     badly.\n       FISA applications are voluminous documents, containing \n     boilerplate language as well as details specific to each \n     circumstance. The judges did not say the misrepresentations \n     were intended to mislead the court, but said that in addition \n     to erroneous statements, important facts have been omitted \n     from some FISA applications.\n       In one case, the FISA judges were so angered by \n     inaccuracies in affidavits submitted by FBI agent Michael \n     Resnick that they barred him from ever appearing before the \n     court, according to the ruling and government sources.\n       Referring to the ``the troubling number of inaccurate FBI \n     affidavits in so many FISA applications,'' the court said in \n     its opinion: ``In virtually every instance, the government's \n     misstatements and omissions in FISA applications and \n     violations of the Court's orders involved information sharing \n     and unauthorized disseminations to criminal investigators and \n     prosecutors.''\n       The judges were also clearly perturbed at a lack of answers \n     about the problems from the Justice Department, which is \n     still conducting an internal investigation into the lapses.\n       ``How these misrepresentations occurred remains unexplained \n     to the court,'' the opinion said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 2, 2002]\n\n                          Secrecy Is Our Enemy\n\n                            (By Bob Herbert)\n\n       You want an American hero? A real hero?\n       I nominate Judge Damon J. Keith of the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n       Judge Keith wrote an opinion, handed down last Monday by a \n     three-judge panel in Cincinnati, that clarified and \n     reaffirmed some crucially important democratic principles \n     that have been in danger of being discarded since the \n     terrorist attacks last Sept. 11.\n       The opinion was a reflection of true patriotism, a 21st-\n     century echo of a pair of comments made by John Adams nearly \n     two centuries ago. ``Liberty,'' said Adams, ``cannot be \n     preserved without a general knowledge among the people.''\n       And in a letter to Thomas Jefferson in 1816, Adams said, \n     ``Power must never be trusted without a check.''\n       Last Monday's opinion declared that it was unlawful for the \n     Bush administration to conduct deportation hearings in secret \n     whenever the government asserted that the people involved \n     might be linked to terrorism.\n       The Justice Department has conducted hundreds of such \n     hearings, out of sight of the press and the public. In some \n     instances the fact that the hearings were held was kept \n     secret.\n       The administration argued that opening up the hearings \n     would compromise its fight against terrorism. Judge Keith, \n     and the two concurring judges in the unanimous ruling, took \n     the position that excessive secrecy compromised the very \n     principles of free and open government that the fight against \n     terror is meant to protect.\n       The opinion was forceful and frequently eloquent.\n       ``Democracies die behind closed doors,'' wrote Judge Keith.\n\n[[Page S8652]]\n\n       He said the First Amendment and a free press protect the \n     ``people's right to know'' that their government is acting \n     fairly and lawfully. ``When government begins closing \n     doors,'' he said, ``it selectively controls information \n     rightfully belonging to the people. Selective information is \n     misinformation.''\n       He said, ``A government operating in the shadow of secrecy \n     stands in complete opposition to the society envisioned by \n     the framers of our Constitution.''\n       The concurring judges were Martha Craig Daughtrey and James \n     G. Carr. The panel acknowledged--and said it even shared--\n     ``the government's fear that dangerous information might be \n     disclosed in some of these hearings.'' But the judges said \n     when that possibility arises, the proper procedure for the \n     government would be to explain ``on a case-by-case basis'' \n     why the hearing should be closed.\n       ``Using this stricter standard,'' wrote Judge Keith, ``does \n     not mean that information helpful to terrorists will be \n     disclosed, only that the government must be more targeted and \n     precise in its approach.''\n       A blanket policy of secrecy, the court said, is \n     unconstitutional.\n       The case that led to the panel's ruling involved a Muslim \n     clergyman in Ann Arbor, Mich., Rabih Haddad, who overstayed \n     his tourist visa. The ruling is binding on courts in \n     Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee and may serve as a \n     precedent in other jurisdictions.\n       The attorneys who argued the case against the government \n     represented four Michigan newspapers and Representative John \n     Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat. They took no position on \n     whether Mr. Haddad should be deported.\n       ``Secrecy is the evil here,'' said Herschel P. Fink, a \n     lawyer who represented The Detroit Free Press. He said the \n     government ``absolutely'' had an obligation to ``vigorously'' \n     fight terrorism. But excessive secrecy, he said, was \n     intolerable.\n       ``We just want to watch,'' said Mr. Fink.\n       Judge Keith specifically addressed that issue. The people, \n     he said, had deputized the press ``as the guardians of their \n     liberty.''\n       The essence of the ruling was the reaffirmation of the \n     importance of our nation's system of checks and balances. \n     While the executive branch has tremendous power and authority \n     with regard to immigration issues and the national defense, \n     it does not have carte blanche.\n       Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties \n     Union who represented some of the plaintiffs in the case, \n     noted that the administration has been arguing since Sept. 11 \n     that it needs much more authority to act unilaterally and \n     without scrutiny by the public and the courts.\n       He said last week's ruling was the most recent and, thus \n     far, the most important to assert, ``That's not the way it's \n     done in our system.''\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8652-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8652-S8656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will be brief. The President again \ntoday admonished the Senate for moving slowly on homeland security. He \nagain told his audience that he was very concerned that we are moving \nslowly on an issue of great import in terms of his design on homeland \nsecurity and the need for a recognition of national security through \nthis legislation.\n  Let me simply say to the President and to anybody else who has \nquestion: There is no desire to slow down this legislation. There are \nSenators who have very significant concerns about various provisions, \nbut there ought to be no question about our desire to continue to work \nto complete the deliberation of this legislation and send it to \nconference as quickly as possible.\n  We have only had an opportunity to debate one amendment and bring it \nto closure. It would be my hope we could take up Senator Byrd's \namendment sometime very soon and we could take up other amendments to \nthe legislation as soon as possible. We have now been on this bill for \n3 weeks, and I understand why some would be concerned about the pace \nwith which the Senate is dealing with this legislation.\n  I discussed the matter with Senator Lott, and I think he shares my \nview that we have to move the bill along. I note that if the President \nhad supported homeland security legislation when the Democrats first \noffered it last summer, we probably would have completed it by now. It \ntook them about 2 months to respond to the actions taken by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in the Senate. But that has been done. \nThey have responded, and we have worked with them to come up with a \nplan of which we are very proud and a product that can be addressed.\n  Senator Byrd has a good amendment. There are others who have \namendments as well, but the time has come to move on. I had originally \nhoped we could get an agreement that only relevant amendments would be \noffered. We have not had a case of nonrelevant amendments. We have had \na case of no amendments in this process. It is very important for us to \ndemonstrate to the American people, it is very important for us to make \nas clear as we can that we want to come to closure on this \nlegislation--take up amendments and deal with them effectively, but the \namendments ought to be germane and we ought to work within a timeframe.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, with respect to the Lieberman \nsubstitute amendment to the homeland security bill, I send a cloture \nmotion to the desk.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask the leader if he will add my name to \nthat cloture motion.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to add the Senator's name.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I give the distinguished majority leader \nmy power of attorney to sign this for me. Everybody in the country \nknows about my trembling hands. So I hope the majority will sign this \nfor me.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I have \nthat right, and we will accommodate the Senator's request. I appreciate \nvery much his support of the cloture motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The cloture motion having been presented under rule XXII, the Chair \ndirects the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Lieberman \n     substitute amendment No. 4471 for H.R. 5005, Homeland \n     Security legislation.\n             Jean Carnahan, Herb Kohl, Jack Reed (RI), Richard J. \n           Durbin, Kent Conrad, Paul Wellstone, Jim Jeffords, Max \n           Baucus, Tom Harkin, Harry Reid (NV), Patrick Leahy, \n           Jeff Bingaman, Barbara Boxer, Byron L. Dorgan, Mark \n           Dayton, Debbie Stabenow, Robert Torricelli, Mary \n           Landrieu, Joseph Lieberman, Robert C. Byrd.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we now have two cloture motions before \nthe Senate. The first one ripens this afternoon at 5:15. That is on the \namendment offered by Senator Byrd to the Interior appropriations bill.\n  We cannot get to the rest of the business before us unless that \ncloture motion is agreed to. There can be no excuse, there can be no \nreason, after all this debate, after all the meetings, that we cannot \nat least bring closure to that amendment.\n  Senators still have a right to offer amendments to the bill, but we \nhave to move on. I cannot imagine that there would be a Senator who \nwould want to extend debate beyond the 3 weeks we have now debated \nInterior and the Byrd amendment. The same could be said of homeland \nsecurity. If we want to respond to the President, who again today said \nthe time for the Senate to act is now, let's respond on a bipartisan \nbasis and let's vote for cloture on the Lieberman substitute and let's \nmove this legislation along.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly about the upcoming cloture vote and also about the status of \nour progress on the homeland security bill and the progress of the \nSenate on its fundamental responsibility to have a budget or make \nappropriations.\n  I would have thought that on September 17, the day the Constitution \nwas ratified, there would be more regard for the constitutional \nresponsibility of the Senate. We have the power of appropriation, but \nwe are not handling our duties. Much as I dislike saying so, I believe \nthe Senate is dysfunctional. Harsh, perhaps, but true, certainly. We \nare simply not getting the job done.\n\n  I am a little surprised to see a cloture motion filed on an amendment \nto an appropriations bill. If there were protracted debate, if there \nwere an effort to stall, if there were some attempt made to delay the \nproceedings of\n\n[[Page S8653]]\n\nthe Senate, perhaps so. But there are Senators who want to vote on an \nimportant issue relating to the forests, especially in the West, and \nthe dangers of fire. They have been seeking a vote but have not been \nable to get one.\n  I intend to vote against cloture, to give Senators a chance to \npresent their amendment. That is not to say I will support the \namendment, but I believe the Senators ought to have an opportunity to \npresent their amendment.\n  Cloture has now been filed on the homeland security bill. We are now \nin our third week after returning from the August recess, and the \nSenate has done virtually nothing during that period of time. We have \nhad prolonged speeches on generalizations which have, in fact, impeded \nthe progress of the homeland security bill. We were in a position to \nvote on the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut \nlast Thursday, but it could not get a vote because the time was \nconsumed with speechmaking. Now, I like speechmaking as much as the \nnext Senator, but there has to be some balance as to what is being \ndone. And again this afternoon--I had not known unanimous consent was \ngranted--more lengthy speeches, without really getting to the substance \nof what the Senate ought to be doing.\n  We have not passed any appropriations bill among the 13 we are \ncharged with passing. Now, this is September 17, 13 days away from the \nend of the fiscal year, with only a few working days left. The \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill lies dormant. It has been \npassed by both bodies, but there hasn't been a conference. The military \nconstruction appropriations bill lies dormant. Again, it has been \npassed by both bodies but there hasn't been a conference.\n  We are fighting a war at the present time. We are cleaning up the \nremnants of other wars, in Kosovo and in Bosnia, and our troops are in \nAfghanistan. We will be called upon soon to vote on a resolution which \nmay send us to war against Iraq.\n  Now, what are we doing for the Department of Defense? We have a very \nsubstantial increase in defense funding, but the way it looks now, we \nare going to be having a continuing resolution. What the House has said \nought to be adopted and what the Senate has said ought to be adopted \nwill be curtailed very drastically if we have a continuing resolution. \nSo we are simply not doing our job.\n  Then we have 11 other appropriations bills. I have the \nresponsibility, as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education, to prepare a very major bill which \nfunds the Department of Education, the major capital investment of \nAmerica, the Department of Health and Human Services, which is very \nimportant, and the Department of Labor on worker safety. But we are not \nmoving to pass the bill.\n  The National Institutes of Health, probably the best investment this \nCongress makes, the crown jewel of the Federal Government--perhaps the \nonly jewel of the Federal Government--has an increase of $3.5 billion \nin this year's appropriations bill. But as of this reading, it is \nunlikely to comment on its operation because we are not going to pass \nthe bill.\n\n  We are told that the Department of Defense appropriations bill is \nbeing held up because we have not established the allocations. Why \nhaven't we established allocations? We haven't established allocations \nbecause there is no budget. The Budget Act was passed in 1974, and this \nis the first year there hasn't been a budget passed.\n  As I am approaching the end of my 22nd year in this body, not an \ninconsiderable period of time, I have not seen the Senate in such \ndisarray as we are at the present time.\n  We had a vote several weeks ago on what was the equivalent of \ndeeming. That is legal jargon, Senate jargon, for making out as if we \nhad passed a budget to establish a figure. It required 60 votes to have \nthis amendment passed--I was sorely tempted to vote for it--which would \nhave established the Senate budget $9 billion above the House budget. I \ndo believe we need a budget, because if we do not, we are going to be \npassing appropriations bills which far exceed the purported \nallocations.\n  It is customary, on the attractive education proposals and the \nattractive health proposals, to get into the high fifties. With a 60-\nvote requirement, those amendments are not passed, but they are very \ntempting amendments. When I responded to the rollcall, with 59 Senators \nhaving voted aye on the deeming resolution, I just was not going to do \nit, notwithstanding my deep commitment to the appropriations process \nand notwithstanding my knowledge that it was fairly important to have a \nbudget figure.\n  But if we are going to use a shortcut, if we are going to use a \nsubstitute, what is the point of having a budget resolution? If the \nBudget Committee knows it can be derelict in its duty and be bailed out \nby 60 Senators who will say, awe, shucks, let's go ahead and do it \nanyway, what is the point to have the Budget Committee do its job next \nyear or any year?\n  The previous chairman of the Budget Committee told me--the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New Mexico is sitting in front of \nme--that he will be chairman next year. If I was sure of that, I would \nhave voted for deeming. But I am not sure of much of anything on the \ncurrent posture.\n  So it is my hope that we will move ahead and have votes and let there \nbe a vote on this issue on the course. But let us proceed to vote on \nthe homeland security issues which are very important.\n  One of the critical issues on homeland security, in my judgment, is \nto have the analysis of all the agencies--FBI, CIA, NSA--under one \numbrella.\n  Had that been done prior to September 11, 2001, I think that \ncatastrophe might have been avoided. There were lots of danger signals. \nThere were lots of dots on the board.\n  There was the July FBI Phoenix memorandum about a man taking flight \ntraining and two al-Qaida men in Kuala Lumpur, known to the CIA, who \nlater turned out to be pilots on the hijacked planes. The CIA didn't \nbother to tell the FBI or INS.\n  You had the NSA warning on September 10 that something was going to \nhappen the next day. But nobody bothered to translate it until \nSeptember 12.\n  Then you had the matter of Zacarias Moussaoui, a much celebrated \npersonality today with the litigation in the Federal court. But had the \nFBI obtained a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \nthere was a treasure trove of information linking Moussaoui to al-\nQaida. And there was a virtual blueprint, had all the dots been put \ntogether.\n  After September 11, I opposed the creation of an independent \ncommission because it seemed to me the Intelligence Committees could do \nthe job. I understood that they couldn't move ahead immediately with \nhearings in closed session and then in open session in order to give \nthe intelligence community an opportunity to regroup. But that time has \nlong passed, and now we find the Intelligence Committees are embroiled \nin another investigation; that is, an investigation by the FBI against \nthe Intelligence Committees.\n  It is very difficult to understand how the Intelligence Committees \ncan be investigating the FBI and the CIA and other intelligence \nagencies, and then, having a leak of classified material, to have the \nFBI investigate the intelligence committees. I wrote to the chairmen \nand vice chairmen of both the House and Senate, strongly urging them \nnot to do that--that you simply can't have investigators being \ninvestigated by those who are under investigation.\n  Then you have the issue of separation of powers. If the FBI is going \nto be able to investigate the Congress, what independence does the \nCongress have in our oversight function?\n  So the Intelligence Committees have not moved ahead for that job. The \nonly alternative now is an independent commission. I worked as one of \nthe younger lawyers on the Warren Commission staff many years ago. I \nsay ``younger lawyer'' because I am still a young lawyer. And, while \nthe Warren Commission has received a fair amount of critical analysis \nover the years, the essential conclusions have held up--that Oswald was \nthe sole assassin, or the single bullet that went through both the \nPresident and Governor Connolly and the President was struck by a later \nbullet which killed him. So I have now come to conclude that we need an \nindependent commission.\n  But most of all we need a Senate which will move ahead in its duties \nand obligations. This is a good day, September 17. September 17, 1787, \nwas the\n\n[[Page S8654]]\n\nday the Constitution was signed. So, 215 years later, that ought to be \na hallmark for us to move ahead and discharge our duties.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I was en route here and was watching \nand saw the Senator from Pennsylvania speaking. I got here as fast as I \ncould because I was wondering when somebody would say what he has said. \nFrankly, I am sorry the distinguished President pro tempore is not \nhere, or I would ask him the same question: When do we intend? When \nwould he let us vote on this very important, new Cabinet position and \nthe Cabinet organization that goes with it?\n  I heard much of what he wants to say. I know he wants to win. But I \nbelieve it is important that when we are at war, we proceed with some \ndispatch to give the President what he wants. If the distinguished \nSenator is going to lose, we all lose sometimes. If he is going to win, \nmaybe he will win sooner than he thinks. But it is taking a long time \nand getting nowhere. And I think we know the issues on that new piece, \nthat new Department of our Federal Government. I think he ought to let \nus proceed with it.\n  My further observation has to do with appropriations. You know, we \nare all tied in knots because we didn't get a budget resolution, and \nevery time we say it, somebody should be here on our side of the aisle \nbecause it is not our fault. It is not me as ranking member. It is not \nmy fault. And it is not my fault in any other capacity. I have been on \nthat committee for 25 years, and never did I not get a budget \nresolution when I was chairman. One way or another, we got a budget \nresolution.\n  Now we don't know which appropriations numbers to follow, the bigger \nnumber in the House or the Senate or vice versa. At least that much \nwould be resolved with a budget resolution. I hope we learn from it and \nwe get on to our business today.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam, President, my amendment, No. 4554, would \nestablish an Office of National Capital Region Coordination within a \nnewly-created Department of Homeland Security. Joining me in offering \nthis amendment are Senators Warner, Mikulski, and Allen.\n  The September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the Pentagon underscored \nthe unique challenges the National Capital Region faces in emergency \npreparedness. A recent editorial in the Washington Post perhaps \ndescribed the problem best:\n\n       Sept. 11 laid bare the truth about the national capital \n     region's preparedness for a major terrorist attack. That \n     fateful day revealed that the area's 5 million residents, the \n     federal government's far-flung operations and the varied \n     state and local jurisdictions were ill-prepared for the kind \n     of emergencies that could result from bioterrorism or other \n     murderous terrorist strikes . . . . It will be no easy feat, \n     converting a region containing three branches of the federal \n     government, two states, and the District of Columbia, each \n     with separate police forces and emergency plans--but all \n     using the same roads and bridges--into a well-coordinated \n     governmental operating complex . . .\n\n  In no other area of the country must vital decisionmaking and \ncoordination occur between an independent city, two States, seventeen \ndistinct local and regional authorities, including more than a dozen \nlocal police and Federal protective forces, and numerous Federal \nagencies.\n  In hearings before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the \nDistrict of Columbia, Senator Mary Landrieu, the Distinguished Chair of \nthe Subcommittee, and virtually every witness highlighted the region's \nhigh risk for terrorism and the critical need for coordinated and \ntimely communication between the Federal Government and the surrounding \nState and local jurisdictions. I want to commend Senator Landrieu for \nher leadership on this very important issue and for working to address \nthe emergency preparedness funding needs of the District of Columbia \nand the Washington Metro system.\n  Over the past year significant progress has been made on the State \nand local levels in emergency response protocols. The Metropolitan \nWashington Council of Governments, COG, the association representing \nthe 17 major cities and counties in the region, should be commended for \nthe strong partnerships and initiatives they have nurtured over the \npast twelve months, including the creation of the COG Ad Hoc Task Force \non Homeland Security and the development of a Regional Emergency \nResponse Plan.\n  Similarly, at a summit meeting convened last month, the mayor of the \nDistrict of Columbia and the Governors of Maryland and Virginia took a \nmajor step forward with the signing of an eight-point ``Commitments to \nAction'' to improve coordination. Unfortunately, the Office of Homeland \nSecurity, which helped convene the summit, is not a party to the \nagreement.\n  What is still lacking, however, is the integration of the Federal \nGovernment's many and diverse protocols in the region with those of \nState and local authorities. This past August, a plan known as the \nFederal Emergency Decision and Notification Protocol was announced by \nthe Administration, giving the directors of the Office of Personnel \nManagement, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the General \nServices Administration the authority to release Federal employees in \nthe area and around the country. However, as an August 17, 2002 article \nin the Washington Post notes, ``[left unclear by the plan is how \nFederal agencies execute the evacuation. Congress and the courts are \nindependent of the President. Even Cabinet secretaries and senior \nagency directors have autonomy over their employees and buildings . . . \n.''\n  I commend to my colleagues the September 10, 2002 edition of the \nWashington Post which featured a story detailing the status of \nemergency planning in the area, noting the work yet to be done by the \nFederal Government.\n  The unique and dominant Federal presence in this region obligates the \nFederal Government to become a fully cooperative partner in the \nregion's efforts at emergency planning and preparedness.\n  One of the key goals of a new Department of Homeland Security is to \nconsolidate the components of the Federal Government playing an \nintegral role in the protection of the homeland, both existing and yet-\nto-be-created, into one single entity whose purpose is to coordinate \nthese components and facilitate their individual missions.\n  In the National Capital Region, the many branches and agencies of the \nFederal Government similarly necessitate a single voice to aid and \nencourage the significant efforts already being undertaken by State, \nlocal, and regional authorities. It is with this goal in mind that my \namendment proposes the creation of an office within a Department of \nHomeland Security that would provide such a voice.\n  The Office of National Capital Region Coordination would establish a \nsingle Federal point of contact within a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. This office would not only coordinate the activities of the \nDepartment affecting the Nation's Capital, but also act as a one-stop \nshop through which State, local, and regional authorities can look for \nmeaningful access to the plans and preparedness activities of the \nnumerous other Federal agencies and entities in the region. Likewise, \nthis new office would become the vehicle used by the multitude of \nFederal entities in the area to receive vital information and input \nfrom the state, local, and regional level in the development of the \nFederal Government's planning efforts.\n  In short, the Office of National Capital Region Coordination would \nensure that the Federal Government takes a place at the table as this \nregion makes unprecedented attempts to coordinate the work of its many \nState, local, and regional authorities.\n  The need for such an office has been expressed and supported by many \nof the most important participants and stakeholders in the area's \nterrorism preparedness activities, including COG, WMATA, the Greater \nWashington Board of Trade, and the Potomac Electric Power Company, \nPEPCO. I ask that letters of support from these groups be printed in \nthe Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. A year has passed since the horrific attacks of \nSeptember 11th, and as we debate the shape and form of a new Department \nof Homeland Security, the time has come for the Federal Government to \nfulfill its obligations to the National Capital Region\n\n[[Page S8655]]\n\nand those dedicated to preserving its safety. I would urge my \ncolleagues to support this important amendment.\n\n                                         Pepco Holdings, Inc.,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 2002.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Government Affairs, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lieberman: As Chief Executive Officer of \n     Pepco Holdings Inc., I am writing to express my strong and \n     unequivocal support for Senator Paul Sarbanes' amendment to \n     the National Homeland Security and Combating Terrorism Act of \n     2002.\n       The proposed amendment would create within the Department \n     of Homeland Security a National Capital Region Coordination \n     Office. This office would have the responsibility of \n     coordinating the response activities of the Federal, State, \n     and local governments with that of the general public and the \n     private sector.\n       The District of Columbia is truly in a unique situation \n     when it comes to Homeland Security. As our Nation's Capital, \n     the District is home to more than 370,000 Federal workers and \n     draws over 18 million visitors annually. At the same time, \n     given the multi-jurisdictional nature of the Greater \n     Washington Metropolitan area and the enormous Federal \n     presence, there are distinct challenges facing this region's \n     efforts to have a comprehensive and coordinated response to \n     terrorism.\n       For example, there are over a dozen separate local police \n     departments in the greater Washington area. Overlaying this, \n     there are another dozen Federal law enforcement agencies, \n     each with their own jurisdiction and mandate. These \n     departments have their own procedures and are developing \n     their own contingency plans. Coordinating these efforts will \n     not be an easy task and will require a dedicated office \n     within the Department of Homeland Security.\n       Unfortunately on September 11 we saw what can happen if the \n     region fails to coordinate its response. On the afternoon of \n     the attack the Federal government sent home its entire \n     workforce early without notifying anyone on the local level. \n     At the same time the Federal government was releasing \n     hundreds of thousands of Federal employees and contractors to \n     already grid-locked roads and packed Metro stations, Federal \n     agencies were erecting security zones and blocking off \n     streets around their facilities making the evacuation of the \n     District even more difficult.\n       Thankfully, there was no secondary attack after the \n     Pentagon. But had there been one, this lack of coordination \n     could have had disastrous results and I believe illustrated \n     the need for a dedicated office within the Department.\n       As the major provider of electricity to the District of \n     Columbia as well as Prince George's and Montgomery counties \n     in Maryland, Pepco has spent a significant amount of time and \n     effort on security issues since September 11. The more I look \n     at the unique challenges we face in this new environment, \n     both as Chief Executive and a Washingtonian, the more I \n     believe in the need for Senator Sarbanes' proposal.\n       Thank you for your leadership on homeland security issues, \n     and I trust that you will give the National Capital Region \n     Coordination Office provision every consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John M. Derrick,\n     Chairman, Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Washington Area Transit Authority,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lieberman: On behalf of the Washington \n     Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, I would like to express \n     our great appreciation and strong support for your efforts to \n     enhance security in the national capital region. We urge you \n     to offer an amendment to S. 2452, the ``National Homeland \n     Security and Combating Terrorism Act of 2002'' in order to \n     address the specific needs of the National Capital Region, \n     perhaps the area of greatest potential risk in the country.\n       Importantly, there is not central point of coordination for \n     the many Federal entities in the region, including various \n     executive branch agencies, the Office of Homeland Security, \n     the Military District of Washington, the U.S. Congress, and \n     the judicial branch. Effective coordination within the \n     Federal government is absolutely critical in the National \n     Capital Region in light of the fact that the Federal \n     government is the region's largest employer. The recent \n     Regional Summit on Security, convened by Governor Ridge, also \n     pointed out the continuing need for effective coordination \n     among all levels of government in the National Capital \n     Region.\n       The other matter of concern is the enormous challenge this \n     region faces in working constructively with the \n     Administration as it formulates security budget proposals. \n     While the Congress, through the appropriations process, has \n     generally been quite receptive to funding requirements for \n     security measures, it has been extremely difficult and \n     cumbersome to present our case to the Administration for the \n     resources needed to carry out the national strategy for \n     combating terrorism and other homeland security activities, \n     due to the highly decentralized nature of the Executive \n     Branch budget development process. The proposed amendment \n     provides a mechanism for a review of the funding resources \n     required for the region to implement the national strategy \n     for combating terrorism.\n       We greatly appreciate your attention and diligence in \n     assisting the region in addressing these important issues. We \n     are all facing challenges that previously seemed unthinkable. \n     We owe you a great debt of gratitude for your leadership in \n     assisting the National Capital Region in preparing to meet \n     these challenges.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Christopher Zimmerman,\n     Chairman, Board of Directors.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Greater Washington Board of Trade,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 23, 2002.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Government Affairs, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lieberman: Thank you for your leadership on \n     building a strong and thoughtful Department of Homeland \n     Security. As you prepare your final mark on S. 2452 we urge \n     you to include an amendment that calls for a separate office \n     for the National Capital Region within the Department. The \n     proposal is supported by many of your colleagues including \n     Senators Warner, Allen, Sarbanes and Mikulski, as well as \n     Senator Landrieu, ranking member of the District of Columbia \n     Appropriations Subcommittee and Mayor Anthony Williams.\n       The National Capital Region is perhaps the area of greatest \n     potential risk in the country to future terrorist attack. It \n     is the seat of government, the location of many symbolic and \n     historic structures, the venue for many high profile public \n     events attended by large numbers of people, a key tourism \n     destination that draws 18 million visitors annually and home \n     to 370,000 federal workers and hundreds of lawmakers.\n       The area is unique in that it has dozens of federal \n     agencies that have been mandated to have their own emergency \n     preparedness plans. Most of these agencies have not \n     coordinated their plans with local governments or private \n     sector concerns that own and operate critical infrastructure \n     like power, telecommunications and transportation, which the \n     agencies are dependent. The region also has more than a dozen \n     separate and distinct police forces representing seventeen \n     jurisdictions and more than a dozen federal protective forces \n     that need better coordination.\n       S. 2452 does not currently require the federal government \n     to coordinate with the region or intradepartmentally, leaving \n     the region and the nation's capital vulnerable. While \n     coordination efforts are improving, there clearly needs to be \n     an institutional structure in place to bring coordination to \n     the level necessary in this complex environment.\n       We urge you to support the amendment to S. 2452 that will \n     create a single point of contract within the Department of \n     Homeland Security for coordination in the National Capital \n     Region. The purpose is not to supercede any planning or \n     action currently being undertaken, but only to serve as a \n     coordinator of information, a point of contact for planning \n     with the regional public and private sectors.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Robert A. Peck,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Metropolitan Washington\n\n\n                                       Council of Governments,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 22, 2002.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n           Chairman, Senate Committee on Government Affairs, U.S. \n                                           Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lieberman: The Metropolitan Washington \n     Council of Governments (COG) is appreciative of your efforts \n     in strengthening the provisions of S. 2452, the National \n     Homeland Security and Combating Terrorism Act of 2002, as it \n     impacts the National Capital Region. In particular we endorse \n     your efforts in insuring that federal terrorism preparedness \n     and emergency response activities in the Washington, DC area \n     are coordinated in consultation with those of the Region's \n     sub-federal governments, private and non-profit entities, and \n     the public generally.\n       As you are aware, COG is completing a year-long effort \n     involving hundreds of public officials and public and private \n     experts in the development of coordination and communications \n     protocols for use by state and local governments, private and \n     non-profit agencies, and other ``stakeholders'' concerned \n     about preparation for and management of terrorist and other \n     emergencies in the National Capital Region. Having a single \n     contact point for coordinating these efforts with existing \n     and proposed Federal response capacities is necessary for the \n     effective and timely protection of life and property in the \n     region.\n       The proposed amendment creates a function within the \n     Department of Homeland Security which will be such a contact \n     point, allowing full communication among the Federal and sub-\n     federal entities dedicated to protection of this region and \n     its citizens and coordination of their potentially supportive \n     but disparate functions without impeding the planning or \n     actions of either group.\n       Additionally, the creation of such a function recognizes \n     the unique status of this region, with its strong presence of \n     the Federal government as employer, policy-initiator, and \n     potential target, as worthy of specific future Federal \n     support.\n       The COG Ad Hoc Task Force on Homeland Security has \n     considered the concepts and purposes contained in this \n     proposed amendment and supports its enactment.\n       On behalf of my colleagues on the Task Force, I am pleased \n     to endorse this proposed\n\n[[Page S8656]]\n\n     amendment and urge you to support its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Carol Schwartz,\n     Chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8656-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8656-S8663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                            2003--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ncontinue with the consideration of H.R. 5093, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5093) making appropriations for the Department \n     of the Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2002, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:15 \nwill be equally divided between the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe subcommittee or their designees prior to a vote on the cloture \nmotion on the Byrd amendment No. 4480.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Byrd and Senator Burns are not \nhere. The Chair has already decreed that we will divide the time. But \nthere have been a number of people waiting: Senator Crapo, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Craig. Just for expedition purposes, if they would \nlike to speak now, that is fine. We would wait until they finish. I do \nnot know in what order they wish to go, so why don't we announce that \nso people aren't waiting around.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time are we going to have?\n  Mr. REID. Half of 40 minutes, 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If you want to let Senator Crapo go first?\n  Mr. CRAIG. That will be fine.\n  Mr. REID. May we have an order?\n  You are going to use your time probably, now, and then a little over \nhere or what do you want to do?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, Senator Reid, I assume we would retain \nthe last 5 minutes for closing purposes.\n  Mr. REID. Because it is your amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes, because it is our amendment. We would want that.\n  Mr. REID. That is really no problem. It is our cloture motion, but if \nyou want the last 5 minutes, that is fine. So we ask that consent. In \nthe meantime, you use whatever time you need. So you have 15 minutes \nnow.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the Senator from Idaho 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I rise in support of the efforts to \naddress the serious and devastating impacts of fires that are currently \nraging throughout the West and to impress upon my colleagues the need \nfor immediate action to reduce this threat in the future.\n  I thank my colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, for his tireless \nefforts to try to find a path forward on a collaborative basis and to \nbuild the consensus necessary to address this difficult issue. The \nSenator from New Mexico as well has been very closely involved in \ndeveloping these proposals. I commend him for his efforts.\n  As I begin, I offer my gratitude to the brave men and women who are \nfighting these fires. Wildland firefighting is a dangerous and \nexhausting job, and I can't thank them enough for their efforts. \nAlready this year, 6.3 million acres have been burned, and this level \nof destruction puts us on pace to meet the catastrophic fire season of \n2000, when 8.4 million acres burned, with more than a million of those \nacres in Idaho.\n  Idaho has been relatively lucky this year. However, with outbreaks of \nDouglas fir beetles and mountain pine beetles throughout Idaho, it is \nclear we are poised for another dangerous fire season.\n  Not all fire is bad. In fact, fire can be beneficial. However, many \nof the fires we face today are fueled by unnatural fuels and burn with \nan intensity and size that makes them undesirable in our natural \necology. Additionally, insect and disease outbreaks are often naturally \noccurring agents of change, yet some outbreaks are enhanced by our past \nactions and inactions and occur in scopes that are damaging and \nunnatural.\n  As a result of the previous fire seasons, Congress acted with an \nimmediate and bipartisan response.\n  We came forward with funding and direction for a national fire plan. \nYet, to date, this plan has not been implemented effectively enough to \naddress the risks facing our communities.\n  I do not think we should be pointing fingers or making excuses about \nwhy or how these fires occurred. We need to look forward and address \nthe problem. We need to do so quickly. I do not want to see another \nmillion acres burning in Idaho next year.\n  In his Healthy Forests Initiative, the President outlined actions \nthat will effectively address the risk of catastrophic wildfires. In \nthe Fiscal Year 2002 supplemental appropriations bill, our majority \nleader identified a way to effectively reduce the risks in the Black \nHills National Forest. Clearly, we all want to protect our forests.\n  Our forests are an important part of our heritage and have great \nimpacts on local economies and recreational opportunities for local \nresidents and visitors alike. They provide our drinking water and \nwildlife habitat. In short, healthy forests are vital to all Americans.\n  The Forest Service has identified 70 million acres of Condition Class \nIII lands. These lands are at catastrophic risk of wildfire and subject \nto insect and disease infestations, windthrow, and other health risks. \nIt is important to address risks on these lands, but it must be noted \nthat today we are not debating action in all of these areas.\n  As I said, many of these threats are natural and we may choose to let \nthem occur naturally. However, we must act--and act quickly--to protect \nour high value forest areas. We must act to protect homes, property, \nand livelihood, maintain the quality of our watersheds, and take steps \nto ensure that burned areas are quickly rehabilitated rather than face \nthe dangerous risks of reburn.\n  Again, the amendments we are discussing do not include the entire 196 \nmillion acre National Forest System or 74.5 million acres of condition \nclass III areas, but instead address areas where we cannot allow \nendless delays. We do so without eliminating public recourse. There has \nalso been speculation the language will do what Senator Daschle did and \nlimit all appeals and judicial review. This is not true.\n  Critics also contend the amendment suspends environmental laws. That \nis also false. The amendment requires that projects be consistent with \nthe applicable forest plans or resource management plans. I can tell \nyou from experience that these site-specific plans take years of work \nwith widespread public involvement and compliance with all of our \nenvironmental laws.\n  Protecting our environment and the opportunity for public involvement \nis a vital part of any actions on our public lands. Reducing the risk \nof fire is no exception. However, the imminent threat demands we act \nquickly and move past stalling tactics and countless delays.\n  Damage to our environment from these fires is acute. The harm to \nlocal economies is felt in many ways. It is clear our forests have \ndeteriorated to the point were active management is a necessity. I hope \nmy colleagues recognize that and will support the efforts of member's \nwhose goal is to protect their communities and environment.\n  I encourage all of the Senators to vote against the cloture motion.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Idaho for his \nvery thoughtful presentation and his true expression of the real \nconditions on our forest lands.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I thank my colleague, Senator Craig, \nwho has spoken to the broader issue of the problem we face, and the \nfirefighters. And Senator Crapo elaborated on that some.\n  Let me speak for a moment about why I support the Craig-Domenici \namendment from a local standpoint. It certainly provides a critical \ntool in doing the job that we know needs to be done. We know there are \ncounterproposals floating around. From my perspective, that does not \naccomplish what we need to have done.\n  Let me speak a couple of minutes about what happened near the town of \nDurango, CO. I live about 18 miles from\n\n[[Page S8657]]\n\nthere. In fact, during the Missionary Ridge fire, we watched it with \ngreat anticipation from our porch at our ranch.\n  Durango is a very scenic town in Colorado, home of one of only 13 \ngold medal trout streams in the whole country, and has some of the \nfinest mountain biking areas in the West.\n  Two months ago, there was a fire called the Missionary Ridge fire, \ndeclared under control on July 28, but only after we had lost over \n70,000 acres of forest, 56 homes, 27 adjoining buildings, and the \ncollective cost of $40.6 million to fight that fire. More importantly, \nlarge areas around the Lemon and Vallecito Reservoirs burned so \nintensely that the soil had become hydrophobic and unable to keep water \nback. Downstream, the La Plata, Aimas, Los Pinos, and Florida Rivers \nwere now all at risk.\n  When I was home this past weekend, I was reading in the local \nnewspaper about several homes that were washed off their foundations by \nthe mud slides as a result of that loose soil caused by the fire and \nthe burning of all of the underbrush and trees.\n  That $40.6 million lost, to put it in context, is more than double \nthe amount of funding allocated for recreation for all of the 11 \nforests in Region II, which is Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, and \nNebraska. It is four times the amount of funding for wildlife for all \n11 forests in Region II for fiscal year 2002. It is nearly double the \namount of money allocated to the region for hazardous fuels reduction \nwork for fiscal year 2002. So in a little over 1\\1/2\\ months, we spent \nmore allowing that area to be destroyed by fire than we would have \nspent on wildlife habitat management on all 11 forests over 4 years.\n  Speaking of wildlife, when the Missionary Ridge fire was at its \nhighest level of intensity, I happened to have a chance to talk to one \nof the firefighters who had been on the front line. He told me he \nestimated the fire to be moving at about 50 miles an hour--literally \nout of control--and actually saw birds being burned out of the sky \nbecause they were unable to outfly that fire, and that a number of \nsmall animals literally burned alive because they could not outrun that \nfire. There are just terrible stories about what happened.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some excerpts \nof stories in the local newspapers in Durango of September 8, 10, 13, \nand 14.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                           september 8, 2002\n\n       The Valley Fire began on June 25th and quickly consumed 10 \n     homes and 378 acres, about 160 acres were burned on private \n     land.\n       Fall Creek Ranch residents hired a logging company to help \n     remove logs and place other logs around areas where waters \n     tend to flow heavily. The residents have poured $26,000 into \n     mitigation so far.\n       Just under an inch of rain in less than an hour created mud \n     and water flows that cover Florida Road, County Road 501, and \n     County Road 245. About 700 customers at the Bar D Chuckwagon \n     restaurant were trapped until about 10 p.m.\n\n\n                           september 10, 2002\n\n       The City of Durango's turbidity went from 2 NTU's (a \n     measure of the number of small particles that are suspended \n     in a water sample) or practically colorless, on Friday, to \n     440 NTU's, a chocolate brown by Monday.\n       A waive of ash, mud and debris cascaded down from \n     Missionary Ridge burn area late Wednesday, flooding fields \n     and roads and temporarily stranded some residents north and \n     east of Durango.\n\n\n                           september 13, 2002\n\n       Only about a quarter-inch of rain fell, but it was enough \n     to close roads, flood houses and clog culverts.\n       LaPine County has spend about $100,000 keeping roads and \n     drainage structures clear of mudslides.\n       ``There are homes out there that never expected to be \n     influenced by flooding that are getting a hell of a \n     surprise,'' said Doyle Viller La Plata County director of \n     road maintenance.\n       Dead fish are littering the banks of the Animas River after \n     recent mudslides in the Animas Valley, and there could be \n     hundreds more beneath the murky water.\n       The mud is so thick that they (the fish) can't breath in \n     the water said Mike Japhet, State of Colorado Division of \n     Wildlife.\n       He received one report that the fish were ``gasping for air \n     and trying to swim out of the water onto the bank'' near 32nd \n     Street in Durango on Sunday.\n       All the fish around the 32nd Street Bridge, appear to be \n     dead, Japhet said, and the death zone could extend north for \n     several miles to where the mud entered the water.\n\n\n                           september 14, 2002\n\n       The county estimates that more than $100,000 has been spent \n     on clearing roads and ditches near Lemon and Vallecito \n     Reservoirs, and there has been more than $1 million in \n     personal property damage from flash flooding.\n\n\n  october 2002 bicycling magazine article--russell zimmerman, durango \n                           bicycle shop owner\n\n       ``The last time I rode here, the forest was so dense you \n     could see no more than 100 feet ahead. There is nothing left \n     today, no living thing within a mile to interrupt the barren \n     landscape. No fallen trees, no bushes, no grass.\n       ``The bottom of my wheels disappear into the three-inch-\n     deep layer of ash. The route is the same, but the trail is \n     different. Roots are gone, burned away. Some of the rocks \n     have even been vaporized.''\n       ``My tires kick up a fine dust that covers the bike, and \n     me. No one could follow me; they'd choke.'' Before the fire, \n     I'd spot a porcupine every ride. Or a deer, or elk or bear. \n     Not this time.''\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, the result now, of course, is that on \nthe Animas River, which goes through the town of Durango, dead fish are \nlittering the banks because so much mud has come into the water.\n  Mike Japhet of the Colorado Division of Wildlife said that in some \nplaces fish are actually trying to get out of the water because they \ncannot breath. He received one report that fish were actually ``gasping \nfor air'' as they tried to stay alive.\n  The local county has spent over $100,000 just clearing mud from roads \nand ditches near the Lemon and Vallecito Reservoirs that were affected \nby this fire.\n  I want to add my voice to the Craig-Domenici amendment. I just want \nto point out from a local point of view the catastrophic results.\n  Our little town of Durango in fact relies heavily on tourism. An old \ntrain takes tourists through the mountains. They had 28,000 \ncancellations in just 2 weeks because of that fire. Those \ncancellations, of course, result in money lost to the local community. \nThe estimated loss of revenue during the month after that fire in the \ntown of Durango was estimated to be about 40 percent from the normal \nresources they would have been able to rely on from tourists who stay \nin motels and who eat in the restaurants.\n  The facts are clear: unnaturally dense forests result in unnaturally \nhot burning and fast moving fires, like we experienced in Colorado.\n  Our proposal would address the problem in a balanced way--even \nproviding greater review of projects than the majority leader's plan \nthat takes care of his own state that he managed to attach to the \nemergency supplemental bill.\n  We know what needs to be done, but now opponents are opposing our \nbill and offering counterproposals that will do absolutely nothing to \nhelp forest managers thin these forests to reduce the risk of these \ncatastrophic fires, nor allow for any salvage operations to help pay \nfor the rehabilitation of these areas.\n  What does the counterproposal do? Their proposal does nothing more \nthan sell the public a false bag of goods--it does nothing but create \nfalse expectations in the public.\n  My state of Colorado has experienced enough from prior bad policies. \nI am offended that some would now suggest new ones.\n  Since my friends on the other side know what needs to be done, why \nare they proposing such ineffective policy?\n  Because we are in an election year and some politically-active \nenvironmental groups are drafting the policy. It is not a secret. They \nsay there is a lot of campaign money at stake--television and radio ads \nthat could be poured into your State if you oppose doing the right \nthing.\n  It is time to do the right thing. It is time for these environmental \ngroups to start looking at policies that benefit the environment rather \nthan maintaining the political hammerlock they have on the Forest \nService and BLM.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished\n\n[[Page S8658]]\n\nSenator on our side, and then I will be glad to offer the remainder to \nSenator Byrd.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, that wouldn't give the Senator the last 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, fellow Senators, I come today to the \nfloor because there is a very important amendment that is attached to \nthe Interior appropriations bill, and it is a second-degree amendment \nattached to the Byrd amendment.\n  The only thing I would like to say today, since cloture has been \ncalled for on the Byrd amendment, is that if in fact cloture is \ninvoked, our amendment will disappear. We believe our amendment is a \ngood amendment and it deserves an up-or-down vote.\n  We have not been delaying things. We have been waiting for an \nopportunity to have a vote. We would like an up-or-down vote on our \namendment, which is an effort by a number of Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle to permit the Forest Service and the BLM of the United States \nto go into our forest lands that desperately need cleanup and to look \nat just four types of properties that belong to our Federal \nGovernment: those that have blown over and are there, and where they \nare unable to do anything--the trees are, in fact, dormant--forests \nthat have been bitten and eaten so that the bugs have infested them, so \nthey are useless, but we leave them there instead of removing them, and \nremoving all of the substance that is there with them. And there are \ntwo other kinds similar to that, and we address them.\n\n  All we try to do is say: Can't we expedite the removal of that \nsubstance I have just described which causes fires? Because once any of \nthat starts, you cannot stop it, and it goes like wildfire. And since \nour forests are not maintained properly, it burns thousands and, in \nsome instances--like this year--millions of acres.\n  As I see it, it is time we do something practical. Our amendment is \ncommonsense cleanup for the forests that are being destroyed. I do not \nbelieve the amendment--that will be offered later on, if we lose--does \nthat in a proper manner. I believe it makes it just as difficult, if \nnot more difficult, to remove this kindling, this buildup that is \npermitting our forests to burn.\n  We are not delaying any bill. We are asking for a chance to vote. \nWhenever it is possible in the Senate, we want a vote. That is all we \nask. We will have more time then to explain it in detail.\n  It is common sense. It is not anti-environment. It is a rational, \nreasonable way to clean four kinds of forests that none of us would \nlike to leave in their current situation so that they will become the \nessence of the next firestorms of the West.\n  If I have not used all my time, I yield the remainder of it to \nSenator Craig for his allocation or use. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much of that time--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am sorry, 19 minutes remain for the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, the underlying first-degree amendment, which is the \nsubject of the cloture vote this afternoon, provides $825 million in \nemergency funds to the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \nManagement. That money will be used to repay the extraordinary fire \nsuppression costs incurred by those agencies over the past several \nmonths.\n  As many of our colleagues know, particularly those who represent \nWestern States, 2002 is turning out to be one of the most devastating \nfire seasons on record. Over the past 10 years, the average number of \nacres burned by fire between January 1 and September 16 has been 3.4 \nmillion acres. This year, however, the comparable number of acres \nburned is 6.4 million; almost twice the 10-year average.\n  But this problem is much more than just the numbers of acres burned. \nThe devastation and destruction resulting from these fires is almost \ntoo much to comprehend. Fire suppression costs will exceed $1.5 \nbillion. Nearly 3,000 structures have been destroyed, including 1,313 \nhomes. And, most tragic of all, 21 citizens have lost their lives \nfighting these treacherous fires.\n  Clearly, Madam President, this situation amounts to a domestic \nemergency of historic proportions.\n  That is why Senator Burns and I proposed this amendment and why so \nmany of our colleagues have joined us in this endeavor. Indeed, even \nthe President has come to appreciate the need for this assistance, as \nevidenced by his August 28 funding request to Congress.\n  Madam President, it is of the utmost importance that we move forward \non this matter, and that we do so in a timely manner. In fact, I would \nremind my colleagues that the authority to designate such funds as an \nemergency expires on September 30. Consequently, if this bill is not \nsigned into law by the end of the month, there is a very real \npossibility that these funds will not be made available. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the cloture motion, and help us in our effort to \nhelp our firefighters.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  How much time does the distinguished Senator from North Dakota wish?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Five minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I understand certain comments were made \nabout the slowness of the appropriations process and the assertion that \nnot having a budget resolution pass the floor is the reason for that.\n  I do not think that is supported by the facts. The appropriations \nprocess is moving slowly for reasons that have no relationship to a \nbudget resolution or having one or not having one.\n  The fact is, the appropriators agreed to an amount for a budget that \nwas what was recommended in the resolution that went through the Budget \nCommittee. The appropriators agreed unanimously--Democrats and \nRepublicans--to adopt the budget amount for this year that the \ncommittee recommended.\n  So there is nothing to prevent appropriations bills from coming to \nthe floor in an orderly process. The appropriators gave to each of the \ncommittees an allocation that added up to the amount of money that was \nprovided for in the recommendation by the Budget Committee. So that is \nnot the problem here.\n  No. 2, I think it should be pointed out that we had an opportunity on \nthe floor to pass a budget for this year and got 59 votes. We got 59 \nvotes. Now, it required 60 votes. But we had a bipartisan supermajority \nin the Senate for a budget amount for this year--not a budget \nresolution but a budget amount for this year. We fell one vote short of \ngetting that amount approved.\n  Frankly, all of this misses the larger point. The reason we are in \ndeep financial trouble now has nothing to do with the budget resolution \nfor this year at all. The real problem is the budget resolution that \npassed last year. The budget resolution that passed last year put us on \nthe course of a 10-year plan that has contributed to the most dramatic \nreversal in our fiscal fortunes in our Nation's history.\n  It was the budget resolution that passed last year that contained a \nmassive and unaffordable tax cut that has undermined the fiscal \nstrength of this country for years to come.\n  Last year, we were told we would have $5.6 trillion of budget surplus \nover the next decade--$5.6 trillion. Now, if we look at the \nCongressional Budget Office's new report, what we see is no surpluses; \nthe money is all gone.\n  If we just adopt the President's recommendation on spending and taxes \nfor the next 10 years--no additional spending by Congress, not a dime--\nif we just adopt his proposals, we will be $400 billion in the red. \nThat is after being told last year we had $5.6 trillion of surpluses \nover the next decade. Now we are $400 billion in the hole. That is a $6 \ntrillion turn.\n  And what are the reasons for it? The No. 1 reason is the tax cuts \nthat were in last year's budget, pushed by the President, passed by the \nCongress. That accounts for over a third of the disappearance of the \nsurplus.\n  The next biggest reason: technical considerations that apply to \nrevenue not meeting the estimates. That is the second biggest reason--\nnot related to\n\n[[Page S8659]]\n\nthe tax cut, but it is the second biggest reason.\n  The third biggest reason is the increased costs because of the attack \non the United States.\n  I am talking now about, over the 10 years of the President's budget \nplan, what are the contributing factors to the disappearance of the \nsurplus. The biggest reason--over a third--is the tax cut, 34 percent. \nThe second biggest reason: revenue not meeting expectations, apart from \nthe tax cut; that is 29 percent. Twenty-two percent is increased costs \nassociated with the attack on the country. And the last, and smallest, \npart of the problem is the economic slowdown, representing 14 or 15 \npercent of the disappearance of the surplus.\n  That is the reality. The appropriations process not moving forward \nhas nothing to do with the budget resolution being passed or not \npassed. The simple fact is, the appropriators agreed to the amount that \nwas in the budget proposal that passed the Budget Committee. They did \nso on a unanimous basis, and they proceeded to stay within that amount. \nThat is the reality.\n  The bigger truth, the larger reality is that we have fiscal problems \nbecause of the budget that passed last year. That put us on a course \nthat does not add up, never has added up, and will require serious work \nin the future, if we are going to get back on track.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have the 5 remaining minutes prior to the \nvote reserved. We have no more time to allocate on our side. The \nassistant leader said we could use time if there were no speakers from \nthe other side. Senator Byrd is here.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, does the Senator want more than 5 minutes? \nDo you need more?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I think our colleague from Oklahoma would like to speak \nfor 5, and then if I could use 5 to close it out, then we could advance \nthe vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is fine with me if the Senator closes. The Senator wants \n5 minutes over there. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. BURNS. Two. That is all I need.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 2 minutes to the ranking member and I will yield 5 \nminutes to the distinguished Senator. I am always very accommodating, \nmost always, to Senators from the other side of the aisle. Then will I \nhave any more time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator yields 10 minutes, that would \nexhaust his time.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I won't need it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from West \nVirginia for his yielding a couple minutes. I will be brief.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on cloture. I say that knowing my \nfriend and colleague from West Virginia, I guess, is going to support \nit. But he is chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I have been on \nthe committee. I have been in the Senate for a long time. It is a very \nbad idea to start filing cloture on any amendment that you don't like \non appropriations bills. It is a bad idea for a couple reasons. One, it \nwon't work. You are not going to be able to take a cloture vote and \nsay, ``We will have a fire amendment and it is going to spend several \nhundred million dollars on fire, but we will not have any other \namendment dealing with this issue,'' because it won't work.\n  The Senator from Idaho is entitled to his amendment. Even if cloture \nis invoked, we can still get a vote on the Senator's amendment, or some \nother Senator can offer a similar amendment.\n  I will, first, tell my colleague from West Virginia, I don't like \ncloture. To me, it should be used very sparingly. It is becoming far \ntoo prevalent in the Senate where somebody says: We will just file \ncloture.\n  Someone told me: We will file cloture on homeland security. We will \nwrap that up.\n  Of course, that would deny us the opportunity to offer the \nPresident's bill on homeland security. They may file it, but they will \nnot get cloture. The President is entitled to have a vote on his \nhomeland security proposal, and we are going to get it, just as the \nSenator from Idaho is entitled to have his vote on fire control. Other \nSenators have ideas.\n  My point is, you can waste days on cloture. We wasted 3 days. No one \non this side of the aisle was filibustering the Interior bill or \nfilibustering homeland security, nor should they, in my opinion. I hope \nwe don't have filibusters ever, frankly, on appropriations bills. We \nneed to decide how much we are going to spend and how we will do it.\n  Maybe if somebody came up with an amendment that is so offensive, so \nintrusive, so anti an individual State that they would filibuster, that \nmight be unique, but I haven't found that yet in my Senate career on an \nappropriations bill. I can't remember filibusters on appropriations \nbills. I have only been here 22 years--not nearly as long as my friend \nfrom West Virginia. It is a terrible idea if somebody says: I don't \nlike that amendment so we will file cloture on it and hope it goes \naway. If cloture is adopted, the Craig-Domenici amendment will \ndisappear.\n  I am telling my colleagues, it will not disappear, even if cloture is \ninvoked. And if it is, I might tell my friends, we could spread out, we \ncould waste another couple days. I don't think anybody wants to do that \nbecause we have no interest in filibustering anything.\n  My colleague from New Mexico is a very good legislator, and he has a \ncouple ideas on fire management, and so does my colleague from Idaho. I \nknow the other Senator from Idaho and other Senators have ideas, and \nthey are entitled to have their amendments considered. And they will be \nconsidered at some point.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's not get in the habit of going the route \nof cloture if an amendment appears and we say we don't really like it. \nThat process will not work. We only have a week from Monday to complete \naction on the appropriations bills, if we are going to have them done \nby the end of the fiscal year. That is only 13 days. We have already \nspent a week and a half on the Interior bill and we are not even \ngetting close.\n  We have basically had an amendment on drought, and we were precluded \nfrom offering another drought amendment. And now we have a fire \namendment, appropriating money for fire, and my colleague is trying to \nbe denied a vote.\n  This side is going to find a way to get some votes on this bill. We \ncan spend weeks doing it or we can spend days. We can spend an hour. I \nheard my colleague from Idaho said he is willing to have a time limit. \nHe is willing to have a side by side. I know the Senator from New \nMexico has a fire amendment. Great. Senator Bingaman, I think, that is \na different fire amendment, and I think that is fine. Let's vote on \nthose amendments.\n  I appreciate my colleague from West Virginia yielding. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair. I thank my chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time does he have? How much time is \nleft on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 4 minutes 20 \nseconds; the Senator from Idaho, 4 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. BURNS. I will take the first 4 minutes. I thank my good friend \nfrom West Virginia also for allocating the time.\n  As he believes very much in the Constitution of the United States, I \nalso believe in some of the rulings of the Senate. And I think I would \nbe remiss as ranking member on this committee and a comanager on this \nbill if I did not fight for the rights of the rest of the Members in \nthis body to have a vote. I think it is what it is all about. That is \nfor debate.\n  I haven't heard anybody come down here and talk against the merits of \nthis second-degree amendment. It will not go away. And silence tells me \nthat maybe the case has already been made and hard to defend of what we \nare trying to do as far as forest health is concerned. Twenty years, 25 \nyears is a track record, a known track record.\n\n[[Page S8660]]\n\nAnd now we see the culmination of those management practices over that \nmany years in the growth of the forest and what it can lead to if we \nallow folks who probably don't have all the experience in the world, on \nthe ground management of a renewable resource, what that brings us to.\n  So I would hope that we would support cloture or deny cloture so this \nissue can be talked out because it will not go away. I am not real sure \nit is not the shortest way to arrive at a vote and settlement of the \nissue.\n  I thank my good friend from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, why do we want to vote down cloture? There \nare other appropriations bills coming to the floor. I am supporting the \nSenator's amendment. I never said a word against his amendment. I would \nbe very supportive of it. I am not filibustering it, and I haven't \nfilibustered anything else. I haven't filibustered the homeland \nsecurity bill, either. I have heard some intimations this afternoon \nthat I have filibustered. My Lord, some people around here wouldn't \nrecognize a filibuster if they met it on the way home. I know what a \nfilibuster is. But I am not against this amendment. Why would we want \nto vote against this cloture?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Correct me if I am wrong. If cloture is invoked, the \namendment of our friend from Idaho would no longer be germane and it \nwould fall. We would like our colleague to have the right to offer his \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there are other appropriations bills coming. \nWhy not vote for this bill and do some of the good things that are \nbeing done with this bill, and the Senator can come back another day \nwith his amendment? I am not opposed to his amendment. Why do we want \nto penalize other parts of the country and other Senators for good \nthings that are in the bill because some Senators don't want to vote \nfor cloture on this?\n  This is an appropriations bill. Those advocating voting against \ncloture, in many instances, are Senators who are on the Appropriations \nCommittee. Why? We need to get on with this. Let's vote cloture on this \nand the Senator will have another day, another opportunity on another \nappropriations bill.\n  I am for his amendment. I think he has made a good statement in \nsupport of it. I cannot understand why we want to cut off our nose to \nspite our face on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to make a \ncouple final remarks before I leave the floor for another event I need \nto attend.\n  The Senator from West Virginia just now said it so well. There is an \nongoing filibuster on this amendment, but not on this side. It is not \non this side. There is no question that, on controversial issues, this \nSenate must acquire 60 votes to pass an amendment. The Senator from \nIdaho has offered an amendment that does not have the requisite 60 \nvotes. The Senator from New Mexico and others on our side have offered \nan alternative that we acknowledge does not have 60 votes. Over the \ncourse of the last several weeks, we have attempted to find common \nground and, at least to date, have failed. In fact, I recall vividly \nlast week on the floor the Senator from Idaho indicated they were going \nto make another effort yesterday to attempt to reach that common \nground. That has not happened.\n  So it is fair to say that both sides have failed to reach the Senate \nrequisite for controversial amendments, which is 60 votes. We had \noffered a procedural compromise since we could not find a substantive \none. That compromise would be to have side-by-side votes, to indicate \nthat there is support, but not the level of support required under \nSenate rules. That, too, failed.\n  So the bottom line is that we have an amendment pending that 1 week \nago today generated 79 votes; 79 people went on record--Republican and \nDemocrat--supporting drought assistance on an amendment that supports \nfirefighting assistance. The President and others have said the \nfirefighting money is urgent. I would like to reread the speeches made \nlast week about the urgency of getting something done on drought \nassistance, about how important it is to get out there and provide this \nhelp now.\n  Well, in the next 5 minutes we will have a chance to provide this \nhelp now. The Senator from Idaho is not precluded from reoffering this \namendment to the Interior appropriations bill. He can do that. So to \nsay it is now or never for them is just not correct. There is nothing \nto preclude them from going back and offering this amendment to the \nunderlying bill--nothing. So if they vote against cloture, they are \nvoting against firefighting assistance, against drought assistance, and \nthere can be no other conclusion.\n  Don't tell me you have to do it on this amendment or you cannot do it \nat all. That is not right. So let's get real and be honest here. There \nis a game being played here that I think ought to be shown for what it \nis--a game that, for whatever reason, is denying this amendment passage \ntoday, even though the debate and consultation and the continued \ncooperative effort to see if common ground can be achieved. I just \ntalked, moments ago, to Senator Bingaman. He said he has another \nmeeting scheduled--I think it is this afternoon--with Senators on both \nsides of the aisle to see if they can reach common ground.

Mr. President, there can be no doubt. If we are serious \nabout moving this legislation forward and providing this assistance, we \ntake care of this amendment and move on to other issues. We have been \non this bill now for 3 weeks. We will be on it for another couple \nweeks, the way it looks. There comes a time when we just have to move \non and when we have to recognize that, under Senate rules, we either \nhave to accommodate the rules, or reach some compromise, or drop the \namendment. We have those three options.\n  We cannot accommodate the rules today because neither side has 60 \nvotes. Let's recognize it for what it is. This is a delay. Until we get \nover this delay, we cannot provide the kind of assistance to \nfirefighters and farmers and ranchers that is absolutely critical \nacross the country. And the very speeches we made last week are just as \nreal and important and urgent today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the life of me, I must tell the \nmajority leader, I cannot understand what you speak of. There has been \nno filibuster on this bill, and a second-degree amendment is not \nextraordinary nor does it require 60 votes. You know the rules as well \nas I do. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee just came to the \nfloor and made the right speech, talking about the urgency of his \namendment and firefighting money. I support it totally.\n  If we don't deal with his amendment and deal with my amendment in \nconcept as a new public policy for this country, he as chairman, or \nanother chairman, will be coming to the floor every year and asking for \n$1.5 billion to $2 billion of taxpayer money to fight the wildfires of \nthe West, across the Alleghenies, and down to the Blue Ridge. That is \nthe reality of a misguided public policy that has put our national \ntreasures at risk, the U.S. forestlands.\n  This year, we burned over 6.5 million acres; the chairman spoke to \nthat. We lost 2,100 homes; the chairman spoke to that. We lost 21 \nlives; the chairman spoke to that, too. This is a tactic to stall? Not \nat all. No, the majority leader, in my opinion, misspoke. There has \nbeen no filibuster. I have kept him and the assistant leader in full \nconsultation as we have tried to resolve and bring, in a bipartisan \nway, a clear new adjustment in public policy. We cannot arrive at that. \nIt is my amendment that is now up as a second degree, and appropriately \nso.\n  I ask for a vote on it, an up-or-down vote, as it is entitled to. I \nwould accept a side-by-side debate with Senator Bingaman's alternative \nbut not a 60-vote, no--51 or 50. Majority rules here, except under the \nrules that require a 60 vote. In this instance, it is not required.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with us this afternoon and say no to \ncloture, and maybe then we can move expeditiously because we have lost \ndays when this could have been resolved very quickly.\n  I don't blame the Senator from West Virginia for being frustrated. He \nis chairman of the Interior Subcommittee. He brought a bill to the \nfloor that most of us want. The majority leader knows I supported the \naid to farmers and ranchers that have experienced catastrophic drought. \nIt is not my intention, nor anyone else's, to hold up that money. But \nit is our intention, it is our purpose, and we will have a vote, to \ndeal with national forest policy that will slightly adjust our ability \nto get active on the land, to remove the fuel, to improve the forest \nhealth, to save the watershed, to save the wildlife habitat, and, also, \nto save homes and people's lives and the beautiful landscapes of the \npublic forests of these United States.\n  Shame on us for failing to address a policy that, this year, has \nallowed the burning of 6.5 million acres of public land, and the fires \nwill continue year after year into the future until the public stands \nup and says: Congress, United States Senate, change your ways. Your \npolicy isn't working. Your policy is not working, and our forests are \nburning and our forests are being lost because of public policy.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to respond to a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, did I hear the \nmajority leader say that if we lose and we are knocked down by cloture, \nwe can offer this legislation later?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator did hear that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder how we could be delaying the bill then.\n  Mr. CRAIG. We are not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How could we be delaying it? If we have a chance to do \nit later, wouldn't we be delaying it then, too?\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is not our intention to delay. We have never intended \nto delay the bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to yield if I have time remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Why won't Senators vote for cloture? There are many other \nneeds being addressed by this bill. I have said I will support the \nSenator on another bill later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time required for the cloture vote--\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am trying to salvage a bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Which bill is the Senator referring to, our amendment \nor the big bill?\n  Mr. BYRD. Why vote down cloture on this amendment? What is wrong with \nit?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is an amendment properly to the Interior bill. Why \nwould we knock it down? It is germane. It is relevant. And put it \nwhere? Where would we put it? The Senator said put it on another bill. \nWhere? It is a very important subject matter. It is just as important \nas the burning amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. If they intend to bring it up later, why not vote for \ncloture here? Senators can always bring up something later.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator from West Virginia, this is the \nmost appropriate bill for it to be on.\n  Mr. BYRD. Of course it is, but if you cannot get it on one bill, you \ntry on another.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Why does the Senator want us to vote to take it off the \nbill? Those who have worked hard on this issue want it on the bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have not opposed that. I tried to be very understanding \nwith the Senator. We cannot have everything the way we want it. I have \nlost a few amendments in my time that were of interest to my part of \nthe country, too.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The majority leader is even wrong in saying this \namendment needs 60 votes. It does not need 60 votes, even with a budget \nresolution. It is just an authorization bill. It is implementing what \nyou put in the bill, the $825 million. It is not subject to 60 votes, \nwhich means--why not have cloture; they both need 60 votes anyway. That \nis not so. Our bill does not need 60 votes, nor does Senator Bingaman's \namendment need 60 votes. Pure and\n\n[[Page S8662]]\n\nsimple: 51 votes on a bill on which they belong. So why would we, who \nhave struggled with it, vote to kill it? We want it alive. We want it \nto go to conference with the Senator when we all go to conference.\n  Mr. BYRD. Why don't Senators help me get this bill to conference? \nThat is what I am asking. Why don't Senators help me get this bill to \nconference?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are going to help with the Interior bill--both \nbills.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope so.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This is the only measure in which we are interested. We \nhave gotten together for hours in the offices of five different \nSenators because it is important. And then somebody comes along and \nsays: Let's have a cloture vote and kill the bill.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on Senator Byrd's \n     amendment No. 4480.\n         Joseph Lieberman, Harry Reid, Jean Carnahan, Daniel K. \n           Inouye, Christopher Dodd, Herb Kohl, Jack Reed, Richard \n           J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, shortly we will dispose of the Lieberman \nand Thompson amendments.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May we have order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could just restate: We will dispose of the \nLieberman and Thompson amendments. It is my understanding, once that \nhas occurred, Senator Byrd will offer his amendment. It is my \nunderstanding that debate will take place tonight, and of course \ntomorrow.\n  With that understanding, there will be no more rollcall votes this \nevening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition first to thank Senator \nByrd, the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and its \nInterior Subcommittee and the Subcommittee Ranking Republican, Senator \nBurns, for their efforts in drafting the fiscal year 2003 spending plan \nfor the agencies under their jurisdiction. Also, I want to call \nattention in particular to two competitively awarded initiatives that, \nunfortunately, the annual Department of Energy, DOE, budget submission \nroutinely underfunds and expects Congress to correct.\n  First, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and its partners, DOE, \nCeramatec, ChevronTexaco, Eltron Research, McDermott Technology and \nConcepts NREC, are developing a unique, oxygen-producing technology \nbased on high-temperature, ion transport membranes, ITM. The \ntechnology, ITM Oxygen, would be combined with an Integrated \nGasification Combined Cycle, IGCC, system to produce oxygen and \nelectric power for the iron/steel, nonferrous metals, glass, pulp and \npaper, cogeneration, and chemicals and refining industries. The ITM \nOxygen project is a cornerstone project in DOE's Vision 21 efforts and \nhas the potential to significantly reduce the cost of tonnage oxygen \nplants for IGCC systems.\n  The DOE fiscal year 2003 cost-share requirement is $6.5 million from \nthe Fossil Energy Research and Development, Coal and other Power \nSystems, President's Coal Research Initiative, Advanced Systems budget \nunder IGCC, Vision 21. Unfortunately, DOE requested only $3.5 million \nfor the ITM Oxygen project. Underfunding ITM Oxygen in fiscal year 2003 \nby $3 million would result in a delay of the program, by at least one \nyear and I am advised it would add approximately $10 million to the \nprogram's costs.\n  Second, DOE's ITM Syngas program is developing a ceramic membrane \nreactor able to separate oxygen from air and partially oxidize methane \nto produce synthesis gas in a single step. Development of this \ntechnology will lead to numerous applications including clean \ntransportation fuels, hydrogen for fuel cell applications, and chemical \nfeedstocks. A critical application is gas-to-liquids, GTL, conversion \nwhere ITM Syngas technology will significantly improve the overall \neconomics of GTL and permit the economical recovery of more than 37 \ntrillion cubic feet of stranded Alaska North Slope gas.\n  Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. is leading a research team \ncomprising Pacific Northwest National Laboratories, McDermott \nTechnology, Ceramatec, ChevronTexaco, Eltron Research, Norsk Hydro, the \nUniversity of Alaska-Fairbanks, the University of Pennsylvania, and \nPennsylvania State University.\n  The DOE fiscal year 2003 cost share requirement is $5.5 million from \nthe Fossil Energy Research and Development, Coal and Other Power \nSystems, President's Coal Research Initiative, Fuels, Transportation \nFuels and Chemicals program. DOE's fiscal year 2003 budget request of \n$5.0 million for the Fossil Energy Research and Development, Coal and \nOther Power Systems, President's Coal Research Initiative, Fuels, \nTransportation Fuels and Chemicals program budget includes just $2.4 \nmillion to continue the ITM Syngas/Hydrogen project. Underfunding ITM \nSyngas in fiscal year 2003 would result in stretching out the program \nand increasing overall program costs.\n  I want to thank the Senators from West Virginia and Montana for \nhaving supported in the past both the ITM Oxygen and Syngas programs. \nBecause of their attention, both development efforts have remained on \ncost, on schedule and promise to be true success stories. Now I want to \nthank them again,\n\n[[Page S8663]]\n\nfor adding $6 million to the DOE's request for IGCC programs and $15 \nmillion for transportation fuels and chemicals programs. This \nadditional funding will ensure that ongoing programs like the ITM \nOxygen and ITM Syngas are fully funded in fiscal year 2003. I look \nforward to working with both the Senator from West Virginia and the \nSenator from Montana as they conference with our colleagues in the \nHouse of Representative to ensure that $6.5 million is provided for ITM \nOxygen and ITM Syngas is funded at $5.5 million.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8663-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Vice Admiral Norbert \nRobert Ryan, Jr., United States Navy, who will retire on Sunday, \nDecember 1, 2002, after 35-years of faithful service to our Nation.\n  Hailing from Mountainhome, PA, Vice Admiral Ryan graduated from the \nU.S. Naval Academy in 1967. Following graduation he attended flight \ntraining and was designated a Naval Aviator in 1968. After completing \nadditional technical training, he spent three years with Patrol \nSquadron EIGHT conducting antisubmarine warfare patrols during the \nheight of the Cold War.\n  Returning to the Naval Academy from 1972 to 1975, Vice Admiral Ryan \nhelped shape future Navy leaders while serving as a Company Officer and \nMidshipman Personnel Officer. While at the Academy he concurrently \nattended graduate school, earning a Master of Science degree in \nPersonnel Administration from George Washington University.\n  In 1975, Vice Admiral Ryan returned to the fleet, commencing a period \nof nine straight years of sea-duty assignments in which he served on a \nCarrier Group Commander's staff and flew P-3 Orion aircraft in three \ndifferent Patrol Squadrons, including service as the Commanding Officer \nof Patrol Squadron FIVE. From 1984 to 1986, he was assigned as the \nOperations Officer on the staff of Commander, Patrol Wing ELEVEN and \nthen as Force Operations Officer for Commander, Patrol Wings, Atlantic.\n  After serving two years as the Administrative Assistant to the Chief \nof Naval Operations, Vice Admiral Ryan completed studies at the John F. \nKennedy School of Government, Senior Officer National Security Program, \nenroute to command of Patrol Wing TWO.\n  From 1991 to 1993, Vice Admiral Ryan served as Executive Assistant to \nthe Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. During the period of 1993-\n1995, he was assigned to the Bureau of Naval Personnel, first as \nDirector for Total Force Programming and then as Director for \nDistribution.\n  Vice Admiral Ryan returned to the fleet as Commander Patrol Wings \nPacific/Commander Task Force 12 and then to the Pentagon where he \nperformed superbly as the Navy's Chief of Legislative Affairs, serving \nin that important post from 1996 to 1999.\n  In November 1999, Vice Admiral Ryan assumed duties as Chief of Naval \nPersonnel/Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, Manpower and Personnel. In \nthis position, he distinguished himself through exceptionally \nmeritorious service as he expertly developed and executed a visionary \nNavy personnel strategy, dynamic assignment system placement \nimprovements, intelligent manpower allocations and many carefully \ncrafted quality of life initiatives. His relentless efforts directly \nprovided an unprecedented level of personnel readiness throughout the \nNavy.\n  A leader by example, Vice Admiral Ryan fostered creative concepts for \ntaking care of people by applying focused mentoring and one-on-one \nleadership with the individual Sailor foremost in mind. He was the \ndriving force that positioned the Navy's human resource organization \nfor optimum support of the Service's needs. A true visionary, he \nsupported manpower reform, new Fleet personnel requirements, and \ninnovation in personnel management and manpower preparation for new \noperational platforms and weapons systems.\n  During his tenure as Chief of Naval Personnel, Vice Admiral Ryan \noversaw unprecedented success in quality of life enhancements for all \nNavy men and\n\n[[Page S8664]]\n\nwomen and their families. These enhancements included the establishment \nand improvement of cost-efficient and extremely effective recruiting \nand reenlistment incentives, implementation of the Thrift Savings Plan, \nexpansion of life insurance benefits to active duty family members and \nimprovements to the process by which Sailors receive housing \nallowances. His actions maintained sensitivity to Fleet requirements \nwhile being ever mindful of our most vital asset - the Sailor.\n  Vice Admiral Ryan's leadership, intelligent stewardship and \nexceptional commitment to all naval personnel stand to ensure the \nsuccess of our Navy well into the 21st Century. He is an individual of \nuncommon character and his professionalism will be sincerely missed. I \nask my colleagues on both side of the aisle to rise with me to thank \nVice Admiral Norb Ryan for his honorable service in the United States \nNavy, and to wish him and his family fair winds and following seas as \nhe closes his distinguished military career. We also wish Norb Ryan and \nhis wife, Judy, success, happiness, and good health as he takes the \nhelm as President of The Retired Officer's Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8664-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8664-S8665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, the Senate confirmed the 74th, \n75th, 76th, and 77th judicial nominations from President George W. \nBush. We have confirmed more of President Bush's nominees in less than \n15 months than were confirmed in the last 30 months that a Republican \nmajority controlled the Senate and the pace of judicial confirmations. \nWe have done more in half the time. We have also already confirmed more \nof President George W. Bush's judicial nominations since July 2001, \nthan were confirmed in the first two full years of the term of his \nfather President George H.W. Bush.\n  We are recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month and this week I understand \nthat the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has a number of meetings and \nevents planned. It seems a good time to take stock of where we are with \nregard to judicial nominees who are Hispanic.\n  I am informed that out of all of President George W. Bush's judicial \nnominations less than 10 are Hispanic or Latino; indeed, the percentage \nof nominees who are Hispanic is approximately 6 percent, which is, or \ncourse, less than half of the percentage of Hispanics in the population \nof the United States. Earlier this year the Puerto Rican Legal Defense \nand Education Fund issued a report ``Opening the Courthouse Doors: The \nNeed for More Hispanic-American Judges.'' The report urged the \nPresident to take action to address the persistent problem of Hispanic \nunder-representation in Federal judgeships by nominating ``qualified \nHispanic candidates who have also had a demonstrated interest and a \nmeaningful involvement in the work and activities of the Hispanic \ncommunity.'' I regret that the President has not heeded this \nrecommendation.\n  President Clinton nominated more than 30 Hispanic candidates for \njudicial vacancies. Unfortunately, some of them were denied hearings \nand votes during the years in which a Republican majority controlled \nthe Senate process. Qualified, mainstream Hispanic nominees such as \nChristine Arguello of Colorado, Enrique Moreno of Texas, and Jorge \nRangel also of Texas, who were nominated to circuit courts and Anabelle \nRodriquez of Puerto Rico and Ricardo Morado of Texas, who were \nnominated to district courts, were defeated without a hearing or a \nvote. Others, such as Judges Rosemary Barkett of Florida, Sonia \nSotomayor of New York, Carlos Lucero of Colorado, Jose Cabranes of \nConnecticut, Kim Wardlaw of California, Fortunado Benavides of Texas, \nand Richard Paez of California who were nominated to the circuit courts \nwere eventually confirmed, many after lengthy delays by Republicans and \nRepublicans' efforts to vote down their nominations.\n  For example, three of President Clinton's first 14 judicial nominees \nwere Hispanic. One of them, Judge Barkett of Florida, who was nominated \nto the Eleventh Circuit, was targeted by Republicans for defeat based \non their claims about her judicial philosophy or ideology. Despite \nnumerous procedural efforts by Republicans, then in the minority, to \ndelay and defeat her nomination, Judge Barkett was eventually \nconfirmed. Although she had received a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' \nrating from the ABA, 36 Republicans voted against her confirmation.\n  Once Republicans took over the Senate in 1995, they slowed down the \nconfirmation process dramatically, especially for circuit court \nnominees. They delayed the confirmation of Judge Sotomayor to the \nSecond Circuit and tried to defeat her nomination because the \nRepublican leadership feared she could be elevated to the Supreme \nCourt. Even though Judge Sotomayor, like Judge Barkett, received a \nunanimous ``Well Qualified'' rating from the ABA, 29 Republicans voted \nagainst her confirmation on grounds of judicial philosophy or ideology. \nRepublicans also delayed the confirmation of Judge Richard Paez for \nover 1,500 days, and after numerous procedural efforts to defeat his \nnomination through delay, Republicans mustered 39 votes against his \nconfirmation.\n  Others Hispanic nominees, like Judge Fuentes who was nominated to the \nThird Circuit, had to wait a year to be confirmed. This was not because \nRepublicans were busy confirming other circuit court nominees. In the \n15 months after he was nominated, Republicans allowed only seven \ncircuit court nominees to be confirmed. In contrast, the Democratic-led \nSenate has confirmed 13 of this President's circuit court nominees in \nless than 15 months, and two others are awaiting a vote on the floor.\n  President Clinton also appointed Judge Ricardo Urbino to the District \nCourt in D.C., Judges Daniel Dominguez, Salvador Casellas, and Jay \nGarcia Gregory to the District Court in Puerto Rico, Judge Victor \nMarrero to the District Court in the Southern District of New York, \nJudges David Briones, Orlando Garcia, and Hilda Tagle to the District \nCourts in Texas, Judges Mary Murguia and Frank Zapata to the District \nCourts in Arizona, Judge Carlos Murguia to the District Court in \nKansas, and Judge Adalberto Jordan to the District Court in Miami. \nRepublicans delayed on a number of Hispanic nominees to the District \nCourts, including Judge Tagle who waited more than 30 months to be \nconfirmed while Ms. Rodriguez waited more than 30 months to never be \nconfirmed during the period of Republican control of the Senate.\n  In contrast, rather than reflecting the growing Hispanic population \nand increasing numbers of qualified Hispanic lawyers who are \npotentially judicial nominees, the Bush Administration's nominations \nhave resulted in very few Hispanic judicial nominees compared to the \nClinton Administration. President Bush has chosen only 8 Hispanics out \nof the 128 judicial nominations he has made. That is most regrettable.\n  Since the change in majority, we have moved quickly on the few \nHispanic nominees who have been forwarded by this White House. Judge \nChristina Armijo was confirmed in May, 2001. Judge Phillip Martinez was \nconfirmed last September. Judge Randy Crane was confirmed in March. \nJudge Jose Martinez was confirmed last week. Magistrate Judge Alia \nLudlum, who was nominated in July and whose ABA peer review was \nrecently received, is participating in a confirmation hearing this \nweek. Unfortunately, because the White House nominated Judge James \nOtero and Jose Linares in July and August and has changed the 50-year \ntradition regarding ABA peer reviews, the ABA peer reviews on these \nrecent nominees have not been received or they, too, would have had \nhearings. Each of the other Hispanic nominees to federal trial courts \nparticipated in a confirmation hearing within 60 days of having a \ncompleted file. In addition, I am planning another confirmation hearing \nto include Miguel Estrada.\n  Thus, Democrats will have held hearings on every Hispanic judicial \nnominee submitted by the President who has a completed file. The \nDemocratic majority has proceeded to vote to confirm every Hispanic \ndistrict court nominee who has had a hearing. Moreover, we have \nproceeded without the years of delay that used to accompany \nconsideration of minority judicial nominees.\n\n  In ``Justice Held Hostage,'' the bipartisan Task Force of Federal \nJudicial Selection of the Citizens for Independent Courts, co-chaired \nby Mickey\n\n[[Page S8665]]\n\nEdwards and Lloyd Cutler, reported that during the period of Republican \ncontrol of the Senate judicial nominees who were ethnic minorities or \nwomen took longer to get considered by the Senate, were less likely to \nbe voted on and less likely to be confirmed--if they were considered at \nall by the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I recall all too well the months and years it took for the \nRepublican-controlled Senate to confirm Hispanic judicial nominees like \nJudge Sotomayor, Judge Paez, and Judge Tagle, in addition to other \nwomen or minorities like Judge Margaret Morrow, Judge Marsha Berzon, \nJudge Ann Aiken, Judge Margaret McKeown, and Judge Susan Oki Mollway. I \nalso recall the numerous women and people of color who were nominated \nto the federal bench by President Clinton but who were never given \nhearings by the Republicans, like Judge Roger Gregory, Judge Helene \nWhite, Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and Kathleen McCree Lewis. Judge \nWhite of the Michigan Court of Appeals waited over 1,500 days but was \nnever given a hearing or a vote. Still others, like Bonnie Campbell, \nwere given a hearing but never given a vote on their nominations. These \nare just a few of the women and minorities whose confirmations were \ndelayed or defeated through delay.\n  President Clinton worked hard to increase the diversity of the \nfederal bench and 12 percent of his appointments to the circuit courts \nwere Latino. It would have been closer to 16 percent if all of his \nHispanic nominees to the circuit courts had been accorded hearings and \nvotes. By contrast, President Bush has nominated only one Hispanic to \nthe dozens of circuit court vacancies that have existed during his \nterm. Thus, as of today, 3 percent of this President's circuit court \nnominees are Hispanic. Between the circuit vacancies that were blocked \nby Republicans and the new ones that have arisen during the past 15 \nmonths, President Bush has had the opportunity to choose nominees for \n41 vacancies on the circuit courts--13 of these have already been \nconfirmed. This President has chosen only one Hispanic to fill any of \nthese 41 vacancies, and none to any of the following vacancies: the \nfour vacancies in the Tenth Circuit, which includes Colorado and New \nMexico, among other States; the three vacancies on the Fifth Circuit, \nwhich includes Texas; the six vacancies on the Ninth Circuit, which \nincludes California and Arizona, among other States; none to the three \nvacancies in the Second Circuit, which includes New York; and none to \nthe three vacancies on the Third Circuit, which includes New Jersey and \nPennsylvania.\n  If this White House had looked a little harder and were not so \nfocused on packing the circuit court bench with a narrow ideology, it \ncould have found many qualified nominees, like Enrique Moreno, Jorge \nRangel, Christina Arguello and others to fill these vacancies. Instead, \nPresident Bush did not choose to re-nominate these individuals who had \nbeen unfairly blocked by members of his party, and he also withdrew the \nnomination of Enrique Moreno to the Fifth Circuit, a nomination that \nthe ABA had rated ``Well Qualified.''\n  So when Republicans try to take credit for President Clinton's \nHispanic nominees and try to blame Democrats for the lack of Hispanic \nnominees by President Bush, they should be confronted with the facts \nand asked why they opposed so many of President Clinton's qualified \nHispanic nominees and why so many of them voted against Judge Paez and \nJudge Sotomayor and Judge Barkett, and why so many Hispanic nominees \nwere delayed for years and why so many were never given hearings or \nvotes. Of course the facts have not prevented unfounded accusations by \ncritics of the Democratic majority. The Republican press conference \naccusing Senate Democrats of being anti-Hispanic was an example of such \ninflammatory and baseless accusations.\n  As the Congressional Hispanic Caucus meets this week with Hispanic \nleaders from across the country, I welcome their views on the few \nHispanic judicial nominees sent to the Senate by the President and \ntheir help in encouraging this White House to work more closely with \nSenators from both political parties to nominate qualified, mainstream \nHispanic nominees to the federal bench.\n  Our diversity is one of the great strengths of our Nation, and that \ndiversity of background should be reflected in our federal courts. Race \nor ethnicity and gender are, of course, not substitutes for the wisdom, \nexperience, fairness and impartiality that qualify someone to be a \nfederal judge entrusted with lifetime appointments to the federal \nbench. White men should get no presumption of competence or \nentitlement. Hispanic and African American men and women should not be \npresumed to be incompetent. All nominees should be treated fairly, but \nno one is entitled to a lifetime appointment to preside over the claims \nof American citizens and immigrants in our federal courts. We must, of \ncourse, carefully examine the records of all nominees to such high \noffices, but we know well the benefits of diversity and how it \ncontributes to achieving and improving justice in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8665-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, the Committee on Finance filed a report on \nS. 1971 without the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate. I ask \nunanimous consent that the CBO cost estimate be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n               congressional budget office cost estimate\n\n     S. 1971--National Employee Savings and Trust Equity Guarantee \n         Act\n       Summary: S. 1971 would make several changes to both the \n     Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) that would affect the operations \n     and taxation of private pension plans. These include changing \n     the requirements for diversification options, providing \n     information to assist participants in making investment \n     decisions, and changing the premiums paid to the Pension \n     Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). In addition, S. 1971 \n     would modify the tax treatment of certain executive \n     compensation and make other changes.\n       The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that the \n     bill would increase governmental receipts by $437 million \n     over the 2003-2007 period, and by $221 million over the 2003-\n     2012 period. Most of the revenue increase would occur in 2003 \n     ($578 million), and the bill would result in a loss of \n     revenue from 2005 through 2010.\n       CBO estimates that the bill would increase direct spending \n     by $36 million over the 2003-2007 period and by $89 million \n     over the 2003-2012 period. Discretionary spending would also \n     increase by $4 million over the 2003-2007 period, assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts. Because S. 1971 would \n     affect revenues and direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures \n     would apply.\n       JCT has determined that the revenue provisions of the bill \n     do not contain any mandates. CBO has determined that the \n     other provisions contain no intergovernmental mandates, but \n     they do contain several mandates on sponsors, administrators, \n     and fiduciaries of private pension plans. CBO estimates that \n     the direct cost of those new requirements on private-sector \n     entities would exceed the annual threshold specified in the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act ($115 million in 2002, adjusted \n     annually for inflation).\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of the bill is shown in the following table.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                                          ------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              2003       2004       2005       2006       2007\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nExecutive compensation provisions........................        182         95         68         40         19\nChange in interest rate for calculating plans' funding           397        -54       -119        -97        -65\n requirement.............................................\nVoluntary early retirement incentive plans...............         -1         -4         -7        -10        -10\n                                                          ------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page S8666]]\n\n \n      Total revenues.....................................        578         37        -57        -66        -55\n \n                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nFlat-rate PBGC premiums..................................

The provisions relating to executive \n     compensation would tax without deferral certain compensation \n     provided through offshore trusts, and require wage \n     withholding at the top marginal tax rate for certain \n     supplemental wage payments in excess of $1 million. Those \n     provisions would increase revenues by $182 million in 2003, \n     by $402 million over the 2003-2007 period, and by $496 \n     million over the 2003-2012 period. The pension-related \n     provision with the largest revenue effect would alter the \n     allowable interest rates used to calculate pension funding \n     requirements (see discussion below). That provision would \n     increase revenues by $62 million over the 2003-2007 period \n     and reduce revenues by $199 million over the 2003-2012 \n     period. Other pension provisions would reduce revenues by $1 \n     million in 2003, by $32 million over the 2003-2007 period, \n     and by $82 million over the 2003-2012 period.\n       Direct spending\n       Reduced Flat-Rate Premiums Paid to PBGC--Under current law, \n     defined benefit pension plans operated by a single employer \n     pay two types of annual premiums to the Pension Benefit \n     Guaranty Corporation. All covered plans are subject to a \n     flat-rate premium of $19 per participant. In addition, \n     underfunded plans must also pay a variable-rate premium that \n     depends on the amount by which the plan's liabilities exceed \n     its assets.\n       The bill would reduce the flat-rate premium from $19 to $5 \n     per participant for plans established by employers with 100 \n     or fewer employees during the first five years of the plans' \n     operations. According to information obtained from the PBGC, \n     approximately 7,500 plans would eventually qualify for this \n     reduction. Those plans cover an average of 10 participants \n     each. CBO estimates that the change would reduce the PBGC's \n     premium income by less than $500,000 in 2003 and by $8 \n     million over the 2003-2012 period. Since PBGC premiums are \n     offsetting collections to a mandatory spending account, \n     reductions in premium receipts are reflected as increases in \n     direct spending.\n       Changes in Variable Premiums Paid to the PBGC.--S. 1971 \n     would make several changes affecting the variable-rate \n     premium paid by underfunded plans. CBO estimates, in total, \n     this section will decrease receipts from those premiums by $9 \n     million in 2003 and $51 million over the 2003-2012 period.\n       First, for all new plans that are underfunded, the bill \n     would phase in the variable-rate premium. In the first year, \n     the plans would pay nothing. In the succeeding four years, \n     they would pay 20 percent, 40 percent, 60 percent, and 80 \n     percent, respectively, of the full amount. In the sixth and \n     later years, they would pay the full variable-rate premium \n     determined by their funding status. On the basis of \n     information from the PBGC, CBO estimates that this change \n     would affect the premiums of approximately 250 plans each \n     year. It would reduce the PBGC's total premium receipts by \n     about $2 million in 2004 and by $41 million from 2004 through \n     2012.\n       Second, the bill would reduce the variable-rate premium \n     paid by all underfunded plans (not just new plans) \n     established by employers with 25 or fewer employees. Under \n     the bill, the variable-rate premium per participant paid by \n     those plans would not exceed $5 multiplied by the number of \n     participants in the plan. CBO estimates that approximately \n     2,500 plans would have their premium payments to the PBGC \n     reduced by this provision beginning in 2004. As a result, \n     premium receipts would decline by $1 million in 2004 and by \n     $10 million over the 2004-2012 period.\n       Finally, the bill would alter the allowable interest rates \n     used to calculate pension funding requirements contained in \n     ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, which would allow plans \n     to become more underfunded in plan year 2001 without \n     subjecting them to tax and other penalties. Even though most \n     plan-year 2001 accounts will be finalized in September 2002, \n     the new interest rate requirement would give some plans \n     credits that may be used in plan-year 2002, which would \n     affect premiums paid in fiscal year 2003. JCT estimates that \n     this provision initially would cause employers to reduce \n     pension plan contributions, but later increase these \n     contributions until fund returns to baseline levels. Some \n     plans subsequently would have to pay higher premiums because \n     their reduced contributions would further increase their \n     level of underfunding. Other plans, however, would qualify \n     for a special exemption and not be required to pay the \n     variable premium for plan-year 2001. Based on information \n     from the PBGC, CBO estimates the net effect would be a \n     decrease of $9 million in premium receipts in 2003. From 2004 \n     through 2007, premium income would then increase, resulting \n     in a net change in receipts of less than $500,000 over the \n     2003-2007 period.\n       Authorization for the PBGC to Pay Interest on Refunds of \n     Premium Overpayments.--The legislation would authorize the \n     PBGC to pay interest to plan sponsors on premium \n     overpayments. Interest paid on overpayments would be \n     calculated at the same rate as interest charged on premium \n     underpayments. On average, the PBGC receives $19 million per \n     year in premium overpayments, charges an interest rate of 8 \n     percent on underpayments, and experiences a two-year lag \n     between the receipt of payments and the issuance of refunds. \n     Based on this information, CBO estimates that direct spending \n     would increase by $3 million annually.\n       Substantial Owner Benefits in Terminated Plans.--S. 1971 \n     would simplify the rules by which the PBGC pays benefits to \n     substantial owners (those with an ownership interest of at \n     least 10 percent) of terminated pensions plans. Only about \n     one-third of the plans taken over by the PBGC involve \n     substantial owners, and the change in benefits paid to \n     owners-employees under this provision would be less than \n     $500,000 annually.\n       Discretionary spending\n       Studies. S. 1971 would direct the PBGC, the Department of \n     Labor, and the Department of the Treasury to undertake four \n     studies: one regarding establishing an insurance system for \n     individual retirement plans, one on the fees charged by \n     individual retirement plans, one on ways to revitalize \n     defined benefits pension plans, and one on floor-offset \n     employee stock ownership plans. Based on the costs of studies \n     with comparable requirements, CBO estimates these studies \n     would cost about $4 million over the 2003-2012 period, \n     assuming the availability of appropriated funds.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts. The net changes in governmental receipts that are \n     subject to pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in the \n     following table. For the purpose of enforcing pay-as-you-go \n     procedures, only the effects through 2006 are counted.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                              By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               2003       2004       2005       2006       2007       2008       2009       2010       2011       2012\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in receipts.......................        578         37        -57        -66        -55        -97        -94        -50          4         21\nChanges in outlays........................         12          3          5          7          9         10         10         11         11         11\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page S8667]]\n\n       Estimated impact on state, local, and tribal governments: \n     JCT has determined that the revenue provisions of S. 1971 \n     contain no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA).\n       CBO reviewed the non-revenue provisions of S. 1971 and has \n     determined that they contain no intergovernmental mandates as \n     defined in UMRA and would impose no costs on state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: With only limited \n     exceptions, private employers who provide pension plans for \n     their workers must follow rules specified in ERISA. \n     Therefore, CBO considers changes in ERISA that expand those \n     rules to be private-sector mandates under UMRA. The \n     nonrevenue provisions of S. 1971 would make several such \n     changes to ERISA that would affect sponsors, administrators, \n     and fiduciaries of pension plans. CBO estimates that the \n     direct cost to affected entities of the new requirements in \n     the bill would exceed the annual threshold specified in UMRA \n     ($115 million in 2002, adjusted annually for inflation). JCT \n     has determined that the revenue provisions of S. 1971 do not \n     contain any private-sector mandates.\n       Title I of the bill would impose restrictions on \n     individual-account (that is, defined contribution) plans \n     regarding assets held in the plans in the form of securities \n     issued by the plan's sponsor. The bill would require affected \n     plans to allow participants to immediately sell those \n     securities that have been acquired through the employee's \n     contributions, and to allow participants to sell certain \n     securities acquired through the employer's contributions \n     after three years of service with the firm. The latter \n     requirement would be phased in over three years. CBO \n     estimates that the added administrative and record-keeping \n     costs of this provision would be approximately $20 million \n     annually, with larger amounts in the first year.\n       Title I also would require plans to offer a range of \n     investment options. This requirements would add little to \n     plans' costs because many plans now abide by a safe harbor \n     provision in ERISA that has similar requirements.\n       Title II of the bill would impose restrictions on plan \n     administrators during transaction suspension periods. \n     (Transaction suspension periods are periods of time when \n     participants are unable to direct the investment of assets in \n     their accounts--for example, when a plan is changing \n     recordkeepers.) To avoid financial liability during those \n     time periods, fiduciaries would be required to abide by \n     certain conditions. The bill also would increase the \n     maximum bond required to be held by fiduciaries from \n     $500,000 to $1 million. CBO estimates that the direct cost \n     of these provisions to plan sponsors and fiduciaries would \n     be small.\n       Title III of the bill would impose a number of requirements \n     on plans regarding information they must provide to their \n     participants. Administrators of defined contribution plans \n     would be required to provide quarterly statements to \n     participants. Those statements would have to contain several \n     items, including the amount of accrued benefits and bested \n     accrued benefits, the value of investments held in the form \n     of securities of the employing firm, and an explanation of \n     any limitations or restrictions on the right of the \n     individual to direct the investments. Currently, plans must \n     provide more limited statements to participants upon request. \n     CBO estimates that, while many plans now provide pension \n     statements on a quarterly basis, about 30 million \n     participants would begin to receive quarterly statements as a \n     result of this bill. The added cost of this requirement would \n     be about $100 million annually.\n       Title III also would require administrators of private \n     defined-benefit pension plans to provide vested participants \n     currently employed by the sponsor with a benefit statement at \n     least once every three years, or to provide notice to \n     participants of the availability of benefit statements on an \n     annual basis. CBO estimates that the cost of this provision \n     would be less than $5 million annually.\n       In addition, Title III would require plans to provide \n     participants with basic investment guidelines and information \n     on option forms of benefits, as well as information that plan \n     sponsors must provide to other investors under securities \n     laws. Plans also would have to make available on a web site \n     any disclosures required of officers and directors of the \n     plan's sponsor by the Securities and Exchange Commission. CBO \n     estimates that the cost of these provisions would exceed $25 \n     million annually.\n       Previous CBO estimates: CBO has prepared cost estimates for \n     three other bills that contain provisions similar to those in \n     S. 1971. These are:\n       H.R. 3669, the Employee Retirement Savings Bill of Rights, \n     as reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means on March \n     14, 2002 (CBO estimate dated March 20, 2002),\n       H.R. 3762, the Pension Security Act of 2002, as ordered \n     reported by the House Committee on Education and the \n     Workforce on March 20, 2002 (CBO estimate dated April 4, \n     2002), and\n       S. 1992, the Protecting America's Pensions Act of 2002, as \n     ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions on March 21, 2002 (CBO \n     estimate dated May 7, 2002).\n       The major budgetary effects of H.R. 3669, like S. 1971, \n     pertain to revenue provisions that relate to pension plan \n     funding. (H.R. 3669 also included a provision excluding \n     certain stock options from wages.) H.R. 3669's provisions \n     affecting pension would produce an estimated revenue loss of \n     $1.2 billion over the 2002-2012 period, compared with the \n     $277 million revenue loss projected for the pension \n     provisions of S. 1971 over the 2003-2012 period.\n       Like S. 1971, both H.R. 3669 and H.R. 3762 would make \n     several changes to ERISA affecting premiums collected by the \n     PBGC. CBO estimated that H.R. 3669 would increase direct \n     spending by $104 million over from 2003-2012 and H.R. 3762 \n     would increase direct spending by $185 million over the same \n     period. Unlike S. 1971, H.R. 3762 included a provision \n     amending the underlying formula used to determine variable \n     rate-premiums for plan-year 2003. Also, one of the changes \n     made by H.R. 3762 would first apply to plan-year 2002, while \n     that provision in S. 1971 would start with plan-year 2003. \n     Both bills also contained somewhat different language than S. \n     1971 affecting the interest rates used to calculate variable-\n     rate premiums in the plan-year 2001.\n       S. 1992 did not have any estimated impact on either \n     revenues or direct spending.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal revenues: Annie Bartsch; \n     Federal spending: Geoff Gerhardt; impact on state, local and \n     tribal governments: Leo Lex; impact on the private sector: \n     Bruce Vavrichek.\n       Estimate approved by: Robert A.

Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes to \ndescribe some of the challenges facing rural health care systems and \nwhy I feel it is critical for the Senate to act now to reduce the \ninequities in Medicare funding between rural and urban providers.\n  Rural America depends on its small town hospitals, physicians and \nnurses, nursing homes, those who provide emergency ambulance services, \nand other members of our rural health care system. And because of past \nand proposed cuts in Medicare reimbursement, plus historical unfairness \nin Medicare payments, these vital services are in jeopardy.\n  Like most of my Senate colleagues, I supported the Balanced Budget \nAct, BBA, of 1997 when it was enacted by Congress with strong \nbipartisan support. Prior to the passage of this law, Medicare was \nprojected to be insolvent by 2001, so it was imperative that we took \naction to extend Medicare's financial health and to constrain its rate \nof growth to a more sustainable level.\n  We later found that the Balanced Budget Act worked to reduce Medicare \nprogram costs, but many health care providers were adversely affected \nby payment reductions that were larger than intended. To address these \nconcerns, Congress in 1999 made adjustments in the Balanced Budget \nRefinement Act, BBRA, followed in 2000 by the Medicare Beneficiary \nImprovement and Protection Act, BIPA. Without these needed changes, \nfrankly, as many as a dozen of North Dakota's hospitals might be closed \ntoday.\n  But, additional legislation is still needed to improve Medicare \nreimbursement for health care providers in order to stabilize the \nMedicare program and ensure that beneficiaries, especially in rural \nareas, will continue to have access to their local hospitals, \nphysicians, nursing homes, home health, and other services. Many small \nrural hospitals in particular serve as the anchor\n\n[[Page S8668]]\n\nfor the full range of health care services in their communities, from \nambulatory to long-term care. Medicare is the single most significant \npayer for services at these hospitals, and as such, it has an impact on \nthe whole community.\n  Part of the problem in North Dakota is simply demographics: North \nDakota's population is the second oldest in the Nation, and our \npopulation is shrinking daily. In fact, in 13 of North Dakota's \ncounties, there were 20 or fewer births for the entire county last \nyear. Admissions to rural hospitals have dropped by a drastic 60 \npercent in the last two decades, and those patients who do remain tend \nto be older, poorer, and sicker. This means that rural hospitals tend \nto be disproportionately dependent upon Medicare reimbursement, to the \nextent that Medicare accounts for 85 percent of their revenue. \nObviously, given this reality, changes in Medicare reimbursement have a \nmajor impact on the financial health of rural hospitals.\n  Another part of the problem is that Medicare has historically \nreimbursed urban health care providers at a much higher rate than their \nrural counterparts. Of course, some of this difference can be explained \nby regional differences in the cost of health care and variations in \nthe health status of older Americans. But this is not the whole \nexplanation. Even after adjusting for these factors, a recent report by \nhealth care economists found that, for example, Medicare's \nper beneficiary spending was about $8,000 in Miami, but only $3,500 in \nMinneapolis. When average Medicare payments for the same procedure are \ncompared, the disparities in payment in different areas of the country \nare dramatic. The table below compares payments for two of the most \ncommon procedures in North Dakota: hospitalization for heart failure \nand shock, and hospitalization for treatment of pneumonia.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Heart\n               Location in U.S.                 Failure and     Simple\n                                                   Shock      pneumonia\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNorth Dakota..................................       $3,079       $3,383\nCalifornia....................................        4,774        5,153\nNew York......................................        4,471        5,237\nDistrict of Columbia..........................        6,168        6,588\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  As you can see, the average payment for these same hospital \nprocedures, in larger and more urbanized States like New York and \nCalifornia, is 150 percent of the Medicare payment for the same \nprocedure in North Dakota. The average Medicare payment for these same \nprocedures is twice as high in the District of Columbia. In my opinion, \nthe difference is largely explained by a Medicare reimbursement system \nthat is skewed in favor of urban area, and past legislation has done \nlittle to address that concern, despite efforts by some of us to do so.\n  I have cosponsored legislation in the Senate, the Area Wage and Base \nPayment Improvement Act, S. 885, that would address the rural inequity \nin Medicare reimbursement in two ways. First, this bill would equalize \nthe ``standardized payment'' which forms the basis for Medicare's \nreimbursement to hospitals. You would think something called the \n``standardized payment'' would already be standard, but the fact is \nthat hospitals in rural and small urban areas, including all of North \nDakota, receive a smaller standardized payment than large urban \nhospitals. This bill would raise all hospitals up to the same \nstandardized payment.\n  Second, S. 885 would increase the wage index for most of North \nDakota's hospitals. This is a major area of concern that I hear about \nfrom North Dakota hospital administrators. The current wage index, \nwhich is an important factor in a hospital's total Medicare \nreimbursement, is based on an antiquated theory that it costs more to \nhire hospital staff in urban areas than it does in rural areas. That \nmay have been true once, but it is no longer true today. Today, \nhospitals in North Dakota are competing with hospitals in Minnesota, \nChicago and elsewhere for the same doctors and nurses, and they have to \npay competitive wages in order to recruit staff.\n  I am also a cosponsor of the Rural Health Care Improvement Act of \n2001, S. 1030. This legislation introduced by Senator Conrad would, \namong other things, provide for a new ``low volume'' adjustment payment \nfor hospitals with a smaller number of patients and establish a \nrevolving loan fund to help rural health care facilities make much-\nneeded capital improvements.\n  I also want to mention a positive impact of the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997. That legislation created the Critical Access Hospital program, \nwhich has proven to be critically important to the survival of North \nDakota's smallest and most rural hospitals. Twenty-eight of North \nDakota's rural hospitals, serving about 181,000 North Dakotans, have \nnow converted to Critical Access Hospital status, which allows them to \nreceive cost-based reimbursement from Medicare. I strongly support \ncontinuing this program and making some modest changes to strengthen \nthe program. We also need to reauthorize the Rural Hospital Flexibility \nprogram, which provides grants to states to assist small rural \nhospitals in making the switch to Critical Access Hospitals.\n  In addition, Congress also must make some other changes to Medicare \nreimbursement to head off some upcoming reductions in payments. For \ninstance, Medicare reimbursement to physicians and allied health \nproviders is scheduled to be reduced by 12 percent over the next three \nyears because of problems with the payment formula. In addition, \nreimbursement to home health agencies is scheduled to be cut by 15 \npercent on October 1, and a 10 percent payment boost for rural home \nhealth agencies expires at the end of this year. And skilled nursing \nhomes will be facing a 10 percent reduction in their Medicare payment \nrates in 2003 and a 19 percent cut in 2004 unless Congress acts to \navert this ``cliff'' in funding. I support making changes in all of \nthese areas to help address these concerns.\n  In closing, I think we as a Nation need to acknowledge that a strong \nhealth care system is an important part of our rural infrastructure. \nOver the years, we have determined that rural electric service, rural \ntelephone service, an interstate highway system through rural areas, \nand rural mail delivery, to name a few services, make us a better, more \nunified Nation. We need to make the same determination in support of \nour rural health care system, and I will be fighting for policies that \nreflect rural health care as a strong national priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8668-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8668-S8669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ON CONSTITUTION DAY, THE WORK OF THE SENATE, AND BALANCING THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to note an interesting coincidence \nof things that are happening, and not happening, today.\n  Many Americans are celebrating today as Constitution Day. At 4 p.m. \neastern time, on September 17, 1787, the Framers of the U.S. \nConstitution adjourned the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. \nThe Constitution they proposed, after deep debates and tortured \ncompromise, was then submitted to the several States for ratification, \nand for the judgment of history.\n  According to the nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, Constitution \nDay, Inc., at 4 p.m. today, ``schools across America will be led in the \nrecitation of the Preamble to the US Constitution on a national \nteleconferencing call conducted by Sprint . . . churches across America \nwill be led in the ringing of their bells to honor the First Amendment, \nFreedom of Religion . . .'' and there will be commemorations from \nValley Forge, PA, to a replica of Independence Hall at Knott's Berry \nFarm, CA.\n  Little can be said, that has not been said before, about the profound \nwisdom, foresight, and faith that the Framers of our Constitution \nbrought to constructing the foundational document of our Nation's \nsystem of government and laws.\n  President Coolidge said of the Constitution, in 1929, ``The more I \nstudy it, the more I have come to admire it, realizing that no other \ndocument devised by the hand of man ever brought so much progress and \nhappiness to humanity.''\n  I rise to acknowledge this special day of celebrating our \nConstitution and I join all Americans in paying tribute to the patriots \nwho produced it.\n  For many Americans, one of the signs of our deep respect for the \nConstitution is our acknowledgment that, in exceptional cases, a \nproblem rises to such a level that it can be adequately addressed only \nin the Constitution, by way of a Constitutional amendment.\n\n[[Page S8669]]\n\n  Yesterday, President Bush spoke forcefully about the Senate's failure \nto pass a budget resolution for the fiscal year that starts in just 14 \ndays. He called upon us to do what was needed, urgent, and responsible, \nand to do it promptly, by sending him this year's defense appropriation \nand the homeland security bill. And in all this, the need to maintain \nfiscal discipline becomes evident, as we see a return to deficit \nspending.\n  For 4 years in a row, a modern record, the first time since the \n1920s, Republican Congresses balanced the Federal Budget. The first \nRepublican Congresses in 40 years made balancing the budget their top \npriority, and did what was necessary to run the kind of surpluses we \nneed to pay down the national debt and safeguard the future of Social \nSecurity.\n  Today, the Federal budget is again written in red ink. The \nCongressional Budget Office's recently released budget update projects \na $157 billion deficit for fiscal year 2002, the year about to end. If \nyou don't count the Social Security surplus, the rest of the government \nwill run a $317 billion deficit.\n  Under current policies, CBO says the deficit will be about the same \nnext year, in fiscal year 2003. But we don't know today what war \nagainst terrorism will demand next year. And, unfortunately, we do know \nthat too many in Congress and too many interest groups are demanding \nlarge increases in spending for other purposes.\n  This year's budget deficit was caused by an economic recession and a \nwar begun by a terrorist attack. Even before taking office, President \nBush correctly foresaw the coming recession and prescribed the right \nmedicine, the bipartisan Tax Relief Act of 2001, that has bolstered the \neconomy and prevented a far worse recession.\n  We will rebound from the recent economic slowdown. And we must do \nwhatever it takes to win the war, that's a matter of survival and of \nprotecting the safety and security of the American people. Beyond that, \nwe must keep all other federal spending under control, so that we \nreturn, as soon as possible, to balancing the budget.\n  Even in the heady days of budget surpluses, I always maintained the \nonly way to guarantee that the Federal Government would stay fiscally \nresponsible was to add a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. \nBefore we balanced the budget in 1998, the government was deficit \nspending for 28 years in a row and for 59 out of 67 years. The basic \nlaw of politics, to just say ``yes'' was not repealed in 1998, but only \nrestrained some, when we came together and briefly faced up to the \ngrave threat to the future posed by decades of debt.\n  The Government is back to borrowing. And for some, a return to \ndeficit spending seems to have been liberating, as the demands for new \nspending only seem to be multiplying again.\n  That is why, on Constitution Day, it is important to me to be a \ncosponsor of S.J. Res. 2, and to call again for Congress to adopt a \nBalanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution and send it to the states \nfor ratification. I also stress that this amendment would not count the \nSocial Security surplus in its calculation of a balanced budget. Those \nannual surpluses would be set aside exclusively to meet the future \nneeds of Social Security beneficiaries.\n  On Constitution Day, I call on the Senate to do today's work: Send \nthe President a Defense appropriations bill, send the President a \nhomeland security bill, and pass a budget that holds the line on new \nspending. And, on Constitution Day, I call on the Senate to safeguard \nthe future, by again taking up a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8669-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     HONORING FREEDOM SERVICE DOGS\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

He set a world record in the 100 meters at the IAAF \nGrand Prix Final in Paris with a time of 9.78 seconds, one-hundredth of \na second faster than the old record.\n  It may surprise some of my colleagues in this body that South \nCarolina could produce the fastest runner in the world. They look at \nthe races for Senate that Senator Thurmond and I have been involved \nwith, and have probably concluded our state produces only marathoners.\n  But the new generation of South Carolinians excel in speed. Mr. \nMontgomery has demonstrated great talent as a sprinter, as the 2001 USA \nOutdoor champion and a gold medalist in the 2000 Olympic 4x100 relay. \nNo question, his hard work culminated in his perfect run this past \nweek, making him the best of the world's best.\n  I know every track fan in our nation joins those of us in South \nCarolina in congratulating Mr. Montgomery and wishing him continued \nsuccess in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8669-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE VICTIMS OF THE KATYN FOREST MASSACRE\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nmemory of the victims of the Katyn Forest Massacre in 1940.\n  On September 17, 1939, Soviet troops invaded Poland in accordance \nwith the German-Soviet agreement. While Polish troops fought bravely, \nthey ultimately were overwhelmed by the Soviet forces.\n  In an effort to eliminate potential threats to Soviet control of \nPoland, Soviet troops, under Stalin's orders, committed what some have \ncalled one of the most heinous war crimes in history. Over 15,000 \nPolish soldiers, officers, intellectual leaders, prisoners of war and \nother Polish citizens were executed. Between four and five thousand \nPolish bodies were buried in a mass grave in the Katyn Forest. There \nwere no trials, no justice for these innocent victims.\n  While the Soviet government denied complicity, on February 19, 1989 \nit finally released documents confirming their role in this massacre. \nHowever, an admission of complicity does not ease the pain of a nation \nwhose entire population was affected by this horrible event.\n  I am hopeful that as more people learn of the Katyn Forest Massacre, \nwe will be able to come to terms with this tragedy and the pain that it \nhas caused so many. We must continue to honor the memories of those who \nwere lost that day, so that we will not be destined to repeat this \ncentury the horrors which so often affected the last.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8669-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8669-S8670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO STORAGETEK\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

This weekend, Mr. Jett will be honored \nas Kentucky's Outstanding Older Worker for 2002 at an awards ceremony \nhosted by Experience Works.\n  Mr. Jett's life is an example of selfless devotion to community \nimprovement. He was an educator, high school principal and \nsuperintendent of schools in Kentucky until his retirement in 1982. \nHowever, Mr. Jett's idea of retirement is certainly not traditional.\n  Currently, the city of Campton, KY, has the privilege of calling Mr. \nJett its mayor. Along with community development, the improvement and \nbeautification of Campton is always in the forefront of his mind. One \nwill often find Mr. Jett sweeping sidewalks or tending to the \nlandscape, showing his pride for Campton and Kentucky. As in all areas \nof his life, Mr. Jett leads by example, never resting on his laurels.\n  Aside from his service in the public sector, Mr. Jett operates a tour \ncompany, he organized the East Kentucky Talent Project to help young \nmusicians, and he has taught square dancing, western dancing and \nclogging for the past 40 years at the Natural Bridge State Park. His \nactive lifestyle does not show signs of slowing, even after being \ndiagnosed with cancer in 1998, and undergoing knee replacement surgery.\n  At a time when civic pride is not only desirable, but essential, Mr. \nJett's life is an example of how we should treat our city, state, \nnation and fellow citizens: with upmost respect, compassion and \ndedication. He is truly an American Hero to the lives he touches daily. \nPlease join me in honoring the distinguished career of Mr. Richard H. \nJett.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8670-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY UNITAS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a legend \nin the world of professional football, the late Johnny ``Golden Arm'' \nUnitas. I would also like to extend my most heartfelt condolences to \nhis wife Sandy, his daughters Paige and Janice Ann, and his sons John, \nKenneth, Robert, Christopher, Joe and Chad. I know my colleagues join \nme in expressing our gratitude for Johnny's many contributions.\n  Revered as the greatest quarterback of all time, Johnny was a man of \nincredible integrity and was a hero to many, both on and off the field. \nAfter graduating from St. Justin's High School in Pittsburgh, PA, where \nhe got his start playing football as a sophomore, Johnny began to set \nhis sights on college football. He found his niche at the University of \nLouisville. As quarterback for the university's football team, Johnny's \nskills and leadership demanded the attention of national recruiters. He \nwas signed by the Baltimore Colts in 1956, and proved to be one of the \nteam's greatest assets for 17 seasons.\n  His impressive accomplishments include throwing touchdown passes in a \nrecord 47 consecutive games and being the first quarterback in the NFL \nto pass a total of 40,000 yards. During his celebrated career in the \nNFL, Johnny received many of the game's highest awards. He was named \nPlayer of the Year in 1959, 1964 and 1967, was named Player of the \nDecade for the 1960s. On July 28, 1979, Johnny was enshrined into the \nPro Football Hall of Fame. He was also named the Greatest Player in the \nFirst 50 years of Pro Football, was named to the NFLs 75th Anniversary \nTeam, and had his number, 19, retired by the Baltimore Colts.\n  Indeed, Johnny Unitas will forever be considered one of the greatest \nfootball players in history. But his legacy doesn't end there. He was a \ndown-to-earth role model who cherished interaction with teammates and \nyounger players. In 1987, the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award was \nestablished in his name to honor the top senior quarterback in college \nfootball each year. Additionally, after completing his reign in the \nNFL, Unitas continued to visit Louisville to help his alma mater with \nanything he could.\n  I am certain that the legacy of excellence that Johnny Unitas has \nleft will continue on, and will inspire others. On behalf of myself and \nmy colleagues in the Senate, I offer my deepest condolences to Johnny's \nfriends and loved ones, and express my gratitude for all he contributed \nto the University of Louisville, the National Football League and to \nour great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8670-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8670-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8670-5", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPERIODIC REPORT ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS PAYMENTS MADE TO CUBA PURSUANT TO \n             TREASURY DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC LICENSES--PM 108\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 1705(e)(6) of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, \nas amended by section 102(g) of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic \nSolidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996, 22 U.S.C. 6004(e)(6), I transmit \nherewith a semiannual report prepared by my Administration detailing \npayments made to Cuba by United States persons as a result of the \nprovision of telecommunications services pursuant to Department of the \nTreasury specific licenses.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to authorize grants for the establishment of quasi-\njudicial\n\n[[Page S8675]]\n\ncampus drug courts at colleges and universities modeled after State \ndrug courts programs; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Campus Classmate \nOffenders in Rehabilitation and Treatment Act.''\n  The Campus Classmate Offenders in Rehabilitation and Treatment Act, \nwhich can also be referred to as the ``Campus CORT Act,'' directs the \nDepartment of Justice to establish a demonstration program to provide \ngrants and training to help our Nation's universities and colleges \nestablish new quasi-judicial systems. These systems aim at countering \nthe serious drug and substance abuse related problems that are taking \nsuch a heavy toll on our institutions of higher learning and the \nstudents who attend them. The demonstration program, which would be \nadministered by the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs, \nwould be based on the valuable lessons and successes we have garnered \nfrom our Nation's innovative and expanding drug court system.\n  Specifically, this demonstration program legislation would authorize \nthe establishment of up to five Campus CORTs each year for Fiscal Years \n2003 through 2006. The bill authorizes the Office of Justice Programs \nto provide $2,000,000 in Federal funding during each of those years to \nhelp get five Campus CORTs well trained, soundly established and up and \nrunning. This new program's approach should be similar to how the \nOffice of Justice Programs currently runs the ongoing drug court grant-\nmaking program, including providing an Internet-based application \nprocess.\n  There are plenty of good reasons to take the next step and establish \na Campus CORTs program based on the drug court model. Since they first \nappeared in 1989, drug courts have rapidly spread all across the \nNation. Rather than simply locking-up nonviolent drug offenders in \nprison along side violent criminals, drug courts provide the \nalternative of court-supervised treatment. Instead of simply punishing, \ndrug courts help get people clean.\n  Drug courts' many successes are underscored both by the bipartisan \nsupport they have received in Congress and by the Bush Administration. \nFor example, during a national conference hosted this last April by the \nNational Association of Drug Court Professionals, both Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy Director John Walters, our Nation's ``Drug \nCzar,'' and Drug Enforcement Agency Director Asa Hutchinson gave \nspeeches in support of drug courts.\n  According to the latest statistics as reported by the Department of \nJustice's Office of Justice Programs, there are nearly 700 Drug Courts \nin operation all across the United States. This includes 483 Adult Drug \nCourts, 167 Juvenile Drug Courts, and 37 Family Drug Courts. An \nadditional 400-plus new Drug Courts are in the planning process. The \nreport goes on to state that approximately 220,000 adults and 9,000 \njuveniles have been enrolled in the drug court system and of those, \n73,000 adults and 1,500 juveniles have graduated.\n  The merits of the drug court system are well documented. Nationwide, \nthe drug courts have helped more than 1,000 to be born drug free, more \nthan 3,500 parents to regain custody of their children, and 4,500 \nparents to resume making their child-support payments. The retention \nrate is over 70 percent, with 73 percent of the participants managing \nto keep their jobs or successfully find new work. These are encouraging \nsuccesses, and not just for the individuals involved, but for society \nas a whole.\n  These are the kind of successes we should be able to see once the \ndrug court model is customized and applied through Campus CORTs as we \nwork together to respond to the alcohol, drug and other substance abuse \nchallenges facing our Nation's colleges and universities.\n  Our Nation's drug courts use a carrot and stick approach where \noffenders can either live at home and remain free to work under court \nsupervised treatment or face the very real threat of hard jail time. \nSimilarly, Campus CORTs will give troubled students the chance to get \nsupervised treatment and stay clean or get kicked out of school and \nwatch their futures get squandered away.\n  Instead of simply booting students with substance abuse problems \ndirectly out of school, as is currently happening at many universities \nand colleges all across the country, I believe we should instead help \nprovide institutions of higher learning with new tools they can use to \nhelp students get and stay clean. Of course, just like it is with the \nexisting drug courts, there will be some students who simply do not \nrespond to Campus CORTs. While those students will have to face the \nfact that they may well be expelled from school, at least we will have \nbeen able to give them the opportunity to clean-up their act.\n\n  Since the new Campus CORTs would be established at colleges and \nuniversities, the legislation calls on the Office of Justice Programs, \nor OJP, to establish new ``quasi-judicial standards and procedures for \ndisciplinary cases'' for institutions of higher learning that wish to \nparticipate in the new Federal program.\n  Today, I am pleased to highlight that one of the leading institutions \nof higher learning in my home State, Colorado State University, CSU, \nhas already broken new ground as the Nation's first university to apply \nthe drug court concept in a campus setting. The ``Day IV'' program, as \nit is known at CSU, has racked-up a successful record in helping keep \nstudents clean and in school.\n  Under the pioneering leadership of Cheryl Asmus, the drug court \ninspired program helped 26 out of 30 students who would have otherwise \nbeen kicked out of school stay there during the last spring semester \nalone. As I understand it, two of the four were dismissed from school \nfor not meeting the Day IV program's treatment requirements and the \nother two left school for other reasons.\n  In any case, a success rate approaching 90 percent is a wonderful \naccomplishment, both for the university and especially for the 26 \nstudents who have managed to pull themselves back from potential \ndisaster.\n  Our drug court system is making a difference all across our Nation. \nIn fact, a 2002 report issued by Columbia University's prestigious \nNational Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse states that ``drug \ncourts provide closer, more comprehensive supervision and much more \nfrequent drug testing and monitoring during the program, than other \nforms of community supervision.'' The report underscores that ``drug \nuse and criminal behavior are substantially reduced while offenders are \nparticipating in drug court'' and that ``criminal behavior is lower \nafter participation, especially for graduates.''\n  Far too many of our Nation's college students are falling by the \nwayside as they get sidetracked by crippling drug and alcohol abuse \nproblems. Not only are academic careers being impacted and ended, \nentire lives are being thrown into limbo.\n  Our Nation's drug court system is a good example of a viable and \nproductive partnership between the Federal Government, our State \ngovernments and local jurisdictions. Their collaboration is making a \npositive impact all across our country. I want to take this moment to \nthank the people of the OJP, the experts at the National Association of \nDrug Court Professionals and the State and local judges, prosecutors, \nlaw enforcement officers and other officials who have done so much to \nestablish, build upon and continually improve our Nation's drug court \nsystem.\n  I also want to take a moment to thank Judge Karen Freeman Wilson, \nChief Executive Officer of the National Association of Drug Court \nProfessionals, Stuart VanMeveren, District Attorney for Colorado's \nEighth Judicial District, and Colorado State University President \nAlbert Yates for their letters of support for the Campus CORT \nlegislation I am introducing today. Their support for this bill is \nappreciated.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the three letters of support and the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2941\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Campus Classmate Offenders \n     in Rehabilitation and Treatment Act'' or the ``Campus CORT \n     Act''.\n\n[[Page S8676]]\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF CAMPUS DRUG COURTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Attorney General, acting through the \n     Office of Justice Programs, is authorized to make \n     demonstration grants to accredited universities and colleges \n     to establish not to exceed 5 campus classmate offenders in \n     rehabilitation and treatment programs (referred to as \n     ``Campus CORTS'') each fiscal year modeled after the \n     statewide local drug court programs throughout the United \n     States.\n       (b) Campus CORTS.--Campus CORTS shall--\n       (1) be established at accredited colleges or universities;\n       (2) have jurisdiction over substance abuse related \n     disciplinary cases involving students that may or may not be \n     criminal in nature, including illegal drug use, abuse of \n     prescription drugs, alcohol abuse, and other issues, but no \n     student who is deemed to be a danger to the community may be \n     involved;\n       (3) pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney \n     General, establish appropriate quasi-judicial standards and \n     procedures for disciplinary cases; and\n       (4) impose as the ultimate sanction expulsion from school.\n       (c) Consultation.--The Attorney General shall consult with \n     the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, d.b.a., \n     the National Drug Court Institute, universities and colleges, \n     including the Campus Drug Court program at Colorado State \n     University, and other experts in establishing quasi-judicial \n     standards required by this Act.\n       (d) Assistance.--The Attorney General shall make grants to \n     qualified universities and colleges, the National Association \n     of Drug Court Professionals, d.b.a., the National Drug Court \n     Institute, and other associations and experts to assist in \n     establishing campus drug courts and provide training and \n     technical assistance in support of the program.\n       (e) Grant Making Considerations.--In awarding grants to \n     qualified colleges or universities, the Office of Justice \n     Programs should--\n       (1) endeavor to include colleges and universities of \n     different sizes across the United States; and\n       (2) enable colleges and universities to apply for grants \n     through the Internet site of the Office of Justice Programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated $2,000,000 for each \n     of the fiscal years 2003 through 2006 to carry out this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  August 23, 2002.\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: As the representative of the \n     National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) and \n     of the drug court professionals throughout the country I am \n     writing this letter of support for your bill for the ``Campus \n     Classmate Offenders in Rehabilitation and Treatment Act'' or \n     the `'Campus CORT Act.'' Modeled after the ``campus drug \n     court'' at Colorado State University, campus drug courts \n     nationwide are the exciting next step in the drug court \n     arena. I truly appreciate your commitment to making them a \n     reality.\n       All of the drug court professionals across America laud the \n     depth of your knowledge about substance abuse and its \n     concomitant crime and appreciate your steadfast support of \n     stopping the revolving door of drug addiction and crime in \n     our criminal justice system. With the alarming news about \n     drug use and binge drinking on college campuses, the Campus \n     CORT Act will face the campus drug and alcohol use and abuse \n     problem head on, preventing accidents and crimes at colleges \n     and universities throughout the nation.\n       Taking the drug court concept to this next level, to \n     college campuses, is the logical way to further the fight \n     against substance abuse and criminal behavior. As you know, \n     Columbia University's prestigious National Center on \n     Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) report from 2001 states \n     that drug courts provide closer, more comprehensive \n     supervision and much more frequent drug testing and \n     monitoring during the program, than other forms of community \n     supervision. In addition, it found that drug use and criminal \n     behavior are substantially reduced while offenders are \n     participating in drug court.\n       Again, thank you for introducing the `'Campus CORT Act'' \n     and for your continuing support of drug courts. I look \n     forward to continuing to work with you and your staff in the \n     future.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                Judge Karen Freeman Wilson (ret.),\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n         Office of the District Attorney, Eighth Judicial \n           District, State of Colorado,\n                                Fort Collins, CO, August 28, 2002.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Fort Collins, CO.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: I wholeheartedly support your \n     proposed ``Campus CORT Act.''.\n       As you know, Colorado State University, through the work of \n     Dr. Cheryl Asmus and others, has developed a Campus Drug \n     Court that is now in full operation. Prior to the \n     implementation of the CSU Campus Drug Court, many bright, \n     promising college students lost their opportunity to obtain \n     their college degree because of being dismissed from school \n     as a result of a drug or alcohol addiction. This new pilot \n     program provides students who have drug or alcohol problems a \n     process in which they can address their usage problem while \n     staying in school. Colorado State University's project has \n     proven very successful. Very few students in the program have \n     failed to abide by the program requirements. Most \n     participants have been able to abstain from usage. This \n     success is due to the very strong impetus for students to \n     ``stay clean'' by allowing them to continue to have access to \n     grants and loans, as well as remain at the university so long \n     as they abide by drug court requirements.\n       Federal legislation that creates funding to expand the \n     campus drug court program is an excellent proposal. This \n     program helps promising young people, who have chosen to \n     improve their lives through a college education, succeed when \n     alcohol and drugs may be the one obstacle that stands in \n     their way. They are given the opportunity to stay in school, \n     graduate, and become contributing members of society. That \n     success is insured by addressing a drug or alcohol addiction \n     problem that very well would have a negative affect on their \n     families and their ability to succeed professionally.\n       The availability of federal funds to assist in starting \n     these programs across the country has the promise of spawning \n     very successful drug and alcohol programs nationwide. The \n     traditional Drug Court concept has been very successful. The \n     Campus CORT Act can provide the resources that will result in \n     the same success opportunity for students at our colleges and \n     universities.\n       We wish you every success in your efforts to pass this \n     legislation. If there is anything I can do to assist, please \n     do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Stuart A. Vanmeveren,\n     District Attorney.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Colorado State University,\n\n                              Fort Collins, CO, September 4, 2002.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: This letter serves as strong support \n     for the bill you are proposing to introduce to the United \n     States Senate that will authorize the appropriation of funds \n     to establish ``drug courts'' at other colleges and \n     universities. These drug courts will be modeled after the \n     Drug Courts Program, and the Colorado State University (CSU) \n     campus drug court. I understand that CSU will play a critical \n     role as consultant to the Attorney General of the United \n     States in this effort, and we are committed to working in any \n     capacity in this effort. As the first, and only university \n     with a campus drug court to date, we are in a unique position \n     to provide first-hand experience and advice.\n       In late 1999, the Family and Youth Institute at Colorado \n     State University set up several meetings with the CSU Office \n     of Judicial Affairs and Colorado's Eighth Judicial District \n     Drug Court. The result of these meetings spawned an effort to \n     apply for support to establish a ``campus drug court.'' In \n     mid-2001, the Family and Youth Institute was awarded two \n     years of support for the drug court from the U.S. Department \n     of Education. Currently, a cross-disciplinary team meets \n     weekly to staff the drug court students. After one semester \n     in operation, all but four (one school dropout, two expelled \n     from program, one positive breathalyzer) of approximately 20 \n     students remain trouble and AOD free. So far, we have three \n     drug court graduates and recorded improvements in the other \n     participants in terms of grades, employment, family \n     situations, attitudes, and behaviors.\n       As a Carnegie Class I research institution, CSU is poised \n     to lead the field in determining what factors of a drug court \n     influence their success. I am aware of the current debates \n     across the nation of the true impacts of the 1000 plus drug \n     courts. I am confident that by introducing the model into the \n     world of academia, inevitably it will inevitably spur \n     research that will result in research-based evidence to \n     concretely address these debates and concerns.\n       We have found the model to be easily adaptable to our \n     campus setting and have listed as one of our four goals to \n     assist other campuses in developing their own campus drug \n     courts. We are extremely grateful and appreciative you have \n     decided to assist us in this goal. It is not an accident that \n     Colorado State University, and Colorado, will lead in this \n     effort. You have long championed drug courts and, in \n     particular, the Eighth Judicial District's Juvenile Drug \n     Court, our mentor.\n       A key strategy of Colorado State University is civic \n     education renewal. A part of this strategy is to focus on \n     initiatives and programs that assist students in developing \n     into people of integrity and strong values. We are also \n     dedicated to the ability to graduate students in four years \n     who are prepared to enter the world as contributing citizens. \n     Using dismissal or expulsion as a consequence for someone \n     with a substance abuse problem is a quick fix for our campus, \n     but not for the individual or the community at large. As a \n     land-grand institution, valuing service to our society, we \n     believe the integration of drug court's goal of using \n     treatment with strong interventions into the disciplinary \n     system, as an alternative to dismissal or expulsion directly \n     supports the mission of Colorado State University.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Albert C. Yates,\n                                                        President.\n\n[[Page S8677]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Crapo (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Specter, Mr. Miller, Mr. \n        McCain, and Mr. Bunning)\n  S. 2942. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \neliminate the five-month waiting period in the disability insurance \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. Crapo. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation that will correct a serious flaw in the Social Security \nDisability Insurance program, which currently forces many Americans who \nare diagnosed with a terminal illness to live out their final days in \npoverty.\n  Under current law, any eligible individual applying for SSDI benefits \nmust wait 5 full months before he or she can begin receiving benefits. \nI appreciate the support of Senator Bayh, Senator Specter, Senator \nMcCain, and Senator Miller for this bill that will eliminate the \nwaiting period for those individuals with terminal illnesses.\n  Far too often, I have had terminally ill constituents contact me \nthrough my State offices with horror stories about their personal \nexperiences. These people are healthy, hard-working members of our \nsociety. Suddenly, they are told by their doctor that they have a \nterminal illness and that it would be best if they stop working and go \non disability as soon as possible to maintain their strength. However, \nbecause of the waiting period, before they know it, these people are \nseveral months behind in their bills. Others, unfortunately, do not \neven live through the full waiting period.\n  I am sure that if any of my colleagues were to contact their State \noffices and speak to their staff that handle these disability cases, \nthey would find that their constituents have faced similar difficulties \nwith this waiting period. Like every other hard-working American, these \nterminally ill individuals have all paid into the Social Security \nsystem throughout their working lives, with the expectation that future \nbenefits would be there to supplement lost income should a disability \nor serious illness ensue.\n  I am please that this legislation has the support of the National \nAssociation for the Terminally Ill. This organization's primary mission \nis to assist individuals diagnosed with a terminal illness, whose life \nexpectancy is two years or less. They have told me of the many \nindividuals that have come to them for assistance, faced with no \nincome, while waiting through those 5 months before receiving \ndisability benefits. Frequently, the association is contacted by people \nwho are forced to sell furniture, cars, family heirlooms, and even \ntheir homes, just to pay expenses for daily living.\n  Two years ago, this Congress did the right thing by waiving the 24-\nmonth waiting period for Medicare coverage for individuals diagnosed \nwith Lou Gehrig's Disease. The time has now come for Congress to take \nthe appropriate action to relieve part of what is already an \nunthinkable burden on all terminally ill individuals.\n  I invite my colleagues to join us in this effort and I hope the \nSenate will proceed expeditiously with this important legislation that \nwill provide relief for tens of thousands of working Americans. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2942\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall take effect with \n     respect to applications filed after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Leahy, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 2943. A bill to amend title 9, United States Code, to provide for \ngreater fairness in the arbitration process relating to livestock and \npoultry contracts; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Iowa to \nintroduce legislation to give farmers options in identifying a forum to \nresolve disputes with agribusinesses.\n  This legislation is based on our amendment to the Senate-passed Farm \nBill that was unfortunately stripped in the conference committee. Our \namendment passed by a vote of 64-31, yet it was ultimately taken out \ndue to objections by large agribusiness companies in the backroom \nnegotiations.\n  While our effort then was not successful, I am hopeful that we will \nbe able to pass this legislation and begin to give farmers a fair shot \nin the marketplace.\n  I am deeply concerned that the concentration of power in the hands of \na few large agribusiness firms, companies that can raise a billion \ndollars on Wall Street at the drop of a hat, is forcing farmers and \nranchers to be placed at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace.\n  These large corporations are using their market power to force \nindependent producers into a position of weakness through unfair \ncontracts and other uses of market leverage.\n  In some cases, the domestic marketplace has become almost \nnoncompetitive for the family farmer. Farmers have fewer buyers and \nsuppliers than ever before. One indication of this dominance is one-\nsided contracts that favor agribusinesses at the expense of farmers and \nranchers.\n  It is of paramount importance that we help restore competition in \nrural America. One way to promote competition is to ensure that farmers \nhave a choice of forums to resolve disputes with agribusinesses.\n  While alternative methods of dispute resolution such as arbitration \ncan serve a useful purpose in resolving disputes between parties, I am \nextremely concerned about the increasing trend of stronger parties to a \ncontract forcing weaker parties to waive their legal rights and agree \nto arbitrate any future disputes that may arise.\n  It recently came to my attention that large agribusiness companies \noften present producers with ``take it or leave it'' contracts, which \nincreasingly include mandatory and binding arbitration clauses. This \npractice forces farmers to submit their disputes with packers and \nprocessors to arbitration.\n  As a result, farmers are required to waive access to judicial or \nadministrative forums, substantive contract rights, and statutorily \nprovided protections. In short, this practice violates the farmers' \nfundamental due process rights and runs directly counter to basic \nprinciples of fairness.\n  Arbitration is billed as an inexpensive alternative to civil \nlawsuits. The opposite, however, is often the case. Filing fees and \nother expenses in arbitration result in much higher costs for the \nparties than civil actions. Attorney fees, whether hourly or \ncontingency, are similar regardless of forum.\n  For example, in a recent Mississippi case, filing fees for a poultry \ngrower to begin an arbitration proceeding were $11,000. This is far \nmore than the $150 to $250 cost of filing in civil court. It makes no \nsense for a farmer to seek payment for wrongdoing when he or she has \nlost $10,000, when it costs\n\n[[Page S8678]]\n\n$11,000 just to get the case before an arbitrator.\n  The practical result of these mandatory arbitration clauses is that \nfarmers have no forum in which to bring their dispute against the \ncompany. Arbitration clauses require farmers to waive their right to a \njury trial and bring a dispute only in a forum that my be cost-\nprohibitive. Farmers, who likely have substantial debts due to low \nprices and large mortgages on their farms, are often left without any \nrecourse even in a case where the agribusiness has plainly acted \nillegally.\n  With the litigation option taken away by contract and the arbitration \nforum taken away by economics, the grower has no forum in which to \nbring his or her dispute against the company. The net result of these \nmandatory arbitration clauses is that the farmer always loses.\n  If poultry farmers lose their farms as a result of a mis-weighed \nanimal, they should have the right to hold the company accountable. \nWhen farmers are hurt because they have received bad feed, we must \nensure that they are able to choose the forum through which they can \nresole their concerns.\n  If farmers believe they have been provided diseased animals from an \nagribusiness, they should at least have a forum in which to voice their \nconcerns.\n  In short, we must give farmers a fair choice that both parties to an \nagricultural contract may willingly and knowingly select. This \nlegislation therefore does not prohibit arbitration. It simply ensures \nthat the decision to arbitrate is truly voluntary and that the rights \nand remedies provided for by our judicial system are not waived under \ncoercion.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this legislation and give farmers \noptions to resolve disputes in the agriculture marketplace.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered printed in the Record, \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 2943\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

To authorize appropriations for nanoscience, \nnanoengineering, and nanotechnology research, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the 21st Century \nNanotechnology Act. This bill would authorize a coordinated interagency \nprogram that will support long-term nanoscale research and development \nleading to potential breakthroughs in areas such as materials and \nmanufacturing, nanoelectronics, medicine and healthcare, environment, \nenergy, chemicals, biotechnology, agriculture, information technology, \nand national and homeland security. Building on the National \nNanotechnology Initiative, the bill would authorize appropriations for \nresearch throughout the government while providing tools for better \ncross-agency management and coordination\n  Nanotechnology is the science and technology of building electronic \ncircuits and devices from single atoms and molecules on a scale of one \none-billionth of a meter. It will one day change the way Americans \nlive.\n  I am convinced that this so-called ``small science'' is the next big \nthing'' in technology. The world is on the cusp of a nanotechnology \nrevolution that will change our lives on a scale equal to, if not \ngreater than, the computer revolution. The United States could miss \nthat revolution if our nanotechnology work remains uncoordinated and \nscattered across a half-dozen Federal agencies. That would be tragic on \nseveral levels, from scientific to social to economic.\n  I am determined that the United States will not miss, but will mine \nthe opportunities of nanotechnology. To do this, I want America to \nmarshal its various nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to \nremain the world's leader in this burgeoning field. And I believe \nFederal support is essential to achieving that goal.\n  The legislation I am pleased to be introducing today with Senator \nLieberman will provide a smart, accelerated, and coordinated approach \nto nanotechnology research, development, and education. In my view, \nthere are three major steps America must take to ensure the highest \nsuccess for its nanotechnology efforts.\n  First, a National Nanotechnology Research Program should be \nestablished to coordinate long-term fundamental nanoscience and \nengineering research. The program's goals will be to ensure America's \nleadership and economic competitiveness in nanotechnology, and to make \nsure ethical and social concerns are taken into account alongside the \ndevelopment of this discipline.\n  Second, the Federal Government should support nanoscience through a \nprogram of research grants, and also through the establishment of \nnanotechnology research centers. These centers would serve as key \ncomponents of a national research infrastructure, bringing together \nexperts from the various disciplines that must intersect for nanoscale \nprojects to succeed. As these research efforts take shape, educational \nopportunities will be the key to their long-term success. As chairman \nof the Commerce Committee's Science, Technology, and Space \nSubcommittee, I have already laid out a challenge to triple the number \nof people graduating with math, science and technology degrees. Today, \nI commit to helping students who would enter the field of \nnanotechnology. This discipline requires multiple areas of expertise. \nStudents with the drive and the talent to tackle physics, chemistry, \nand the material sciences simultaneously deserve all the support we can \noffer.\n\n  Third, the government should create connections across its agencies \nto aid in the coordination of nanotechnology efforts. These could \ninclude a national coordination office, and a Presidential \nNanotechnology Advisory Committee, modeled on the President's \nInformation Technology Advisory Committee.\n  I also believe that at these organizational support structures are \nput into place, rigorous evaluation must take place to ensure the \nmaximum efficiency of our efforts. The bill would call for an annual \nreview of America's nanotechnology efforts from the Presidential \nAdvisory Committee, and a periodic review from the National Academy of \nSciences. In addition to monitoring our own progress, the U.S. should \nkeep abreast of the world's nanotechnology efforts through a series of \nbenchmarking studies.\n  If the Federal Government fails to get behind nanotechnology now with \norganized, goal-oriented support, this nation runs the risk of falling \nbehind others in the world who recognize the\n\n[[Page S8679]]\n\npotential of this discipline. Nanotechnology is already making pants \nmore stain-resistant, making windows self-washing and making car parts \nstronger with tiny particles of clay. What America risks missing is the \nnext generation of nanotechnology. In the next wave, nanoparticles and \nnanodevices will become the building blocks of our health care, \nagriculture, manufacturing, environmental cleanup, and even national \nsecurity.\n  America risks missing a revolution in electronics, where a device the \nsize of a sugar cube could hold all of the information in the Library \nof Congress. Today's silicon-based technologies can only shrink so \nsmall. Eventually, nanotechnologies will grow devices from the \nmolecular level up. Small though they may be, their capabilities and \ntheir impact will be enormous. Spacecraft could be the size of mere \nmolecules.\n  America risks missing a revolution in health care. In my home State, \nOregon State University researchers are working on the microscale to \ncreate lapel-pin-sized biosensors that use the color-changing cells of \nthe Siamese fighting fish to provide instant visual warnings when a \nbiotoxin is present. An antimicrobial dressing for battlefield wounds \nis already available today, containing silver nanocrystals that prevent \ninfection and reduce inflammation. The health care possibilities for \nnanotechnology are limitless. Eventually, nanoscale particles will \ntravel through human bodies to detect and cure disease. Chemotherapy \ncould attack individual cancer cells and leave healthy cells intact. \nTiny bulldozers could unclog blocked arteries. Human disease will be \nfought cell by cell, molecule by molecule, and nanotechnology will \nprovide victories over disease that we can't even conceive today.\n  America risks missing a host of beneficial breakthroughs. American \nscientists could be the first to create nanomaterials for manufacturing \nand design that are stronger, lighter, harder, self-repairing, and \nsafest. Nanoscale devices could scrub automobile pollution out of the \nair as it is produced. Nanoparticles could cover armor to make American \nsoldiers almost invisible to enemies and even tend their wounds. \nNanotechnology could grow steel stronger than what's made today, with \nlittle or no waste to pollute the environment.\n\n  Moreover--and this is key--America risks missing an economic \nrevolution based on nanotechnology. With much of nanotechnology \nexisting in a research milieu, venture capitalists are already \ninvesting $1 billion in American nanotech interests this year alone. \nIt's estimated that nanotechnology will become a trillion-dollar \nindustry over the next ten years. As nanotechnology grows, the ranks of \nskilled workers needed to discover and apply its capabilities must grow \ntoo. In the nanotechnology revolution, areas of high unemployment could \nbecome magnets for domestic production, engineering and research for \nnanotechnology applications--but only if government doesn't miss the \nboat.\n  The Federal Government is already making some efforts with regard to \nnanotechnology. The U.S. does have a National Nanotechnology \nInitiative. This nation has already committed substantial funds to \nnanotechnology research and development in the coming years. But here's \nmy bottom line. It is essential to build on this foundation of funding \nwith a framework for sound science over the long term. That is the \nreason for the legislation I am issuing today. On the framework it \nprovides, of national coordination and strategic planning, scientists \nwill be able to meet the grand challenges of nanotechnology. Over the \nlong term, with Federal support, they will be able to plumb the depths \nof its capability, and scale the heights of its potential.\n  In 1944 the visionary President Franklin Delano Roosevelt requested a \nleading American scientist's opinion on advancing the United States' \nscientific efforts to benefit the world. Dr. Vannevar Bush offered his \nreply to President Harry S Truman the next year, following FDR's death. \nIn his report to the President, Dr. Bush wrote, ``The Government should \naccept new responsibilities for promoting the flow of new scientific \nknowledge and the development of scientific talent in our youth. These \nresponsibilities are the proper concern of the Government, for they \nvitally affect our health, our jobs, and our national security. It is \nin keeping also with basic United States policy that the Government \nshould foster the opening of new frontiers and this is the modern way \nto do it.''\n  Those principles, so true nearly sixty years ago, are truer still \ntoday. With the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development \nAct, I propose that the government now accept new responsibilities in \npromoting and developing nanotechnology. I hope that the Senate can act \nswiftly on this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2945\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century Nanotechnology \n     Research and Development Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The emerging fields of nanoscience and nanoengineering \n     (collectively, ``nanotechnology''), in which matter is \n     manipulated at the atomic level (i.e., atom-by- atom or \n     molecule-by-molecule) in order to build materials, machines, \n     and devices with novel properties or functions, are leading \n     to unprecedented scientific and technological opportunities \n     that will benefit society by changing the way many things are \n     designed and made.\n       (2) Long-term nanoscale research and development leading to \n     potential breakthroughs in areas such as materials and \n     manufacturing, electronics, medicine and healthcare, \n     environment, energy, chemicals, biotechnology, agriculture, \n     information technology, and national security could be as \n     significant as the combined influences of microelectronics, \n     biotechnology, and information technology on the 20th \n     century. Nanotechnology could lead to things such as--\n       (A) new generations of electronics where the entire \n     collection of the Library of Congress is stored on devices \n     the size of a sugar cube;\n       (B) manufacturing that requires less material, pollutes \n     less, and is embedded with sophisticated sensors that will \n     internally detect signs of weakness and automatically respond \n     by releasing chemicals that will prevent damage;\n       (C) prosthetic and medical implants whose surfaces are \n     molecularly designed to interact with the cells of the body;\n       (D) materials with an unprecedented combination of \n     strength, toughness, and lightness that will enable land, \n     sea, air, and space vehicles to become lighter and more fuel \n     efficient;\n       (E) selective membranes that can fish out specific toxic or \n     valuable particles from industrial waste or that can \n     inexpensively desalinate sea water; and\n       (F) tiny robotic spacecraft that will cost less, consume \n     very little power, adapt to unexpected environments, change \n     its capabilities as needed, and be completely autonomous.\n       (3) Long-term, high-risk research is necessary to create \n     breakthroughs in technology. Such research requires \n     government funding since the benefits are too distant or \n     uncertain for industry alone to support. Current Federal \n     investments in nanotechnology research and development are \n     not grounded in any specifically authorized statutory \n     foundation. As a result, there is a risk that future funding \n     for long-term, innovative research will be tentative and \n     subject to instability which could threaten to hinder future \n     Untied States technological and economic growth.\n       (4) The Federal government can play an important role in \n     the development of nanotechnology, as this science is still \n     in its infancy, and it will take many years of sustained \n     investment for this field to achieve maturity.\n       (5) Many foreign countries, companies and scientists \n     believe that nanotechnology will be the leading technology of \n     the 21st century and are investing heavily into its research. \n     According to a study of international nanotechnology research \n     efforts sponsored by the National Science and Technology \n     Council, the United States is at risk of falling behind its \n     international competitors, including Japan, South Korea, and \n     Europe if it fails to sustain broad based funding in \n     nanotechnology. The United States cannot afford to fall \n     behind our competitors if we want to maintain our economic \n     strength.\n       (6) Advances in nanotechnology stemming from Federal \n     investments in fundamental research and subsequent private \n     sector development likely will create technologies that \n     support the work and improve the efficiency of the Federal \n     government, and contribute significantly to the efforts of \n     the government's mission agencies.\n       (7) According to various estimates, including those of the \n     National Science Foundation, the market for nanotech products \n     and services in the United States alone could reach over $1 \n     trillion later this century.\n\n[[Page S8680]]\n\n       (8) Nanotechnology will evolve from modern advances in \n     chemical, physical, biological, engineering, medical, and \n     materials research, and will contribute to cross-disciplinary \n     training of the 21st century science and technology \n     workforce.\n       (9) Mastering nanotechnology will require a unique skill \n     set for scientists and engineers that combine chemistry, \n     physics, material science, and information science. Funding \n     in these critical areas has been flat for many years and as a \n     result fewer young people are electing to go into these areas \n     in graduate schools throughout the United States. This will \n     have to reverse if we hope to develop the next generation of \n     skilled workers with multi-disciplinary perspectives \n     necessary for the development of nanotechnology.\n       (10) Research on nanotechnology creates unprecedented \n     capabilities to alter ourselves and our environment and will \n     give rise to a host of novel social, ethical, philosophical, \n     and legal issues. To appropriately address these issues will \n     require wide reflection and guidance that are responsive to \n     the realities of the science, as well as additional research \n     to predict, understand, and alleviate anticipated problems.\n       (11) Nanotechnology will provide structures to enable the \n     revolutionary concept of quantum computing, which uses \n     quantum mechanical properties to do calculation. Quantum \n     computing permits a small number of atoms to potentially \n     store and process enormous amounts of information. Just 300 \n     interacting atoms in a quantum computer could store as much \n     information as a classical electronic computer that uses all \n     the particles in the universe, and today's complex encryption \n     algorithms, which would take today's best super computer 20 \n     billion years, could be cracked in 30 minutes.\n       (12) The Executive Branch has previously established a \n     National Nanotechnology Initiative to coordinate Federal \n     nanotechnology research and development programs. This \n     initiative has contributed significantly to the development \n     of nanotechnology. Authorizing legislation can serve to \n     establish new technology goals and research directions, \n     improve agency coordination and oversight mechanisms, help \n     ensure optimal returns to investment, and simplify reporting, \n     budgeting, and planning processes for the Executive Branch \n     and the Congress.\n       (13) The the private sector technology innovations that \n     grow from fundamental nanotechnology research are dependent \n     on a haphazard, expensive, and generally inefficient \n     technology transition path. Strategies for accelerating the \n     transition of fundamental knowledge and innovations in \n     commercial products or to support mission agencies should be \n     explored, developed, and when appropriate, executed.\n       (14) Existing data on the societal, ethical, educational, \n     legal, and workforce implications and issues related to \n     nanotechnology are lacking. To help decision-makers and \n     affected parties better anticipate issues likely to arise \n     with the onset and maturation of nanotechnology, research and \n     studies on these issues must be conducted and disseminated.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to authorize a coordinated \n     inter-agency program that will support long-term nanoscale \n     research and development leading to potential breakthroughs \n     in areas such as materials and manufacturing, \n     nanoelectronics, medicine and healthcare, environment, \n     energy, chemicals, biotechnology, agriculture, information \n     technology, and national and homeland security.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, our Nation has long prided itself on \nbeing the world's premier innovator of new ideas. Over the last two and \na half centuries, the uniquely American willingness to experiment with \nnovel concepts and to chart bold directions has placed us at the \nforefront of scientific and technological progress. Our ability to \nengage in scientific exploration and to marry research findings with \nthe development of practical applications has, in turn, enabled us to \nset the benchmark on virtually every indicator of human progress, from \nlonger lifespans, to higher standards of living, to unparalleled \neconomic productivity.\n  However, while past accomplishments may confer a present competitive \nadvantage, it does not guarantee future success. We cannot afford to \nrest on our laurels in a world that is becoming increasingly \ncharacterized by the speed with which scientific paradigms shift and \ntechnological revolutions occur. In a global economy in which ideas and \ntechnology are the new currency, every new breakthrough represents an \nopportunity to claim, or, in our case, lose, global leadership.\n  The emerging field of nanotechnology constitutes such an opportunity. \nIt is not just any opportunity, however, but one whose magnitude and \nsignificance locates it on the scale of harnessing electricity, \ncreating antibiotics, building computers, or wiring up the Internet. It \nis, in short, a new frontier in science and technology that has the \npotential to transform every aspect of our lives. Nanotechnology, in \nfact, may have even greater potential to affect the way we live since \nit has such broad prospective applications in so many different areas, \nfrom medicine, to electronics, to energy. Nanotechnology is what \nscientists and technologists often call an ``enabling'' technology, a \ntool that opens the door to new possibilities constrained only by \nphysics and the limits of our imaginations.\n  Yet, despite the enormous potential that nanotechnology offers, it is \nnot an area in which we have assumed uncontested leadership. From an \ninternational prospective, the United States faces the danger of \nfalling behind its Asian and European counterparts in supporting the \npace of nanotechnological innovation. Other nations have grasped the \nfact that the first players to fully capitalize on the promise of \nnanotechnology have the potential to leap frog in productivity and \nprecipitate a reshuffling in the economic, and perhaps aspects of the \nmilitary, pecking order. Accordingly, they have undertaken substantial \nefforts to invest in nanotechnology research, and to accelerate \ntechnology transfer and commercialization. While our Nation certainly \npossesses the raw resources and talent to lead the world in developing \nthis technology, it is also clear that a long-term focus and sustained \ncommitment, as well as new collaborations between government, academia, \nand industry, will be needed to ensure our place at the head of the \nnanotechnological universe.\n  This is why I am so proud today to join my colleague, Senator Ron \nWyden of Oregon, in introducing the 21st Century Nanotechnology \nResearch and Development Act. This Act will build on the efforts of the \nNational Nanotechnology Initiative, NNI, which was started under \nPresident Clinton and has received continued support under President \nBush, to establish a comprehensive, intelligently coordinated program \nfor addressing the full spectrum of challenges confronting a successful \nnational science and technology effort, including those related to \nfunding, coordination, infrastructure development, technology \ntransition, and social issues.\n  I feel it is appropriate at this point to give credit to President \nClinton for having the prescience and initiative of creating the NNI, \nand to applaud President Bush for expanding support for nanotechnology \nR from $270 million in FY 2000 to the $710 million targeted in his \nbudget request for FY 2003. The NNI has been a key driver of \nnanotechnology in this country by bringing coherence and organization \nto what had previously been a scattered set of research programs within \nthe federal government. It has, in no small part through the efforts of \nits spokespersons. Dr. Mike Roco and Dr. Jim Murday, achieved a higher \nprofile for nanotechnology both within and outside the government, and \ngathered national attention to the importance of this field.\n  The time is now ripe to elevate the U.S. nanotechnology efforts \nbeyond the level of an Executive initiative. Funding for nanotechnology \nwill soon reach $1 billion a year, and the NNI currently attempts to \ncoordinate programs across a wide range of Federal agencies and \ndepartments. This level of funding and the coordination challenges that \narise with so many diverse participants strongly recommend having a \nprogram based in statute, provided with greater support and \ncoordination mechanisms, afforded a higher profile, and subjected to \nconstructive Congressional oversight and support.\n  Our bill closely tracks the recommendations of the National Research \nCouncil, NRC, which completed a thorough review of the NNI this past \nJune. The NRC report stated how impressed the reviewers were with the \nleadership and multi-agency involvement of the NNI. Specifically, it \ncommended the Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology, NSET, \nsubcommittee, which is the primary coordinating mechanisms of the NNI, \nas playing a key role in establishing research priorities, identifying \nGrand Challenges, and involving the U.S. scientific community in the \nNNI. To improve the NNI above its current level of success, the NRC \nmade a number of recommendations. These recommendations have largely \nbeen incorporated into our bill, including establishing an independent \nadvisory panel; emphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between \nlong-term and short-term research; supporting the development of \nresearch facilities, equipment, and instrumentation; creating special \nfunding to support research that falls in the breach between agency \nmissions and programs; promoting interdisciplinary research and \nresearch groups; facilitating technology transition and outreach to \nindustry; conducting studies on the societal implications of \nnanotechnology, including those related to ethical, educational, legal, \nand workforce issues; and the development of metrics for measuring \nprogress toward program goals. This legislation will also complement \nthe provision that I authored in this year's Senate defense \nauthorization bill, S. 2514, establishing a nanotechnology research and \ndevelopment program in the Department of Defense. If this provision is \nsupported in conference, we will have matching pieces of legislation \nthat will encompass and coordinate both civilian and defense \nnanotechnology programs, establishing a truly nationwide effort\n\n[[Page S8684]]\n\nthat leverages the expertise residing in every corner of our \ngovernment.\n  If history teaches us anything, it is that once the wheels of \ninnovation have stopped and stagnation has set in, mediocrity will soon \nfollow. Nowhere in the world are those wheels of innovation spinning \nmore rapidly than in the area of nanotechnology. This legislation \nprovides a strong foundation and comprehensive framework that elicits \ncontributions from all three sectors of our society in pushing \nnanotechnology research and development to the next level.

Res. 139\n\n       Whereas in 2000, the Surgeon General announced a goal of \n     eliminating, by 2010, health disparities experienced by \n     racial and ethnic minorities in health access and outcome in \n     6 areas: infant mortality, cancer screening, cardiovascular \n     disease, diabetes, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and \n     human immunodeficiency virus infection, and immunizations;\n       Whereas despite notable progress in the overall health of \n     the Nation there are continuing health disparities in the \n     burden of illness and death experienced by African-Americans, \n     Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Asians, and \n     Pacific Islanders, compared to the population of the United \n     States as a whole;\n       Whereas minorities are more likely to die from cancer, \n     cardiovascular disease, stroke, chemical dependency, \n     diabetes, infant mortality, violence, and, in recent years, \n     acquired immunodeficiency syndrome than nonminorities \n     suffering from those same illnesses;\n       Whereas there is a national need for scientists in the \n     fields of biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and health \n     services research to focus on how best to eliminate health \n     disparities between minorities and the population of the \n     United States as a whole;\n       Whereas the diverse health needs of minorities are more \n     effectively addressed when there are minorities in the health \n     care workforce; and\n       Whereas behavioral and social sciences research has \n     increased awareness and understanding of factors associated \n     with health care utilization and access, patient attitudes \n     toward health services, and behaviors that affect health and \n     illness, and these factors have the potential to be modified \n     to help close the health disparities gap that effects \n     minority populations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a National Minority Health and Health Disparities Month \n     should be established to promote educational efforts on the \n     health problems currently facing minorities and other \n     populations experiencing health disparities;\n       (2) the Secretary of Health and Human Services should, as \n     authorized by the Minority Health and Health Disparities \n     Research and Education Act of 2000, present public service \n     announcements on health promotion and disease prevention that \n     target minorities and other populations experiencing health \n     disparities in the United States and educate the public and \n     health care professionals about health disparities;\n       (3) the President should issue a proclamation recognizing \n     the immediate need to reduce health disparities in the United \n     States and encouraging all health organizations and Americans \n     to conduct appropriate programs and activities to promote \n     healthfulness in minority and other communities experiencing \n     health disparities;\n       (4) Federal, State, and local governments should work in \n     concert with the private and nonprofit sector to recruit and \n     retain qualified individuals from racial, ethnic, and gender \n     groups that are currently underrepresented in health care \n     professions;\n       (5) the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality should \n     continue to collect and report data on health care access and \n     utilization on patients by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic \n     status, and where possible, primary language, as authorized \n     by the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and \n     Education Act of 2000, to monitor the Nation's progress \n     toward the elimination of health care disparities; and\n       (6) the information gained from research about factors \n     associated with health care utilization and access, patient \n     attitudes toward health services, and risk and protective \n     behaviors that affect health and illness, should be \n     disseminated to all health care professionals so that they \n     may better communicate with all patients, regardless of race \n     or ethnicity, without bias or prejudice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/17/senate-section/article/S8684-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8684-S8685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4537.
