All time will run out on the trade bill \nat around 6 o'clock this evening.\n  I indicate to all Senators, we now have a finite list of amendments \nthat will be voted on if the Senators want votes on those amendments. \nIt is about nine amendments, as I recall. We are going to try to work \nout a timely order to handle those. If we do not, then, no matter what \nhappens, we finish at 6 o'clock anyway, and there will be a final vote \non this bill, unless something untoward occurs. So there is still a lot \nof work to do.\n  The leader has indicated not only does he want to complete work on \nthis trade bill, but there is bioterrorism legislation. The House did \nnot move the supplemental yesterday. They quit at about 10 o'clock last \nnight without having brought up a single amendment. So they are going \nto work their way through that today.\n  The order that has been entered in the House does not allow many \namendments, so they can probably move the bill fairly quickly, as I \nunderstand it. Whether it will get here in time for us to do anything \nis something we just have to wait and see. Senator Byrd also would like \nto finish that before we leave.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4742-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4742]]\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to address another issue. Today \nwe are going to be completing our work on the trade adjustment \nassistance legislation, the trade promotion authority bill, as well as \nthe Andean Trade Preference Act. My expectation is we will finish that \nwork by sometime midafternoon.\n  It was then my intention to bring up the Senate version of the \nappropriations supplemental that has just been reported out of the \nAppropriations Committee. I have had a number of conversations with \nSenator Byrd about the need to address this matter expeditiously.\n  The bill includes $14 billion for defense, as we continue to wage our \nwar on terror; there is $1.8 billion in contingency defense funds that \nare directly connected with our efforts at homeland defense; an \nadditional $8.3 billion, substantially more than what the House has \ncommitted for other needs in homeland defense; plus $5.5 billion for \nthe recovery efforts in New York.\n  This is a very important bill. It was our hope, our expectation that \nwe would be able to complete our work on this bill prior to the time we \nrecess.\n  I am told now that our Republican colleagues are going to object to \nmoving that bill. I find that especially disconcerting given the \ncomments made a couple of weeks ago by the House majority leader, who \ncriticized me and Senator Byrd for the inaction in what he called the \nDemocratic-controlled Senate in its unwillingness to take up what he \ntermed to be the war supplemental prior to the Memorial Day break. He \nsaid he is discouraged; that, in his view, this should not be an \nacceptable state of affairs.\n  The package he indicated included some critical matters relating to \nour efforts in carrying out the war on terror and responding to the \nneeds of New York. He said he not only was not optimistic, but he said \nthere was a dearth of leadership in the Senate. If there is a dearth of \nleadership, perhaps we can see some leadership shown on both sides in \naddressing that dearth.\n  I am prepared to offer a unanimous consent request today to take up a \nbill and complete it before we leave. I do not see any reason why we \ncannot do it. It passed unanimously out of the committee. There is no \nquestion we send exactly the wrong message if our Republican colleagues \nobject to taking up this bill. There is a very disconcerting message \nthat sends to New York, to those who are concerned about homeland \ndefense, especially with the new warnings that are emanating from the \nDepartments of Government, as well as from our effort in the war in \nAfghanistan.\n  On April 22, President Bush said:\n\n       I ask the Congress to pass the supplemental that we have \n     submitted as quickly as possible. It's emergency funding for \n     defense and homeland security and economic security, and we \n     need to get it done by Memorial Day. It's time the Congress \n     passed the supplemental.\n\n  Those are words from the President himself. I hope he will pick up \nthe phone from wherever he is in Europe and call the leadership and \ntell those who are blocking this legislation that he wants it done just \nas badly today as when he articulated his views on this issue a few \nweeks ago.\n  There is no reason we cannot take it up. There is no reason we have \nto delay until after we get back. There is no reason we cannot make the \nmost of this week. We can get this done. If it can pass out of the \ncommittee unanimously, it can pass on the floor overwhelmingly. We need \nto address it.\n  Madam President, I put my colleagues on notice that we will have a \ndiscussion about this later in the day. I was not made aware of the \nopposition on the part of our Republican colleagues until this morning, \nbut I will say we will press to complete our work.\n  We will try to respond to the request of the President of the United \nStates that we get it done before Memorial Day. We will address the \ncriticism of the House majority leader who complains of a dearth of \nleadership. Let's show leadership on both sides of the aisle. Let's \nshow a commitment to the people of New York, to the people in \nAfghanistan, to our effort at addressing the needs of homeland defense \nmore effectively than we would be were we to say: No, we will wait; no, \nsomehow, it is not that important; no, we want to go home before we get \nthis job done.\n  There is no reason to go home until we have gotten this job done, and \nwe are going to press it all day long if we need to, to see if that is \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4742-5", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4742-S4744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, again I thank my colleague from \nMichigan. As all of my colleagues know, this is an issue on which she \nmade a commitment to her people before she got elected. She reminds me \nevery day of that commitment and her absolute determination to address \nthis issue soon.\n  I was in Maine a couple of days ago and was reminded again of what an \nemotional issue it is for seniors who have no other recourse but to go \nto Canada to get help, who pay bills and have to decide whether it is \ndrugs or groceries, drugs or rent, drugs or car payments, drugs or \nfuel.\n  That kind of a decision in this day and age for people vulnerable as \nthey are economically and in so many other ways is a matter that simply \ncannot rest until we have addressed it.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for her willingness to keep coming \nto the floor and reminding us of how important it is to keep organizing \nand effectively pressing for action in the Senate.\n  I know she wishes to make her statement at this time, and so I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank our Senate majority leader. If we did not have \nhis leadership, we would not have the opportunity to be talking about \nspecific proposals for a comprehensive Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit or opening the doors to Canada or in other ways lowering prices \nfor families, seniors, businesses, workers. The entire economy is \naffected by this issue, and we would not be in a position to do that \nwithout the leadership of Senator Daschle.\n  I thank him for that and also say that this week, as we are \ncelebrating the leadership of another colleague, it would not be \npossible without Senator Jim Jeffords. I commend him. As our majority \nleader talked about going to Canada, Senator Jeffords has been at the \nforefront of breaking down those barriers so we could open the border.\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\n  I find it ironic we are debating an open trade bill, fast track, so \nwe can have more trade and yet the only thing we cannot trade with \nCanada is prescription drugs made in the United States and subsidized \nby American taxpayers. Yet if they go to Canada and the prices are \ndropped in half, we cannot benefit from that.\n  Senator Jim Jeffords has been a leader. I am very proud to be joining \nwith him on a bill with Senator Dorgan and many others. I once again \ncommend Senator Jeffords for his courage in so many ways in stepping \nforward on matters that directly affect people every day. It is no less \ntrue on this question of prescription drugs.\n  It is true, as our Senate majority leader said, people are choosing \nevery day between food and medicine, paying the light bill, and being \nable to pay the rent. I have been inviting people from Michigan to come \nto my Web site and be a part of something we are calling the \nPrescription Drug People's Lobby. People have said to me, Why do you \ncall it that? Well, it is very simple. We looked up the numbers, and \ntoday there are six drug company lobbyists for every one Member of the \nSenate. Their voice is heard, and they spend every day doing everything \nto, unfortunately, stop us from lowering prices. They do wonderful \nwork. We celebrate American-made ingenuity that creates these new drugs \nfrom which we can benefit, but if they are not affordable, then they \nare not available. It is as simple as that.\n\n  We have to address the question of prices and updating Medicare to \ncover prescription drugs. So I have formed something called the \nPrescription Drug People's Lobby in Michigan. I have colleagues doing \nthe same. I know Senator Jean Carnahan is doing this. Senator Durbin \nand others are joining in this whole effort to invite people to share \ntheir stories to make their voices heard.\n  I am very pleased today to share one of those stories from Mrs. \nMalissa Askin. I share a story that reflects exactly what our \nDemocratic leader, our majority leader, was indicating. Mrs. Malissa \nAskin, from Romulus, MI, e-mailed me 2 days ago and asked that I share \nher story. I appreciate that she is allowing me to do this. She starts \nout by saying:\n\n       I guess my story is no different from the many Americans, \n     when it comes to deciding if I can afford food to live, or \n     medications. It boils down to a choice these days (what can I \n     afford to keep myself alive?), once I pay my bills.\n\n  Then she goes on to say:\n\n       I am 68 years old. My husband is deceased and I have no \n     family. I have had a heart bypass, both arteries in my neck \n     cleaned out and now in April I was operated on for cancer, \n     not to mention other surgeries. I am supposed to be on nine \n     medications. However, at the price of these meds, I can only \n     afford three. I do not know what will happen with me by not \n     being able to be on the meds I cannot afford, but it makes me \n     wonder what I am living for. I feel like nobody cares.\n\n  Well, Mrs. Askin, people do care. We care. I care. Our Senate \nmajority leader cares.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator for her poignant story and for again \nreminding us of the human face behind this issue. Those faces come so \neffectively to mind when one reads the words and listens to the \nextraordinarily difficult, agonizing decisions these older Americans \nhave to make as they make their choices, as the Senator has indicated.\n  Has the Senator ever thought of the irony we find in our country \ntoday where those people most vulnerable, those people who need \nprescription drugs the most, are the very ones who have no access to \nprescription drugs through the health plan to which they subscribe?\n  Those of us who are younger, those of us who have private health \nplans today, have plans to which we can subscribe that have all kinds \nof prescription drug coverage available to us. I can go to a drugstore \nand have many of my drugs paid for, if I would ever find the need, but \nmy mother cannot. She is part of Medicare. My relatives and my \nconstituents cannot if they are in Medicare because they are in a \nprogram that has never adopted a prescription drug benefit program, in \nspite of the need that has been clearly demonstrated given the trends \nin health care delivery out of hospitals and into the more outpatient \ntreatment care that is provided today.\n  I know the Senator from Michigan hears the same stories----\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. About the ironic state of circumstances we face. I \nwonder if she could comment on that.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I could not agree more. In 1965, we set up the promise \nof health care for those over age 65 and those who are disabled through \nMedicare, a wonderful American success story. Yet because it has not \nbeen updated to cover prescriptions, it no longer covers the way health \ncare is provided today.\n  My mother as well, my aunt, my uncle, my other relatives who have had \nhealth care coverage when working, now find themselves in a situation \nwhere they cannot really get what they need because most of what they \nneed is outpatient prescription drug coverage. I know that is why we \nare working so hard in the Senate to bring the sense of urgency that \nMrs. Askin feels to pass a comprehensive prescription drug benefit, not \none like, unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side in the House \nhave been proposing, which for most people would give less than 20 \npercent coverage and cut our hospitals and create more costs for home \nhealth care in the process. That plan is not good enough.\n  What we are talking about is something that would allow us to provide \ncomprehensive prescription drug coverage without adding costs for home \nhealth or cutting our hospitals that have already been cut but looking \nat something comprehensively.\n  When we look at Mrs. Askin, the bottom line for her is if she were to \ndo what she needs to do to remain healthy, it would be a monthly bill \nof $938. How can someone do that? How can someone do that and live?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Michigan points out another irony. We \noften hear about people voting with their feet. We hear it in another \ncontext generally. A lot of times immigrants vote with their feet as \nthey leave their countries to come to a safer place, a place with a \nbetter future. I find it ironic--and I am interested in the comments of \nthe Senator from Michigan--that our seniors today appear to be voting \nwith their feet in driving in large buses and caravans to Canada to get \nhealth care today. What does that say about the American health care \nsystem? What does that say about Medicare? What does that say about \ntheir own satisfaction with a system that appears to be so broken, so \nincapable of providing them the care they need, they have to go to \nanother country to get it in order to afford it?\n  That, too, is voting with one's feet. I find that whether it is in \nletters to the Senator, or letters to any of us, or in the expressions \nof dismay, the current circumstances they face, more and more of our \nseniors are voting with their feet, going to Canada, to another health \ncare system, to get what they cannot get here.\n\n  Could the Senator from Michigan comment on that?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would be happy to comment on that situation.\n  From Michigan, it is a simple 5-minute drive across the bridge from \nthe tunnel from Detroit to Canada; or from Port Huron, or Sault Sainte \nMarie, a simple 5-minute drive to Canada. We have worked together, on a \nnumber of occasions, with the Canadian Medical Society and pharmacists \nin Canada.\n  I find it most outrageous that these are American made drugs, the \nexact same drugs. We took a group of breast cancer patients using \ntamoxifen, at $136 a month in Michigan, 5 minutes across the border for \nthe same drug sold for $15. I am told the companies make a modest \nprofit on the $15.\n  There is something wrong, something desperately wrong. I support \nunderwriting basic research. I support the ability to create patents so \ncompanies do not have to have competition for their name brands for 15 \nor 20 years, so they can recover their costs and all the other things \nwe do to help create these wonderful lifesaving drugs. What do we get \nfor it? The highest prices in the world. It is simply not good enough.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Again, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan. One day, hopefully in this session of Congress, you and I and \nall of our\n\n[[Page S4744]]\n\ncolleagues will be on the floor voting on a bill that will rectify that \nsituation. We should not have to wait through another election. We \nshould not have to wait for any other development. We know the facts. \nWe know the people are going to Canada. We know the people are making \nthese tough choices. We know heartfelt letters such as these are \nwritten, pleading for the Congress to respond. The only thing we do not \nknow is how long it will take for the Congress to do what it needs to \ndo; that is, to respond effectively with a comprehensive approach to \nuniversal access to good prescription drug coverage with cost \ncontainment as part of that coverage. That will happen someday as a \nresult of the leadership shown and the extraordinary persistence of the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  I thank the Senator again for that effort.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am deeply grateful for the comments of the Senate \nmajority leader. His leadership, truly, on so many issues, particularly \nthis issue, touches the lives of so many people every day. I am very \ngrateful to the majority leader for that leadership.\n  We are focusing on bringing bills to the floor so we can solve the \nproblems addressing what Mrs. Askin from Romulus, MI, has written \nabout. We cannot say: We will wait another year: Mrs. Askin, why don't \nyou wait on medications that you need, wait until next year or the year \nafter or the year after?\n  This is not like buying a new car or a new pair of tennis shoes or \nare you going to wait on buying a piece of clothing. This is lifesaving \nmedicine. There has to be a sense of urgency.\n  Health care has changed. Most of the time we are not admitted into \nthe hospital. Thankfully, medication will allow people to avoid open-\nheart surgery or allow them to live with dignity at home or allow \nparents to care for children who are chronically ill or disabled, that \nallow them to live longer. We welcome these new innovations. It is \nwonderful.\n  I am proud that in this country we are in a partnership with \ninvestments from all taxpayers to the National Institutes of Health, \nutilizing the American ingenuity of the companies that go to work. It \nis wonderful.\n\n  Unfortunately, the end result is not wonderful. At the end of this \nprocess, the very people who help invest in the process cannot afford \nthese lifesaving medications. Something is wrong. When we get to the \nend of the process and the health care system we have set up for older \nAmericans who use the majority of medications, or those who are \ndisabled who use the majority of medications, does not recognize these \nnew lifesaving drugs incorporated in part of the health care system \ncalled Medicare, there is something wrong.\n  When we are creating these medications and they are sold to every \nother country in the world at half the price they are sold to us, there \nis something wrong.\n  When we see today these lifesaving medications are treated like any \nother product and twice as much or 2\\1/2\\ times more is spent on \nadvertising than the research, and we, as taxpayers, pay for that \nthrough tax writeoffs, something is wrong. More was spent on Vioxx last \nyear for advertisement than spent by Budweiser on beer, Coca-Cola on \nCoke, Pepsi-Cola on Pepsi. There is something wrong. It is fine to \nadvertise and promote, but when the companies drive the prices beyond \nour ability to be able to afford the medications, when this advertising \nand promotion and sales going on in doctors' offices all over the \ncountry each day create a situation where a small business has to drop \ntheir insurance for their employees because they cannot afford the \npremium, it has gone too far.\n  When manufacturers have to stop providing health care for retirees or \nlay off people because of rising health care costs, most of which is \nthe cost of their prescription drugs, it has gone too far. I could go \non and on with examples of what has been happening.\n  Right now one of the largest costs, one of the costs driving every \npart of our economy, is the explosion in the pricing of prescription \ndrugs. We can do better than that. We can open the border to \ncompetition for Canada. We can limit the amount we are willing to \nsubsidize in those explosive advertising costs. We can support States \nin innovative ways. They are looking for ways to bring down prices for \ntheir own citizens such as in the State of Maine and the innovations \nthey have incorporated, making sure when patents run out and it is time \nfor the generic, the same formula can be sold without the brand name at \npennies on a dollar. Those generic laws work, and we are, in fact, \ndoing that. We have a plan that works. It is now time to put it into \naction.\n  In closing, I say to Mrs. Askin that people do care. We are working \nvery hard to get it right. We are working hard so citizens will not \nhave to decide every morning what bill to pay, what food they can \nafford, or whether or not they can afford their medicine. It is time to \nget it right. I will work very hard until we get it right so you can \nknow that you can benefit from the wonderful new medications that have \nbeen placed on the market to save lives, to extend life, so you can \nalso enjoy all the other wonderful parts of your life without worrying \nabout whether you can afford your medicine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4744-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am indebted to the leadership for, \nlast evening, late in the hour, having called up my amendment in the \nsecond degree, I think, to the Byrd amendment.\n  What is the pending question before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. It is his second-\ndegree amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Madam President, I am still smiling because I was coming onto the \nelevator with some books, and the elevator operator said: My Lord, are \nyou going to preach?\n  I wish I had the talent to preach on this particular score because \nthe real problem confronting our country is economic strength. There is \nno question in my mind that fast track is about the worst thing that we \ncould possibly adopt. I have yet had the time to really get into a \ndebate. I would not preach, but I would be delighted to get into a \ndebate with respect to, actually, the need for a competitive trade \npolicy, for the rebuilding of our economic strength, and the rebuilding \nof our manufacturing capacity.\n  Somehow or other we have lost sight of the greatness of America. We \nthink it is the 6th Fleet and the atom bomb. They do not count anymore \nin the halls of international and global relations and foreign \ndiplomacy. What counts now is economic strength, that is the real \nbattle and war we are in.\n  They say: You are going to start a war. We have been in a very \nviable, competitive, reciprocal free trade, competitive free trade of \nwhich Cordell Hull spoke.\n  What comes to mind, I was at a conference up in Chicago some years \nago with Akio Morita, the chairman of the board of Sony. He was \nspeaking about the Third World, the emerging nations. This is some \nyears back. He was counseling the Third World countries that they had \nto develop a strong manufacturing sector in order to become a nation-\nstate. He was talking along, and then he pointed at me, and then he \nsaid:\n\n       By the way, Senator, the world power that loses its \n     manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power.\n\n  That is what is on my mind this morning. It is not just manufacturing \nbut, of course, our financial dilemma. There is no question in my mind \nthat we have developed, not a tax-and-spend, but a borrow-and-spend \nsociety.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the debt to the penny be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          THE DEBT TO THE

S4746]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, they have talked about surpluses, \nsurpluses, surpluses. You will find in Time magazine this week, up on \nthe right-hand side--I don't have my copy--where the deficit for 2001 \nwas in excess of $500 billion. Let me repeat that. Look in Time \nmagazine. We were talking about surpluses when we were cutting taxes \nlast year. Time magazine alone reported, rather than a surplus we were \nrunning these horrendous deficits.\n  Of course, the fiscal year has just begun. We have yet to distribute \na lot of the emergency money. For example, I have been trying like the \ndickens to get the rail security money to start working on the tunnels \ngoing into New York. The money has been appropriated and voted during \nthe emergency, but we are not really serious. We are not really serious \nabout the so-called terrorism war. Here we are already running a $212 \nbillion deficit and the increase to the debt already this fiscal year \nwas right at almost $100 billion spent from Social Security trust \nfunds. They are talking about how we could get into it, but this record \nthat I am introducing is very significant because of what I pointed \nout.\n  Let me have printed in the Record an article by Paul Krugman, ``The \nGreat Evasion; Where Have All The Taxes Gone?'' I ask unanimous consent \nit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the NY Times, May 14, 2002]\n\n                           The Great Evasion\n\n\n                     where have all the taxes gone?\n\n                           (By Paul Krugman)\n\n       Last week Stanley Works, a Connecticut tool company, \n     postponed its plan to evade taxes by incorporating itself in \n     Bermuda. The decision reflected pressure from the White \n     House, which denounced the move as unpatriotic in a time of \n     national emergency.\n       I am, of course, making that last part up. The \n     shareholders' vote approving Stanley's move was challenged by \n     Connecticut officials; also, the company has been put in the \n     spotlight by David Cay Johnson, The New York Times's \n     invaluable tax reporter. But the Bush administration, always \n     quick to question the patriotism of anyone who gets in its \n     way, has said nothing at all about Stanley Works, and little \n     about the growing number of U.S. corporations declaring \n     themselves foreign for tax purposes.\n       To be fair, the administration didn't create the loophole \n     Stanley wants to exploit. And it's not enough just to \n     denounce corporations that exploit tax loopholes; the real \n     answer is to deny them the opportunity. Still, the \n     administration's silence is peculiar. What's going on?\n       The closest we have to an official statement on the issue \n     of companies moving offshore comes from the Treasury \n     Department's chief of tax enforcement: ``We may need to \n     rethink some of our international tax rules that were written \n     30 years ago when our economy was very different and that now \n     may be impeding the ability of U.S. companies to compete \n     internationally.''\n       Unfortunately, that statement misrepresents the issue. For \n     one thing, U.S. companies don't necessarily pay higher taxes \n     than their foreign counterparts; Germany's corporate tax rate \n     is significantly higher than ours, France's rate is about the \n     same, and Britian's is only marginally lower. Anyway, the \n     Treasury statement makes it sound as if we're losing revenue \n     because U.S.-based companies are moving their headquarters to \n     lower-cost locations, or because they are losing market share \n     to foreign rivals. Neither proposition is true. In fact, \n     we're losing revenue because profitable U.S. companies are \n     using fancy footwork to avoid paying taxes.\n       By incorporating itself in Bermuda, a U.S.-based \n     corporation can--without moving its headquarters or anything \n     else--shelter its overseas profits from taxation. Better yet, \n     the company can then establish ``legal residence'' in a low-\n     tax jurisdiction like Barbados, and arrange things so that \n     its U.S. operations are mysteriously unprofitable, while the \n     mail drop in Barbados earns money hand over fist. In other \n     words, this isn't about competition; it's about tax evasion.\n       The natural answer would seem to be to crack down on the \n     evaders--to find a way to tax companies on the profits they \n     really earn in the U.S. and prevent them from using creative \n     accounting to make the profits appear somewhere else. It's \n     hard, but not impossible.\n       But here's the key point: Administration officials don't \n     want to help collect the corporate profits tax. Unable to \n     push major corporate tax breaks through Congress, the \n     administration has used whatever leeway it has to offer such \n     breaks without legislation. The Hill, a nonpartisan \n     publication covering Congressional affairs, recently reported \n     on ``a series of little-noticed executive \n     orders .  .  . that will provide corporations with billions \n     of dollars in tax relief without the consent of Congress.''\n       And now the silence on Stanley becomes comprehensible. The \n     administration doesn't want to say outright that it's in \n     favor of tax evasion; but it also doesn't really want to \n     collect the taxes. Better to say nothing at all.\n       The trouble is that hinting, even by silence, that it's \n     O.K. not to pay taxes is a dangerous game, because it can \n     quickly grow into a major revenue loss. Accountants and tax \n     planners have taken the hint; they now believe that it's safe \n     to push the envelope, Tax receipts this year are falling far \n     short of expectations, even taking the recession into \n     account; my bet is that it will turn out that newly \n     aggressive tax avoidance by corporations (and wealthy \n     individuals) is an important part of the story. And it will \n     get worse next year.\n       Furthermore, what does it say to the nation when companies \n     that are proud to stay American are punished, while companies \n     that are willing to fly a flag of convenience are rewarded?\n       If the administration wants to eliminate the corporate \n     profit tax, let's have a real, open debate--starting with an \n     explanation of how the lost revenue will be replaced in a \n     time of severe budget deficits. Meanwhile, let's crack down \n     on tax evasion.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, you can read there and see where they \nhave not only cut $1.6 trillion from the revenues and wonder where the \ndeficits come from, but they are insisting at this particular time to \nmake permanent certain tax cuts, an additional $4 trillion. Of all \nthings, our Commander in Chief, the President, says: And by the way, \nsince we have a war on terrorism, we are going to have to run deficits.\n  We have paid for every war that we have ever been in. I noted the \nother day, last Saturday:\n\n       Sharon's Finance Ministry has revised the budget to deal \n     with the slump and pay for the military effort, particularly \n     the month-long offensive in the West Bank that ended last \n     week. It includes raising by 1 percentage point the 17 \n     percent value-added tax, levying higher taxes on diesel fuel \n     and cigarettes and making cuts in the country's generous \n     social welfare benefits.\n\n  You don't find that back in the United States. Israel is serious \nabout its war.\n  But no. We continue with the economy. We think it is bouncing back \nbecause--why? It is not on account of production, and not on account of \ninvestment in the market today, but on account of ``Argentina, a land \nthat shopped itself to death.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Argentina, A Land That Shopped Itself To Death\n\n                          (By Matthew Parris)\n\n       I always knew there was something queer about Argentina.\n       You do not need to be psychic to pick up a sense that \n     something is wrong with a place. Scores of countries are \n     inhabited by scores of ills, but they muddle through. \n     Argentina felt wrong in a different way. Travelling there was \n     more akin to the experience of visiting a company which, \n     though trading, later turns out to have been a front for \n     quite another operation; or driving down a modern and \n     expensive-looking motorway (as I once did in Cuba) where the \n     sliproads turn out to be dead ends, the bridges across it \n     bridge nothing to nothing, and the crowds of people milling \n     inexplicably round beneath them are found to be desperate \n     hitch-hikers, there being no cars and no petrol.\n       It just didn't add up. Nor did Argentina.\n       Arriving at the frontier by bus from Bolivia some years ago \n     after a 20-hour journey over atrocious roads from La Paz, we \n     found that from the border post to the nearest town lay a \n     short stretch of tarmac along which the ten-minute taxi ride \n     cost more than the cost of the whole Bolivian bus journey. In \n     the next town, Juyuy, we paid in Argentine pesos and were \n     given change in crudely printed notes issued by the state \n     government, there being an insufficiency of funds from \n     central government in Buenos Aires,\n       This seemed like anarchy--some kind of breakdown. So how \n     come, when we reached the next town, Salta, the women were \n     wearing fur and taking toy dogs for walks on leads? I have \n     felt the same ``Huh?'' about Israel, Morocco and Saudi \n     Arabia.\n       Like Tintin's little dog, Snowy, one surveys the scene with \n     a question mark suspended above the head. The reasons for \n     puzzlement vary but the sense of disjunction is the same: a \n     circuit board with an unfinished circuit; and Escher print \n     where the perspective disappears up its own staircase; those \n     people Moral Re-Armament who invited you unaccountably to \n     lunch in the 1970s; a telephone kiosk in the desert; Mormons. \n     One observes quizzically yet unable even to frame the \n     question. Years later, when the thing implodes, one says: ``I \n     always knew there was something dodgy there; I should have \n     looked into it; I should have said something.''\n       But what? This was at a time when all the wise people said \n     Carlos Menem was doing things right, the peso had linked to \n     the dollar and the entire Spanish banking system was taking a \n     punt with Argentine economic\n\n[[Page S4747]]\n\n     prospects. To talk of the inherent madness would have \n     appeared, in itself, mad.\n       Now, at least, there is acceptance that something is wrong. \n     Let me take a stab at saying what. I think the problem with \n     Argentina is shopping.\n       There is much too much shopping in Argentina, and it has \n     been going on for a long time. Everybody in Buenos Aires \n     seems to be shopping and when they are not shopping they are \n     at yacht clubs, or with their psychoanalysts.\n       Another favourite pastime is visiting cemeteries, at the \n     most fashionable of which I was astonished to encounter \n     something more resembling a city than a place of burial. \n     Family mausoleums vied with each other for marbled splendour. \n     Some were multistoreyed, and some went down a couple of \n     floors beneath ground. One was said to have a lift. Through \n     the streets of this macabre metropolis women in mink walked \n     miniature poodles in tartan coats.\n       Where, then, was the money coming from? I saw some \n     breweries, a cement works and a Coca-Cola bottling plant, and \n     there were rumoured to be factories (on strike) in another \n     part of town. There were also a great many waiters, hotels, \n     bars, clubs, and sexily skirted shopgirls selling sickly-\n     sweet pastries and treacly cream. There were window-dressers. \n     And, everywhere, there was shopping.\n       Well, it's fairly clear--is it not--what was amiss? The \n     country was living way beyond its means. People did know \n     this, on one level at least. They knew what the figures said, \n     and they blamed the Government for not getting the figures \n     right. It was all due, they said, ``to corruption''; no doubt \n     somebody, probably the political class, was salting it away. \n     Government needed to be ``cleaned up'', people said (while \n     boasting about how cleverly they were fiddling their own \n     taxes): but in the meantime much hope was being placed by \n     some, and much disbelief by others, in whatever it was \n     President Menem was doing with the currency.\n       Those who supported pegging the peso to the dollar thought \n     this would rescue the Argentine economy; those who did not, \n     thought it would wreck the Argentine economy. On one thing, \n     however, there seemed to be wide agreement; getting the \n     currency right would be the basis for economic revival.\n       To another question, however, little attention was \n     directed. Given that currency is really just a medium of \n     exchange, what of the things--the goods and services--to be \n     exchanged? What were Argentinians making? What were they \n     doing when not shopping? How hard were they working? What \n     were they paying themselves for this work? About such \n     questions I heard less discussion and sensed a lack of focus. \n     This was very different from neighboring Chile, a humbler \n     country where the hustle and buzz of economic activity filled \n     the air.\n       Currency and corruption because the great evasions of \n     political discussion in Argentina. Currency was something \n     somebody else--a politician--had to get right before the \n     economy would work.\n       Corruption was the reason why, even after many fine minds \n     had applied themselves to Currency, the economy was still \n     refusing to work.\n       When a political leader has been spat humiliatingly out by \n     the voters we are understandably disinclined to hitch our \n     judgment to his star, but Fernando de la Rua, President for \n     two years since 1999, does seem to me to have been right. And \n     in the end, the bangers of pots and pans got him.\n       They will soon be banging their pots and pans outside the \n     house of their latest President, Eduardo Duhalde. Whatever \n     left-wing window-dressing, the 60-year-old Peronist veterans \n     brings to his appointment, the real need and only solution is \n     austerity, massive spending cuts and an end to \n     featherbedding. As a Peronist he will not find it easy to \n     lead this way. Already the pots and pans beat for fresh \n     elections and the eviction of the entire political class.\n       Listen to those pots and pans in Argentina. They are a \n     voice, and a powerful one, of democracy. The voice says ``let \n     us have our cake and eat it''. The voice has shouted down \n     government after government in that country.\n       Nor do you need to remind me that Argentina has only \n     fitfully enjoyed elected government. It is a great fallacy of \n     post-1945 political science to equate democracy with elected \n     government. Democracy is the crowd,the majority, the mob; the \n     crowd may get its way by electing a government or by \n     sustaining a dictator. Some of history's most notorious \n     populists have been dictators and generals; for most \n     dictators, if they are to survive, must be or became \n     demagogues.\n       A dictator--as was Juan Peron--is in some senses more at \n     the mercy of his people than an elected government, for his \n     position is inherently precarious and his tenure, however \n     long, will always have a temporary flavour. Nobody rules for \n     ever without the love of the people, but elected governments \n     can on the whole get away with if for longer. A dictator--an \n     Amin, Mussolini, Mugabe, Hitler, Galtieri--needs to work more \n     assiduously to please the crowd, and has a greater power to \n     carry into effect the will of the people, than a prime \n     minister or elected president. When it suited him, Peron and \n     his trade unions had no difficulty in winning elections.\n       But with elections some constitutions, terms of office, \n     courts and rules of law. These, often thought of as \n     characterizing democracy, are impediments to the will of the \n     people, and intended to be. So are the International Monetary \n     Fund, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the \n     Federal Reserve Bank, the World Bank, world trade and \n     ``globalisation''. They are bulwarks against the mob.\n       And they, or a fair few of them, will now have to serve as \n     President Duhalde's allies against the Argentine electorate, \n     banging its pots and pans in the face of reality. Lemmings do \n     not always know what is good for them. Lemmings can be \n     democrats, too.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, ``Argentina, a land that shopped \nitself to death.''\n  We have gone from the socialistic United Kingdom system of tax and \nspend and to the Argentina system of borrowing, spending and shopping \nto death. There it is.\n  It is very interesting. When I talk of the financial dilemma we are \nin with a $400 billion trade deficit and we are going to run a nearly \n$400 billion fiscal deficit--I want to be here on September 30 and see \nwhere we are measuring up by September 30. We have an election in \nNovember. By October, we will have the figures. It will be nearly a \n$400 billion deficit. There isn't any question in my mind.\n  So you have the fiscal weakness--the enfeeblement, more or less--of \nthe economy on the one hand and the productivity on the other hand of \nnot making anything anymore.\n  I was very interested. That is why I brought this book to the Senate \nthis morning. The favorite book in Washington today is Theodore Rex \nabout Teddy Roosevelt. You will find the economic strength of the \ncountry on page 20.\n\n       More than half of the world's cotton, corn, copper and oil \n     flowed from the American cornucopia, and at least one-third \n     of all the world's steel, iron, silver and gold.\n\n  Can you imagine that? Here we just had to put in some restrictions on \nthe import of steel. It is not more or less trade. It is more about \nMcNamara and the World Bank. He went running around the world with the \nWorld Bank saying: Wait a minute. In order to become a nation state, \nyou have to have the weapon of agriculture and the weapons of war. You \nhave to have a 2-percent steel plant.\n  I worked with a fellow named Willy Korpf when he brought to South \nCarolina, Beaumont, TX, down in Brazil, Saudi Arabia--he was building \nthem in China a few years ago when he crashed in the Alps coming to his \nhome.\n  I dedicated his plant across the Rhine across from Strasbourg, \nFrance, and Kehl, Germany.\n  But that 2-percent plant all around the world is an overproduction of \nsteel.\n  While they argue about steel--I have it in my backyard with NuCor, \nwhich doesn't have any legacy problems. It is the most productive steel \nplant in the entire world. Yet we are importing steel at less than cost \non the dock right in front of the Customs house where I have my office \nin Charleston, SC, to furnish steel all over the Southeast from Brazil. \nThat is the kind of situation we are in.\n  After 100 years, Teddy Roosevelt--yes. Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison--\nthe Forefathers--were all protectionists. Here it is. They had it. This \nis what we have as a result of it.\n\n       More than half the world's cotton, corn, copper, and oil \n     flowed from the American cornucopia, and at least one third \n     of all steel, iron, silver, and gold. . . . The excellence of \n     her manufactured products guaranteed her dominance of world \n     markets. Current advertisements in British magazines gave the \n     impression that the typical Englishman woke to the ring of an \n     Ingersoll alarm, shaved with a Gillette razor, combed his \n     hair with Vaseline tonic, buttoned his Arrow shirt, hurried \n     downstairs for Quaker Oats, California figs, and Maxwell \n     House coffee, commuted in a Westinghouse tram (body by \n     Fisher), rose to his office in an Otis elevator, and worked \n     all day with his Waterman pen under the efficient glare of \n     Edison lightbulbs. ``It only remains,'' one Fleet Street wag \n     suggested, ``for [us] to take American coal to Newcastle.'' \n     Behind the joke lay real concern: the United States was \n     already supplying beer to Germany, pottery to Bohemia, and \n     oranges to Valencia.\n\n  We had a vote yesterday on a 50-percent tariff on importing oranges, \nand they are still bringing them in from Brazil.\n  Further:\n\n       As a result of this billowing surge in productivity, Wall \n     Street was awash with foreign capital. Carnegie calculated \n     that America could afford to buy the entire United Kingdom, \n     and settle Britain's national debt in the bargain. For the \n     first time in history,\n\n[[Page S4748]]\n\n     transatlantic money currents were thrusting more powerfully \n     westward than east. Even the Bank of England had begun to \n     borrow money on Wall Street. New York City seemed destined to \n     replace London as the world's financial center.\n\n  Wall Street is on its backside. Why? Because of the enfeeblement of \nthe economy as we think of our strength.\n  I emphasize that the security of the United States is like a three-\nlegged stool. You have the one leg for the values as a nation, you have \nthe second leg as the military strength, and your third leg as your \neconomic strength.\n  On values, we have the respect of the world for standing for \nindividual freedom and democracy. There is no question whatsoever with \nrespect to our military power. And with respect to our economic power, \nit has become fractured as a result of the conduct after World War II \nfor the last 50 years, which worked. No one complains about the \nMarshall plan and the treating of foreign trade as foreign aid.\n  But this is what has happened as a result. It has to stop.\n  Two-thirds of the clothing we wear is imported; 88.5 percent of the \nshoes on the floor in the Senate are imported; over half of electric \nmotors and portable electric hand tools; 71.8 percent of our aircraft \nengines and our gas turbines are imported; over a third of our motor \nvehicles are imported; over half of the office machines; 95.5 percent \nof consumer electronics--we hardly make those anymore--70 percent of \nthe televisions; 86.7 percent of radio and television broadcasting \nequipment; over half of the photographic cameras, 80.8 percent; 82.8 \npercent of the luggage; 70.3 percent of the bicycles; and 84.8 percent \nof the toys.\n  I hear constantly, ``high tech, high tech.'' Senator, you don't \nunderstand. We are going away from the smokestack industries and we are \ngoing high tech.\n  Look here.

Madam President, you get an idea of America going out \nof business, but more than anything else, we ought to look at \nSaturday's business section of the Washington Post.\n  In contrast to Teddy Roosevelt, and the beginning of the last \ncentury, let us define where we are today. An article is entitled \n``Buying American? Maybe Not.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 18, 2002]\n\n                       Buying American? Maybe Not\n\n\n                    Many U.S. Brands European-Owned\n\n                             (By T.R. Reid)\n\n       Let's imagine a typical American couple--we'll call them \n     Bill and Betty Yankee--using a long weekend for an all-\n     American vacation.\n       Bill, an engineer at Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., in Upstate \n     New York, and Betty, a clerk at Casual Corner, take their \n     Jeep down to the Amoco station for a fill-up, pop a Dave \n     Matthews album into the cassette player and head west. They \n     drive all day, except for a quick lunch at Burger King, and \n     stop for the night at a Holiday Inn outside Pittsburgh. In \n     their room, Bill smokes a couple of Lucky Strikes and watches \n     ``A Beautiful Mind'' on pay-per-view, while Betty curls up \n     with a bottle of Snapple and the new Philip Roth novel she \n     just received from the Literary Guild.\n       The next day, they get some cash at a Mellon Bank ATM, fill \n     the tank at a Shell station and drive all the way to Chicago. \n     There they meet their daughter Barb, a copywriter at the Leo \n     Burnett advertising agency, who proudly shows her parents the \n     ad she has written for Taster's Choice coffee. Barb's \n     husband, Bob, a reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times, is \n     delighted with the Brooks Brothers necktie his in-laws \n     brought him.\n       It all sounds thoroughly American. However, just about \n     every product and service that the Yankee family bought or \n     used on this trip came from European-owned companies.\n       The family Jeep is made by Germany's DaimlerChrysler. The \n     Amoco station belongs to the British oil company BP and the \n     Shell station to Royal Dutch Shell, an Anglo-Dutch \n     combination.\n       Burger King is owned by Britain's beverage giant Diageo, \n     Holiday Inn by the big British hotel firm Six Continents. \n     Mellon Bank is a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland. \n     The Oscar-winning movie ``A Beautiful Mind'' was released by \n     Universal Studios, a subsidiary of the French media colossus \n     Vivendi Universal, which is also a major operator of pay-per-\n     view television in the United States. Philip Roth's \n     publisher, Houghton Mifflin, is another Vivendi subsidiary. \n     The Literary Guild is part of the global empire of the German \n     publishing giant Bertelsmann. Lucky Strikes are made by \n     London-based British American Tobacco. Snapple is owned by \n     Britain's Cadbury Schweppes. Taster's Choice coffee belongs \n     to Nestle SA of Switzerland.\n       It's fitting, in a way, that the Yankee family is \n     constantly buying from European companies, because all four \n     of the Yankees--like millions of other Americans today--are \n     employed by European-owned firms. Niagara Mohawk is one of \n     several American power utilities owned by Britain's National \n     Grid. Both Brooks Brothers and the 1,000-store Casual Corner \n     chain are part of an Italian conglomerate, Retail Brand \n     Alliance. The Leo Burnett agency belongs to a French group, \n     Publicis. Even a product as localized as the Chicago Sun-\n     Times is owned by a company that is owned by the London media \n     magnate Conrad Black.\n       ``We live in a globalized world, and the products Americans \n     use now can be owned by companies almost everywhere,'' notes \n     John Palmer, a director of the European Policy Centre, a \n     Brussels-based think tank. ``Since we've seen the rise of \n     some very powerful European multinationals in the recent \n     past, it's only natural that these companies would extend \n     their reach to the U.S.''\n       The seemingly endless web of European connections woven \n     through corporate America today reflects a surge of \n     investment from Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, \n     Italy, Ireland, Scandinavia and other parts of Western Europe \n     over the past decade. The long U.S. economic boom of the '90s \n     drew hundreds of billions of dollars from European investors \n     into American companies, according to the European-American \n     Business Council, an advocacy group based in Washington. \n     Europe is by far the top source of foreign direct investment \n     in the United States.\n       European investors say the flow of money across the \n     Atlantic is a tribute to the strength and the promise of the \n     U.S. economy.\n       ``Why invest in the U.S.A.? It's simple,'' says Sir Ian \n     Prosser, chairman of Six Continents PLC, the hotel firm with \n     headquarters in London. ``It's a great economy, and it \n     produces great returns. Beyond that, the U.S. is so \n     competitive that we know the things we learn operating there \n     will help us in all our other markets around the world.''\n       Money flows the other way, too. Through names like \n     McDonald's, Starbucks or the Gap, U.S. investment is evident \n     in virtually every European city. But similarly, the American \n     presence is not restricted to American labels. Such famous \n     European car brands as Volvo, Jaguar, Aston Martin and Land \n     Rover are all owned by Ford Motor Co.\n       Even so, the United States is a net gainer, by hundreds of \n     billions of dollars, from the back-and- forth investment. In \n     2000, according to Commerce Department figures, U.S. direct \n     investment in Europe reached $650 billion; European \n     investment in the United States was almost $900 billion. In \n     economic terms, the big U.S. surplus in direct investment \n     helps pay for the big U.S. deficit in international trade.\n       The European-American Business Council says that Europeans \n     are the top foreign investors in 44 states, with Texas and \n     California receiving the most funds. In Maryland, 60 percent, \n     or $6.8 billion, of foreign investment money has come from \n     Europe. Virginia has $14.7 billion in European investments, \n     representing 68 percent of total foreign investment.\n       Some 3.9 million Americans work directly for European-owned \n     companies, the council says.\n       The result of this transatlantic tidal wave of investment \n     is that many of the products that seem most familiar to \n     American consumers now come from European companies.\n       Even the word ``America'' in the brand name doesn't imply \n     American ownership anymore. The American Heritage Dictionary \n     is another Vivendi property. RCA Records, once part of the \n     Radio Corporation of America, belongs to Bertelsmann. There \n     may be\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\n     nothing more American than apple pie, but Mott's apple pie \n     filling, along with Mott's apple juice and apple sauce, are \n     British-owned.\n       Europeans have also put major amounts of money into \n     American financial companies. In addition to Mellon Bank, \n     Royal Bank of Scotland owns more than 15 other U.S. banking \n     institutions. The respected investment bank once known as \n     First Boston is now Credit Suisse First Boston, a unit of \n     Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group.\n       In Baltimore, fast-growing Allfirst Bank is a subsidiary of \n     Allied Irish Banks of Dublin, and the city's traditional \n     brokerage house, Alex. Brown, belongs to Deutsche Bank.\n       Just over a decade ago, when Japanese companies were \n     pouring large sums into U.S. businesses and real estate, the \n     investment sparked fear and anger among many Americans. There \n     was a concern that Tokyo was snatching up America's corporate \n     jewels. When Sony purchased Columbia Pictures, for example, \n     Newsweek's cover featured the Statue of Liberty dressed in a \n     kimono and the headline ``Japan Invades Hollywood.''\n       But the new wave of European investment has spawned almost \n     no adverse reaction among Americans. Perhaps Americans are \n     proud that foreign investors want to put their money into the \n     U.S. economy. Perhaps there is a growing public awareness of \n     the process of globalization, with multinational companies \n     buying and selling subsidiaries all over the world. Perhaps \n     Americans just don't know how much of their daily commerce is \n     done with European-owned firms. Or could it be that Americans \n     don't mind if blue-eyed Christians from Europe buy their \n     companies but are less comfortable when Asians do?\n       Since the U.S. government, industry and financial markets \n     all welcome the influx of funds, there's probably not much \n     relief available for any Americans who are worried about the \n     wave of European ownership. The only thing to do, really, is \n     head out to a bar and drown your worries with a classic \n     American drink like a ``seven and seven.''\n       Of course, this might not be a completely satisfying \n     response, because both parts of that familiar cocktail come \n     from British companies today: Seagram's Seven Crown belongs \n     to Diageo, and 7Up is one of the flagship brands of Cadbury \n     Schweppes.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I will not read the entire article. It \nis very interesting.\n\n       Let's imagine a typical American couple--we'll call them \n     Bill and Betty Yankee--using a long weekend for an all-\n     American vacation.\n       Bill, an engineer at Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. in Upstate \n     New York, and Betty, a clerk at Casual Corner, take their \n     Jeep down to the Amoco station for a fill-up, pop a Dave \n     Matthews album into the cassette player and head west.

I don't want to sound like Al Gore, but \nI know a little bit about global trade. I didn't invent it. But 40 \nyears ago, as a Governor, I went to both Latin America and to Europe to \nseek industry, and today we have 125 German industries in South \nCarolina. I have not had much luck recently on carpetbagging New York, \nbut I used to go up there regularly and move everything I could find up \nthere down to South Carolina. But the opportunities now are in Europe \nand out in the Pacific rim.\n  I called on Michelin exactly 40 years ago--well, 42, I guess--in late \nMay or June of 1960. We have four Michelin French plants, their North \nAmerican headquarters.\n  So don't lecture us, who have lost 53,900 textile jobs, about \nglobalization. The fact is, there is no such thing as free trade. Never \nhas been. Never will be. In the earliest days----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am going to get through my thoughts here, and then I \nwill be glad to yield. But I do not have it on the record, and I want \nto put this particular subject on the record as I see it and can \nremember it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I just want to ask unanimous consent for \nsomething.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized following Senator \nHollings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Very good. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, what happened was, in our earliest days we had just \nwon our freedom when the David Ricardo comparative advantage crowd in \nthe mother country, Britain, corresponded with Alexander Hamilton and \nsaid: Now what you ought to do is trade with us what you produce best, \nand we will trade back with you what we produce best--free trade, free \ntrade, Adam Smith, market forces, and everything else of that kind.\n  Alexander Hamilton wrote a report on manufacturers. I have a copy of \nit now. There is one original copy over in the Library of Congress. But \nin a line, he told the Brits: Bug off. We are not going to remain your \ncolony, importing all the manufactured goods and exporting to you our \nrice, our cotton, our indigo, our lumber, timber, and iron ore, and so \nforth.\n  The second bill that passed this Congress in its history--the first \nbill being for the Seal of the United States--the second bill in the \nhistory of the Congress, that passed on July 4, 1789, was \nprotectionism, a tariff bill of 50 percent on 60 articles. \nProtectionism was supported throughout the building of America during \nthe 1800s--Lincoln with steel protectionism; protectionist Roosevelt \nwith agricultural support prices, protective quotas and import quotas; \nEisenhower in the middle 1950s with oil import quotas, protectionist \nEisenhower. Those who built protected.\n  After all, that is the oath we take, to preserve and protect. We have \nthe FBI to protect us from enemies within, the Army to protect us from \nenemies without, Social Security to protect us from the ravages of old \nage, Medicare to protect us from ill health; the clean air, clean \nwater--we have safety rules and everything. The fundamental job of \nGovernment is protection.\n  Here we have the highest standard of living. All these Senators run \naround on the floor, they want the environment, they want safety, they \nwant parental leave, and they want plant closing notice. Fine. We have \nthem all on the books. But you can go down to Mexico for 58 cents an \nhour and none of that. And if your competition goes, you are going to \nhave to leave. And that is what has been happening.\n  But you have these folks on the floor of the Senate who are \ndetermined to wreck the economy. There never has been any such thing as \nfree trade, and never will be. Almost like world peace: you strive for \nit. You strive for it, and it will not happen in my lifetime or your \nlifetime.\n  More than anything else, all you have to do is just look at the books \npublished by none other than the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative--``Foreign Trade Barriers.'' This one in 1992 had 267 \npages. They are talking about, oh, the wonderful success of fast\n\n[[Page S4750]]\n\ntrack, fast track; we are going to really bring down trade barriers, \nincrease jobs.\n  This one is for 2002: ``National Trade Estimate Report of Foreign \nTrade Barriers.'' This has gone up to 458 pages. It has gone up 200 \npages. They are increasing the barriers. They are competing. Reciprocal \nfree trade, reciprocal free trade, said Cordell Hull, to compete. So \nwhat happens is, we have the competition of the countries themselves.\n  Let me explain just what all they do. They begin with import \nlicensing. We do not have that. You have a tough time getting an import \nlicense into Japan or even into China or Korea. If you want to import \ntextiles into Korea, you have to have a vote of the Korean textile \nauthority. The ones over there with whom you are competing vote you \nout. You never get in.\n  In banking, they talk about free trade, free trade. The day before \nyesterday, the Japanese lowered the yen. That is market manipulation. \nSo with a lower yen, they can increase their exports. That is not free \ntrade, free market, free market, free trade. They have inspection \npractices.\n  Let's put it this way. If you want a 2002 Toyota in France, it is on \nthe dock in Le Havre being inspected, and by January 1, 2003, you can \nget last year's model, 2002. The same with the CDs and VCRs, they put \nthem up at a place in France. They have all of these inspection \npractices. They are all tricks of the trade.\n  We just had a hearing on Enron. The lawyer had a memo there about all \nthe tricks of the trade. They have such things as different snow when \nyou go to sell ski equipment in Japan. And I have a paper company, West \nVirginia Pulp and Paper. They tried to emulate and mimic and produce \ncigarette paper. They worked on it for 2 years, got the exact duplicate \nof it and everything over there, and they still wouldn't let them bring \nthat cigarette paper in. They said it was still different.\n  What you have in essence is the fundamental practice. That is what \nhas to be emphasized as I try to explain this. We operate in the free \nmarket, capitalistic market in the United States on price and quality. \nNot so in global competition. They couldn't care less about price. They \ntry for a good price and try for quality, but it is below price, below \nthe production cost. That Lexus I have that costs $35,000 in \nCharleston, SC, costs $45,000 to $50,000 in downtown Tokyo. All of the \nprices are less than cost. Can you understand why they fought so \nvigorously the idea of doing away with our dumping laws? We can easily \nprove they are selling as loss leaders. They are selling at less than \ncost in the United States of America, but that is the name of the game.\n  As I said, the Japanese have already taken over a third of the \nautomobile market, already a majority of the semiconductor, and a \nmajority of the computer market. You can go right on down the list. \nOnce they get market share, they will run the prices up. The \ncompetition is not with respect to productivity. We are constantly \nchastising the workers of the United States. You go to the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics or the economic section of the United Nations; they \nboth agree that the most productive industrial worker in the world is \nthe U.S. industrial worker. There is no question about their producing, \nbut we are not in the competition. We are talking about quality and \nproductivity. They are talking about dumping. That is why they fought \nright here to a tie vote with respect to trying to get that amendment. \nThat is why the U.S. Trade Representative went to Doha and said: Don't \nworry about it. We will have a good conference because we are going to \nget rid of the dumping laws.\n  That is exactly what they are saying. Now they have fast track, and \nthey are ready to do it. They can get rid of the dumping laws. This is \na fix on that.\n  More than anything else, you have to understand the competition. The \ncompetition isn't with respect just to market share and countries. On \nthe contrary, we have met the enemy, and it is us. I will never forget \nmy good friend Bobby Kennedy who used to have this desk. He came into \nthe limelight in America with a book called ``The Enemy Within.'' He \nwas talking about Hoffa and organized labor.\n  I can write that same book, ``The Enemy Within,'' about management. \nIt is corporate executive America. They couldn't care less about it.\n  I hope I can get an article here by Henry Kauffman. I had the \narticle, but I don't know that I brought that over this morning because \nI didn't realize I was going to have this opportunity. He said way back \nthat people in the olden days when you owned the horse, you were \nsupposed to feed the horse while it was alive, and if the horse was \ndead, the owner was responsible to bury the horse.\n\n  That is not the case with corporate executive America today. They \njust pass through, sometimes hostile takeovers and everything else of \nthat kind. They are trying to get the stock up over a 3-year period, \ngive them a golden parachute, and move on. They don't feel the \nobligation to stay. So what happens is, they have learned on the one \nhand that they can save tremendous money in cost with respect to \nproducing offshore. Thirty percent of volume or sales is in your labor \ncost and manufacturing. And you can save as much as 20 percent of your \nsales cost by moving to an offshore low-wage country or down to Mexico.\n  If you retain your executive office and your sales force but move \nyour manufacturer offshore to a low-wage country, what you do is, if \nyou have $500 million in sales, you can make $100 million before taxes \nor you can continue to work your own people and go broke. That is the \njob policy of corporate America, adopted in fast track by the Senate. \nThat is what I am trying to bring home to those who are not thinking, \nincluding my farmer friends.\n  Yes, I listed the different industrial articles. We have a deficit in \nthe balance of trade in cotton. You can go right on down the \nagricultural commodities. Let China keep coming, and in 3 or 4 years we \nwill have a deficit in the balance of trade in wheat. We have \ncompetition in durum wheat. That is why we have one friend here from \nNorth Dakota. But there is no question in my mind that what we have is \njust that, the enemy within.\n  What do they do? They band together not to build, as we are \nresponsible to build this country in the Senate, not to create jobs, as \nour primary responsibility to keep America economically strong and \ncreate jobs and job opportunities, but theirs is to export the jobs as \nfast as they can. They band together with the Business Roundtable, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the conference board, but more \nparticularly, the Chamber of Commerce.\n  I saw that change come about with Tom Donahue when we went over \nthere. That National Chamber of Commerce couldn't care less about main \nstreet America. They have no idea of creating jobs or opportunity or \nrepresenting main street America. I could tell you now, I was in this \nbefore. I will never forget--I might as well identify myself as not \nantilabor, but certainly I am not ready to vote just labor's way. I am \nfrom a right-to-work State. I voted for that law. And more \nparticularly, when we had a debate when Russell Long was chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, I was the fellow who blocked labor law reform on \neight occasions. We had eight votes up and down on cloture. I won on \nall eight votes.\n  In years passed, I have received honors from the Chamber of Commerce. \nSo I know from whence I come and speak. We have developed more industry \nthan that Donahue. He came from a trucking outfit. They put him on a \nfew boards. He has picked up here on trial lawyers and everything else \nlike that.\n  But what we have confronting us in the Senate is not weapons of mass \ndestruction and Saddam. We have the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and \nweapons of class destruction.\n  The greatness of America is when Henry Ford said: Look, I want that \nfellow who is producing the automobile to be able to buy it. He started \nMiddle America, the industrial wage. They had benefits and health care \nand everything else of that kind. These are the jobs we are losing hand \nover fist.\n  The first thing we brought out on debate on so-called free trade--\nthey would not even admit it from the Finance Committee--is not how we \nwere going to create jobs. First, they added how are we going to take \ncare of those who lost the jobs--\"adjustment assistance,'' they call \nit. So we are not producing, and we are into a situation where you have \nlimited time.\n\n[[Page S4751]]\n\n  I understand the time will run out this afternoon around 4 o'clock. \nThey worked it into this particular situation. Yes, everybody wants to \ngo home for the Memorial Day break. They always do it. When we \nadjourned before with GATT in November, we were going home for \nThanksgiving. They always find a holiday and work it up and fix the \nvote.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this \nparticular point the article in the Washington Post, dated December 26, \n1993.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 26, 1993]\n\n The NAFTA-Math; Clinton Got His Trade Deal, But How Many Millions Did \n                          It Cost the Nation?\n\n                           (By Charles Lewis)\n\n       The orgy of deal-making that preceded the House of \n     Representatives vote on NAFTA illustrated just how little the \n     mercenary culture of Washington has changed since the arrival \n     of a Democratic administration.\n       Estimates of the total cost of the deals around NAFTA vary \n     widely. Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert who has written \n     favorably about NAFTA for the Institute for International \n     Economics, told the Associated Press that the last-minute \n     deals cost in the ``tens of millions of dollars.'' Public \n     Citizen, the consumer organization founded by Ralph Nader, \n     estimates that the deals cost at least $4.4 billion. The \n     Nation magazine, which has been critical of NAFTA and \n     ``Republicrat'' Clinton, says the total cost of the eleventh \n     hour wheeling-and-dealing might ultimately amount to $50 \n     billion.\n       Hyperbole aside, the quantifiable cost to the taxpayer of \n     the NAFTA deals will be at least $300 million. American \n     consumers will also pay higher prices on a wide variety of \n     goods because of special interest tariff agreements reached \n     during the NAFTA bazaar. Rep. Dick Zimmer (R-N.J.), who voted \n     for NAFTA, is disgusted about the ``presidential giveaways,'' \n     and he plans to introduce legislation in January to repeal \n     the various NAFTA deals, arguing that ``such sordid behavior \n     debases the legislative process.'' But good luck trying to \n     figure out what deals were made. Many of the particulars of \n     what transpired have disappeared like steam into the air. \n     Normally loquacious members of Congress are tongue-tied or \n     unavailable to comment about their NAFTA votes, while White \n     House officials dismiss the subject as sour grapes. But many \n     of the details of numerous deals have been documented and \n     confirmed. They illustrate the financial forces that shaped \n     Congress's voting and may have tipped the balance in favor of \n     the agreement.\n       The biggest single taxpayer outlay was snared by Rep. \n     Esteban Torres (D-Calif.). Concerned about NAFTA support \n     among Hispanic members of Congress, the White House wrote a \n     ``U.S.-Mexico Executive Agreement'' to create a bi-national \n     North American Development Bank. The cost will be at least \n     $250 million. Torres, a former United Auto Workers union \n     official, voted for NAFTA after receiving this expensive \n     concession.\n       Two undecided Georgia Democrats extracted $15 million from \n     the administration. The aptly named Rep. Nathan Deal and Rep. \n     George ``Buddy'' Darden decided to vote for NAFTA when \n     the White House agreed to hire 136 new customs agents just \n     for the textile and apparel industries. As Darden told the \n     Atlanta Constitution, ``I was very impressed by the White \n     House's responsiveness to the textile industry.''\n       To secure votes in the Texas delegation, the administration \n     promised to speed up the building of the Center for the Study \n     of Western Hemispheric Trade somewhere in Texas. Cost: $10 \n     million. $33 million to vegetable interests in Florida to \n     complete an agricultural research station.\n       One of the most amusing illustrations of how difficult it \n     is to arrive at the true cost of NAFTA involves Rep. Eddie \n     Bernice Johnson, a first-term Democrat from Texas. The \n     Journal of Commerce broke the story that Johnson agreed to \n     support NAFTA after an unnamed administration official \n     promised that the Pentagon would purchase two additional C-17 \n     cargo planes--at a cost of $1.4 billion--from the Vought \n     Aircraft factory in her south Dallas district. The \n     controversial military transport plane has an impressive \n     history of technical failures. Johnson claims she was \n     misquoted. Her decision to support NAFTA, she says, was based \n     on the ``broad needs'' of her constituents; the Journal of \n     Commerce reporter stands by his story.\n       That's one reason why estimates of the NAFTA price tag \n     vary: Public Citizen includes this alleged $1.4 billion deal \n     in their estimate of $4.4 billion.\n       Another reason: the ultimate costs of the special-interest \n     tariff deals before the NAFTA vote are difficult to gauge. \n     For example, a special ``snap-back'' tariff mechanism was \n     agreed to with Mexico to protect Florida citrus growers. If \n     U.S. orange juice concentrate prices fall to certain levels, \n     a tariff is imposed on Mexican oranges; American consumers \n     will be denied the benefits of lower orange juice prices.\n       Similar formal ``Executive Letter of Agreement'' tariff \n     agreements were made on sugar and syrup goods, wine and \n     brandy, flat glass, home appliances and bedding components \n     such a springs, iron rails and wooden parts, to name a few. \n     These executive letters of agreement are a form of \n     protectionism extended to certain well-connected business \n     interests. Hufbauer, the pro-NAFTA trade expert, said in a \n     recent interview that they could ``easily cost American \n     consumers hundreds of millions'' of dollars.\n       The more candid members of Congress acknowledged that their \n     votes were being bought. Florida Rep. Tom Lewis, a \n     Republican, who supported the pact after the Clinton \n     administration explicitly agreed to raise tariffs temporarily \n     on imported tomatoes from Mexico, told the New York Times, \n     ``I look with disdain on the way this whole thing has been \n     done . . . It almost looks like you're selling your soul.''\n       A week before the vote Rep. Bill Brewster (D-Okla.) was \n     undecided about NAFTA. He had two personal meetings with the \n     president and dozens of phone calls from administration \n     officials. He let it be known that he would not supporter \n     NAFTA without specific concessions for his constituents. In \n     the end, as the Washington Times reported, the White House \n     agreed to help cattle ranchers and peanut growers in his \n     district. As Brewster put it, ``I know how this place \n     operates . . . I made sure we got it in writing.''\n       Other, savvier deal-makers were explicit about not getting \n     a quid pro quo. Rep. Charlie Rose (D-N.C.) played a crucial \n     role in the House anti-NAFTA working group led by Majority \n     Whip David Bonior until literally hours before the vote. But \n     Rose had told a reporter that ``I could be persuaded by the \n     White House if they were sufficiently serious to lower the \n     tobacco tax to pass NAFTA.'' Rose was then lobbied by the \n     White House and wound up voting for NAFTA.\n       ``I didn't sell my vote,'' Rose insisted to reporters. ``I \n     just told those people: `Look, if I vote with you, I want you \n     to be as understanding as you possible can about the kinds of \n     problems agriculture has and needs to address in 1994.''\n       In other words, Rose's vote was bought on a layaway plan. \n     The ultimate cost, if any, won't be known until next year, \n     when the Clinton administration sends Congress its proposal \n     to raise taxes on cigarettes.\n       After the NAFTA vote, Bill Clinton was compared in these \n     pages and elsewhere to Lyndon Baines Johnson, for his \n     aggressive, unabashed use of political power in dealing with \n     Congress. The comparison implies that pork-barrel politics, \n     while unfortunate and unseemly, is necessary to achieve \n     success, and always has been.\n       Perhaps. But LBJ, even in his most legendary arm-twisting \n     mode, never led a domestic lobbying campaign as lopsided as \n     Clinton's NAFTA effort. Forget the testimonials elicited from \n     Nobel laureate economists, the former secretaries of state, \n     former presidents, Lee Iacocca and Bill Gates. Consider the \n     Clinton persuasion tactics in the larger context of the NAFTA \n     lobbying effort.\n       Ross Perot, labor unions and other NAFTA opponents spent \n     less than $10 million, according to the Wall Street Journal. \n     Mexican government and business interests, by contrast, \n     retained scores of lobbying, public relations and law firms \n     in Washington at the cost of $30 million. And the leading \n     pro-NAFTA lobbying group, USA*NAFTA, and individuals U.S. \n     corporations with factories in Mexico spent another $10 \n     million to promote the pact. Add to these two figures the \n     $300 million in government funds that the Clinton \n     administration committed for the sake of passing NAFTA, and \n     it seems likely that NAFTA proponents outspent their \n     opposition by a margin of more than 30-1.\n       More importantly, LBJ never promised to do things \n     differently. Clinton did. In accepting the democratic \n     presidential nomination in July 1992, he declared his \n     antipathy for special-interest wheeling and dealing in \n     Washington. ``For too long, those who play by the rules and \n     keep the faith have gotten the shaft,'' he said. ``And those \n     who cut corners and cut deals have been rewarded.''\n       Sixteen months later, when Clinton was in danger of losing \n     vote on NAFTA, those who cut deals were the ones who reaped \n     the biggest rewards. And those who kept the faith that \n     Clinton might change the way politics is done in Washington \n     were the ones who got the shaft.\n       Charles Lewis is founder and executive director of the \n     Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit research \n     organization based in Washington and funded by foundations, \n     corporations, labor unions, individuals and revenues from \n     news organizations. Margaret Ebrahim of the center provided \n     research assistance.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you can find out that they gave a \ncultural center; President Clinton gave golf games; they gave--and this \nis all for NAFTA. That particular article was dated 1993. Anyway, it \ntalks about how they fixed fast track and changed the votes on the \nHouse side. They do the same thing within the Finance Committee. You \ndon't have any debate. Without fixing the votes, they cannot get \ncloture--they impress cloture upon you, I should say. You don't get \ntime for debate.\n  So what we have now is the executives, finally, not only moving their \nmanufacturing, they are moving their executive offices to Bermuda.\n  I don't think this amendment is up, but I had one with respect to the \ntextiles. I wanted to try to compensate those who, in the last 3 \nyears--1999,\n\n[[Page S4752]]\n\n2000, 2001--have lost their jobs, some 334,000. The cost of the \namendment itself is about a billion dollars. We are trying to get them \nhealth care so they can continue and get some kind of training and \nadjustment assistance, having lost their jobs. We were told in NAFTA we \nwere going to create jobs, and we lost 53,900 jobs. But not only are we \nlosing the jobs, but they have the unmitigated gall--corporate \nAmerica--to move offshore and not pay any taxes. They want that mother \nand father of that 18-year-old we recently lost in Afghanistan--they \nwant that mama and daddy, who are working, to pay taxes. You can tell \nthis society is on a binge. The President ran adds for 3 minutes, \nsaying: Take your trips, go to Disney World, go and take a trip--and \neverything else like that. They don't want to pay for the war.\n  Now we have corporate America AWOL from the terrorism war. They are \nall going overseas, down to Grenada, and over to Bermuda and everywhere \nelse so they won't pay taxes. Never mind about leveling the playing \nfield. You could not blame the other countries that don't have this \nhigh standard of living. Any one of the countries--in China, they are \nbuilding their industrial capacity just right. Over in China, they say, \nlook, in order to sell, you have to produce that Buick car. Wait a \nminute, they say after that, you have to move your research here. The \nmost modern automobile research is in China. Of course, they have the \noutstanding engineers at a next-to-nothing cost.\n  So now--I don't have the article here--they are moving Japan's \nfuturistic research, cutting edge research, into China. So what you \nhave is the competition of 1.3 billion producers in agriculture and \nindustry, and we are hollering ``fast track, fast track,'' and we have \nto aid somebody. We have run out of gas, as I pointed out. Level the \nplaying field? You cannot do it Washington's way, Mr. President.\n  They tell me: Senator, don't worry about it, we have to retrain, re-\neducate. I will give you an example. Oneida, in South Carolina, makes \nclothes. They have 487 workers. The average age of those 487 workers \nwas 47. So we will do it Washington's way and we will train those 487 \nworkers, and tomorrow morning they are computer operators, expert \ncomputer operators. Mr. President, are you going to hire the 47-year-\nold computer operator or the 21-year-old? You are not going to take on \nthe health costs of the 47-year-old. You are not going to take on the \nretirement costs of a 47-year-old. You are going to be hiring the 21-\nyear-olds.\n  When they have lost their jobs, they quit making payments on the \nautomobile, and they quit making payments on their house. Some of them \nhave lost their houses and everything else like that, with 53,900 in \nSouth Carolina alone, and 700,000 in the country. These are just the \nones in the last couple of years we are trying to get at, as we did \nwith the steelworkers, and we got a majority vote on that. That is what \nI had lined up. I was going to pay for it by closing the Bermuda tax \nloophole. It is a national disgrace.\n\n  They talk about when they have an intelligence breach--and I never \naccused the President of knowing anything. I don't think it was passed \non. That is obvious from what I am reading. There isn't any question \nthat the fellow up in Minnesota wrote a memo--read Time magazine this \nweek--a detailed memo on how they might fly into the World Trade \nTowers. I don't know why they keep getting the fellow from Phoenix, AZ. \nGet the one from Minnesota. He said they might fly into the World Trade \nTowers.\n  Seaport security has languished in the House since before Christmas. \nRail security has languished at the desk since before Christmas. They \nare not about to pay the bills or put on any taxes to pay for this war. \nThey want another $4 trillion tax cut. This is one of those situations \nwhere we need just as much help.\n  I wish I had the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, here to \ntalk about building and fighting the war and everything else. I never \nheard anything more eloquent on behalf of the steelworkers. I support \nher. She is magnificent. I wish I had her here to describe the plight \nof these textile workers. They are just as important to our security.\n  I will emphasize this: In 1961--and it is still on the books today--\nthere was a national security provision preventing the President from \ntaking Executive action in trade, unless he proved first that the item \nin question was important to our national security. I went at that time \nto hearings, along with George Ball from the State Department, Freeman \nof the Department of Agriculture, Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg, \nSecretary of Commerce Luther Hodges, and we had Secretary of the \nTreasury Douglas Dillon. We had the hearings, and it is on the books of \nthe United States of America that, next to steel, textiles is the \nsecond most important to our national security. So we are not just \ntalking about a cheap price. America wasn't built on consumerism; \nAmerica was built on building and creating jobs.\n  For 100-some years, in Teddy Roosevelt's time when we had a strong \nAmerica, we didn't even have the income tax. The tariffs and \nprotectionism built this country, and under Eisenhower, Roosevelt, and \nother distinguished Presidents, we continued to build.\n  This crowd has nothing but boast politics. They couldn't care less. \nFast track--we will just vote it. The excuse will be I had to do it. It \nwas either take it or leave it. It ought to be a shame to vote against \nthe Constitution. Article I, section 8, not the President, not the U.S. \nTrade Representative, but the Congress of the United States shall \nregulate foreign commerce.\n  Here I am begging to perform my own responsibility, and the vote is: \nYou do not have the responsibility; we are going to do it, and you have \nto take it or leave it, up or down; you are not going to be in charge--\nfast track.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor and reserves the \nremainder of his time.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, by previous consent, I was to be \nrecognized following the presentation by Senator Hollings. I wish to \npropose, for the convenience of others in the Chamber, a slightly \ndifferent arrangement. Senator Grassley wishes to be recognized. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Grassley be recognized for 20 minutes, \nwith Senator Landrieu following for 15 minutes, Senator Corzine for 15 \nminutes; and, following that, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak against the Hollings \namendment that is before the Senate. I will tell you two reasons I \nstrongly oppose the amendment.\n  My comments are in regard to why trade adjustment assistance should \nnot be expanded in the way Senator Hollings proposes it. Before I give \nthose reasons, I remind my colleagues of the tremendous expansion of \ntrade adjustment assistance that is already in the bipartisan bill \nbefore the Senate. A lot of programs that are part of trade adjustment \nassistance have never been part of the program in the 40-year history \nof trade adjustment assistance.\n  We in a bipartisan way in this body are very concerned about workers \nwho are dislocated for trade or economic reasons. The usual retraining \nand support programs are being continued, but as one of several \nexamples of additional programs, we are going to provide health \ninsurance benefits for dislocated workers because of trade under trade \nadjustment assistance.\n  When I speak against any further outrageous expansions of this \nprogram, as Senator Hollings' amendment would do, I do not want anybody \nsaying that those of us who oppose it do not have any concern about \nthose who are dislocated because of trade.\n  First, this is an extremely expensive, radical expansion of the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program that cannot be justified in any fashion \nas a program that is related to trade. In fact, this amendment \ncompletely severs the traditional 40-year link between adjustment \nassistance and trade. All you have to do is work in one specific \nindustry during a specific period of time and you are eligible to \nreceive benefits.\n  The fact is, workers in the textile industry and in other industries \nas well often lose their jobs for reasons having nothing to do with \ntrade. Often workers might lose employment because of\n\n[[Page S4753]]\n\nnew advances in technology, changes in the national economy, their \ncompany is not well run, or because of improvements in productivity. \nFor all of those, we have programs on the books to help those \ndislocated workers, albeit dislocated unrelated to trade.\n\n  The textile industry in particular has seen tremendous changes \nbecause of new technology, such as the introduction of new computer-\nassisted design techniques that have often transformed many labor-\nintensive jobs into more high-tech workplaces over the past decade.\n  While it is certainly regrettable that these new developments in \ntechnology mean some workers lose their jobs, we should try to help \nthese workers and help their families at the same time and do it as \nmuch as we can through other types of assistance. They are not workers, \nthough, who have lost their jobs because of trade.\n  Furthermore, I do not know on what basis we can simply give \nGovernment benefits to workers in one industry but not to workers in \nother industries. Do not workers in industries other than textiles also \ndeserve the same treatment?\n  The bottom line is the purpose of trade adjustment assistance. It is \ndesigned to help workers who are adversely affected solely because of \ntrade.\n  This amendment would signal a radical transformation of trade \nadjustment assistance into another welfare program with no connection \nto trade. It would also sharply boost the cost of the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this \nprovision alone would cost over $700 million in a 10-year period. That \nwould nearly double the cost of the entire Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram with just the one provision: The provision put forth by Senator \nHollings.\n  I regret that any American loses his or her job. There is nobody who \nwants to see an American lose their job. I have had the opportunity \ntwice in my industrial employment to lose jobs, once in 1960 and once \nin 1971.\n  In 1971, I drew unemployment compensation for a short period of time. \nI know what it is like to be dislocated from a job, but I was not \ndislocated because of trade. There were other programs that helped me \nduring that period of time, and those programs are available for people \nbecause we know that losing a job is a terrible blow to an individual. \nIt affects the entire family. But there are other programs designed to \nhelp these individuals.\n  We should not take money away from other Federal programs and from \nother pressing needs in our country to pay benefits under a trade \nadjustment assistance program to workers just in one industry, and \nparticularly when they are not affected by trade.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. President, while I have time remaining, I wish to speak \ngenerally--how much time do I have Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the underlying \nlegislation.\n  When talking about trade promotion authority, opponents seem to love \nto use the term ``fast track'' because I think they believe that this \nsounds somewhat sneaky or somewhat uncontrollable. That is a shame. It \nis a shame because the term ``fast track'' does not really reflect what \nthis legislation is all about and the procedures that are connected \nwith giving the President the authority to negotiate trade agreements.\n  The term we use in this legislation, ``trade promotion authority,'' \nis more accurate. In reality, trade promotion authority is a contract. \nIt is a contract between the President and the Congress. When the \nCongress extends trade promotion authority to the President, the \nCongress agrees to authorize the President to negotiate trade \nagreements and to do it on behalf of 280 million Americans.\n  Why do we have this contract with the President of the United States? \nWe have it because there is only one person who can speak on behalf of \n280 million people in international affairs, and that is our chief \ndiplomat, the Chief Executive of our country, the President of the \nUnited States. It is that simple. We cannot have 535 people in Congress \nnegotiating with other nations. It would not ever work.\n  If we are going to succeed at the negotiating table, our trading \npartners need to know that the person to whom they are speaking has \nauthority to negotiate.\n  Trade promotion authority not only gives that authority to negotiate, \nbut it gives a great deal of credibility to our President at these \ntables. That is what the trade promotion authority contract between the \nCongress and the President is all about.\n  Let me be clear. The President does not go into trade negotiations \nwithout guidance and without always being reminded that the \nconstitutional power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce rests \nwith the Congress of the United States. Through this trade promotion \nauthority bill, the Congress gives very careful direction to the \nPresident, with detailed lists of instructions. The Congress tells the \nPresident--we do that through this legislation--if he follows these \ndirections we give him, if he fulfills the details of consultation \nprocedures laid out in this bill, we will do three things.\n  First, we will actually consider the agreement. We will not have \nthese agreements sitting around collecting dust on Capitol Hill. The \nCongress will actually pick up this agreement and we will consider it. \nNow, that does not mean we will agree with the bill, it does not mean \nwe would pass the bill, but we are committed to considering it.\n  Secondly, we will not change the agreement before we consider it. We \nauthorize the President to negotiate. He follows our directions. He \nconsults with the Members of Congress through the process. We know what \nis in the negotiated instrument. Now we will consider it without \nchanging it.\n  Third, we will limit debate on the agreement. We will not tie it up \nin endless debate in the Congress. That is the contract we have with \nthe President of the United States, an agreement between the President \nand the Congress that if he will do certain things for us, we will do \ncertain things.\n  Why do we do it that way? We do it because it empowers us as a \nCongress, it empowers us as a nation. Without trade promotion \nauthority, the President has no clear direction from Congress. He can \nbasically negotiate anything he wants without consulting with Congress, \nbut he will not do it in a credible way with the other nations that are \nwith him because they are not apt to agree if they are not certain that \na final agreement will be considered by Congress No. 1, and not changed \nby Congress No. 2, and actually voted upon.\n  Congress can selfishly observe its constitutional power because we \nkeep a watchful eye on the President of the United States over many \nmonths, sometimes over many years, in the process of the negotiations \nto reach an agreement.\n  Trade promotion authority also empowers us as a nation of 280 million \npeople. Our foreign trading partners know the President speaks for the \nNation in international trade and that he has the backing of Congress. \nWith this knowledge, they can be sure any agreement concluded with the \nPresident will be considered by Congress without being amended to \ndeath. That empowers our Nation to get the best bargain we can at the \nnegotiating table.\n  What happens if the President does not fulfill his end of the \nbargain? What if he does not follow Congress's direction or fails to \nconsult with the Congress as the law requires? Then he does not get the \nbenefit of agreement. The trade promotion authority bill itself \ncontains procedural enforcement mechanisms to ensure the President does \nnot overstep his agreement with the Congress. Trade promotion authority \nprocedures are very carefully balanced in a thoughtful way for the \nPresident and the Congress to work together to advance the economic \ninterests of our Nation. It is a procedure that has worked well for \nover 50 years, and on the basis of this legislation, trade promotion \nauthority has worked well for 25 years. It is also a procedure that \nsince 1995 our Nation has gone too long without. One hundred thirty \nagreements around the world have been negotiated. Our President has not \nhad the credibility to be at the table. He has not been at the table. \nWe have been at the table of three bilateral agreements but otherwise \nnot. So the interests of\n\n[[Page S4754]]\n\n280 million Americans have never been represented, never been \nprotected, and the rest of the world is going to move on.\n\n  Prior to 5 or 6 years ago, the rest of the world used to wait for the \nUnited States to take the first step. We have an opportunity now by \npassing this legislation to put our Nation once again in the lead. So \nthat is why I urge my colleagues to work our way through the rest of \nthese amendments and to work with Senator Baucus and me to pass this \nbill and help get our Nation's trade back on track.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. There is also a lot of benefit in trade promotion \nauthority and trade agreements for the American farmers and ranchers, \nand it is beneficial to us because our farmers and ranchers are \ncompetitive and technologically advanced in the world. The United \nStates has long been a world leader in agricultural exports. Dollar for \ndollar, the United States exports more meat than steel, more corn than \ncosmetics, more bakery products than motor boats, more fruits and \nvegetables than household appliances. One in three acres of \nagricultural production of the United States is exported.\n  In 2000, the U.S. agricultural community exported $51 billion in \nproducts and supported at least 750,000 American workers. With 96 \npercent of the world's population living outside the United States, \nthere is a huge market for food products of American farmers and \nranchers.\n  In the absence of trade promotion authority, other countries have \nentered into trade agreements that have driven foreign consumers from \nthe U.S. agricultural market.\n  Burger King restaurants in Chile buy potatoes from Canada. Canada's \nfree trade agreement with Chile gives their farmers eased access to the \nChilean market while American farm products are subject to high tariffs \nthat drive up the price to the consumer. So, consequently, we do not \nsell to Chile.\n  Trade promotion authority will expand existing markets, open new \nmarkets for American food products, and allow our farmers and ranchers \nto better compete, boosting our exports. Previous trade agreements \ndemonstrate benefits to American farmers and ranchers.\n  U.S. agricultural exports to our NAFTA partners have increased $4 \nbillion since that agreement went into effect 8 years ago. Under the \nUnited States-Canada Free Trade Agreement, U.S. agricultural exports \ndoubled. Canada is the No. 2 market for our agricultural exports, \nbuying $7.6 billion in the year 2000. Under the North American Free \nTrade Agreement, our agricultural exports to Mexico have nearly \ndoubled, making it our third largest agricultural market buying $6.5 \nbillion in the year 2000.\n  U.S. pork producers credit the North American Free Trade Agreement \nwith their 130-percent increase in market share in Mexico between 1994 \nand the year 2000. The United States beef and veal exports to Canada \nincreased 26 percent in volume between 1990 and 2000 and increased five \nfold with Mexico from 1993 to the year 2000. The sale of United States \ncorn to Canada increased more than 127 percent in volume between 1990 \nand 2000, and exports to Mexico increased by nearly 18 times between \n1993 and 2000.\n\n  Mexico voluntarily chose to accelerate its market opening for corn \nunder the North American Free Trade Agreement to provide lower cost \nfood for its consumer. Canada imported 15 percent more soybeans from \nthe United States between 1990 and 2000. Mexican imports of United \nStates soybeans doubled from 1993 to the year 2000.\n  I would also like to comment on the seriousness of defeating the Byrd \n(3447) amendment on the Congressional Oversight Group. The Byrd \namendment will curtail the authorities on international trade within \nthe Congress of the United States; those people who have been given \nauthority, the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means, will be \ncurtailed. It will curtail our oversight of these agreements. We need \nto work toward that. I am also asking my colleague, for the sake of \nmaintaining the authority of an oversight of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, that we defeat the Byrd amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will withhold for a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3450 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Byrd, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the amendment numbered 3450 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin be recognized \nfollowing Senator Dorgan, and that he be recognized for up to 45 \nminutes, and that Senator Cantwell be recognized following that for 20 \nminutes. If there is a Republican Senator who seeks recognition, that \nSenator would have the right to follow Senator Dorgan. We will \nalternate if the Republicans want to; if they do not, we have the order \nset up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3470\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration, amendment No. 3470.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make sure the unanimous consent \nagreement is clear. Following Senator Harkin, if a Republican wishes to \nspeak, they will be able to do. Prior to that, the order is in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand a procedure is established \nthat amendment No. 3470 will come up for a vote later in the afternoon \nbefore we have final passage on the measure before the Senate. I rise \nto speak for the allotted 15 minutes as arranged under a previous \nconsent agreement.\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment that I hope will be voted \non favorably. I suggest it would help the underlying bill. I will \ncertainly support the work that Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus on \nour side have done to bring this important bill to the floor. I have \nbeen supportive of the overarching concept and many of the details of \nthe bill.\n  I am proud to say our entire Louisiana delegation--both Senators, \nSenator Breaux and myself, as well as all seven Members of our House \ndelegation--have been very pro trade, and for good reasons: Not only \nbecause we think it is important for our Nation but for our own State \nof Louisiana that has positioned itself historically as a great trading \nhub.\n  Although there are some disadvantages in the short term, and there \nare some jobs and industries that may be temporarily negatively \naffected, the long-term trends for the State of Louisiana and, frankly, \nfor this Nation are very positive.\n  I thank Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus. I support their efforts \nto streamline some of our trade policies, recognizing there are \nlegitimate concerns about environmental and labor issues. The \nunderlying bill has addressed, if not perfectly--has attempted to \naddress in good spirit and in good, strong rules and regulations--those \nefforts. This could be a continuing work in progress. We in Louisiana \nfeel very strongly about that.\n  The amendment is not an attempt to undermine or scuttle this grand \ncompromise and great package. It is an attempt to perfect and modify it \nfor a group of workers who have been hard hit by something that is not \nin line with this free trade bill; that is, when the President just a \nfew months ago issued a 201 ruling to put tariffs on raw steel that \ncomes into the United States--which I vigorously objected to; so did \nthe senior Senator from Louisiana and many Senators--and what\n\n[[Page S4755]]\n\nhas happened since that administrative decision to put this tariff in, \nin hopes of helping other areas of the Nation and other Senators and \ntheir States that produce this steel, States such as West Virginia, \nKentucky, and Maryland.\n  I can understand these efforts to try to build consensus. The bottom \nline is it has hurt our maritime industry. I will give you some facts \nand figures. My amendment seeks to simply expand the trade adjustment \nassistance for not only workers who might lose their jobs because they \nhave either moved overseas or have lost their jobs because of a flood \nof imports, but also this small group of maritime workers, about \n38,000, for a limited period of time who were losing their jobs because \nof the lack of imports coming in because of this 20- to 30-percent \ntariff.\n  Again, I disagreed with the President's decision. I continue to \ndisagree with that decision. My amendment does not seek to overturn it. \nI am just trying to help workers who are directly affected by that \ndecision in an effort to make the whole situation a bit more perfect \nfor the workers from the steel-producing States we are trying to help, \nas well as to try to give some necessary and urgent relief to maritime \nworkers who find themselves on the other side of that decision because \nthey are losing their jobs because steel is not coming in to the port \nof New Orleans.\n  We have lost tons and tons, in just a couple of months, of steel \ncoils, steel plates and sheets, steel bars, tin plates, and stainless \nsteel bars that are coming into the ports of Louisiana, primarily the \nports of New Orleans.\n  We are not the only port that has been hurt very badly. The Port of \nHouston, the ports of the Great Lakes--we have ports all over the \nNation, so 38,000 maritime workers literally are having to pick up an \nunemployment check instead of a paycheck because of the decision that \nwas made.\n  I tried to stop the decision but it was an administrative decision. \nMy amendment does not seek to overturn it. My amendment only says, \nsince it has been a consensus of the administration and Congress to \nhelp the steelworkers and special parts of our Nation, let's also, by \nthis small amendment--that only costs $10 million and it sunsets after \n4-plus years--help the maritime workers.\n  Under the current bill, they are not entitled to benefits because \nthey are not being affected by a flood of imports. Their jobs are not \nnecessarily being moved overseas. They just do not have the steel to \nbring on to the wharves because of this tariff.\n  It does not cost us very much money in the scheme of things, but it \nwill help thousands of workers in Louisiana, and many thousands of \nworkers temporarily, until this situation can get worked out.\n  That is the essence of my amendment. It is about 8,000 jobs that are \nat risk in New Orleans, a major port in our Nation. It is about 7,500 \njobs in the Port of Houston, the President's home State. It is about \n5,000 jobs, approximately, in California, in the Los Angeles Port; in \nPennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware--Mr. President, your own State--\ncombined, about 4,400 jobs that could be at risk; in the Great Lakes \nand Upper Mississippi, about 2,000 jobs. It is estimated for smaller \nports around the Nation, it is about 10,000 jobs.\n  Why? Because steel is one of the major imports, until this tariff was \nplaced 2 months ago, that was coming into our Nation. While it caused \ngreat heartburn in the steel-producing areas of our State, it was \nactually very good business for our ports.\n  Suffice it to say we cannot go back and overturn everything, but we \ncertainly can vote today to help maritime workers directly affected by \nthis decision. Again, it only costs us $10 million. It sunsets in 4-\nplus years. It is a minor help that we can give to people who show up \nat the docks every morning and stay late almost every day. They have \nchildren to send to college. They have mortgages on their houses. They \nhave other bills and responsibilities, maybe an elderly person who is \nat home. These are hard-working Americans and because of action taken \nin Washington they have to now pick up an unemployment check instead of \na paycheck.\n  These are not welfare recipients; these are people who have worked \n10, 15, 25, 30 years at what I would consider--as would most \neverybody--hard labor.\n  The Presiding Officer is familiar with this picture because he comes \nfrom a port State. This is a New Orleans dock but it could be anyplace \nin America where you have stevedors and longshoremen loading and \nunloading ships. This is one of the great benefits of trade because \nthese, in many cases, are unionized jobs, very high-paying jobs with a \nlot of protection for these workers. This is dangerous business. This \ngoes on in America every day.\n  There are thousands and thousands of these workers. What you will not \nsee in this picture is a welfare recipient. What you see is a worker, \nmany years working on the docks. Because of this tariff and the bill we \nare discussing, a lot of these guys cannot pick up a paycheck--or women \nare now working on the docks. My amendment seeks to give them some \nsmall relief--not upset the bill, not turn the compromise on its head, \nbut to give us some relief.\n\n  I hope when we have an opportunity to vote later this afternoon we \nwill get a good, bipartisan vote on this small amendment that will help \nbring us some relief.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has just under 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If I could, I would like to speak for a minute about \nanother problem that has arisen because of this 30-percent tariff on \nsteel that is not related to my amendment. While I have a minute, I \nwish to speak about our fabrication industry.\n  Senators are now very familiar with me coming to the floor to try to \nexplain the importance of the oil and gas industry to our Nation. We \ntalked a lot about this in our energy debate, but I need to make this \npoint today on this trade bill.\n  This tariff is very hurtful to the maritime workers who I am trying \nto help in a very modest, but meaningful way so they can qualify and \nget their TAA benefits under this trade bill. I also want to bring to \nthe attention of this body--not that I have a solution for it because I \ncannot figure out an amendment that would actually help this; if I \ncould I would offer it--what a great harm this tariff has also brought \nto a great industry in south Louisiana; that is, in the manufacturing \nbusiness, using a lot of steel to help build our boats and platforms \nand equipment that help us get oil and gas safely out of the ground in \nthe gulf and bring it to the shore to try to help light up this \nbeautiful Chamber and everybody in New York and California and Illinois \nand in Louisiana--the whole country.\n  We have a very vibrant fabrication industry, as you can imagine, with \nindustries such as McDermott Industries and Gulf Island Fabricators. \nThese are large fabricators. I am here to say, after contacting many of \nthem over the last several months, that some of them will absolutely go \nout of business and we are then going to lose hundreds of jobs, if not \nthousands, in south Louisiana, for the simple reason that because of \nthe cheaper steel that they were importing from other places in the \nworld, bringing it to Louisiana through the mighty Gulf of Mexico or \nother large bodies of water to south Louisiana to build these great \nplatforms, we cannot now compete against the same sort of manufacturing \nin places all over the world.\n  Our delegation that is voting for trade--and we are happy to vote for \nthe trade bill--has been caught in crosswinds, you might say, because \nof an administrative decision about trade. As a result, we are losing \nnot only jobs in our maritime industry, which this trade bill should be \nhelping to protect, but also we are getting hurt because of our lack of \nability now to compete with other manufacturers in other parts of the \nNation to get our oil and gas out of the ground.\n  Now we are in a situation of having fabrication done offshore to \nfloat these tremendous platforms and rigs into the gulf. Our workers do \nnot get the benefit of these jobs. Our oil and gas is taken out of our \nground, right off of our shore, and 100 percent of the proceeds of the \ntaxes paid come to the Federal Government. So Louisianians don't get \nthe taxes from the royalties, we don't get the jobs making the \nplatforms, we get beat up constantly because we are producing oil and \ngas, and my maritime workers have to pick up an unemployment check \ninstead of a paycheck.\n\n[[Page S4756]]\n\n  If I sound as if I am complaining a little bit, I mean to try to lay \nout this problem. Again, I thank Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus. I \nsupport the trade bill, but I ask them for their assistance in helping \na few thousand maritime workers who are not being hard hit by the trade \nbill they are recommending, which I support, but they are being hard \nhit because of an administration decision that is keeping imports down, \ntherefore putting maritime workers out of business.\n  When I can meet with Senator Breaux and get a solution for our \nfabricators, I will most certainly be bringing up that amendment, \nthough not to this bill. But I will get as much relief as I can for \ngood industries, good companies that have produced good jobs, \nindustries that are going to be hurt, and I will ask the President as \nwell as the leadership in the House and the Senate, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, to come up with some potential solution--cost effective \nfor the taxpayer--to our problem in Louisiana.\n  People in Louisiana deserve a fair share and an opportunity to work \nhard.\n  I yield any remaining time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3461\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nJersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise to discuss amendment No. 3461 which was \noffered on my behalf, and on behalf of Senator Dodd, Senator Stabenow, \nand others by Senator Reid on Monday and set aside. It is my \nexpectation this amendment will be voted on at the expiration of the 30 \nhours, as required by cloture. But I wanted to make sure I had an \nopportunity to discuss the merits of this and the importance of this, \nwhich I consider quite significant.\n  I offer this amendment to protect the role of Congress and elected \nState and local officials in determining the nature and scope of \nsignificant public services. It is one thing for Congress to sacrifice \nits own prerogatives in the development of trade policy, as we will \nlikely do today with the passage of trade promotion authority; however, \nin my view, it goes much too far to delegate constitutional \nresponsibilities of elected officials when it comes to determining what \nare public services and what significant public services should be \nmanaged in the public sector.\n  My amendment stands for the simple proposition that trade agreements \nshould not be used to privatize public services--public services duly \ndirected by constitutionally authorized actors of our Nation's \ndemocratic processes. Specifically, the amendment would establish as a \nprincipal negotiating objective that trade agreements should not \ninclude a commitment by the United States to privatize significant \npublic services such as national security, Social Security, public \nhealth and safety, and education.\n  It is very simple. Before I discuss the details of my amendment, let \nme say that I agree with the objectives of the sponsors of the \nunderlying bill that we should seek ways to expand trade in services. I \nknow firsthand that this objective can create jobs and economic \nbenefit. In fact, I spent the better part of 30 years of my life \nbuilding an international service business in banking and understand \nthe need for barriers to be broken down. There are many that limit the \nexpansion of American enterprise abroad.\n  It is also true that the American service sector is and will continue \nto be a vital part of our economy. It is one that is growing \nsubstantially. It is a substantial part of our international activity.\n  In my view, we need to aggressively foster and promote that growth. \nIt promises long-term benefits for all Americans.\n  That means we should be looking for ways to open accounts. I commend \nthose efforts as a part of this bill.\n  Having said that, while there are many potential benefits to forging \ntrade agreements designed to increase trade and services, there are \nalso risks. That is what my amendment is about.\n  One of the risks is that those agreements will be misused, either \ndirectly or through unintended implementation requirements.\n  My amendment is designed to reduce that risk so that trade agreements \nwill do what they are supposed to do and won't be used in a particular \nway: the risk that they will commit the United States to privatizing \nkey public services outside of legally constituted constitutional \nprocesses.\n  Some of my colleagues may well be unaware that such a risk exists. \nAfter all, trade agreements are supposed to be about promoting economic \nactivity. They weren't conceived to overrule democratic processes and \ndecisions about the provision of essential public services--things such \nas protecting our airports and airline security, things that we have \nchosen in the democratic process to move forward in the public arena.\n  Yet trade agreements can do just that. There is ample reason to be \nconcerned that privatization of significant public services could well \nbe on the table in future negotiations.\n  In fact, right now negotiations are already underway in the process \nof establishing new agreements with respect to trade and services. \nThose negotiations may well lead to agreements under which services \ntraditionally administered by Federal, State, and local governments \nwould be on the chopping block.\n  Under such agreements, foreign investors might be able to challenge \npublic policies that provide certain services through government \nentities. Such foreign interests could argue that these policies \ndiscriminate against them and represent an unlawful trade barrier. In \nfact, some international agreements are already being interpreted that \nway, and others are being designed for that purpose.\n  Consider what is happening in bilateral negotiations between the \nUnited States and Chile.\n  In 1981, Chile decided to privatize its public pension system; that \nis, its equivalent of Social Security. Under the privatized system, \nChilean workers are now required to invest their pension dollars with \nprivate financial institutions. Unfortunately, Chile's experience with \nthe privatization of Social Security has, in many respects, proved \nproblematic. Many Chilean workers have seen the value of their \ninvestments collapse. And many Chilean political leaders now believe \nthe only way to protect the retirement security of Chilean families is \nto return to the earlier public system based on guaranteed benefits--\nmore like we have in the United States.\n  U.S. negotiators are encouraging Chile to keep their system \nprivatized. As a result, the financial security of Chilean retirees and \ntheir national retirement policy may depend on international trade \nnegotiations rather than the political democratic processes reflecting \nthe wishes of the Chilean people.\n\n  Think about that for a moment and consider how Americans would feel \nif trade negotiations ended up deciding the fate of Social Security in \nAmerica. Imagine trade negotiators setting that investment policy for \nthe Social Security Administration. What if foreign interests were \ndemanding that the United States open up our Social Security system to \nforeign financial firms or mandate privatization outside the democratic \nprocess? Imagine that Chilean, Russian, or German negotiators argued \nthat it was a restraint of trade for Social Security to limit its \ninvestments to U.S Government securities rather than opening up the \nsystem to privatized accounts.\n  I speak as one who strongly opposes that move with the American \nsystem privatizing Social Security. It would lead to a deep cut in \nguaranteed benefits and reduce the financial security of American \nseniors. But I think the most important issue as it relates to this \ndebate, regardless of your views on privatization, is that Americans \nwould be outraged if that were accomplished through trade negotiations \nas opposed to a debate on the floor of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives and a discussion with the American people.\n  The future of Social Security is too important to be decided by \nanyone other than the American people.\n  Social Security is not the only area of public service provision that \nconcerns me. Let's take a look at another example a little less \ndramatic.\n  The European Union has now proposed that the United States make new \ncommitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services to allow \nforeign firms to gain greater access to the U.S. water services market.\n  Many municipalities across the United States have long felt that the \nprovision of water services is an important governmental \nresponsibility.\n\n[[Page S4757]]\n\nSome of the localities in New Jersey that I represent have chosen to \nhave it administered by private companies. Others have chosen to retain \nthe nature of a public provision of water services.\n  The point is that the people have spoken. Should municipalities \nprivatize their water supplies? I am not sure. I am certainly not \nconvinced that one answer is appropriate for all situations. But one \nthing I am sure about is that these decisions should be made by local \nelected officials who understand local circumstances and local values, \nand who are accountable to the local taxpayers and local voters. These \ndecisions to privatize should not be dictated by unelected, distant \ntrade bureaucrats.\n\n  Let me give another example. This involves a company that has been in \nthe news lately, a company named Enron.\n  The Government of Argentina contracted with a division of Enron to \nprovide water and sewer services in Buenos Aires. Enron did not do such \na good job, to put it mildly. For a while, the water provided was \ncontaminated by toxic bacteria. As a result, some 500,000 people were \ntold not to drink the water for well over a month.\n  In the end, the Argentinian Government canceled its contract with \nEnron. Now Enron is suing, under trade agreements, that there is a \nbasis for a $550 million settlement for them against the Argentinian \npeople because they did a bad job.\n  I am telling my colleagues, this is an important issue. The provision \nof public services is a decision which our democratic processes should \nbe deciding. This matter should be decided by democratically elected \ngovernments, not unelected trade bureaucrats.\n  There is a long list of public services that could well be privatized \nand put up for bid by foreign companies. These include everything from \nhealth services for veterans, to State colleges and universities, to \nimmigration control, to afterschool programs, to police officers. All \nof these could be threatened by a trade agreement, and a lot of people \nare worried about that.\n  That is why I want this amendment to be seriously considered by my \ncolleagues on the Senate floor, really to establish a trade objective.\n  Madam President, I ask, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Chair.\n  The American Public Health Association is concerned about the \nprivatization of some parts of the Medicare Program and medical \nservices for the poor. The American Council on Education and the \nCouncil for Higher Education Accreditation have voiced deep concerns \nabout the GATT negotiations. As they said in a statement, higher \neducation is supposed to serve the public interest and should not be a \ncommodity.\n  Yet the threat posed to education by privatization through trade \nagreements is very real. Under some prospective trade rules, States \ncould be barred from subsidizing State universities, using the argument \nthat such subsidies put private universities at a competitive \ndisadvantage. I do not think that is what the American people want \ntrade negotiations to accomplish. They do not want unelected trade \nbureaucrats setting our policy with regard to public services.\n  Let me return to the explanation of the amendment. The amendment is \nvery simple and states:\n\n       A principal negotiating objective of the United States is \n     to ensure that trade agreements do not [do not] include a \n     commitment by the United States to privatize significant \n     public services, including services related to (i) national \n     security; (ii) Social Security; (iii) public health and \n     safety; and (iv) education.\n\n  It then defines the term ``privatize'' to mean:\n\n       . . . the transfer of responsibility for, or administration \n     of, a government function from a government entity to a \n     private entity.\n\n  And that is it. That is the entire amendment.\n  As it should be clear from its language, the premise of the amendment \nis that there are some types of public services that are so important \nthat decisions about them should be made democratically and should not \nbe delegated to an international body. Our amendment highlights, in \nparticular, those four areas. There may well be others.\n\n  There may be some who would argue we ought to privatize some parts of \nour national security system, such as those who objected when Congress \nrecently federalized our airport security system. I disagree. But, \nagain, we ought to have that argument here on the floor of the Senate--\ndemocratically chosen processes, constitutionally established.\n  You could say that about many other types of issues.\n  Trade negotiators should not privatize and preempt the decisionmaking \nof Congress and the President. This amendment is less about \nprivatization than it is about democracy. It is one thing to enter into \ninternational agreements, promote private investment, even if that \nmeans limiting our congressional prerogatives, but it is an entirely \ndifferent matter to tie our own hands in deciding upon important public \nservices, which go to the heart of what government is about in the \nfirst place.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to speak on this important, relevant, \nand germane amendment. In my mind, this bill already delegates too much \ncongressional responsibility and authority. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport this amendment and protect our right to make a democratic \nchoice about what the public services are that are privatized and that \nas we move forward we make those decisions through the debate process \nand discussion with the American people, not through trade \nnegotiations, not through bureaucrats, who are unelected officials.\n  So that is what the amendment is about. I believe strongly that this \nis an amendment my colleagues should support, and I hope they will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, Senator Harkin has agreed to yield 5 \nminutes to me. I know Senator Dorgan is next on the list. He has agreed \nto let me come in at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I believe, by unanimous consent, I was \nto have been recognized following the presentation by Senator Corzine. \nIf that is the case--I believe it is the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, provided I am recognized following his presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. SPECTER are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it is quite clear to me from the cloture \nvote yesterday that the Senate is going to pass trade promotion \nauthority.\n  I think it is a shame that we have not had a more thoughtful debate \non this issue. So I would like to take this opportunity to describe why \nthis issue is and will continue to be controversial.\n  Trade promotion authority is a euphemism for fast track. Fast track \nis just what the name implies--a process that involves a rush to \njudgment. It's like fast food, implying a lack of preparation, a quick \nand easy meal that in the end turns out to be bad for you. Fast track \ntrade authority allows the Administration to go negotiate a trade \nagreement, and bring it back to the Senate without the ability of any \nMember to offer a single amendment.\n  Article I, section 8 of the Constitution states that the Congress \nshall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations. That is \nwhat was written in Philadelphia one hot summer with George Washington \nsitting in the presiding chair, Ben Franklin over to his left, and \nMason, and Madison. They decided Congress shall have the power to \nregulate commerce with foreign nations--not the trade ambassador, not \nthe President, but the Congress.\n  The Congress has decided in recent years that to delegate this \nconstitutional responsibility to trade negotiators. These negotiators \ngo to places like Doha, Qatar, and negotiate agreements in secret. They \nbring these\n\n[[Page S4758]]\n\nagreements back to Congress, and say: Here is the agreement. Take it or \nleave it in total; no amendments because you are not allowed to offer \nany. That is what fast track is all about.\n  If you want a good example of why fast track is a bad deal, you can \nlook to our experience with the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. Our \ntrade negotiators went to Canada armed with fast track. They negotiated \na trade agreement with Canada, and developed a secret side agreement \nwhich they disclosed only 2 years later to the Congress. That side \nagreement effectively traded away the interests of America's family \nfarmers. Our farmers have been hurt badly as a result of it. We \ncouldn't do a thing about it because when that agreement came back to \nthe Congress, no one was able to offer one single amendment.\n  I voted against the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. Had I been able \nto offer an amendment, I might have been able to fix it. The family \nfarmers who have been victimized by this agreement might not have been \nhurt nearly as badly. But no amendments were in order. No one in \nCongress could offer any amendment at any time. That is what fast track \nis about.\n\n  Since we are debating trade and our trade policy, I want to use a \nchart to show what has happened in trade. My colleagues stood up \nyesterday and said: You need to understand how important this is to \nAmerica. You need to understand all the new jobs we are creating with \nthese trade agreements. Well, count me in as somebody who supports \ntrade. I am big for trade. Expanded trade is terrific. The more the \nbetter but only as long as it is fair. If it is not fair, our country \nshould have the backbone to stand up and say, no, the trade we demand \nand expect is reciprocal trade, fair trade.\n  Fast track trade agreements have created runaway trade deficits. Here \nis what happens on the trade deficits. From 1991 to 2000, our trade \ndeficit has gone from $65 billion to $436 billion. Our country suffered \na recession in 2001, so the deficit declined just a bit last year, but \nthe trend is clear.\n  The fact is, this is by far the highest trade deficit in human \nhistory. Every single day, 7 days a week, our country buys more than $1 \nbillion in goods from abroad in excess of what we are able to sell \nabroad--over $1 billion a day every single day, racked up as a deficit.\n  I ask those who support this fast track free trade strategy, do you \nthink this works? Where did you pick up your economics? Was there some \ntextbook I missed along the way that makes you think that this trend is \na favorable one? I don't think so. This is not working. This is a \nfailure. This is a massive failure. Our trade strategy is drowning \nAmerica in red ink. Yet we have Senators coming to the floor saying: \nGive us more of this.\n  Where is this red ink coming from? Prior to negotiating an agreement \nwith Mexico, we had a small trade surplus with Mexico. We have turned \nthat now into a huge deficit. Prior to negotiating a trade agreement \nwith Canada, we had a modest deficit. Now we have turned that into a \nvery large deficit. We have a very large and growing trade deficit with \nChina, $70 billion a year plus--and a very large, abiding, growing \ntrade deficit with Japan.\n  What does all that mean in terms of real people? We have Senators who \ncome here and argue theory. They are out of touch with working people. \nWhen you work in the Congress, you take a shower in the morning and \nthen put on a dark suit. What we are doing in trade policy is dealing \nwith the jobs of the people who work hard all day and then have to \nshower at the end of the workday. It is their jobs that are sent \nelsewhere as a result of this legislation.\n  I gave a speech in the Senate some years ago. I told the stories of \nsome real folks who have been affected by unfair trade. The other day \nwe had a press conference on the steps of the Senate, with working men \nand women that continue to lose their jobs. The stories don't change.\n  The Levi corporation decided they can't make Levis in the United \nStates anymore. It is cheaper to make Levis in countries where you can \npay people 50 cents an hour. Or Fruit of the Loom, making shorts, men's \nshorts, they just ship those to a plant where they can pay somebody 40 \ncents an hour.\n  It is one thing to lose your shirt, another to lose your shorts. OK, \nit's a bad joke, and this is no laughing matter. Not when you have \ncompanies decide to move their plants to where they can pay people 40 \ncents an hour or, better yet, pay them 24 cents an hour. You know we \nhave products on our store shelves made by 12-year-old kids who worked \n12 hours a day and were paid 12 cents an hour. We all know that.\n  We have fought for over a century for the right of workers to \norganize, the right to work in a safe workplace, the right to say that \nit is wrong to put children who are 10 and 12 years old down in coal \nmines or in industrial plants, the right to a reasonable minimum wage. \nThose who support fast track ultimately are allowing corporations to \npole vault over all of that, and to move jobs overseas where they don't \nhave to be bothered with decent wages and working conditions. This is \nultimately just about corporate profits.\n  We have 8.6 million people today who are looking for work. If you are \none of those people, your personal unemployment number is 100 percent. \nYou, at some point, had to come home and tell your wife and your \nchildren: I am sorry, I lost my job and I don't know what I am going to \ndo next.\n  The Economic Policy Institute has calculated that, as a result of the \nmost recent trade agreements--Canada, NAFTA, and the WTO--roughly 3 \nmillion jobs have been lost in this country. So when you have 8.6 \nmillion people out of work, and 3 million of them have been displaced \nby trade, should we be diving headfirst into new trade agreements?\n  When NAFTA was negotiated, we were told that Mexico would specialize \nin low-wage and low-skilled jobs, and that those products would benefit \nU.S. consumers. That may have happened to some extent, but we have lost \na lot of good jobs for working people in this country. The three \nlargest imports into this country from Mexico are automobiles, \nautomobile parts, and electronics. They are all jobs of high-skilled \nworkers with high-skill wages that were displaced in this country.\n  Borg Warner had a transmission plant employing 800 people in Muncie, \nIN. The jobs paid $17 an hour. Good jobs. Those jobs don't exist there \nanymore. They are in Mexico. Atlas Crankshaft, owned by Cummings \nEngine, literally put its manufacturing plant on trucks and moved it \nfrom Ohio to Mexico. So those 200 jobs have gone south, looking for \nlower wages. The Abbott Cooperation, which manufactures wires harnesses \nfor Whirlpool Appliances, and their 117 jobs, were sent to Mexico. A \nmetals plant in Warren, MI, closed down. They put their equipment on \ntrucks and moved to Mexico--26 jobs gone south.\n  Some say: You know, Senator Dorgan, that is life. That is the way the \nnew economy is. That is the way this world works. It is a new global \neconomy and you don't understand it. You are one of these xenophobic \nisolationists who can't see over the horizon and cannot understand the \nnew economic day.\n  Well, I am certainly not suggesting that we retract on the global \neconomy. That is a fact of life; it is here and now. The question for \nthis Congress is, What are the rules? The rules have not kept pace with \nglobalization. As these plants close and move jobs to Mexico, or \nIndonesia, or Sri Lanka, or other countries around the world, shouldn't \nCongress begin debating what the rules are of free trade and \nglobalization? Because the rules have not kept pace with the times.\n  Those who want to take advantage of having no rules are those who \nwant to make profits by deciding they want to trade American jobs, and \nall the restrictions that come with it, for jobs elsewhere for pennies \nan hour, where they don't have to worry about polluting the water and \nair, and they can do it with impunity. They can hire as many kids as \nthey want. They don't have to worry about a safe workplace because \nthere are no rules and regulations on any of that.\n  The global economy has moved forward without sufficient rules. This \nSenate, instead of debating fast track, ought to be debating the rules \nof globalization. We are not allowed to do that. Do you know why? Those \nmaking big profits out of the existing system don't want us to do that. \nThat is the last thing they want us to talk about.\n\n  It would be nice if the proponents of fast track would take the time \nto talk\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\nto a few of the many people whose jobs were determined to be relatively \nunimportant in the scheme of international trade. I am not talking \nabout people who make buggy whips--a product for which we have no \nadditional need. I am talking about people who made decent wages \nworking real jobs in factories that produce good products.\n  When the rules are not fair, it is up to the Senate to stand up for \nAmerican workers. They will not do it and amendment after amendment on \nthis so called fast-track bill has gone down. Why is that? Because this \nwas like a big truck with a tarp over it, buttoned up long ago and \ndriving through this Chamber, like the trucks that will come in after \nJune 30 from Mexico.\n  Incidentally, as a result of NAFTA and some flawed analysis, this \nAdministration is set on June 30 to allow Mexican trucks to enter our \ncountry for long hauls. Everyone here knows there isn't a ghost of a \nchance that this is going to be safe for American drivers. Inspection \nsites don't exist. The standards for Mexican long-haul trucks are not \nenforced. I ask you to look at investigative reports on it and ask \nyourself: Do you want your family driving next to a long-haul truck \nthat has been driven for 24 hours by somebody who doesn't have a \nlogbook and hasn't had an adequate safety inspection? I guarantee that \nwill happen here after June 30 of this year. Why? Because we are not \nable to debate these issues under fast track.\n  The Senate is once again saying to our trade ambassador to go \nnegotiate trade agreements in secret, and to forget about what the \nSenate might think. Our current trade ambassador, Bob Zoellick, is a \nman I personally like, bright as a whip. We disagree on some things and \nagree on some other things. But it is just plain wrong for the Senate \nto give this kind of authority away, and to abrogate its \nresponsibility. And I hate to think of the likely consequences.\n  Mr. Zoellick said this on November 26, 2001:\n\n       In Doha, Qatar, antidumping laws in the U.S. could be \n     discussed as a new trade round gets underway.\n\n  In effect, our trade ambassador has put our antidumping laws on the \ntable to be traded away. We have already lost section 22, and section \n301 has been weakened, and now the trade ambassador is talking about \ngiving away the laws that prohibit dumping in our marketplace and \ninjuring our producers and workers. If we trade away our antidumping \nlaws away, there will be no protection against unfair trade. None.\n  When on Earth will this Congress learn? Have we not had enough \nexperience with this nonsense? How high do our trade deficits have to \ngo? If it doubles again, maybe then they will think there is a problem?\n  We can make the case that a fiscal policy deficit is money we owe to \nourselves. We cannot make that case with the trade deficit. This is \nmoney we owe to other countries. We will repay this someday with a \nlower standard of living in this country. That is inevitable.\n  Our negotiators just keep handing us these bad trade agreements, and \nour trade deficits keep skyrocketing. Will Rogers once said that the \nUnited States of America has never lost a war and never won a \nconference. He surely must have been speaking of our trade negotiators \nbecause with United States-Canada, with NAFTA, with WTO, with GATT, our \ntrade negotiators have taken 15 minutes and have wilted and folded \nunder the onslaught of pressure from both corporations and other \ncountries, and we end up with rules of trade that are fundamentally \nunfair to our workers, our farmers, and our businesses.\n  There is no debate about that in this Chamber. There is a relentless \nchant of the type you find on street corners about free trade, free \ntrade, fast track, new jobs, when all the evidence tells us that we \nhave had a disastrous experience with trade. We have paved the road by \nwhich U.S. companies can seek a lower wage almost anywhere in the \nworld.\n  Did any of my colleagues see the story the other day in the \nWashington Post about the young woman who was working in a toy factory \nand died from sheer exhaustion? She had been working 16-hour days for \ntwo months without a day off.\n  I have been in a number of countries with abysmal working conditions. \nWe know there are a couple hundred million kids who are being employed \naround the world. Some are locked in garages, in basements.\n  I held a hearing in Congress about child labor, and heard testimony \nabout young kids in India making carpets. They had had their fingertips \nlaced with gunpowder and set on fire so the burns would scar. Then when \nthese young children in these large plants would stick themselves with \nneedles while making carpets, it would not hurt, and they could keep on \nworking. Do we want those products on the store shelves of Pittsburgh \nor Fargo or Los Angeles or Dallas? Is that free trade? Is that fair \ntrade? Does anybody here care about that?\n  Do my colleagues know how many people we have in the Department of \nCommerce working on enforcement of trade laws so we make sure these \ntrade laws are fair? China, a country that has somewhere around a $70 \nbillion trade surplus with us, because they send us all their trinkets, \ntrousers, shirts, and shoes, and we take them all. Madam President, do \nyou know how many people are enforcing trade agreements with China? \nFewer than 10. Fewer than 10 people. The same is true with Japan, with \nwhich we have a huge trade deficit.\n  It is probably not unnoticed that I have a great deal of angst about \nthe way these issues generally are handled. We do not have a thoughtful \ndebate; we have a thoughtless debate. This is chanting about \nirrelevancies instead of talking about what makes this country strong.\n\n  The economic engine in this country, in my judgment, is an economic \nengine that begins with working people and also businesses willing to \ninvest their money to ask for a fair shake in international \ncompetition. We create these trade agreements with other countries that \nresult in huge trade deficits, and we have Senators come to the Chamber \nand talk about how many new jobs they have created. It is total \nnonsense. They ought to be talking about the 3 million jobs they have \nlost, and then talk about a few of the names of the people who have \nlost their jobs.\n  I guarantee there is not one Member of the Senate who is going to \nlose his job because of a bad trade agreement. There are going to be a \nlot of folks out there raising a family and trying very hard to make a \ngood living who will be told: No, your job does not exist in Akron, OH, \nanymore. Your job is now going to Sri Lanka, and we are sorry, that is \nlife, that is the global economy.\n  It is inevitable now this President will be given fast-track \nauthority. I did not believe we ought to give fast-track authority to \nPresident Clinton, and I do not believe we ought to give it to this \nPresident.\n  What I say about fast track is this: Take 1, 2, 10, or 20 of the \ntrade problems we already have from existing trade agreements. Try to \nfix those. Then come back and let's talk about new agreements.\n  I will not vote for this fast track bill. I suspect many Members of \nthe Senate will. They will button their coats tighter, stand up proudly \nand say how wonderful it is for this country, and not one of them will \nhave his job moved to Sri Lanka, Mexico, or anywhere else. I guarantee \nworking people who lose their jobs because of this will find precious \nlittle comfort by having trade adjustment assistance as part of it. \nYes, I support that part of the trade package. But it is not a good \nsubstitute for good trade law, and everybody in this Chamber knows it.\n  Madam President, I would like to take a couple more hours, but I need \nto step aside. We have other business to do. I hope at some point we \nwill have a real debate on trade in the Senate. It is certainly not the \nleader's fault we have not had a real debate. The problem is the lack \nof substance of the underlying bill. We cannot have a debate about \nsubstance.\n  I invite other Senators to spend a few hours talking about the \nreality of international trade. If anybody wants to do that with me, I \nwill join him and talk about real numbers and the truth on trade.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have a brief question. I know my friend from Nevada \nwants to make a UC request. Getting\n\n[[Page S4760]]\n\nthe tenor of the Senator's debate--interesting debate--he is critical \nof the NAFTA agreement, one of the three free trade agreements passed \nby the Senate, two of which passed almost unanimously--the Jordanian \ntrade agreement and the free trade agreement with Israel. NAFTA was not \nquite as unanimous. But did the Senator vote in favor of those three \nfree trade agreements?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No, I did not vote in favor of NAFTA, I did not vote in \nfavor of the U.S.-Canada agreement, and I did not vote in favor of \nGATT.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Did the Senator vote in favor of the Israel or Jordan \nfree trade agreements?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I did. And it is ironic that the Senator who makes the \npoint about the Jordan agreement voted to keep the Jordan agreement \nlabor standards out of this fast-track legislation.\n  I voted for the bilateral trade agreements that the Senator From \nOklahoma mentioned, but I did not vote for NAFTA, I did not vote for \nUnited States-Canada Agreement, and I did not vote for GATT. Those \nagreements have led to huge deficits. These numbers do not represent \nsuccess, not in North Dakota and not in Oklahoma. These growing massive \ndeficits are choking our country. I would love it if the Senator from \nOklahoma will join me sometime in a debate on trade on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  It is hard to get people to agree to do that, but if the Senator from \nOklahoma would, I would love to have the opportunity.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, is going to speak. \nFirst, I ask unanimous consent that following the previously ordered \nsequence of speakers, Senator Sarbanes be recognized to speak for up to \n15 minutes, and Senator Kennedy be recognized for up to 30 minutes, \nwith the previous provision regarding Republican speakers remaining in \neffect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Did the Senator say Senator Sarbanes and then Senator \nKennedy?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, but a Republican can come in between if they care to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I believe Senator Kennedy may be speaking on a different \nnontrade issue.\n  Mr. REID. If there is an objection, the rights of the Republicans are \npreserved.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would like to reserve some time for a Republican to be \nable to follow Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator modify his request?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I will do that in the next one.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Well, if Senator Kennedy is going to be speaking on \nminimum wage, I would like for a Republican, likewise, to have an \nopportunity to speak on that.\n  Mr. REID. If that is the desire of the Senator, we have no problem \nwith that. Following Senator Kennedy, that would be fine.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For 15 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4760-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 3448\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nNevada.\n  We are considering a lot of amendments. I know the chairman of the \nFinance Committee has been working through amendments. We have been \nworking through amendments as well, and we are going to get into a \nsituation where we have a lot of votes. For the information of our \ncolleagues and particularly our colleague and friend from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd, who has three or four amendments, one of which \nis second degreed by our friend and colleague from South Carolina, \nSenator Hollings.\n  Senator Byrd's amendment in the first degree deals with a \ncongressional oversight group that changes in composition.\n  Right now, the oversight for trade is in the Finance Committee. I \nhappen to serve on the Finance Committee, so I was interested in the \ncomposition of the congressional oversight group. It talks about the \noversight from the House. I notice in the House group, it consists of \nthe majority leader and minority leader, and eight additional members \nwould be appointed by the Speaker of the House, four each from the \nminority and majority. It also says none of the eight members appointed \nunder this paragraph will be members of the Committee on Ways and \nMeans.\n  Then it says the membership in the Senate congressional oversight \ngroup shall be comprised of the following Members of the Senate: \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, Senator Byrd; minority leader and \nmajority leader; eight additional Members appointed by the President \npro tempore of the Senate, four members from the majority after \nconsulting with the majority leader, and four members from the minority \nparty after consulting with the minority leader of the Senate.\n  Then it also says that none of the eight members appointed under this \nparagraph may be members of the Committee on Finance.\n  I am a member of the Finance Committee, and I do not want to have \nthat jurisdiction taken away from the Finance Committee. So I am going \nto oppose this amendment. At some point, I am going to move to table \nthe amendment. I would not want to table the amendment of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia without notifying him and giving him a chance to \ndebate. Maybe he has debated it and I missed that debate, but I was not \naware until a few moments ago of the impact of this new oversight \ncommittee, which would exclude members of the Finance Committee, which \nhas jurisdiction over trade.\n  I would think Democrats and Republicans who serve on the Finance \nCommittee would not like to find out that an area over which they have \njurisdiction and over which they have some responsibility, on which \nthey have had hearings, would be excluded from this oversight \ncommittee.\n  That is my purpose of speaking now. It is not for total debate but to \nlet my colleague from West Virginia know that at some point, not \nimmediately--as a matter of fact, it will be after the 2:30 briefing by \nthe FBI Director--a motion will be made to table the underlying Byrd \namendment dealing with the oversight group. I wanted my colleague to be \naware of that.\n\n[[Page S4761]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senator Harkin is not here, \nand his time is being wasted. I ask that the order be inverted so \nSenator Cantwell may now speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in support of the \ntrade and worker assistance legislation before the Senate that we have \nbeen working on for the last 2 weeks. I recognize the important work of \nSenators Baucus and Grassley and thank them for their tireless efforts \nin putting together a good trade proposal that will help workers and \nbusinesses throughout our country.\n  The Baucus-Grassley package embraces a balanced, comprehensive \napproach to free trade. This is the same approach adopted by our \npredecessors in the 93rd Congress when they passed the original 1974 \ntrade act which did combine the flexibility of trade negotiation \nagreements with trade adjustment assistance. Indeed, with the \ncombination of trade promotion authority with the largest expansion of \ntrade adjustment assistance in history, we are making a downpayment on \nthe economic growth and opportunity for many people in our country that \nwill impact our prosperity in the future.\n  Trade is absolutely critical to my home State. It is critical to our \ncurrent economy. It is critical to our future economy. The Puget Sound \nregion is probably the most export-dependent region in the country, and \nWashington is probably the most trade-dependent State in the Nation. \nTrade supports about one-third of the Washington State workforce or \nroughly 750,000 jobs. These jobs pay, on average, 46 percent more than \nthe overall statewide average. These are good jobs.\n  Washington truly is a portal to the Pacific. Our ports--from \nBellingham, Everett, Seattle, Tacoma, Longview, to Vancouver--ship \neverything from electronics, airplanes, to fruits, vegetables, wheat, \nand hundreds of other products to over 199 countries.\n\n  I often hear from my colleagues when discussing trade promotion \nauthority, What is it we are going to sell from the United States to \nthese countries? The answer from my State reaches across many sectors: \nAgriculture, manufacturing, and high-technology products. Trade \nprovides opportunities for both large and small businesses. Washington \nState, for example, is the largest producer of soft white wheat, of \nwhich about 85 percent of the crop is exported to foreign consumers at \nsubstantially higher prices than Washington wheat would receive \ndomestically. In manufacturing, the Boeing Company basically generates \nabout $30 billion in sales, a big part of the Puget Sound industry. And \n70 percent of the revenues come from overseas. Of the current sale of \nBoeing products, 70 percent is to overseas markets. We expect that to \nbe 74 percent in the next several years.\n  In our high-tech sector, Microsoft brings in about $25 billion in \nannual revenue, 50 percent of its sales being made overseas.\n  In these sectors--in agriculture, manufacturing, and in high \ntechnology--our State depends on foreign markets to make our economy \nwork. It is not just large businesses; it is small businesses. Eric \nJenson of Seattle founded a company designing and building bowed \ninstruments, such as the cello. Initially his business was limited to \ndomestic buyers, but by putting his company on the Internet, he thrust \nhimself into world markets and now sells about 25 percent of his \nproduct overseas.\n  As any salesperson would tell you, if you want to sell something, you \nhave to get your product into the store in a competitive fashion. If \nyou have to pay a middleman to do so, the prices will be too high. \nSimilarly, if we want to sell products to the world, we need to get \ninto foreign markets and avoid high tariffs. Currently, our businesses \nand farmers face tremendous barriers to foreign markets. Indeed, while \nforeign companies are able to sell to American consumers at import \nduties that are averaging less about 2 percent, our companies and \nfarmers often face trade barriers that are 10 times as high, basically \nclosing them out of these market opportunities.\n  The key tool in lowering these tariffs and opening up markets is \nsubstantial bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. In this way, \nwe can better pursue these agreements by giving the President trade \npromotion authority.\n  Yet while we give him trade promotion authority, it is clear we \nshould not do that without making sure that certain objectives are met \nfor protection of labor and the environment. That is why the Baucus-\nGrassley language makes clear to the President for the first time that \nthe relaxation of environmental labor laws to provide a competitive \nadvantage are absolutely unacceptable. By using the Jordan free trade \nlanguage as a model, the Baucus-Grassley language made stronger by our \npassage of the Lieberman amendment, that I supported earlier last year, \nensures that environmental and labor protections will be principal \ncomponents for future trade relationships.\n  Also, the TPA bill, as amended, is absolutely clear that our domestic \nlaws are not to be weakened in future trade agreements.\n  As we open markets and help provide training to our workforce, we \nneed to make sure that countries do not unfairly subsidize industries \nor dump their products in our market. Again, the amendment offered by \nSenators Dayton and Craig which passed, and which I supported, included \nextra protections for trade safeguards that ensure that our companies \nand farmers are protected.\n\n  While we have looked as these trade agreements, there is one very \nimportant aspect of this bill I want to point out: The area of trade \npromotion authority. Before I get to that, I will talk about the fact \nthat there is a misconception: if we do not do trade promotion \nauthority or trade agreement, somehow we will stop the reduction in \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  It is clear we have seen a reduction in manufacturing jobs in our \ncountry and in other countries. But we have not seen a reduction in \nmanufacturing output. What that really means is we have just gotten \nmore efficient and effective at producing products, which means the \nworkforce employed in these areas has been replaced by more productive \nefforts, which means we need to think about how we are retraining and \nreskilling our workforce for the future.\n\n[[Page S4762]]\n\n  In the last 3 years, over 70 firms and 15,000 workers in Washington \nwere displaced by trade activities and qualify for TAA benefits. \nWashington has probably been one of the highest States in the country \nqualifying for benefits under the trade promotion package. But this \nhistoric package goes further. I applaud my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle for supporting what I think is a great economic \ndevelopment strategy for our future: Investment in the human workforce \nin our country.\n  This legislation will provide assistance to dislocated workers in \nseveral ways. The bill more than doubles our financial commitment to \nTAA programs, which is a very needed boost. The bill recognizes that to \nhelp workers, you have to help communities overall. It takes steps to \nexpand trade promotion authority to a broader group of people. It \nexpands the duration of the benefits from 52 weeks to 78 weeks and \nallows recipients to complete their training. And the trade promotion \nauthority helps secondary workers who are also impacted by these job \nlayoffs.\n  GAO published an initial report that shows that TAA recipients who \ncompleted training entered new jobs 15 percent more often than those \nwho did not receive training, and that those who received training, on \naverage, their wage was almost $2 more than their counterparts who did \nnot get the training.\n  We are seeing that this is an effective benefit. An effective \ninvestment, a trade bill that will help open up markets overseas, \nprovide U.S. products, and yet legislation that will also help workers \nwhose jobs are lost because of trade activities and allow them to \nbecome more productive in the future by being retrained.\n  The global market provides tremendous potential for our country's \nfuture. I am glad my colleagues have had such a spirited debate on this \nissue. We need to do more.\n\n  As my State shows, more and more businesses will be seeking their \neconomic vitality by and through these international markets. So we \nneed to work harder here to make sure we give the power to the \nPresident, and to these companies, to make sure their products get fair \ntreatment.\n  This package goes a long way toward accomplishing these goals. I look \nforward to working with Senators Baucus and Grassley to help prepare \nour economy for the 21st century by making sure U.S. products have fair \naccess to international markets.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3459\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3459, which is at \nthe desk, cosponsored by Senators Mikulski, Wellstone, and Kennedy, and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment? Without objection, the Senator's amendment is pending.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment I have now offered has to do \nwith the issue of child labor in world trade. I would like to speak for \na while because, among all the things we have talked about regarding \ntrade and what we are promoting, I believe one of the most important \nelements, in terms of moving ahead in the world economic order that is \ngoing to break down barriers of trade, one of the most important facets \nis how we address the issue of child labor.\n  Increased world trade should not be an end in itself. It must also be \na means of achieving more economic fairness, social justice, and broad-\nbased sustainable development throughout the global economy. \nAccordingly, as we debate this trade bill, this Senate faces a critical \ntest of our nation's moral resolve as well as our economic leadership.\n  The practical challenge before us is to help fashion enforceable \nrules for a new global economy. It must be a global economy that \nrewards working families in America and abroad as much as it benefits \ntransnational corporations, investors, and consumers.\n  I have long supported policies to open foreign markets to our \nnation's exports through new trade agreements and through combating \nunfair trade practices. I believe that new trade agreements--on the \nright terms--offer many new opportunities for our nation's economy to \ngrow and thrive.\n  I hope I am also a realist. Global economic integration is proceeding \nat an accelerating pace, fueled by private sector forces beyond the \ncontrol of any national government. But markets are not self-\nactualizing and they certainly do not concern themselves with fairness \nor equity, left to themselves. Therefore, the real role of government \nat all levels now is to help define the terms on which globalization \nwill proceed.\n  This trade debate is not about free trade versus protectionism. Those \nare empty labels that cloud our real choices.\n  And we all know that there are winners and losers every time our \ncountry enters into a new trade agreement. Our task is to make certain \nthat the terms of every new trade agreement maximize the winners and \nminimize the losers.\n  Some argue that the losers in international trade are just those \ncaught in the whirling winds of globalization--victims of the magic of \nthe marketplace who must fend for themselves. It is not that simple and \nits not accidental. We choose who and what we protect. For example, the \nWTO currently spells out enforceable rules on capital subsidies and \nproduct dumping to promote fair competition in international trade, but \nWTO rules don't do the same for child labor. When it comes to \nabusive child labor, anything goes. Binding international agreements \nand U.S. trade laws rigorously protect intellectual property rights \nnow, but not internationally recognized worker rights such as stopping \nthe worst forms of child labor. We protect CDs, endangered plants, and \nspotted turtles, but not children who are brutally and systematically \nexploited in the global workplace.\n\n  And so today, I say it's time that trade agreements extended their \nprotection to those who need it most--the exploited child laborers who \nhelp make and process many products were consume every day.\n  According to the best estimates released 10 days ago by the \nInternational Labor Organization, there are at least 352 million child \nlaborers between the ages of 5 and 17 who are engaged in today's global \neconomy.\n  At least 246 million of these powerless working children are involved \nin abusive child labor which the business, trade union, and government \nofficials in the ILO agree should be abolished. Think about that--at \nleast 246 million child laborers who have never seen the inside of a \nclassroom. As many as 60 million of them are engaged in the worst forms \nof child labor. They are often killed or maimed for life. They are \nrobbed of their childhood and denied any hope for a brighter future.\n  To put this in perspective, imagine a country as populous as the \nUnited States and Mexico combined in which the entire population is \nmade up of child laborers. Within that population would be an \nunderclass of children roughly equal to all of the people living in \nGermany, France, Great Britain, and Spain combined who work in \nconditions that cripple their bodies and minds, stunt their growth, \ndeny them access to basic education, and shorten their impoverished \nlives.\n  Now I suspect some of my colleagues are going to argue today that \nchild labor has nothing to do with international trade. But they are \ndead wrong.\n  I want to show my colleagues some of the faces of these child \nlaborers associated with various tainted manufactured products and \nother goods flowing freely in international trade as we speak here \ntoday.\n  I would like to tell you a little something about their working \nconditions. On the first chart here is Silgi. Silgi was 3 when this \npicture was taken. She started knotting soccer balls to help her mother \nand four sisters make 75 cents a day. Her mother and four sisters and \nher altogether make 75 cents a day knotting these soccer balls, which \nour kids use on the soccer fields in America.\n  This is Tariq. Tariq is a 12-year-old Pakistani boy. He stitches \nthese leather pieces together to make soccer balls. Pakistan produces 5 \nmillion soccer balls a year, just for the U.S. market. Tariq earns 60 \ncents a day making these soccer balls. As you can see, they have the \nnice swoosh on them there. You know they are not using these in \nPakistan. This is what our kids are\n\n[[Page S4763]]\n\nplaying with on those soccer fields every Saturday when we take them \ndown to play. Think about it. Think about it the next time your kid \nkicks that soccer ball. Think about Tariq, 12 years old, making 60 \ncents a day. He is not in school. He is not learning anything. These \nsoccer balls, obviously, go into international trade.\n  This is a photo of a sign. Three years ago, in early 1999, I took a \ntrip to Southeast Asia to look at the issue of child labor. I was in \nKatmandu, in Nepal, when a former child laborer sought me out. I knew \nof him through other contacts. I had never met him before. I met him \nafter dark on a Sunday night. He had arranged to visit a clandestine \nplace where they make carpets. He knew the guard at the gate. He also \nknew, he thought, that the owner was gone. So we drove down there.\n  As we came up to the gate, here was the sign posted outside of this \ngate. It says in Nepalese but also in English:\n\n       Child labor under the age of 14 is strictly prohibited.\n\n  This is not a doctored document. I took this picture. I took this \npicture with my own hands before we went in.\n  As we went through a gate and down a dark alley, we took a left and \nthere was this building. All the windows were blacked out. We walked in \nthe door and this is what we saw. Children as young as 7, 8 years of \nage, sitting at these looms knotting these carpets. Again, to show you \nit is real, that is me. I was there. My assistant took this picture. \nThey didn't know we were coming.\n  In the past, anybody who would go in there to inspect it would give \nthem advance notice. They had a way of getting all of these kids out \nthe back door and scattered around in a compound so you wouldn't see \nall those kids working.\n  This is on a Sunday night after dark with kids as young as 8 years of \nage sitting in a row. It is dark back here. But there are dozens and \ndozens of these kids along both sides up and down these rows working on \nthese looms. It is dusty. All of that carpet dust comes out. That is \nwhat these kids breathe.\n  Again, don't tell me this isn't happening. I was there. I saw it \nfirsthand.\n  These are two Nepalese girls I spoke to through an interpreter. They \nwere very cautious about speaking with me. They had probably never laid \neyes on an Anglo before. They were sitting there knitting carpet. I \ntried to determine their age. As best I could determine, they were \nunder 12 years of age. But I really couldn't determine exactly what \ntheir age was.\n  All I can tell you is that at about this time the owner showed up. I \nwas told the owner wasn't there. There was a big commotion going on. \nThe owner came in. Of course, he was extremely upset we were on his \npremises and ordered us to leave, which we did, but not until I had the \ndocumentation that this was happening.\n  The next day--I don't have pictures--I went to a carpet manufacturer \nin the same city, Katmandu. There is a carpet manufacturer that adheres \nto the Rugmark label. They don't employ any child labor--none \nwhatsoever. They certify it with a little rug mark. These rugs also go \ninto international commerce. Here is one plant in Katmandu that does \nnot hire child labor. They are making moneymaking carpets for \ninternational trade.\n  Probably 5 miles away is a place such as this. There are dozens of \nthese around making carpeting with these kids for international \ncommerce, and they are also competing with the carpets made by a \nlegitimate a manufacturer who does not employ child labor.\n  This is Amir. Amir is second from the left. He is age 8. He quit \nschool in the third grade and spends his days sitting on a concrete \nfloor sharpening surgical scissors. These are surgical scissors and \nsurgical knives. This is in Pakistan. Amir is 8 years old. He earns $2 \na week. All day long, they breathe in this metal dust from sharpening \nthese scissors.\n  Mr. President, I hope neither you nor anyone else listening to my \nremarks has occasion to go into a surgical room. If you do, think about \nthe scissors and the knives the surgeon will use that were made by \nAmir, 8 years of age. Don't tell me this doesn't have something to do \nwith international commerce.\n  This is 7-year-old Sonu. Sonu lives in Jullundur, India. He cuts \nyellow-dyed chicken feathers for badminton shuttlecocks. That is what \nhe does 7 days a week.\n  There is a cover story in a Hong Kong newspaper about some Chinese \ngirls just across the border who are making toys for McDonald's. Again, \nit goes into international commerce. The amount of money they earn in 1 \nday is about enough for them to buy a Happy Meal for 1 day.\n  I want to add this. I want to be fair to McDonald's. When McDonald's \nfound this out, they took action to stop it. I commend McDonald's for \nat least taking action to stop it.\n  My point is that without vigorous enforcement and oversight, that is \nwhat happens in international commerce. If it had not been for someone \nbreaking into that factory and taking these pictures, MacDonald's might \nnot have known about it either.\n\n  This is a rather busy chart. This shows how child slaves--make no \nmistake about it, they are slaves, bought and sold. They are used in \nthe cocoa and chocolate industry.\n  Last year, Knight Ridder newspapers in a series of articles exposed \nchild slavery on west African cocoa farms. This is the cocoa that young \nslaves harvest and produce. It goes to Europe. It goes into the \nPhiladelphia area. Fifty percent of all the cocoa entering the United \nStates is unloaded in Philadelphia. Chocolate is made using this Ivory \nCoast cocoa harvested by child slaves.\n  Because of this, and because of what is happening globally with the \nuse of child labor in international commerce, I am offering this \namendment to make ending the worst forms of child labor a principal \nnegotiating objective as nearly on a par as possible with the principal \nnegotiating objective in this bill on protecting intellectual property \nrights.\n  It is often said, if you can protect the CD, you ought to be able to \nprotect the child. If you are going to protect the song, how about \nprotecting the kid?\n  I know Chairman Baucus and other members of the Finance Committee \nshare my concerns about abusive child labor. There was some reference \nin the language in this bill, but I think we can and should do better.\n  Before explaining my amendment in greater detail, I want to make \nclear what constitutes the worst forms of child labor. We are not \ntalking about children who work part time after school or on weekends \nin the corner grocery store. It is not, for example, kids helping with \nthe chores on a family farm. There is nothing wrong with that. I worked \nin my youth. All of us did when we were young people. We worked. That \nis not the issue we are addressing.\n  This amendment is focused on the use of the worst forms of child \nlabor in the production of tainted goods that flow in the international \ntrading system today and which we import in the American marketplace. \nLet me cite a few examples of these products and where they come from, \naccording to the U.S. Department of Labor.\n  We import more than $250 million worth of hand-knotted oriental rugs \nevery year from India, Nepal, and Pakistan, produced by as many as 1 \nmillion child laborers, many of whom are kidnapped and enslaved, \nbonded, or indentured.\n  As I said, if you are ever wheeled into surgery, remember that many \nof the surgical knives and scissors are finished by thousands of child \nlaborers in Pakistan--these pictures I just showed you. If any Member \nwishes, I can give you the names of the U.S. medical supply companies \nthat freely import this surgical equipment.\n  Fortunately, there is now a universal definition of what constitutes \nthe worst forms of child labor.\n  You may ask, What do you mean by the worst forms? We know. They are \nspelled out in ILO Convention No. 182, which was adopted unanimously in \n1999, the first time ever. It was ultimately ratified at a record-\nsetting pace by 117 trading nations, including, I am proud to say, the \nUnited States. In fact, the United States was the third country to \nratify ILO Convention No. 182. It was a resolution offered by Senator \nHelms and myself.\n  In November of 1999, it was adopted by the Senate on a 96-to-0 vote. \nThe United States is now on record as ratifying and abiding by ILO \nConvention 182.\n  When we talk about the worst forms of child labor, what are we \ntalking about?\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\n  We are talking about child slavery, child bondage, the use of \nchildren in pornography, much of which enters this country, trafficking \nin children, buying and selling of kids, the recruitment of children in \nthe production or sale of narcotics, and hazardous work by children \nwhere they are breathing metal dust or making glass in India in very \nhigh temperatures. That is what we are talking about.\n  That is what is in ILO Convention 182. That is the worst form of \nchild labor.\n  We are not talking about kids working part time or on weekends. It is \nslavery, it is bondage, it is pornography, and it is hazardous types of \nwork.\n  Combatting abusive child labor and linking respect for other \ninternationally recognized worker rights to the conduct of \ninternational trade is not new. At various times during the 20th \ncentury, numerous international agreements and U.S. policy have \nexplicitly recognized that fair labor standards are necessary for the \nworking of a fair trading system.\n  More to the point, I call to the attention of my colleagues article \nXX of the original GATT. Article XX was brought forward in the 1994 \nGATT deliberations. It was incorporated in the current operating rules \nof the World Trade Organization, the WTO.\n  This article spells out 10 different exceptions whereby WTO member \ncountries may enact national laws without being in violation of \nexisting WTO or GATT requirements and international trade rules.\n  This is what it says, article XX (a) and (b):\n\n       Subject to the requirements that such measures are not \n     applied in a manner which would constitute a means of \n     arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries \n     where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction \n     on international trade, nothing in this Agreement shall be \n     construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any \n     contracting party of measures:\n       (a) necessary to protect public morals;\n       (b) necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or \n     health.\n\n  Article XX: to protect human health and life, protect public morals.\n  Those are exceptions that countries may adopt and not be in violation \nof WTO.\n  At this time, and in this new era of globalization, we have the \nwherewithal to end the use of abused child labor in the production of \ngoods for international trade. The only questions are whether we have \nthe political will and whether America will lead the way.\n  More than 50 years after its adoption, article XX remains untested. \nThere has been no trade jurisprudence to flush out its practical \nmeaning or scope.\n  So I ask my colleagues, what better place to start than for this \nCongress to require U.S. trade negotiators to make it a principal \nnegotiating objective to secure an effective international ban on trade \nin goods produced by defenseless children under 18 who are trapped in \nthe worst forms of child labor?\n  We can do that by adopting this amendment, to make ending the use of \nthe worst forms of child labor in international trade a principal \npriority for our negotiators. It is entirely in keeping with what \nPresident Bush said last year at the Western Hemisphere Trade Summit in \nQuebec. This is what President Bush said last year:\n\n       Our commitment to open trade must be matched by a strong \n     commitment to protecting our environment and improving labor \n     standards.\n\n  What could be more important than protecting children?\n  Using international trade agreements to combat abusive child labor is \ngood international development policy. Abusive child labor perpetuates \nthe cycle of poverty across generations. It is both a cause and an \neffect to the grinding poverty in today's global economy.\n  Much of this should be self-evident. No nation has ever achieved \nbroad-based economic prosperity on the backs of working children, and \nno such nation should be allowed to try according to any standard of \nfair international trade and competition.\n  Ending the use of abusive child labor, especially in the conduct of \ninternational trade, is not morally disguised protectionism. In fact, \npublic support for continued trade liberalization will be enhanced by \neliminating trade in products made with the worst forms of child labor.\n\n  Listen to the words of Ambassador Bill Brock, U.S. Trade \nRepresentative and Labor Secretary in the Reagan administration. This \nis what former Ambassador Brock said. I am not going to read the whole \nthing:\n\n       Those countries which are flooding world markets with goods \n     made by children . . . are doing more harm to the principle \n     of free and fair trade than any protectionist groups I can \n     think of.\n\n  I could not have said it better. No one could say it better. What \nAmbassador Bill Brock said is absolutely right: Those countries \nflooding the world markets with goods made by these kids are doing more \nharm to the principle of free and fair trade than any protectionist \ngroups of which I can think.\n  This amendment is needed because we have this widespread use of the \nworst forms of child labor in products flowing throughout the \ninternational trading system.\n  First, as reported, this bill does not include the prohibition of the \nworst forms of child labor in the proposed definition of core labor \nstandards. That is why I think this amendment is so necessary. The \nbill, as reported, does speak to it but does not include the \nprohibition of the worst forms of child labor.\n  It does not assign a high enough priority and visibility among U.S. \ntrade policy objectives to deter the worst forms of child labor.\n  Secondly, the bill calls for ``promoting respect for worker rights \nand the rights of children consistent with core labor standards of the \nILO'' as one of the eight overall trade negotiating objectives. That is \ndecidedly weaker than what this amendment would do to make it a \nprincipal negotiating objective of the U.S., ``ensuring that any \nmultilateral or bilateral trade agreement that is entered into by the \nU.S. includes provisions obligating all parties to such agreements to \nenact and enforce national laws and to meet their international legal \nobligations to prevent the use of the worst forms of child labor.''\n  That is what is in the amendment.\n  Third, the bill before us makes intellectual property rights one of \n14 principal U.S. negotiating objectives and, as such, calls for \n``providing strong enforcement of intellectual property rights, \nincluding through accessible, expeditious, and effective civil, \nadministrative, and criminal enforcement mechanisms.''\n  That is pretty clear and specific.\n  The amendment we have before us calls for the same clarity of \npurpose, resolve, and range of enforcement mechanisms with regard to \npreventing the use of the worst forms of child labor in international \ntrade.\n  Quite simply, this amendment will ensure that the President has the \nauthority and backing of the Congress to negotiate to end the worst \nforms of child labor in international trade on a par, as nearly as \npossible, with the President's authority to negotiate and protect \nintellectual property rights.\n  In conclusion, this amendment does not dictate a predetermined \noutcome on how best to negotiate enforceable means. It does not tie the \nhands of our trade negotiators in any fashion. But it does make it \ncrystal clear that one, among several, of our 15 principal trade \nnegotiating objectives will be the enactment and effective enforcement \nof national laws by other countries and compliance with their \ninternational legal obligations to eliminate the use of the worst forms \nof child labor in international trade.\n\n  A few days ago, I met in my office with several former child laborers \nfrom around the world. They were on their way to New York City with \nKailash Satyarthi, leader of the Global March Against Child Labor, and \none of the great heroes in the world today for getting kids out of the \nworst forms of child labor.\n  Kailash brought these kids from around the world to take them to the \nUnited Nations for the first ever General Assembly Special Session on \nChildren.\n  I talked to one little boy in my office who had been branded on his \nface and his arms because he had been drinking a little bit of leftover \nmilk. He came all the way from New Delhi to add his voice to a growing \nchildren's chorus in New York and from around the world, pleading for \nus adult policymakers ``to create a world fit for children.''\n  So for Ashraf, a young boy who escaped enslavement and was in my \noffice, and for tens of millions of other\n\n[[Page S4765]]\n\nchildren still trapped in the worst forms of child labor, let's use our \nleverage, the power of our Government, our moral leadership, and \nrequire that U.S. negotiators do their part. They should bring back to \nthis Congress enforceable trade agreements that outlaw and end this \nsordid, dirty dimension of international trade once and for all.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, my staff, the staff of Senator Baucus, the staff of \nSenator Grassley, along with people in the administration, have been \nworking for the last few days to work out an agreement. We agreed to \nmake some changes on our side, but still to keep the essence of this \namendment alive, to make it one of the primary negotiating objectives--\none of the primary negotiating objectives--and that is still in the \namendment. So we have modified it and, as such, we have reached an \nagreement with Senator Baucus and with Senator Grassley.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3459, As Modified\n\n  So I have talked with managers of this bill on both sides, and I now \nask unanimous consent to modify the amendment with the changes that I \nhave sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 2102(b), insert the following:\n       (15) Worst forms of child labor.--The principal negotiating \n     objectives of the United States regarding the trade-related \n     aspects of the worst forms of child labor are--\n       (A) to prevent distortions in the conduct of international \n     trade caused by the use of the worst forms of child labor, in \n     whole or in part, in the production of goods for export in \n     international commerce; and\n       (B) to redress unfair and illegitimate competition based \n     upon the use of the worst forms of child labor, in whole or \n     in part, in the production of goods for export in \n     international commerce, including through--\n       (i) promoting universal ratification and full compliance by \n     all trading nations with ILO Convention No. 182 Concerning \n     the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of \n     the Worst Forms of Child Labor, particularly with respect to \n     meeting enforcement obligations under that Convention and \n     related international agreements;\n       (ii) pursuing action under Article XX of GATT 1994 to allow \n     WTO members to restrict imports of goods found to be produced \n     with the worst forms of child labor;\n       (iii) seeking commitments by parties to any multilateral or \n     bilateral trade agreement that is entered into by the United \n     States to ensure that national laws reflect international \n     standards regarding prevention of the use of the worst forms \n     of child labor, especially in the conduct of international \n     trade; and\n       (iv) seeking commitments by trade agreement parties to \n     vigorously enforce laws prohibiting the use of the worst \n     forms of child labor, especially in the conduct of \n     international trade, through accessible, expeditious, and \n     effective civil, administrative, and criminal enforcement \n     mechanisms.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is my understanding from the managers that both sides \nwill agree to my amendment as modified. I thank both Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley, my colleague from Iowa, and their respective staffs \nfor working with my staff. I know it took a lot of time. I know these \nthings are sometimes hard to work out and think about--the meanings of \nwords, phrases, and their impact. I thank them for working this out in \na manner that preserves the essence of this amendment, which is, make \nit one of our primary negotiating objectives; that the President of the \nUnited States seek to ensure that countries with whom we have trade not \nonly abide by their own labor laws but abide by ILO convention 182 to \nprohibit, to put an end to the worst forms of child labor in \ninternational trade.\n  I have been working on this issue for 10 years. I first introduced a \nbill in 1992. For me, today, to have this accepted by the managers to \nput into the fast-track bill represents a giant step forward. We made \nthe first step a couple years ago when the Senate voted 96 to 0 to \nratify ILO convention 182. Now this puts some teeth into it. This says \nthat from now on when we negotiate trade agreements, this will be one \nof our primary negotiating objectives.\n  The next step, I hope, is for the conference to make sure they keep \nthis language. The House does not have it. I hope our Senate \nnegotiators can keep this language. It is vitally important. It has \nwidespread support in this Chamber on both sides of the aisle. I know \nit has widespread support among the American people. It has widespread \nsupport among our trading partners in other parts of the world.\n  Now is the time for the United States to take that leadership. I hope \nand pray and trust that when this goes to conference, we will keep this \nprovision that is so vital to ensuring that we have not only a free \ntrading system in the future but a trading system that does not \nperpetuate this cycle of poverty and of ignorance throughout the globe \nbecause so many countries are using abusive child labor to make these \nproducts.\n  Hopefully, they will come back from conference and we will have that. \nI look forward to the day when a new trade bill comes before the Senate \nfor us to ratify and in that trade bill are steps that are being taken, \nagreements that have been made to end abusive child labor in \ninternational trade. That will be the day when we can tell all these \nchildren I have shown in all the pictures that they do have a brighter \nfuture, that they will be able to go to school and learn and not be \ncaught in this cycle of poverty and repression, bondage, slavery, \nchildhood prostitution, and childhood pornography into which they are \nnow trapped.\n  I thank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley and their staffs for \nworking this out. I encourage them to do everything they can to hold \nthis in conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Harkin for working \nclosely with us over a long period of time to reach agreement on exact \nlanguage. He has spoken as to how difficult that was and how hard \neverybody worked. I won't repeat any of that. I associate myself with \nthat part of Senator Harkin's remarks.\n  I support this amendment. For Senator Baucus and I, as managers of \nthe legislation, were glad to have it go through in this fashion.\n  When discussing trade and particularly this trade promotion authority \nbill, it is important to put the issue of child labor in the proper \ncontext. What I want to say as the bottom line, before I say everything \nabove the bottom line, is that trade is the instrument to improve the \neconomy of countries because economies that are not in poverty do not \nhave child labor problems that countries in poverty do have.\n  I will discuss this from two standpoints: One, how the bill was \ncrafted even prior to Senator Harkin's amendment to deal with the \nissues of child labor, and also what we are doing as Government and the \npeople of the United States to help in other ways on the issue of child \nlabor.\n  First, I will address what the United States has done with respect to \ninternationally recognized working rights. Our country is not a \nnewcomer to this arena. We have formally recognized core labor \nstandards, including workers' rights, in our statutes since 1984. Many \nof the core labor standards that we recognize are similar or identical \nto those of the International Labor Organization.\n  In addition, the United States has consistently been on the front \nlines in fighting for internationally recognized workers' rights. We \nhave also fought the problem of child labor around the globe, and we \nhave done it quite effectively over the years.\n  I have consistently supported and encouraged these efforts because \nalthough these efforts have not been on the front pages of the \nnewspaper, they do have a track record. We know that these efforts \nwork.\n  Most of what we as a country do internationally is part of what I \ncall a positive agenda for workers' rights and for the elimination of \nchild labor. It has little or nothing to do with trade. The United \nStates is the single largest donor to the International Labor \nOrganizations's premier program for addressing the child labor problem, \nknown as the International Program for Eradication of Child Labor. This \nprogram does a lot of heavy lifting and gets things done.\n  For example, the Program for Eradication of Child Labor works \neffectively with local nongovernmental organizations. This Program for \nEradication of Child Labor helps to ensure that when children are found \nworking in conditions where they are being exploited\n\n[[Page S4766]]\n\nand are taken from work, they are put into schools. It helps provide \nfunds to poor parents so that when their children are taken from work, \nthe family does not starve.\n  We do many other things as part of this ``positive agenda.'' The \nUnited States helps fund School Lunch Programs worldwide. Something as \nsimple as providing a school lunch to a poor child in a developing \ncountry is one of the most effective things we can do to combat child \nlabor because it helps supplement a poor family's income.\n  The United States is also actively engaged in labor law enforcement \naround the world. We provide technical assistance to help countries \nchange their laws so that they can be more effective in combating child \nlabor. We help train the inspectors in foreign countries who go out and \ninvestigate these child labor violations.\n  In addition, the U.S. Government is a signatory to the International \nLabor Organization Convention 182 on the worst forms of child labor \nsuch as slavery, bondage, enforced labor, child prostitution, and \nworking in dangerous conditions.\n  Clearly, then, trade and openness is not the problem for poor \ncountries. Rather, it is as simple as too little trade and not enough \nopenness, particularly openness of their economy.\n  The International Labor Organization Convention on the worst forms of \nchild labor is extremely significant for other reasons. It admits that \nthe overwhelming cause of child prostitution, child slavery, and forced \nlabor is, in fact, poverty.\n  This is where trade and open economies can and do make a huge \ndifference in the lives of people. Over the past 20 years, \nglobalization has been a great force for good in reducing poverty. It \nhas sparked a dramatic rise in living standards in many countries \nacross the world. Millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. \nThere is overwhelming evidence that trade boosts economic growth.\n  A famous Harvard University study by Professor Jeffrey Sachs and \nAndrew Warner found that developing countries with open economies grew \n4.5 percent a year, while developing countries with closed borders grew \na paltry seven-tenths of 1 percent. So it is 4.5-percent growth for \ncountries with open economies to less than 1 percent--seven-tenths of 1 \npercent--a year for countries with closed economies. That is simple, \ncommon sense. Open the economies of poor countries and they will grow \neconomically and they can lift themselves out of poverty.\n  At that rate, open economies double in size every 16 years, while \nclosed ones can only reach that goal in 100 years. Again, 16 years \ndoubling for an open economy, 100 years for doubling the economy of a \nclosed economy.\n  The rapid growth of developing countries that embrace free trade \nalways leads to a rapid decrease in child labor. A 1998 World Bank \nreport shows that once per capita GDP hits $500 per year--just $500 per \nyear--the incidence of child labor falls dramatically. Clearly, then, \npromoting trade, freedom, and openness is one of the single most \nimportant things we can do to end child labor around the world.\n  It is not the only solution, though, and I don't pretend that it is. \nBut trade and open markets are a key part of any solution to ending \npoverty and eradicating child labor.\n  The only way we can promote and lead the effort to open world markets \nis if the President of the United States has the authority to negotiate \ncredibly with other countries at the bargaining table. That is what \ntrade promotion authority is all about.\n  History has shown time and again that if the United States does not \nlead in the effort to open markets and tear down job-killing trade \nbarriers, the gains we made in the past can be lost.\n  Finally, I want to point out that the core labor standards dealing \nwith the worst forms of child labor that we are addressing in this \namendment by Senator Harkin are embedded in the same core labor \nstandards that the United States has recognized and has promoted in our \nlaw since 1984.\n  So I commend my colleague from Iowa for making positive contributions \nto this debate. When it comes to child labor and workers' rights, this \nmodified amendment and this total trade promotion authority bill does \nthe right thing.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to do the right thing again and pass it \nwith the overwhelming bipartisan vote as we did coming out of the \nFinance Committee, 18 to 3.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? \nWithout objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3459), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the pending \nlegislation to provide fast-track authority to the President. This is \nnot the first time I have risen on this floor in order to urge \ncolleagues to join in opposing this authority. The same issue was \nbefore us in 1997. At that time, the administration's request was \nrejected.\n  At this time, we are once again being asked to approve the same \nprocedure, but it is being presented under a different name. It has \nbeen wrapped up in a different package. It is now being called ``trade \npromotion authority.'' In fact, that term is a euphemism--indeed, a \nmisleading euphemism. The President already has broad and flexible \nauthority to promote trade in numerous different ways, under a number \nof existing statutes.\n  The issue here is the latitude the Executive has to negotiate trade \nagreements and the role the Congress will play with respect to such \nagreements. I think that is more aptly described as fast-track \nauthority, and that is the specific matter I want to address for a few \nmoments.\n  Fast track is a procedure that radically redefines and limits the \nauthority granted to Congress in article II, section 8 of the \nConstitution ``to regulate commerce with foreign nations.'' We need to \nrecognize that here today. This is a vast derogation of congressional \nauthority. It has only a brief history. It was first enacted in 1974, \nit expired just twenty years later, in 1994, and in my view its long-\nterm ramifications are as yet little understood.\n  Fast-track authority differs fundamentally from the earlier \ndiscretion the Congress granted to the Executive in the Reciprocal \nTrade Act of 1934, which governed trade negotiations for 40 years. That \ndiscretion, known as proclamation authority, gave power to the \nExecutive to set tariffs within limits and periods of time that had \nbeen set by the Congress. In other words, the Congress defined the \nparameters of Executive authority in trade negotiations, and the \nExecutive had to work within those parameters in using the proclamation \nauthority. It did not give to the President authority to negotiate \ntrade agreements requiring changes in U.S. law, let alone limit the \ndiscretion of the Congress to approve or reject such changes.\n  In contrast, fast-track authority gives the President both the power \nto negotiate trade agreements requiring changes in existing U.S. law, \nand effectively denies to the Congress the power to approve or reject \nchanges to U.S. law on their merits, leaving it only with a ``yes'' or \n``no'' vote on the entire trade package.\n  Fast-track authority, therefore, greatly expands the latitude of the \nExecutive to negotiate an agreement while eliminating the ability of \nthe Congress to consider components of the trade agreement. Fast track \nguarantees that the executive branch can write legislation implementing \na trade agreement and have that legislation voted on, up or down, \nwithin 90 days of its submission to Congress, with only 20 hours of \ndebate and with no opportunity for amendment.\n  Let me repeat that. Fast-track authority gives the executive branch \nthe power to write legislation implementing a trade agreement, to have \nthat legislation voted on, up or down, within 90 days of its submission \nto the Congress, with only 20 hours of debate and with no opportunity \nfor amendments by the Congress.\n  Even when vast changes in existing U.S. law may be at stake, under \nfast-track procedures, Congress has only all-or-nothing decision-making \nauthority.\n\n[[Page S4767]]\n\n  This is a sobering derogation of the congressional power set out in \narticle I, section 8 of the Constitution, which explicitly gives to the \nCongress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations.\n  In no other area of U.S. international negotiation and agreement do \nfast-track provisions prevail. All major U.S. tax treaties, arms \ncontrol, territorial, defense, and other treaties are still \naccomplished through established constitutional procedures fully \nrespecting the role of the Congress and the ability of the Congress, if \nit chooses, to make the determination to change or amend those \nagreements.\n  SALT I, SALT II, START, the nuclear weapons reduction treaties, the \nAtmospheric Test Ban Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention, the \nCustoms Harmonization Convention, the Montreal Protocol, dozens of \ninternational treaties, to mention only some--all these are among the \ninternational agreements negotiated by the United States without fast-\ntrack authority.\n  Proponents of fast track often argue that in the area of trade, the \nExecutive will find it difficult, if not impossible, to negotiate \nagreements without fast-track authority, but a look at the record amply \ndemonstrates this is not the case.\n  First, fast-track procedures are relevant only to trade agreements \nthat require Congress to make changes in existing U.S. law in order for \nthe agreements to be implemented. Most trade agreements do not require \nlegislative changes and thus do not come within the purview of this \nprovision.\n  Of the hundreds of trade agreements entered into between 1974 and \n1994 when fast-track authority was in effect, only five have required \nfast-track procedures.\n  In 1994, after just 20 years, fast track elapsed. This is the only \ntime period in the nation's history when we have had fast track, the \nonly time we effectively shut Congress out of the process of thoroughly \nconsidering trade agreements.\n  In 1997 the Congress declined to extend it, and yet since 1994 \nhundreds of trade agreements were successfully negotiated and \nimplemented. For example, in the year 2000, the Office of the U.S. \nTrade Representative identified the following agreements, all of them \nnegotiated without fast track, as having truly historic importance: The \nInformation Technology Agreement, under which 40 countries eliminated \nimport duties and other charges on information technology products \nrepresenting more than 90 percent of the telecommunications market; the \nFinancial Services Agreement, which has helped U.S. service suppliers \nexpand commercial operations and find new market opportunities around \nthe world; the Basic Telecommunications Agreement, which opened up 95 \npercent of the world telecommunications market to competition; and the \nbilateral agreement on China's WTO accession, which opened this large \neconomy to American products and services. I could cite many other \nexamples.\n  During this twenty-year period when there was no fast-track \nauthority--although we are being told that without it trade agreements \ncannot be negotiated, whereas the record shows this is clearly not the \ncase--the Executive negotiated and then obtained congressional approval \nfor normalizing our trade relations with a new Caribbean Basin \ninitiative bill and with the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. Without \nany fast-track authority, the previous administration negotiated major \nbilateral trade agreements with Jordan and Vietnam. The groundbreaking \nUnited States-Jordan agreement was submitted to and approved by \nCongress in January of last year, and although negotiated by the \nprevious administration, the United States-Vietnam agreement was \nactually submitted to Congress by the current administration and was \napproved in June of last year. So recent efforts to arrive at trade \nagreements without fast-track authority have been notably successful.\n\n  The abundant experience of the last 8 years leads to the conclusion \nthat the arguments for fast track are much overstated. Current \nnegotiations on bilateral free trade agreements with Chile and \nSingapore offer yet another case in point since the administration has \nfound it possible and prudent to carry forward negotiations initiated \nby its predecessor.\n  The case of Chile is particularly instructive. In 1994, Chile \ndeclined an invitation to join NAFTA, citing the administration's \nfailure to obtain fast-track authority. Six years later, however, Chile \nreconsidered its position and in 2000 entered into negotiations on a \nUnited States-Chile bilateral agreement.\n  Negotiations have continued since then more or less on a monthly \nbasis, and in a report dated April 1 of last year entitled ``Chile \nPolitical and Economic Conditions in U.S. Relations,'' the CRS \nconcluded that Chile is willing and able to conclude and live up to a \nbroad bilateral FTA with the United States, suggesting this could be a \ncomparatively easy trade agreement for the U.S. to conclude.\n  The absence of fast track has not prevented negotiations with Chile \nor with Singapore. Yet we are now being asked to have the procedure \napply retroactively without any strong case being made for its \nnecessity.\n  Let me make a final observation. There is now considerable debate and \nconcern around the world about globalization, and we have seen mounting \nlevels of protests, both in this country and abroad. It is clear that \nthe trend towards globalization has raised very fundamental questions \non a range of issues, including labor standards and environmental \nstandards. A real basis for public concern is precisely the sweeping \npower to affect these issues that fast-track authority gives to the \nadministration. There are many other issues, of course, but labor \nstandards and environmental standards are two leading examples. For \ngood reason, the public is apprehensive when important decisions can be \nmade behind closed doors, without adequate open debate and \nconsideration, which is exactly what happens with fast-track authority.\n  One of the most important functions of the Congress is to provide a \nforum in which matters of public concern can be thoroughly and openly \ndiscussed, in which alternatives can be presented and either accepted \nor rejected. The fast-track authority virtually completely undercuts \ncongressional power--something the nation in all its history never \ncountenanced, except during the 20-year period between 1974 and 1994. \nIn effect fast track excludes the people's representatives from \nengaging in a process whereby they can examine the components of a \ntrade agreement.\n  People say: But the Congress may change the trade agreement. So be \nit. That is the risk we run. Congressional scrutiny of arms-control \nagreements has never been restricted by fast-track authority, and \nsurely they are as important as trade agreements.\n  We do not take those on an all-or-nothing basis. They are not \npresented to us for a simple yes-or-no vote. We have the opportunity to \nconsider the various components of the package and to pass some \njudgment upon them. That is one of the most important functions of the \nCongress.\n  Indeed, I think one of the deep concerns of the American people is \nthat trade agreements affecting vital areas of social and economic \npolicy should not be hurried through the Congress using an expedited \nand restrictive procedure. It must be clearly understood that this \nprocedure puts the Congress in the position of being able only to say \nyes or no to the entire package. It denies to the Congress the ability \nto carry out its constitutional responsibilities in terms of regulating \ncommerce with foreign nations. I therefore strongly urge the rejection \nof the fast-track procedure contained in this legislation and intend to \nvote against this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what is the situation with regard to time? \nAre we dividing it? Are we under the normal postcloture that any Member \ncan have an hour? Is that the program?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct; we are following the \nnormal procedure.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I do not know where we go from here in \nterms of procedure. I would like to say a few things. I will try to be \nbrief.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will allow me to make one statement in \nanswer partly to his question, we have set up a queue of speakers, and \nRepublicans certainly have the right to have a speaker\n\n[[Page S4768]]\n\nnow, which would be the Senator from Texas. Following that is Senator \nKennedy. Following Senator Kennedy's statement and if there is a \nRepublican after him, we would start the bioterrorism debate for 90 \nminutes and then we would start voting on this matter.\n  The Senator from Texas asked a question earlier. Under the hour that \nthe Senator has postcloture, how much time does he have, I ask the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 28 minutes \nremaining.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have a bunch of amendments pending, and \nI am against every one of them. Let me outline why.\n  First, this bill is about trade. I am for it. All these amendments \nare against it. We are getting ready to pass this bill, I hope, by 70 \nvotes or so. So if a Senator is for the bill and wants more trade, the \nquickest way to get it in the best form is to vote against these \nantitrade amendments.\n  I am going to address three of them really quickly. First, the \nHollings amendment. I want to remind my colleagues that thanks to the \ngenerosity of the American taxpayer, if someone loses their job because \nof international competition, they get a series of benefits under trade \nadjustment assistance that no other American gets. Anyone who loses \ntheir job, for example, in the textile industry qualifies for trade \nadjustment assistance if they can show or it can be shown that their \njob loss had anything to do with foreign competition; that it was the \nmost significant factor in them losing their job.\n  As a result, textile workers are eligible for trade adjustment \nassistance today. The amendment of Senator Hollings says if someone has \nlost their job in the textile industry anytime over the last 3 and a \nhalf years, or if they lose their job in the future, even if it has \nabsolutely nothing to do with foreign trade, they should qualify for \ntrade adjustment assistance.\n  I think any of our colleagues can see the inequity in that. My State \nis the ninth largest textile State in the Nation. I love my textile \nworkers as much as anybody else does, but I do not know how having a \nprogram to help people who lose their jobs because of foreign \ncompetition can be justified, and a judgment is made based on each \ncircumstance, and then come along and say, but if someone works in the \ntextile industry and they have lost their job, we are going to treat \nthem differently than everybody else. I think there is a tremendous \nequity problem in that, and I think people working in the textile \nbusiness would understand it. Also, the fact that it would apply not \njust for people who lose their jobs in the future but for 3 and a half \nyears in the past.\n  So for that reason, I oppose the Hollings amendment.\n  Turning now to the Landrieu amendment, of all groups that benefit \nfrom trade, the maritime industries are the biggest beneficiaries. The \ngreat bulk of foreign trade comes into our ports. I am blessed in \nTexas, thank God, every day, to have many great ports. My maritime \nworkers get to work on shipping things out, they get to work on \nbringing things in, and of all the people I have, they are among the \nmost pro-trade people, for the obvious reason: Not only do they benefit \nas Americans, but they benefit because they get an opportunity to have \nmore competition for their services.\n  The Landrieu amendment extraordinarily says if someone loses their \njob in the maritime industry, whether it has anything to do with \nforeign competition--because they would get trade adjustment assistance \nif it did, under current law--that they qualify for trade adjustment \nassistance.\n  What I think is extraordinary about this amendment is not that it \ntreats people differently based on what kind of job they have, which I \nkind of think a little bit violates equal justice under the law, but of \nall the workers who would be said tend to be benefited by foreign \ntrade, maritime workers would be virtually at the top of the list.\n  In fact, looking back over my political career, the unions that have \ntended to support me have been maritime unions. Now they all ought to \nsupport me, but they have not. The maritime people have supported me \nbecause I support foreign trade. I do not understand why, of all \nworkers in America, we would single out maritime workers as losers from \ntrade. A, they are the biggest beneficiaries; and, B, to the extent \nthat anybody was a loser, they could qualify for trade adjustment \nassistance.\n  So I think the argument for the Hollings amendment is very weak. I \nthink it is inequitable. I think it is unfair. It is illogical. I think \nall of those things, and more, apply to the Landrieu amendment.\n  Turning very briefly to the Corzine amendment, the Corzine amendment \nsays the President cannot enter into a trade agreement that has \nprovisions that privatize public services.\n  Now the Corzine amendment--I am not sure exactly how it is going to \nbe argued because I had not heard it argued, but let me explain the \nproblem with it. One of the biggest problems we have is getting \ncountries such as Japan to let our contractors bid on their telephone \ncompany equipment and technology, trying to get them to let our \ncontractors bid on building airports. The fundamental argument we use \nis we force them, whether these activities are controlled by government \nor whether they are controlled in the private sector, to move toward \nopening up competition.\n\n  The Corzine amendment would not allow us to negotiate a trade \nagreement where we push a foreign competitor to open up a public \nservice for competition. My guess is Senator Corzine is going to argue \nhe does not want a trade agreement that opens up something our \nGovernment does for competition. The problem is, we cannot have trade \nagreements where we say, OK, we are not going to negotiate anything \nthat opens up a public service in America for competition and expect \nother countries to do the same.\n  I remind my colleagues, no matter how much you think of government \ndoing things, rather than the private sector, we do less than anyone in \nthe world. When we cannot bid on selling telephone equipment in Japan, \nit is because they have a national telephone company that is basically \nrun and controlled by the Government. Certainly we don't want to write \nin our fast-track authority that we cannot negotiate to force Japan to \nopen up those contracts to AT, to Bell, to all of our manufacturers. \nWe have spent years doing that. I don't think we would want to undo it.\n  One might argue if the Corzine amendment could simply prevent \ncooperation in things provided by the Government in America, that would \nbe one thing. I personally don't think that is very good. But if you \ndid, the problem is, these trade agreements are bilateral. You cannot \ntake something off the table in our negotiations and leave similar \nthings on the table in negotiating with our trading partner.\n  I am not quite clear what he is trying to get at. Whatever it is, it \nis not good. We generate less of our GDP through government-provided \nservices than any other major country in the world. Our biggest problem \nin many areas in promoting exports of American products is opening up \ngovernment monopolies. This language basically takes us out of all \nthose markets. It is a very bad proposal, in my opinion.\n  Let me make it clear to our colleagues: I would like to see us enter \ninto an agreement where we could go ahead and begin voting on the \namendments that are pending so we can guarantee each side has a very \nshort window to sum up things. We have been debating this bill for 18 \ndays and our memories are starting to get stretched a little. We \nprobably have a dozen amendments, more or less, that are pending which \ncould be voted on. If we simply sit around and squander 3\\1/2\\ hours \nand let the clock run out on postcloture time, under the rule there is \nno debate of these amendments, they simply are voted on.\n  I urge, especially the leaders on the other side of the aisle, to \nwork out an agreement where we can begin voting and give people a short \nperiod of time to make their argument so we can vote. I understand we \nhave a meeting at 2:30 and we are going to do bioterrorism during that \nhour. I hope when we come back from that meeting at 3:30, rather than \nwaiting until 6:03, or whenever the time is, we could begin at that \npoint voting, and we could give people a little bit of time to say what \ntheir amendment is about and give other people a little bit of time to \nsay\n\n[[Page S4769]]\n\nwhy they are against it. We have a couple of pending amendments that \nhave points of order against them. It would be my intention when we get \nback from the 2:30 meeting, to see if we can make those points of order \nagainst those amendments--there may be an effort to waive the point of \norder. If so, there would be a vote at that point. I hope we can get \nthis process going. There is no reason, in my opinion, to wait around \nuntil 6 o'clock and not give people an opportunity to make their case.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, at least it was the \nintention of the leadership, following my comments, we were going to go \nto the bioterrorism conference. As I understand it--I know our \ncolleagues will be attending a 2:30 meeting and briefing--I will speak \nfor a period of time and then the Republican side will speak for a \nperiod of time and then we will go to the time agreement on \nbioterrorism, and there is 45 minutes a side; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And we will have a vote after the using of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have serious reservations about this bill and I \nintend to vote against it. I have a lifelong record of supporting free \ntrade. I have supported trade agreements in the past. I have supported \ntrade agreements with China and Vietnam. I supported NAFTA. I supported \nGATT. But this bill protects the rights of corporations at the expense \nof workers and the environment. It is not free trade and it is not fair \ntrade when we must compete with countries and foreign businesses that \nabuse their workers and ignore their obligations to the environment \nwith impunity.\n  The proponents of this bill have said that this is the most \nprogressive trade bill on the issues of labor and the environment ever \nto reach the Senate. I agree there is progress on some fronts, but I'm \nvery disappointed that we didn't do more. It is clear that, before the \nCongress gives up much of its constitutional responsibility to regulate \ninternational commerce, much stronger safeguards must be put in place.\n  Labor rights protections must be a vital part of our international \ntrading system. These protections help to lift the standards for \nworkers around the world, and to help protect America's workers from \nunfair foreign competition. As we work with other nations to develop \nrules for the global economy, we can't create new rights for businesses \nand leave workers out in the cold.\n  By fighting for the rights of workers in our own country and around \nthe world, we are representing the best values of the American people--\nthat an honest day's work should receive an honest day's pay that \nworkers deserve fairness in the workplace, fair pay and fair working \nconditions, and that workers are a resource to be supported, not a \ncommodity to be abused.\n  I am very concerned this bill creates a dangerous double standard on \nthe rights of corporations and the rights of workers. On the one hand, \nthis bill directs the United States Trade Representative to encourage \nour trading partners to adopt U.S. standards of intellectual property \nlaw--the most complex and difficult patent laws to maintain and enforce \nin the world--and includes even stronger language on the enforcement of \npatent laws. If a trading partner fails to enforce the highest \nstandards of patent law, retaliation would be swift and severe. While \nthere is a place for intellectual property protections, especially with \nthe acceptance of my amendment assuring access to life-saving \nmedicines, the disparity with labor rights protections is astounding. \nIf a trading partner fails to enforce its own labor laws, this bill \nclearly states that ``no retaliation may be authorized.'' It is as if \nwe're telling our trading partners we'll look the other way if they \nprovide cheap, unregulated labor for corporations.\n  This is the wrong time for Congress to send that message to our \ntrading partners. Today, workers around the world are facing \nunprecedented assaults on their basic rights. In Colombia, according to \nthe Central Workers Union of that country, 160 trade unionists were \nmurdered last year and 79 trade unionists disappeared.\n  In many other nations around the world, workers are prevented from \nmeeting together freely or from joining together to form a union to \nadvocate for their interests. Without these fundamental rights, workers \nin these nations are not truly free. We should be building a global \neconomy in which children have the universal opportunity for education, \nrather than stolen childhoods filled with endless hours of toil for \nnext to nothing.\n  Several key amendments strengthening the labor rights and environment \nprotections in this agreement and enhancing trade adjustment assistance \nwere defeated because of overwhelming Republican opposition. Vice \nPresident Cheney broke a tie to prevent the Congress from helping \nworkers displaced by trade to pay their mortgages. I'm very concerned \nwith the message this sends--when it comes to protecting the interest \nof corporations, spare no expense. When it comes to protecting workers \nor their families, cause no expense.\n  Too often the current trading system enriches multi-national \ncorporations at the expense of working families. To build a fair global \neconomy, all parties to trade agreements should reaffirm their \nobligations and commitments under the International Labor \nOrganization's Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at \nWork. Unless workers around the world have basic freedoms, such as \nfreedom of association and the right to organize a union and bargain \ncollectively, free trade will not be fair trade.\n  At the same time that we are encouraging the growth of global trade, \nwe must take care of workers at home who are hurt from expanded trade. \nI am pleased that Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley have provided \ntrade adjustment assistance that includes essential health care \nsubsidies for laid-off workers who otherwise could not afford to \nmaintain their coverage. This assistance is a lifeline to workers who \nhave lost their jobs through no fault of their own. We've tripled the \njob training funds. We have added wage insurance for older workers who \nare fortunate enough to find new jobs but forced to take a lower wage. \nThis assistance is long overdue and it is right to include it in this \nlegislation.\n  I am also pleased that the trade adjustment package will cover some \nsecondary workers, but it is unfair that downstream workers have been \nexcluded from this coverage. There is no good reason that workers who \nproduce the finished product or package articles should be ineligible \nfor trade adjustment assistance while workers who produce parts or work \nfor supplier companies are covered. Both groups of workers are hurt by \ntrade and need to feed their families.\n  Finally, this bill should have included actions to protect the health \ncoverage of steel retirees. An estimated 600,000 steel retirees, widows \nand their families are now in jeopardy to lose their coverage because \nof growing trade imbalances. For decades, the steel industry has been a \nleader in the American economy. The cars we drive and the buildings we \nwork in would not be possible without the backbreaking work of \nAmerica's steelworkers. We must recognize the contribution of these \nworkers to building America. We must not let them down in their hour of \nneed. Hundreds of thousands of America's workers were promised decent \nhealth care by their companies in exchange for years of service in the \nworkplace. The Mikulski amendment would have kept that promise, and it \nwas wrong for Republicans to block this worthy proposal.\n  Earlier in the last century, many argued that labor rights were not \nthe business of the national government. They were wrong. Without the \nbasic labor protections of the New Deal, America's workers would be \nentirely at the mercy of corporations. Today, those who say that labor \nrights have no place in trade agreements are just as wrong. Unless we \nbuild a global economy that respects basic freedoms and labor rights, \nwe are doing an enormous disservice to workers around the world.\n  We had a good deal of discussion over the course of these past days \nabout the impact on workers at home and overseas. I will review for a \nfew minutes\n\n[[Page S4770]]\n\nthe plight of some of the workers at home and what I believe would have \na much more favorable impact on their quality of life for themselves \nand their children. That is the increase in minimum wage, rather than \nthis legislation. That is why I am strongly opposed to the legislation \nand why I regret very much we were unable to get an agreement by this \nbody to address the issue of the increase in the minimum wage, which \nwould be effectively $1.50 over a 3-year period.\n  There was some discussion as the majority leader requested a \nunanimous consent agreement that we consider this legislation by the \nend of June. There was an objection made by the other side that this \nwas somehow an idea whose time has come and gone. I was reviewing last \nevening the Republican Presidents who signed increases in the minimum \nwage law. President Eisenhower signed an increase in the minimum wage \nlaw. At that time it was not a partisan issue. It was basically, how \nmuch should the increase in the minimum wage be? President Nixon signed \nan increase in the minimum wage law. The first President Bush signed an \nincrease in the minimum wage law, as a number of Democratic Presidents \nhave, as well.\n  It is a time-honored issue that is not complicated. It is an issue we \nhave looked at in the Senate on a number of different occasions.\n  The fact remains, if we fail to see an increase in the minimum wage, \nwe will find we have slipped to virtually an all-time low in the \npurchasing power of the minimum wage. That is why I strongly support \nthe efforts of our majority leader to ensure this body will have an \nopportunity to address this issue no later than the end of July--\nhopefully with the agreement of the other side; hopefully with the \nsupport of our colleagues on the other side.\n  We do have several Members on the other side who will support the \nincrease. We should not be denied the opportunity to vote on this \nissue.\n  As we look down the road in terms of this issue, I remind our \ncolleagues what we are facing in terms of the workers at the lower end \nof the economic ladder.\n  We will, in a very short period of time--July--also be looking at \nwelfare reform. That raises the question about how we are going to free \npeople from dependency to independence. It seems to me what we have \nseen from the period since the passage of the last welfare bill is if \nyou make work pay, you are going to get individuals who are going into \njobs. They are going to need skills, they are going to need some \ntraining, they are going to have to have assurances that they have some \ndaycare for their children. They don't want to lose any health care if \nthey are able to receive it. But fundamentally--you have to make work \npay. That is what the minimum wage issue is really all about.\n  That is why its discussion now is important. As we are looking at the \ntrade bill, we hear a great deal about how this is going to improve the \nlot of workers at the lower part of the economic ladder. I daresay this \nlegislation to guarantee an increase in the minimum wage will have a \ngreat deal more positive impact on their well-being.\n  This chart is about ``Working Hard But Losing Ground, The Real Value \nOf The Minimum Wage.'' If you were looking at where its purchasing \npower would be in 1968, in today's dollars it would be $8.14. We can \nsee if we fail to act by next year, we will be right back to $4.70. We \nhave not increased it in the period of the last 6 years. Workers are \nworking longer. They are working harder. I will point that out in just \na moment. But these are the facts.\n  This chart, ``All The Gains From The Last Increase,'' shows the gains \nin the last 6 years will be eaten away by inflation if we fail to act \non this.\n  This chart shows what is happening in the minimum wage, and its \nrelationship to the poverty line. As I have said many times, and as I \nbelieve the American people have demonstrated, they believe if people \nare going to work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, they ought to have \na livable wage. They should not have to live in poverty.\n  Americans understand fairness. When we look at this chart, what the \npoverty line is, and look at this other line indicating where the \nminimum wage is and how it has been falling, we can see individuals who \nwork hard are still falling further and further below the poverty line, \neven though they are working, and working hard, trying to provide for \nthemselves and provide for their families. The increase in the minimum \nwage can make a difference in the quality of life for those \nindividuals.\n  The question comes up about what has been going on in the workplace. \nHow about American workers? Let's look at this chart, ``Poor Parents \nWorking Harder Than Ever.'' This is a comparison of the total number of \nhours workers are working today to what they were working 20 years ago.\n  Look at this chart. This is the increased number of hours per year \nfor workers who are in the lowest 40-percent income bracket of families \nwith children--the lowest 40 percent of family incomes in the country.\n  This shows 416 hours for all workers in the lower income level, the \nlower 40 percent, with children. They are working 416 hours more now \nthan they were working 20 years ago; white workers are 393; Hispanic, \n477; African American are 531 hours.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding--I want to know if the Senator \nagrees with me--that 60 percent of the people who draw minimum wage are \nwomen, and 40 percent of those women, that is the only money they get \nfor them and their families; is that true?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. This is a women's issue \nbecause the great majority, 60 percent of those who receive the minimum \nwage, are women. And over one-third of those women have children, so it \nis a children's issue. It is quality of life for children. It is a \nfamily issue. We hear a great many speeches around here with regard to \nfamily issues. This is a family issue.\n  I remind the Senator from Nevada about what is happening out there in \nthe workforce. In the lower 40 percent, which includes the minimum \nwage, they are working harder, longer, more than at any time in the \nhistory of our country. It is 10 or 12 weeks, effectively--effectively \n10 weeks longer than they were working 20 years ago.\n  Look at productivity. Let me bring this to the attention of our \ncolleagues. This chart shows the increase in productivity. We will hear \nmany of the arguments: The increase in wages ought to be related to the \nincrease in productivity. If that was the test, we would have an \nincrease in the minimum wage of much more than it is today, if it was \ndirectly related to productivity because of the increase in \nproductivity of low-wage earners. But that is not where we are on this. \nIt should be, but we are not there.\n  The arguments are always made on the impact on inflation. We can \ndiscount that.\n  The loss of employment, we can discount that.\n  But this shows what has been happening in the workforce, about \nminimum wage workers increasing their productivity. Generally, we have \nalways thought wages ought to be somewhat related to increased \nproductivity. If people are going to work harder, work longer, work \nmore efficiently, they ought to be rewarded. That is an American value. \nThat is understandable.\n  That may apply to some workers, but it doesn't apply to minimum wage \nworkers. That is a matter that should be remedied and we are going to \ntry to remedy that with our particular proposal.\n  Just to get back to what is happening in terms of workers working \nlonger and working harder, this is a general profile. This is from the \n``Families And Work Institute and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.'' I \nwill have printed in the Record the citations for all of this.\n  Workers now work more hours than workers in any industrial society--\nit is about 450 hours more than any other industrial society.\n  One in five Americans works more than 50 hours a week. If this trend \ncontinues, the average person will be working more than 60 hours per \nweek in 20 years.\n  Half of young workers today say that not having enough time for \nfamily and work responsibilities is their biggest worry. These are \nyoung workers trying to raise their families, working longer and \nharder--increasing hours away from their families and children.\n\n[[Page S4771]]\n\n  In addition to working longer hours in primary jobs, 13 percent of \nAmericans are working a second job to make ends meet. The second jobs \nadd an average of 13 hours to the work week. That is with regard to \nthese minimum wage earners.\n  These are people, our fellow Americans, men and women of great \ndignity, who take pride in the jobs they are doing. All they want is \nrespect for the jobs they are doing, and that is related to being \ncompensated fairly and decently for their employment. This issue is \nabout respect. This is about dignity of these working families. That is \nwhat this issue is all about.\n\n  This chart indicates that job growth continues even after the minimum \nwage is increased. We have heard these arguments. Let's look at what \nhas happened to the increased minimum wage and what has happened to \nemployment. This goes back to October 1996. This is just the jump in \nthe minimum wage. The first increase was 50 cents. Then in 1997 it was \n40 cents. You see the lines indicating the total number of Americans \nwho are employed continues to increase. This is a false argument that \nsuddenly we are going to lose jobs.\n  I want to bring this matter to the attention of our colleagues. \nIncreasing the minimum wage by $1.50 is vital to the workers but a drop \nin the bucket of the national payroll.\n  Look at this: Americans earn $5.4 trillion a year. A $1.50 minimum \nwage increase would be less than one-fifth of 1 percent of the national \npayroll.\n  We will hear all the argument that this is enormously inflationary, \nthat it will have a disruptive effect in terms of the economy. It is \none-fifth of 1 percent of the national payroll for these workers. But \nit is vitally important to these individuals who are receiving it \nbecause it makes all the difference in the world in terms of their \nquality of life.\n  I want to show what our proposed minimum wage is really all about. It \nis at a historic low. We have a proposal that will be phased in over a \n3-year period--60 cents this year, 50 cents in 2003, and 40 cents for \n2004.\n  Let us look at the proposal in relationship to the increases we have \nhad since 1956. As this chart shows, this is a very modest increase in \nterms of the increases in the minimum wage.\n  All we are trying to do is restore the purchasing power for working \nfamilies who receive the minimum wage back to where we were 6 years \nago. It is very modest. At that time, it finally passed overwhelmingly \nhere in the Senate after we had been debating it for about 2 years. But \nit finally passed at that time.\n  Our proposal is an extremely modest one. As I pointed out yesterday, \nit makes an enormous difference in terms of the lives of the people who \nare receiving this.\n  When the $1.50 is totally phased in, it will amount to $3,000 for a \nminimum wage family. It is the equivalent of 15 months of groceries, \nover 8 months of rent, over 7 months of utilities, and full tuition for \na community college degree.\n  That may not sound like a lot to Members of the Senate. It certainly \ndoesn't sound like a lot for those individuals receiving this \nextraordinary tax break with the bill we passed, or who will be \nbenefiting from the $600 billion the President is requesting of the \nCongress even at this time in terms of the future. But it makes an \nenormous difference to those working families.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. I listened to the Senator speak yesterday, and I heard one \nof the Senators on the other side of the aisle ask, Why doesn't the \nmarketplace control this? Why don't we make it $1 million an hour?\n  Does the Senator respond the same way I do, that if the marketplace \ncontrolled, there would be people making less money than the minimum \nwage today?\n  My father worked before labor unions were of any power in this \ncountry. I can remember him telling me he would go to a mine that was \nhiring. He would hear they were hiring. People were working for nothing \nbasically. There would be a labor boss. The men would be standing there \nwanting a job. ``I will take you. I will take you. And I will take \nyou.''\n  The marketplace really doesn't take care of the American worker. Will \nthe Senator agree with me?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. We are talking about \nentry-level jobs. As I pointed out, it is primarily women who are in \nthe market, maybe having a family and exiting the market, and trying to \ncome in and provide for their family. They work hard. When we think \nabout who these individuals are making the minimum wage, they are \nteacher's aides in the classrooms. We passed the Leave No Child behind \nlegislation.\n  We are giving this focus and attention. We have a difference with the \nadministration on funding levels of that legislation. We think we need \nto invest in our children as a national priority. But the fact is, when \nyou have children in that classroom--this is related as well to what is \ngoing on in the classroom--it is not only about having a well-qualified \nteacher, but also it is about teacher's aides. Teacher's aides are the \nones receiving the minimum wage.\n  Men and women who work in nursing homes look after parents who fought \nin our world wars and lifted the country out of the Depression--the \ngreat heroes of our time. You will find more often than not that people \nworking in those nursing homes are working for minimum wage. These are \npeople who are caring and, as I mentioned, have a sense of pride. They \nare the people who clean the buildings so American enterprise can \nflourish in the daytime. They take tough, gritty jobs at nighttime in \norder to provide for their families. They are jobs in which men and \nwomen take a great deal of pride. They should be treated with respect \nand with dignity.\n  Let me point this out as a final chart. Speaker Dennis Hastert \ncouldn't have said it any clearer on June 8 when he said:\n\n       Lawmakers ought to be able to keep up with the cost of \n     living so they can take care of their families and provide \n     for their families like everybody else does. I think that's \n     the decent thing to do.\n\n  So do I. That is what this minimum wage is all about.\n  Dennis Hastert has the right idea. Let us be able to provide an \nincrease in the minimum wage so people can deal with the cost of living \nwhich is eating away the increase we passed 6 years ago so the parents \ncan take care of their families and provide for them as everyone else \ndoes. That is the decent thing to do.\n\n  That is what this issue is about. It is, as I said before, a women's \nissue, a children's issue, a civil rights issue, but most of all a \nfairness issue. Americans understand fairness. They understand that \npeople working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, and even longer \nnow, for the minimum wage ought not to have to live in poverty. Their \nchildren should not have to live in poverty. This country is a country \nof fairness and decency and justice. This is a defining issue, I \nbelieve, about economic justice in this country.\n  Mr. REID. The Speaker of the House of Representatives approximately a \nyear ago was not talking about minimum wage workers. He was talking \nabout Members of Congress. Is that right?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. What the Senator is saying is that if Members of Congress \nare entitled to a cost-of-living increase, shouldn't the minimum wage \nworker be entitled to a cost-of-living increase?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I do not know how you would answer that if you voted no \nin terms of the increase on this minimum wage, particularly since we \nhave had four increases for Members of Congress since the last increase \nin the minimum wage. They were accepted by the membership. Why would we \nbegrudge nearly 9 million hard-working Americans across this country \nwho are working hard to provide for their families their opportunity to \ntake care of their families as Members of Congress do with theirs?\n  This is an issue we are going to talk about during the course of \nthese next few weeks. We welcome the opportunity to debate it. We \nwelcome the opportunity to vote on it. I am enormously grateful to the \nleadership, Senator Daschle and Senator Reid, for their strong \ncommitment in this undertaking, and our colleagues. We look forward to \nthat debate and discussion at an early time.\n\n[[Page S4772]]\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield any time he has \nremaining?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. I yield such time as remains to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if there is no Republican seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

But in the meantime, we have \nSenator Kennedy here.\n  I ask we go to the next matter, which is, by virtue of the unanimous \nconsent agreement, now before us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4772-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4772-S4786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PUBLIC HEALTH SECURITY AND BIOTERRORISM PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE ACT \n                       OF 2002--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I understand, there is an hour and a \nhalf evenly divided; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself such time as I might use.\n  Mr. President, today, the Senate considers historic legislation to \nenhance the Nation's preparedness for bioterrorism. This legislation \nhas benefitted from the leadership of many Members of Congress on both \nsides of the aisle and on both sides of the Capitol. I thank all of our \ncolleagues who have made such important contributions to this \nlegislation. In particular, I commend my fellow conferees for their \ndedicated and effective leadership on this issue in the conference \ncommittee on this legislation. Under the skillful and effective \nleadership of our conference chairman, Representative Billy Tauzin, the \nconferees and their staffs have worked tirelessly to ensure that this \nlegislation was completed in a timely manner, and I thank them for \ntheir efforts.\n  Our conference has reported legislation that will provide a historic \n$4.6 billion investment to prepare the Nation to respond effectively to \nbioterrorism. This is the single greatest investment our Nation has \never made in public health.\n  Many members of the public had never heard of the word \n``bioterrorism'' before the anthrax attacks of last fall showed us all \nhow chillingly vulnerable we are to this new form of terrorist attack. \nBut bioterrorism was a challenge that our committee had addressed long \nbefore the terrible events of September 11 and the anthrax attacks of \nOctober.\n  In 1998, my colleague, Senator Bill Frist, and I began to assess the \nNation's preparedness for the new challenge of bioterrorism. We learned \nof the terrible loss of life that could result from a major attack \nusing anthrax, Ebola, smallpox or some other deadly biological weapon. \nIn the Armed Services Committee, my colleagues and I learned that \nbiological weapons engineers in the former Soviet Union had conducted \nchilling experiments to make these already deadly pathogens yet more \nlethal through genetic engineering.\n  Our committee learned that our Nation's preparedness for the threat \nof bioterrorism was dangerously inadequate. Supplies of vaccine against \nsmallpox were decades old and insufficient to protect the entire US \npopulation. We also learned that more and more germs were becoming \nresistant to the antibiotics doctors rely on to treat dangerous \ninfections. The Nation's public health agencies were underfunded and \nunderstaffed. Rapid communication of information about dangerous \ndisease outbreaks is an essential part of a national bioterrorism \nresponse yet many public health agencies lacked equipment as basic as a \nfax machine or an e-mail account.\n  To address these grave deficiencies in our Nation's response to \nbioterrorism and other public health emergencies, Senator Frist and I--\ntogether with many of our colleagues in the Senate--introduced The \nPublic Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000. Congress approved \nthis legislation later that year.\n  The act was the basis for the infusion of needed resources that were \nprovided to help prepare for bioterrorism in the supplemental \nappropriation at the end of last year. I commend my colleagues on the \nAppropriations subcommittees, Senator Harkin, Senator Inouye and \nSenator Specter, and our distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens, for \ntheir vision and leadership in recognizing the needs of the Nation for \nbioterrorism preparedness, and for providing the funds that will help \nour Nation prepare for this threat. I look forward to working with \nthese distinguished colleagues on our supplemental appropriation and on \nfunding for the initiatives authorized in the conference report for \nfiscal year 2003.\n  I wish I could say that all the deficiencies that Senator Frist and I \nlearned about in 1998 have been put right. Sadly, I cannot. But we have \nmade a good start. Public health and laboratory personnel have received \nintensive training in identifying biological weapons. The laboratory \ntechnicians who identified the cause of the mysterious illnesses in \nFlorida as anthrax had recently received such training. Without that \npreparation, it is impossible to know how long the anthrax attack would \nhave gone undetected.\n  Our legislation authorized rebuilding of CDC's dilapidated and \nobsolete facilities in Atlanta. In 1998, we found that the laboratories \nand facilities of the CDC were in a shocking state of disrepair. \nCeilings leaked onto sensitive equipment. Offices were scattered across \nAtlanta, requiring scientists to spend time fighting traffic when they \nshould be fighting disease. Our legislation authorizes the funds needed \nto complete the CDC's building plan.\n  No Member of this body has been a more forceful and dedicated \nadvocate for the CDC than my good friend, Senator Max Cleland. He has \nspared no effort in his determination to enhance the ability of CDC to \nimprove the health of every American. He was one of the original \nsponsors of the legislation the Congress enacted 2 years ago to improve \nthe CDC, and his leadership has been indispensable in including \nprovisions to enhance CDC in the conference report. His vision and \nleadership has enabled CDC to become a magnet for new health care \ncompanies in\n\n[[Page S4773]]\n\nAtlanta, and he has been a guiding force in the development of a new \nbusiness park. Through these tireless efforts, CDC has contributed not \nonly to the Nation's health, but to the economy and prosperity of \nAtlanta and the entire State of Georgia. Senator Cleland's leadership \nhas been instrumental in adding over $300 million for CDC facilities to \nthe supplemental appropriation.\n  Public health agencies have received new funds to invest in better \ntraining, improved laboratory equipment and modern communications \ntechnology. Medical researchers are using the tools of this new century \nof the life sciences to discover better ways to prevent or cure deadly \ninfections.\n  We have come a long way since 1998, but we still have far to go. Too \nmany communities are still underprepared for bioterrorism. Too many \nhospitals--crippled by savage cutbacks in their funding under Medicare \nand Medicaid--cannot make the investments needed to prepare for \nbioterrorism. Too many Americans are still at risk.\n  The conference report that the Senate is considering today expands \nand extends the legislation approved 2 years ago so that we can build \non the progress we began in 1998.\n  The keys to responding effectively to a bioterrorist attack lie in \nthree concepts: detection, treatment, and containment.\n  Detecting an attack is the key to containing it. Initiatives \nauthorized in the conference report will improve the training of \ndoctors to recognize the symptoms of a bioterrorist attack, so that \nprecious hours will not be lost as doctors try to diagnose their \npatients. The report will accelerate development of new methods for \ndisease surveillance, using modern information technology to provide \nreal-time reporting of disease outbreaks. The report will also provide \npublic health laboratories with the training, the equipment, and the \npersonnel needed to identify biological weapons as quickly as possible.\n  Once an attack has been identified, we must have adequate medical \nsupplies to contain it and treat its victims. The conference report \nrequires the production of enough doses of smallpox vaccine to meet the \nneeds of every American, so that the Nation will be protected if our \nenemies ever unleash this ancient plague. The legislation also enhances \nFederal stockpiles of pharmaceuticals, vaccines and other medical \nsupplies that can be brought to the aid of communities affected by \nterrorism, as was done by Secretary Thompson so swiftly and effectively \nin the terrible aftermath of the attacks on New York and the Pentagon.\n  Bioterrorism is a threat to the entire Nation and it demands a \nnational response. Our legislation authorizes $1.6 billion in grants to \nstates to enhance bioterrorism preparedness in every state in the \nnation. The conference report also sets aside $520 million to enhance \nhospital preparedness for bioterrorism. Since bioterrorism will affect \nentire communities, our legislation encourages hospital planning to be \nintegrated with community-wide planning by funding partnerships between \nhospitals and state or local governments. Our legislation also includes \na proposal made by my friend, Representative Ed Markey, to provide \nneeded medications to communities living in the shadow of nuclear power \nplants.\n  The report will enhance preparedness for bioterrorism at the \nnational, state and local levels. Because of the initiatives we approve \ntoday, American families can go to sleep tonight knowing that their \nsecurity will be enhanced.\n  Title II of the conference report provides important, new protections \nagainst the misuse of dangerous pathogens like anthrax. These \nprovisions are a decisive step forward for the security of our country. \nOnce implemented, they will assure greater certainty over the \npossession and use of the substances which cause anthrax, plague and \nbotulism.\n  Ever since the attacks using anthrax in the fall, our country has \nbeen trying to figure out how this could have happened. And we have \nlearned that we don't even know who possesses anthrax in the United \nStates. In response, and through the leadership of Senators Feinstein, \nHarkin, and Durbin, we've added significant new authority for the CDC \nand the Department of Agriculture to oversee the possession of anthrax \nand other dangerous biological agents that could be used to harm our \ncitizens or agriculture.\n  Laboratories will now have to register to possess such materials, and \nthey will have to meet guidelines to ensure the safety and security of \nthese materials. Individuals who work with these materials in labs will \nnow be screened to see whether they are terrorists or might otherwise \nput the agents to criminal use.\n\n  Most importantly, we have enhanced the controls on these materials \nwhile preserving the ability to pursue legitimate research--research \nthat will produce the treatments, vaccines, and tests that will protect \nus from these biological agents, should they ever be used against us.\n  In light of the anthrax attacks, we have become increasingly \nconcerned that terrorists could use food as a delivery vehicle for one \nof these agents, or that terrorists could attack with biological agents \ncapable of crippling or destroying our food supply and our agricultural \neconomy. And so, we have given the FDA more funding and substantial new \nauthority to protect the food we eat, and the USDA more funding to \nenhance the security of the food supply and agribusiness.\n  I am proud of these accomplishments. In the hands of the FDA, these \nprovisions will be at work every day to better protect the health and \nsafety of Americans. They will prevent deliberate attacks on our \ncountry, and they will help reduce our country's epidemic of foodborne \nillness. By some estimates, contaminated food in our country causes 76 \nmillion illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths each and \nevery year.\n  For many years, Senators Clinton, Durbin, Mikulski and Reed have \nunderstood this problem and have long championed strong, new food \nsafety authority and resources for the FDA. Senator Durbin has made \nthis a top priority throughout his congressional career in both the \nHouse and Senate. For years, Senator Mikulski and I have sought new \nauthorities over imported foods.\n  Thanks to the provisions in this legislation, the American public \nwill greatly benefit from what has been rightly described by the New \nYork Times as ``the most significant expansion of federal authority \nover the food industry in more than six decades.''\n  FDA will have new authority to prevent unsafe food from entering the \ncountry, new authority to inspect food records and require additional \nrecords to assist in tracing the origins of foodborne illness, and new \nauthority to register food manufacturers. And we've provided for grants \nto States for food inspections and for surveillance and detection of \noutbreaks of foodborne illness.\n  FDA also has more authority to track imported drugs, and authority to \nmonitor more closely bulk ingredients of drugs, medical devices, and \nfoods that are imported for export to ensure that these products are \nnot diverted into domestic commerce.\n  Just as we have focused attention on securing our Nation's food \nsupply, Senator Jeffords has led our efforts to secure our Nation's \nwater supply. Thanks to Senator Jeffords' patient and deliberative \nefforts, this legislation will better protect the American public. As \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, our colleague \nworked closely with the ranking member, Senator Bob Smith, on \nprovisions to anticipate and prevent vulnerabilities in our water \nsupply. Their careful work will fund and enable community water systems \nacross the country to assess their vulnerabilities, address immediate \nand urgent security needs, and carefully plan for potential terrorist \nattack.\n  I am also happy to note that the conference report includes S. 1275, \n``The Community Access to Emergency Defibrillation Act'' authored by \nmyself and Senator Frist. This important legislation has the \ndemonstrated potential to save two of thousands of lives annually and \nis strongly endorsed by the American Heart Association.\n  I am very pleased we have reauthorized the Prescription Drug User Fee \nAct, PDUFA, for the second time. When I authored the Prescription Drug \nUser Fee Act of 1992 with Congressmen Dingell and Waxman and Senator \nHatch, I hoped this law would provide urgently needed funds to the Food \nand Drug Administration to speed the review of new drugs. Before user \nfees\n\n[[Page S4774]]\n\nwere enacted, FDA was short staffed and underfunded. Every beneficial \ndrug delayed because FDA had insufficient staff to act promptly \nrepresented a therapeutic opportunity denied to patients and consumers.\n  The past decade has more than fulfilled my hopes and expectations. \nThe FDA has done a remarkable job of reviewing new drugs in a rapid but \ndeliberative manner. Patients have benefitted from the agency's \ndramatic success in speeding drug reviews, and this legislation \npromises to continue this track record of success.\n  At the same time that speedier approvals have benefitted patients, \nthere have been growing concerns over whether faster speed to market \nfor drugs has come with heightened risks to patients. The fact that \nmore new drugs have reached American consumers first in the world means \nthey are also the first to be exposed to new risks and new safety \nconcerns. A recent Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation by David \nWillman of the Los Angeles Times documented the urgent need to balance \nrapid approval of drugs with an equal commitment to assuring safety.\n  This concern is substantiated by a recent General Accounting Office \nstudy which I requested on the user fee program. According to GAO, the \nproportion of safety-related drug withdrawals has increased for drugs \napproved under PDUFA II compared to drugs approved under the first \nPDUFA. While only 1.6 percent of drugs approved from 1993 through 1996 \nwere withdrawn for safety reasons, over 5 percent of drugs approved \nfrom 1997 through 2000 were withdrawn due to safety. While the number \nof drugs involved is still small only seven in the latter period \ncompared to two in the earlier period--this report is still an \nimportant caution and a substantial increase in our investment in drug \nsafety is warranted.\n  These are the issues I have shared and discussed for years with \npatient advocates, consumer groups and independent scientists. And for \nmany years, I have made clear that we must restore public confidence in \nthe FDA's stewardship of prescription drugs. Our dramatic investments \nin drug reviews had to be matched by a corresponding renewal of effort \nin post-marketing surveillance and drug safety. Anything less would \nonly serve to cast doubts on the integrity of FDA's regulation of drug \nsafety.\n  In the past year, our committee, including Senators Reed, Clinton, \nBingaman, Mikulski, Harkin, Dodd, and Edwards, worked closely with the \nPatient and Consumer Coalition and with independent drug safety experts \nto develop solutions. We found that our concerns were shared by our \ncolleagues in the House, including Congressmen Dingell, Brown, Waxman \nand Stupak. Throughout congressional deliberations on the \nreauthorization of prescription drug user fees, we agreed upon the need \nfor additional resources and stronger authorities for FDA. While it is \nimportant for us to bring drugs to market quickly, we agreed that this \nredoubles our obligation to assure the safety of those drugs.\n  Today, I am happy to say that is precisely what we have accomplished \nin this legislation.\n  First, the FDA's performance goals relating to the speed of approval \nhave not changed. The many review staff hired by FDA with user fees can \ncontinue to scrutinize the safety of drugs seeking approval. The \nincreased fees in the new agreement will be used not to further \naccelerate the approval of drugs, which is already the fastest in the \nworld, but to assure that the studies underlying drug applications are \ngiven the most careful possible scrutiny to assure that the drugs are \nin fact safe and effective.\n\n  The public and my colleagues in the Senate should also understand \nthat the performance goals contained in all of the PDUFA agreements are \nnot goals for the approval of new drugs; rather they are goals for the \ntimely review of new drugs. FDA meets these goals whether or not the \nagency approves or denies approval of a drug.\n  Best of all, I want my colleagues to know that this reauthorization \nis a tremendous accomplishment where drug safety is concerned. We will \nincrease FDA's drug safety spending by over 80 percent over the life of \nthis user fee agreement. With FDA's annual drug safety activities \ncurrently funded at $36 million, this legislation will ensure an \nincrease of $29 million in the fifth year of this agreement, for a \ntotal of $65 million in annual drug safety funding at FDA.\n  To achieve this goal, we have made a fundamental change to how user \nfees are used. The user fee agreement includes a dramatic funding \nincrease of $76 million over five years for FDA to plan, execute and \nfund drug safety ``risk management'' activities for newly marketed \ndrugs. While these activities would be limited in scope and duration, \nFDA will be able to greatly expand its focused scrutiny of these drugs.\n  But in order to give FDA greater freedom of action, we have also \nmandated substantial funding increases for the agency's Office of Drug \nSafety. In fiscal year 2003, the Office will receive an additional $5 \nmillion, and an additional $10 million in fiscal year 2004, with \nincreases assured in subsequent years. Since these funds will be drawn \nfrom FDA's appropriations, Congressman Tauzin, my fellow conferees and \nI are committed to doing all that is necessary to ensure that these are \nnew funds and will not be cannibalized from FDA's other essential \nprograms and activities.\n  We have made other important steps to advance public health and \nsafety. In response to the explosion of direct-to-consumer drug \nadvertising, we have authorized an additional $27 million over five \nyears for FDA's scrutiny of drug advertising and promotions. In \nresponse to delays in generic drug approvals, some of which arise from \nanti-competitive practices by the brand-name drug industry, we have \nauthorized an additional $45 million over five years for FDA's Office \nof Generic Drugs to ensure that generic drugs reach the public more \nquickly.\n  We have also squarely addressed a persistent problem with the \nprescription drug industry. For years, drug companies would promise to \ncomplete post-market, or phase IV, clinical trials to answer important \nquestions about their products. These commitments paved the way for \nreaching the market earlier. In the case of fast track drugs and drugs \napproved through the accelerated approval, these trials were mandatory. \nYet many companies have failed to begin or complete these trials. And \nto respond, FDA's only--and usually unacceptable--recourse would be to \nwithdraw a drug for market.\n  The industry's track record has been disappointing. According to the \nFDA, since 1998, only four of 109 post-market commitments have been \nfulfilled for fast track drugs. Only a quarter of the industry's \ncommitments for standard drugs since 1991 have been fulfilled. And only \na third of its commitments for accelerated approval drugs since 1992 \nhave been fulfilled.\n  Five years ago, I urged the adoption of new authorities for FDA to \nenable the agency to bring these companies into compliance with the law \nand to ensure these essential trials are conducted in a timely way. I \nam very pleased that this legislation includes new authority for the \nFDA to publicize the failure of companies to fulfill their legal \nobligations to complete post-market studies. FDA will publicize such \nfailures through their website, through `dear prescriber' letters, and \npublic statements on the late, uncompleted studies and the resulting, \nunanswered questions of clinical benefit and safety. I am hopeful that \nthe FDA will be able to employ these new tools to bring about more \nresponsible conduct by the industry, and consequently resolve \nunresolved questions of drug safety and efficacy.\n  I am disappointed that some of my colleagues objected to addressing \nin this legislation a crucial priority for children's health. The FDA \nhas a Pediatric Rule that requires a company, before approval of a \ndrug, to study in children the use for which approval is sought in \nadults. It also gives FDA the authority to require, in certain \ncircumstances, that drugs that are already marketed be studied for \ntheir approved use in children. The Pediatric Rule has always served as \na complement to pediatric exclusivity, which we recently reauthorized \nin the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act.\n  But today, the Rule is being challenged in court by parties who \nbelieve the drug industry should be free to decide when or whether to \ndetermine their drugs are safe and effective for\n\n[[Page S4775]]\n\nchildren. The Rule was recently threatened with withdrawal, but the \nAdministration reconsidered this ill-advised step.\n  That is why a clear signal must be sent. This research is of critical \nimportance to children. Without the Rule, less of this research will be \nconducted. And some products, such as biologicals, will not be studied \nat all.\n  With my colleagues, Senators Clinton, Dodd and DeWine, I intend to \npursue this issue in the coming months. We cannot afford to compromise \nthe health of our children with half measures.\n  Finally, I am disappointed that we could not reach agreement on \nlegislation enacting medical device user fees. In 1994, I introduced \nsuch legislation with Congressmen Dingell and Waxman. But dissension \nwithin the device industry prevented us from enacting this important \nreform. Since then, the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health \nand suffered severe losses in its budget and staffing. Its staff has \nshrunk by almost eight percent since 1995 and it has effectively lost \nmore than $34 million in its base funding.\n  With support of my colleague, Senator Gregg, we urged the FDA and the \ndevice industry to seek agreement on performance goals and fees. And to \ntheir great credit, the FDA and the industry reached agreement. But \nsome in the device industry insisted on including extraneous proposals \nthat could not be worked out in the limited time available.\n  Medical device user fees are a win for patients, the industry and the \nFDA. That is why I am committed to achieving a consensus on this issue. \nI believe that we can enact such legislation, so long as we can \ndispense with extraneous controversies and focus on the common goals of \nrestoring the resources of FDA's device center, establishing reasonable \nperformance goals for device reviews, and assuring that safe and \neffective devices are approved in a more timely manner.\n\n  The timely completion of the conference report would not have been \npossible without the hard work of the many staff members who worked on \nthis important legislation. I particularly want to thank Bill Baird of \nSenate Legislative Counsel and Pete Goodloe of House Legislative \nCounsel. Both of these dedicated professionals worked many long, late \nhours and met many tight deadlines to allow this report to be \ncompleted.\n  I want to also thank Patrick Morrissey, Tom DiLenge, Brent Delmonte, \nAmit Sachdev, Bob Meyers and Nandan Kenkeremath from Congressman \nTauzin's staff; Katy French, Vince Ventimiglia, and Steve Irizarry from \nSenator Gregg's staff; Adam Gluck, Eric Juzenas, and Lowell Ungar with \nSenator Harkin; Rhonda Richards with Senator Mikulski; Alison Taylor, \nJo-Ellen Darcy, and Sean Donohue with Senator Jeffords; Deb Barrett and \nJim Fenton with Senator Dodd; Shana Christrup, Helen Rhee and Dean \nRosen from Senator Frist's staff; John Ford, David Nelson, Edith \nHolleman, Bridgett Taylor and Dick Frandsen from Congressman Dingell's \nstaff; Karen Nelson, Ann Witt and Greg Dotson with Congressman Waxman.\n  On my own staff, I want to thank David Bowen for his outstanding work \non all aspects of the bioterrorism issue. He has been tireless and \ninsightful and I know everyone involved in this effort appreciates his \nwork.\n  I also want to thank Paul Kim and David Dorsey for their \nextraordinary efforts to assure protection of our food and water \nsupply, as well as providing better security for potentially dangerous \nbio-materials in our nation's laboratories. They also worked very hard \nto assure that the Prescription Drug User Fee Agreement was a step \nforward for every patient in this country.\n  David Nexon, my Health Staff Director, brought his usual energy and \ncommitment to the effort. Michael Myers, the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pension Committee Staff Director, kept his hand on the tiller \nthroughout.\n  The conference report is a landmark in our national response to \nterrorism and the security threats of this new century. Congress today \nsends the message in one unified and clear voice that this nation will \nnot remain unprepared for the threat of bioterrorism. The front lines \nin the new war against bioterrorism will be our health care system. \nToday we take a historic step forward in preparing America's health \ncare professionals to win the war against bioterrorism.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3462, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis exceptional leadership on this piece of legislation, along with the \nmany members of the committee I have worked with and about whom I will \ntalk later on as I discuss the implications of this piece of \nlegislation. Also, I thank our House colleagues who produced an \nexcellent bill on their own. As a result, we were able to merge the \nbest of the two which, I believe, produce a superb package, although \nlacking in a couple of items, as alluded to by the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  It is basically an extremely positive package, and it puts us well \ndown the road to addressing what is clearly one of the most threatening \nsituations we have as a society, and that is the capacity of those who \nwish us ill--and, regrettably, there are a number of people and \norganizations in this world who wish us ill and would use weapons of \nmass destruction against us, which would include biological warfare.\n  We saw, of course, the devastating impact of a biological event with \nthe anthrax incident, and the President has been speaking about this as \nhe has been moving through Europe on his trip, that some nations in \nthis world are continuing to develop biological weapons and may be \nmaking those weapons available to terrorists.\n  We as a nation, whether we like it or not, have to get ready to \nconfront this threat. This bill will do a great deal to put us in a \nposition to accomplish that.\n  The bill is structured around a variety of points, and I will go into \nthem in specific detail, but the concept of the bill is basically to \nsignificantly improve our Federal capability to deal with a biological \nevent and prepare ourselves with adequate vaccines and adequate \nresearch in the area of developing vaccines to confront bioterrorism \nand, at the same time, look to the local communities and the States and \nsignificantly improve the public health capability of the States and \nthe local communities so that they, as the first responders, will be \nable to manage an event should the worst occur, and we will be able to \ndeal with it in an effective and prompt way.\n  The bill makes a significant commitment of resources well beyond what \nwe had anticipated making when we started down this road but which are \nnecessary. In this war on terrorism, we cannot look at pricetags, we \nmust look at results. It is going to cost a great deal to accomplish \nthe results we need.\n  This bill, although long-awaited, will definitely better prepare this \nNation to respond to attacks which use biological, chemical, or other \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  The bill provides grants to States and local public health agencies \nto assist in preparing for a biological terrorist attack. With these \nresources, unlike prior law, even small States such as New Hampshire \nare assured the ability to prepare and respond to a bioterrorist attack \nor other public health emergency.\n\n  Because of the importance of State preparedness and the amount of \nresources that have been provided, I intend to play an active role in \nmaking sure these funds are not just received by hospitals and State \nand local governments but that they are well spent for the benefit of \nthe American citizenry.\n  An important part of this bill is ensuring that the funds are spent \nconsistent with a State's bioterrorism plans. In addition, we have \nalready begun oversight of the program and look forward to working with \nthe administration and grant recipients as work under the grants begins \nin earnest.\n  Further, under section 102, we will help ensure effective \ncommunication and cooperation among the State, local, and Federal \nagencies by creating a new Assistant Secretary for Public Health \nEmergency Preparedness at HHS.\n  Also, the volunteer spirit has always been alive and well, especially \nin New Hampshire, and I am pleased this conference report includes \nseveral provisions which are designed to facilitate voluntarism in \npreparing for public health emergencies and especially bioterrorism \nemergencies.\n  Title I also includes a number of provisions intended to further \nspeed lifesaving products to citizens before we are faced with another \nserious threat of bioterrorism.\n  Section 121 ensures that stockpiles of products are improved \nimmediately so that there is an adequate supply to protect our citizens \nfrom bioterrorism and other threats. This year we provided the funding \nnecessary to fulfill this commitment, and the Secretary is directed to \nimprove not just the stockpile contents but the supply chain management \nof and local access to products.\n  The bill improves the Secretary's authority to, one, prioritize and \ndo research on new vaccines and therapies; two, rely on all available \nforms of proof of safety and effectiveness, including animal trials; \nand three, accelerate approval of these products. This is absolutely \ncritical if we are to be prepared with adequate vaccines to make sure \nour citizenry is protected.\n  Title II includes the expanded Gregg-Feinstein provisions initially \npassed by the Senate late last year as part of the appropriations \nlegislation.\n  As the recent anthrax attack has suggested, current authorities have \nbeen inadequate to ensure the Government can track the use of \nbiological agents and toxins such as anthrax and botulinum toxins, West \nNile virus, and the like, and to protect against their misuse.\n  The bill makes critical improvements in the Secretary's ability to \nidentify who is handling and doing research with these agents and \ntoxins, to ensure they are qualified to handle these agents, and to \nensure they are not restricted due to inappropriate background or \ncurrent intent.\n  The bill also ensures that universities, laboratories, and agencies \nworking with these agents are registered, appropriately qualified, and \nhave adequate security in place.\n  Many of these agents are used in important research or for important \ntherapeutic purposes in animals and humans. These uses must remain \nprotected and promoted even as we protect the public from their misuse. \nThe bill ensures important exemptions, for example, for FDA-approved \nproducts using or investigating these agents or toxins.\n\n  Title III of the bill provides the FDA with additional inspection, \nrecordkeeping, and detainment authority to ensure the safety of \nAmerica's food and drug supply and increases the number of FDA food \ninspectors. Senator Kennedy spoke about this at some length.\n  The bill also improves our capacity to prevent, detect, and respond \nto an attack on American farmers, livestock, and poultry producers, and \ncertainly Senator Roberts deserves great credit for that. I know he is \ngoing to be speaking in a few minutes.\n  Finally, it provides funds to community drinking water systems to \nallow them to assess any possible vulnerabilities and to institute \nmeasures to prevent tampering. Many have been concerned about having \nthese vulnerability studies go to the EPA which does not have a solid \ntrack record of maintaining control over sensitive information. We must \nensure that the EPA allocates resources and institutes procedures \ndesigned to prevent this information from falling into the wrong hands. \nIt would do no good for us to develop these studies and then find that \nterrorists had been able to use these studies against us.\n\n[[Page S4777]]\n\n  Conferees also succeeded in reauthorizing PDUFA, which has already \nbeen mentioned by the chairman, which has so successfully ensured \npatients timely access to safe, effective, and lifesaving drugs. By \ncollecting fees from pharmaceutical companies, FDA can hire additional \nreviewers and support staff and speed the drug review process without \ncompromising safety or review quality.\n  Under the agreement, the amount of funding FDA receives under the \nprogram will increase by over 28 percent, and in today's deficit \nenvironment this will be of significant assistance. Voluntary user fees \nare substantial and essential sources of revenue that the agency cannot \nafford to lose.\n  I am concerned, however, that this bill does not include some of the \nfollowing items that are particularly critical to the ability of this \ncountry to rapidly prepare for, detect, or respond to biological \nthreats, including anthrax, smallpox, and botulism.\n  In the antitrust area, the Senate bill included a bipartisan \nconsensus provision supported by the Judiciary Committee that would \nextend protection to manufacturers of vaccines and their therapies for \nbioterrorism agents when the companies were engaged in discussions with \nthe Secretary over how best to meet the unmet needs of the United \nStates.\n  It is critical these companies be able to discuss frankly with the \nSecretary their capacities and their strengths so that they can have \nrapid research and develop new vaccines and drugs that protect us \nagainst bioterrorism acts. This provision was, regrettably, dropped in \nconference over my strong objection. I will continue to press for it in \nother arenas.\n  In many critical respects, this Nation remains unprepared for \nbioterrorism threats simply because the threat of unreasonable and \nabusive lawsuits has kept good ideas and good products from being \navailable to our citizens. Examples include decontamination services \nand cleanup services for contaminated worksites, unavailable because of \na threat a lawyer might sue the company.\n  Lifesaving vaccines also remain undeveloped for these same reasons. \nRespirator manufacturers risk the threat of suit when volunteers misuse \na mask in the midst of the chaos during a crisis.\n  I intend to work for a solution this year with many of my colleagues \nwho have expressed support for reasonable liability protections so we \ncan bring on to the market the necessary devices and vaccines in order \nto address these needs and make sure our marketplace is able to respond \neffectively to the threat.\n  Finally, I note my disappointment that the final package did not \ninclude critical new user fee programs for the FDA's device on animal \ndrug centers and accompanying reforms that would dramatically improve \nregulation of those products. These programs and reforms are essential \nto ensuring that our Nation continues to be the leader in developing \nlifesaving therapies and technologies.\n  However, I am heartened by the extraordinary bipartisan, bicameral \nsupport demonstrated for those provisions during the conference. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues, particularly Senator Dodd, \nSenator Hutchinson, and Senator Kennedy, in the development of a strong \nuser fee and reform package. I understand the House intends to move \nthis separately, and certainly I hope we will be able to do the same in \nthe Senate.\n  There are a lot of people who worked very hard on this bill to make \nit a success. Certainly Senator Kennedy was a leader, and he is to be \ncongratulated for his foresight in this matter. Senator Frist, whose \nknowledge in this area is unique and brings so much to the table in the \nSenate, was a major player in designing much of this bill; Senator Enzi \nand Senator Tim Hutchinson for their critical role in ensuring the \ncapacity of all States, but especially rural States, to have capacity \nto prepare for attacks. Senator Susan Collins played a critical role in \ndeveloping the Senate food supply safety provisions, a role reflected \nin a long history working to pass such legislation. Senator Hutchinson \nalso played the single most critical role in the provision protecting \nAmerica's agricultural livestock and poultry provisions. His animal \nenterprise provision, which will protect our folks working on the next \ngeneration of lifesaving vaccines and medicines, is absolutely \nessential.\n  I am also pleased with the inclusion in this bill of so much of \nSenator Hutchinson's legislation concerning improvement in the ability \nto bring antibioterrorism products to the American citizen; Senator \nSessions for his tremendous effort with regard to the minor use, minor \nspecies provisions, which would have provided safe and effective drugs \nfor minor animal species for which therapies are currently unavailable.\n  Unfortunately, this provision was not included in the final bill, but \nit is sound policy and I will continue to support his efforts and to \npass this legislation; Senator Roberts whose attention to the issue of \nfarm policy and the effect of bioterrorism issues relative to our farm \ncommunity was absolutely critical to the design of this bill.\n  At a staff level, I have an exceptional staff. They have worked \nthousands of hours, days and nights, and I thank them very much. Vince \nVentimiglia, Steve Irizarry, and Katy French did a superb job. I also \nthank the majority staff led by David Nixon, and the many people he has \nworking with him. Also, I thank Dean Rosen on Senator Frist's staff.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator for yielding. The completion of the \nBioterrorism Preparedness Act conference report, in my view, represents \nan absolutely vital and significant step forward for our Nation as we \nwork to protect ourselves from any kind of a terrorist attack involving \nbioterrorism.\n  I also had the privilege of being chairman and now ranking member of \nthe Emerging Threats Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. We \nhad witness after witness and commission after commission. We asked \nthem: What keeps you up at night? Each and every time when we tried to \nprioritize the threat that faced this country, bioterrorism was listed \nas No. 1.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership with regard to this bill. \nI echo the comments by Senator Gregg, who has been extremely helpful \nand led the effort on our side. I especially thank Senator Frist whose \nexpertise and leadership with the Centers for Disease Control and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, plus his personal expertise, \nis second to none. If he is not the godfather of this bill, he is \nindeed the godprince. So I thank him for those efforts.\n  This bill also represents a significant advancement in helping to \nprotect agriculture and our Nation's food supply from a possible \nagroterrorist attack. The legislation contains language based on \nnumerous provisions I introduced in the bill some time ago. It was \ncalled the Biosecurity for Agriculture Act. I think that was last fall.\n  Specifically, the bill provides funding authorization for $190 \nmillion for expanded agroterrorism research in 2002 and such sums as \nnecessary in the future years.\n  This language will allow us to significantly expand our research \ncapabilities to deal with these threats. It will allow us to expand \nexisting research partnerships between the Department of Agriculture \nand many of our land grant universities to develop first-responder \ncapability in case we have an agroterrorist attack. It is going to \ncreate many additional partnerships. It will increase the coordination \nbetween the Department of Agriculture and the intelligence community, \nand undertake research to develop what we call rapid field test kits \nthat will allow us to make a determination of the possible introduction \nof any pathogen or disease within minutes or hours instead of days or \nweeks, as often occurs, as of today.\n  In addition, the bill also includes language similar to that I \nintroduced to authorize funding for the upgrades of the Department of \nAgriculture research facilities at Plum Island, NY, Ames, IA, Laramie, \nWY, and Athens, GA. These facilities really represent the frontline in \nthe Department of Agriculture's research efforts to prevent disease \noutbreaks in the United States.\n  Why is the inclusion of this provision in this particular bill so \nimportant? I am not aware of any specific threat, but the possibility \nof agroterrorism or\n\n[[Page S4778]]\n\nfood security attacks is very real, and it has increased since \nSeptember 11.\n  Second, we know the former Soviet Union had developed literally tons \nof biowarfare agents that were to be aimed at the North American food \nsupply. Many of these agents are still housed in unsecured facilities. \nI have been there. Senator Lugar has been there. Many of the scientists \nare simply unemployed and are willing to work for the highest bidder, \nand that is a grave concern.\n  Third, we know several of the September 11 hijackers had significant \nagricultural training. It would be very easy to introduce a disease \nsuch as foot and mouth disease or Karnal Bunt, and the effects would be \ndevastating to our grain supply and our livestock production. Our \nexports would be lost and consumer confidence would simply plummet. \nFood shortages would occur in our Nation's cities.\n  This is particularly frightening when we realize that agriculture is \none of the few sectors of the economy with a trade surplus. Using 1999 \nnumbers, agriculture and agribusiness-related industries accounted for \napproximately 22 million jobs, almost 17 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct. The overall contribution to the Nation's GDP in 1999 was $1.5 \ntrillion. That is at risk. And the cheap U.S. food supply kept the \ntotal portion of the individual income spent on food to about a dime or \n10 percent--one dime out of the consumer's disposal income dollar for \nthat so-called market basket of food. A terrorist attack would \ncertainly endanger that.\n  The importance of this sector to our economy, and our national \nsecurity, cannot be underestimated. We must take the steps to protect \nour agricultural producers, our farmers, our ranchers, and our food \nsupply. This bill represents a very important step.\n  I thank my colleagues who have worked with me on this issue. I thank \nthe staff of the HELP Committee in working with my staff and those on \nthe Agriculture Committee. I thank them for their assistance, including \nthese provisions in this legislation.\n  I yield back the remainder of my allotted time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have learned a lot about terrorism since \nSeptember of last year. We have learned that terrorists prey on \nvulnerability. Our vulnerability becomes their target. This bill \nreduces our vulnerability when it comes to this threat of bioterrorism \nand thus reduces the likelihood of an attack by reducing our \nvulnerability and reduces the potential damage an attack may cause by \nimproving and strengthening our response.\n  We have learned the goal of a bioterror attack is not only to hurt \npeople directly but to paralyze them, to cause panic. This bill will \ncalm the nerves and keep order in the event there is another bioterror \nattack.\n  This bill addresses prevention and preparedness, as well as response. \nIndeed, this bill touches all areas of preparedness: Protecting our \nfood and water, boosting medical stockpiles, and supporting our local \ncommunities and public health infrastructure.\n  This bill emphasizes the local response and local preparedness. It \nrecognizes that it is local people who will respond in the event of a \nbioterror attack. It is about whom you call when you suspect something, \nwhom you call if you are worried about bioterrorism: The family \ndoctors, the emergency workers, the health care professionals. Today, \nwith this legislation we make the first people on the scene our first \npriority.\n  Over 3 months after the tragedies of September 11 and slightly more \nthan 60 days after the anthrax attacks, Congress provided a record $3 \nbillion in emergency bioterrorism funding. This was in December of last \nyear. This was a historic investment. As we have learned since that \ntime, it must be only a downpayment toward ensuring that America is \nfully prepared to respond to bioterrorism and other public health \nrisks.\n  Today, we take another important and very necessary step toward \nsecuring our Nation with the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism \nPreparedness and Response Act. It is a cohesive and comprehensive \nframework to improve our public health system and thereby reduce our \nvulnerability.\n  I, too, thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg for their leadership \nand their tremendous contributions to this conference report. I thank \nour colleagues in the House of Representatives, primarily Chairman \nTauzin and Representative Dingell, for their huge and important \nefforts. Yesterday's overwhelming vote in the House in favor of passing \nthis conference agreement demonstrates this legislation is truly broad \nand bipartisan.\n  There is no question we live today in a more dangerous world, much \nmore dangerous than we envisioned before September 11, much more \ndangerous than we had envisioned before the anthrax-laden letters were \ndelivered across the east coast. We are not unprepared for a bioterror \nattack, but we are clearly underprepared. This bill goes a long way in \nboosting that preparedness and reducing the vulnerabilities.\n  We know terrorists around the world, including al-Qaida, are intent \non using biological weapons against us. We know more than a dozen \nnations--including Iraq, North Korea, Libya, Syria--have the capability \nto produce chemical and biological weapons, and many have stockpiled \nsuch biological weapons in the past. We know thousands of Soviet \nscientists who have the expertise to develop biological weapons are, \ntoday, unemployed, and potentially available to the highest bidder.\n  Yes, the risk is real. We know the risk is increasing. The National \nIntelligence Council warns:\n\n       The biological warfare capabilities of state and non-state \n     actors are growing worldwide. This trend leads us to believe \n     that the risk of an attack against the United States, its \n     interests and allies will increase in the coming years.\n\n  This bill is the foundation and framework for our response.\n  Iraq launched a robust biological program in 1985 and has admitted to \nproducing large quantities of agents and weapons, including 19,000 \nliters of botulinum--in fact, 10,000 liters loaded into munitions--and \n8,500 liters of anthrax--and 6,500 were loaded into munitions. During \nthe gulf war, Iraq weaponized 100 bombs and 15 missile warheads with \nbotulinum, and 50 bombs and 10 missile warheads with anthrax.\n\n  Nonstate actors are also a threat. CIA Director George Tenet has been \nquoted recently in the New York Times as saying: Documents recovered \nfrom al-Qaida facilities in Afghanistan show that Osama bin Laden was \npursuing a sophisticated biological weapons research program. U.S. \nforces discovered a facility in southern Afghanistan near Kandahar that \nwas being built to produce biological agents.\n  Our vulnerabilities remain high. This bill addresses reducing those \nvulnerabilities. Most public health departments in the United States do \nnot have staff fully trained in bioterrorism. A recent report showed \nthat one-third of public health departments serving 25,000 or fewer \npeople had no Internet access, and one-quarter of public health staff \nhad no electronic or e-mail. Today more than 99 percent of food \nimported into this country is never inspected.\n  The American people, with passage of this legislation, should rest \neasier, knowing that our Government is taking the steps necessary to \nrespond to this threat at the local level, at the State level, and at \nthe national level. This legislation will ensure that we continue to \nact both rapidly and appropriately to secure the Nation against future \nattacks on our freedom.\n  What does the bill do? The conference agreement provides the \nresources necessary to improve the training of those first responders, \nto those doctors, to nurses, to public health officials at the local \nlevel. They are the first line of defense. The bill authorizes $300 \nmillion both in 2002 and 2003 to strengthen the capabilities of the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and modernize its \nfacilities. The bill enhances our national research capabilities and \nhelps speed the development of needed drugs, of needed vaccines, \ndiagnostic tests, and other priority countermeasures. And the bill \nhelps ensure that our national strategic pharmaceutical stockpile is \nadequate to meet the needs of America.\n  The October anthrax-laden letters underscored the importance of \ncoordination, the importance of communication. The conference agreement \nputs in place structures to ensure improved\n\n[[Page S4779]]\n\ngovernment coordination, as well as improved collaboration between \ngovernment and the private sector. The legislation helps us develop the \nstate-of-the-art communication infrastructure so we can more readily \nand more rapidly identify and treat infectious disease outbreaks. It \nalso helps ensure that our children and other vulnerable populations \nare better prepared.\n  This conference agreement will significantly improve our ability to \nprotect our water supply, our food supply, our Nation's agriculture, \nand it will help better track and regulate the use of dangerous \npathogens within our borders.\n  The bill focuses on what happens at the local level, at the community \nlevel. If you are suspicious, if an attack occurs, you pick up the \ntelephone, you call somebody, or go to a local facility. This bill \nunderscores the importance of support at the local level.\n  The legislation will provide significant new resources, $1.6 billion \nin the year 2003 alone, to strengthen our State and local public health \nsystems. We have underinvested in our public health infrastructure in \nthe last 30 years in this country.\n  As the title of the bill makes clear, this legislation will not only \nimprove our ability to respond to bioterrorism but to other public \nhealth risks, and emergencies as well, whether they be from other \nintentional acts of terrorism, nuclear attacks, chemical accidents or \nattacks, or from naturally occurring infectious disease outbreaks, the \nso-called dual use of the investment that we put in public health \ntoday.\n  I am proud to be part of this legislation. I believe that years from \nnow America will look back upon this bill as landmark legislation, a \nlandmark achievement, a turning point in our commitment to \nstrengthening our defenses, focusing on biological threats.\n  As has been mentioned by my colleagues, I am very pleased with the \nreauthorization of what is called the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. \nThis important law helps make it possible for the Food and Drug \nAdministration to hire additional manpower and expertise to speed the \ndrug approval process so consumers can benefit more quickly in a safe \nway from life-saving drugs.\n  I am also pleased this agreement includes the Frist-Kennedy Emergency \nAccess to Defibrillator Act, an act which has passed the Senate earlier \nthis year, a provision which will provide annual grants to deploy \nlifesaving cardiac heart defibrillators in more public buildings.\n  My colleague, Senator Gregg, has already recognized so many people \nwho have participated in such an admirable way to this bill. There are \nitems that I, too, would like to have included in this particular bill \nthat are not in the final package, items that I think we must continue \nto address in the Senate and in committee. I believe we need more \ncertainty if private industry truly is to become a partner in combating \nbioterrorism. To harness the genius, to harness the resources of \nprivate companies in these efforts, we should continue to find ways to \nprotect companies from frivolous lawsuits and provide pharmaceutical \nresearch companies and others the certainty that they will not face \nantitrust enforcement simply because they are collaborating with the \nGovernment and their business partners to more rapidly and more \nrationally develop vaccines and other countermeasures.\n\n  This is a solid bill. It combines sound policy and enhanced resources \nto better prepare our Nation and to provide security to the American \npeople. Once again, I commend Senator Kennedy for his dedication and \nleadership. In many ways, this legislation builds upon a foundation we \nbegan about 3 years ago as we began, in a bipartisan way, to develop \nthis issue of bioterrorism. He and I agree that protecting the American \npeople from bioterrorist attacks and other public health threats and \nemergencies does require a robust, a reinvigorated public health \nsystem.\n  I also thank and commend the ranking member of the Senate HELP \nCommittee, Senator Gregg, as well as the other Senate Republican \nconferees he has previously mentioned, Senator Enzi and Senator Tim \nHutchinson, for the tremendous work he is doing in the agricultural and \nrural elements of the bill. Other Members, Senators Roberts, DeWine, \nCollins, and Hatch, also were instrumental in drafting this important \nlegislation.\n  Finally, it is difficult to pass legislation of this magnitude \nwithout the assistance and diligence of dedicated staff. Most of those \nstaff members have been recognized already. I do want to thank members \nof my own staff, in particular Dean Rosen, Helen Rhee, Shana Christrup, \nand Doug Campos-Outcalt, a fellow in my office. I would also like to \nrecognize the contributions of Vince Ventimiglia, Katy French, and \nSteve Irizzary of Senator Gregg's staff; David Nexon, Paul Kim, David \nBowen, and David Dorsey of Senator Kennedy's staff; Raissa Geary of \nSenator Enzi's staff; Kate Hull of Senator Hutchinson's staff; and Mike \nSeyfert and Lisa Meyer of Senator Roberts' staff.\n  Finally, with this bill we will take away one of the most formidable \nweapons in the terrorist arsenal, and that is our own vulnerability.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the chairman for yielding me that time. I, too, \nwish to add my words of gratitude for the work that has been done on \nthis bipartisan, comprehensive bioterrorism legislation. Under the \nleadership of Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Gregg, and Senator \nFrist, as well as a number of others of our colleagues, we are about to \npass legislation that I think will make a significant difference in the \nhealth, safety, and preparedness of our Nation. Americans know we \ncannot wait for another bioterrorism incident such as the one we \nsuffered last fall with respect to the anthrax attacks before we take \naction to protect ourselves.\n  This bill contains a number of critical provisions that will improve \nnational, State, and local preparedness. The authorization of a \nnational stockpile of vaccines, antibiotics, and other drugs necessary \nin the case of an outbreak or other incident is absolutely essential.\n  Furthermore, the emphasis on public health is long overdue, as \nSenator Frist so eloquently stated. This bill will invest over $1 \nbillion in grants to our States to assure the adequate planning that is \nnecessary to improve State and local public health system preparedness.\n  I know all of us were surprised when we learned that many public \nhealth offices were more in the early 20th century with respect to \ntheir equipment and communications capability than in the early 21st \ncentury. They didn't have fax machines or e-mail capabilities. One of \nthe problems we encountered with respect to our efforts to get ahead of \nthe anthrax outbreaks and attacks was, in fact, the inability to \ncommunicate at different levels of government.\n  The underinvestment in our public health infrastructure has been \nunacceptable. Now we are about to reverse it. This is long overdue and \nto be applauded.\n  I also appreciate the bill authorizing $520 million to equip \nhospitals to respond to bioterrorism.\n  After 9-11, when we had our hospitals on alert to try to take care of \nwhat we at the time thought would be thousands of injured people--\nunfortunately, it turned out to be thousands of deaths and relatively \nfew people who were injured--we found we were not prepared because we \ncould not perform many of the functions that were necessary, not only \nto respond to the attacks but the aftermath.\n  For example, many of the first responders went, after their duties at \nthe Ground Zero site, to be decontaminated. There was no \ndecontamination system. Many ended up at our hospitals in New York and \nwere in very cramped and totally insufficient situations to try to \ndecontaminate them before they went back to Ground Zero.\n  That is just one example of what we determined was absolutely \nunacceptable, given the threats we currently face. So we will be \nproviding training and other provisions to promote the development and \nproduction of treatments and what is necessary for our hospitals to be \nprepared.\n  I also applaud the inclusion of strong provisions to safeguard our \nfood supply\n\n[[Page S4780]]\n\nand to provide for the protection of our children. We are finally \ncoming into the recognition that we have not protected our food supply, \nnow that we are in a global marketplace, the way we need to. These \nprovisions that are included are ones that I and others have long \nbelieved were absolutely essential to establishing a registration \nsystem for food manufacturers, to give the FDA records \ninspection authority to trace back investigations, to provide for prior \nnotice of imported food, to allow the cross-utilization of inspectors--\nboth from USDA and FDA--to provide grants for surveillance and \nprotection, and to improve the surveillance of diseases affecting both \nanimals and humans.\n\n  I am very pleased, too, that this bill contains provisions I \nintroduced in legislation, along with Senator Dodd and Congresswoman \nSlaughter from New York, to address the special needs of children.\n  We know children have special vulnerabilities, and we also know \nbiological and chemical agents can have a particularly bad and \ndifferent effect on children because children are lower to the ground \nwhere we have gases that are dense and inert. We have other challenges \nin dealing with what happens to our children dealing with a \nbioterrorism attack. We have therefore established a national advisory \ncommission on children and bioterrorism, and we will do much more to \ntry to provide guidance on how best to protect our children.\n  I also applaud the provision of $100 million to keep Plum Island, off \nthe coast of New York, at its current biosecurity level and to \nmodernize and improve the security of the facilities.\n  Also, I think it is essential we are adding to our security at water \nsystems and expanding the availability of potassium iodide for \ncommunities near nuclear powerplants, such as Indian Point near where I \nlive.\n  While we have taken such strong steps related to bioterrorism and \nchildren and food security and water security, I do have to express a \ndisappointment that we were unable to include the codification of the \npediatric rule that would require the testing of drugs that might be \nprescribed for our children. Senators Dodd and DeWine and I have \nintroduced legislation to bring this about. Unfortunately, we were \nunable to attain support to have it included. But we will be taking \nsteps, through a markup at the committee level and then with \nlegislation, to try to ensure that the drug manufacturers to whom we \nhave given access to an improved streamlined drug approval process--\nwhich we all support--also will be assuring us that the drugs needed by \nour children are safe and properly labeled.\n  This is a very good bill. There obviously are some features that \nshould be included to make us stronger in the future, but I applaud my \ncolleagues, and particularly those who shepherded it through the \nconference, for making us, today, safer than we would have been \notherwise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Chair advise us as to the present status?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has almost 11 \nminutes remaining, and the Senator from Massachusetts has almost 10 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy for \npursuing this bill. I certainly support it. As part of the fight \nagainst terrorism, we must dedicate the resources to the growing threat \nof bioterrorism. This legislation enhances the capabilities of Federal, \nState, and local governments to coordinate emergency preparedness \nefforts, to stockpile vaccines and medical supplies, to modernize \nbiosecurity facilities, and try to ensure the safety of America's \nhealth and food supply.\n  I worked with my colleague, Senator Pat Roberts, to address the \nconcerns about our food supply and vital agricultural economies. The \nagricultural bioterrorism provisions in this legislation will authorize \nthe Department of Agriculture to strengthen its capacities to identify, \nprepare for, and respond to the bioterrorist threats to our farms, \nranches, and food processing, packaging, and distribution facilities \nand systems.\n  We have a clear priority to ensure the safety of our food and to \nmaintain public confidence. To do so we must identify and quickly \ncontrol the threat to our food supply, currently the world's safest, \nmost abundant, and affordable.\n  During the cold war, we knew the Soviet Union had bioweapons that \nincluded bioagents aimed at agriculture. Following the gulf war, we \nknow our soldiers showed evidence of possible exposure to chemical and \nbiological weapons. From the terrorist attacks on Japan's subway system \nwith sarin gas to the recent anthrax attacks here in the United States, \nthe public is now acutely aware of bioterrorist threats.\n  This bill is critical, both for the results it will achieve and the \nreassurance it will provide.\n  The Department of Agriculture will be expanded to enhance inspection \ncapability, implement new information technology, and develop methods \nfor rapid detection and identification of plants and animal disease.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Veterinarian Services will also \nbe authorized to establish cooperative agreements with State animal \nhealth commissions and private veterinarian practitioners to enhance \ntheir ability to respond to outbreaks of any animal disease.\n  This bill directs the Department of Agriculture to establish a long-\nterm program of research to enhance biosecurity of U.S. agriculture.\n  America's universities that have demonstrated expertise in animal and \nplant disease research in coordination with State cooperative extension \nprograms will provide the resources and expertise that will prove \ninvaluable in the war on agricultural bioterrorism.\n  The front lines of this war on terrorism lie on our own shores, farms \nand fields, and the States where food is produced. However our States \nare vulnerable, they will meet the challenge, and they will help us in \nthis war on bioterrorism because they will be able to detect the first \nevidence of an attack to protect our citizens, our economy, and our \nfood supply.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill before us today. I \nappreciate the hard work that went into making it come to the floor and \nmaking it the priority that it should be for our country.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  MEDICARE PROVISIONS IN BIOTERRORISM\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, some of the provisions in the bioterrorism \nbill have not received much attention. These provisions affect \nMedicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, or \nCHIP.\n  What we have done here is to give the HHS Secretary the ability to \nwaive certain requirements in the face of a bioterror event or other \npublic health emergency.\n  For example, the bill would give the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services the ability to pay providers for services rendered in \ngood faith during an emergency, even if certain paperwork or other \nregulations are not followed.\n  In short, the bill gives our federal health programs the flexibility \nthey need to operate in times of emergency, while ensuring \naccountability if the waiver authority is ever used. The administration \nasked Congress for these provisions, and Senator Grassley and I both \nagreed that they are needed.\n  I also want to add that the Medicare and Medicaid provisions in this \nlegislation were hammered out together in a bipartisan and bicameral \nfashion. Although Senator Grassley and I were not conferees, our staffs \nworked extensively with the conference staffs to negotiate these \nprovisions.\n  In fact, all of the authorizing Committees, both sides of the aisle \nand both House and Senate, worked together on these provisions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, allowing items within the jurisdiction \nof the Finance Committee to be added in conference is not something I \ndo lightly. It is critical that we follow regular order, and that \ncommittees of jurisdiction hold hearings and examine proposals before \nthe Senate acts. This is, however, an exceptional situation.\n  In light of the current threats to our nation, we must make these \nchanges to\n\n[[Page S4781]]\n\nmake our Federal health care programs more flexible, and more \nresponsive to patients, in times of crisis. In my view, this is \nimportant enough to make an exception to our general rule of asserting \nour committee's jurisdiction. Also urgent are two provisions that \nstabilize Medicare managed care plans, which many seniors have come to \nrely on.\n  And as Senator Baucus mentioned, our staffs worked closely with the \nconferees' staffs to make sure that we were comfortable with the \nprovisions that were included.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is right. And briefly, in addition to the \nwaiver provisions that affect Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP, this \nlegislation includes a provision that will suspend the Medicare+Choice \n``lock-in'' requirement for three years.\n  Current law requires Medicare beneficiaries to remain in their \nmanaged care plan for the full year. HMOs and beneficiary advocacy \ngroups have both urged Congress to suspend this requirement as a way to \nstabilize this program.\n  While I appreciate the argument that a plan and a beneficiary should \nbe required to make a full one-year commitment, I don't believe that \nthis is the time to implement the lock-in requirement. Plans are \npulling out of the Medicare program every year. Thousands of \nbeneficiaries have lost the plans in their area. Because of the current \ninstability in the program, it is my view that Congress should wait \nuntil the program is more stable before we implement the lock-in.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree, and believe that we have got to take other \nsteps to ensure that seniors understand the choices they have even \nbefore the lock-in is in place. I have always believed that informed \nhealth care choice is the key to a successful Medicare+Choice system. \nThat is why I fought hard in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act for the \nNational Medicare Education Project, which required CMS--then called \nHCFA--to start a 1-800 number and to send out detailed plan comparison \nmaterials to every senior every year. I think this program has been a \nsuccess, and I intend to push for additional funding for it this year. \nBut Medicare education needs even more improvement, especially before \nseniors get locked-in to a specific plan for a whole year. So I think \nit is important that this bill delays the lock-in requirement. I would \nalso like to point out that our doing so today is in sync with recent \nrecommendations from the Advisory Panel on Medicare Education.\n  Finally, the bill gives health plans an additional three months to \nassess their costs before making a decision to participate in the \nMedicare program. Because of exceptional circumstances with respect to \ntiming, we needed to make this change to the so-called ``ACR filing \ndate'' now--prior to the time the Finance Committee acts on Medicare \nlegislation. As I have mentioned, I am not normally willing to make \nexceptions to Finance Committee jurisdiction, but the circumstances \nhere justify such an exception in this case.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Let me summarize by saying that I agree with my good \nfriend Senator Grassley, that every so often there are circumstances \nthat warrant an exception to our jurisdictional concerns, and this is \none of them.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I believe that bodes well for our future work together \non Medicare legislation in the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, indeed. I look forward to working together in a \nbipartisan and bicameral fashion on all the other Medicare, Medicaid, \nand health issues that the Congress will be working on this summer and \nfall.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to give strong support to H.R. \n3448, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and \nResponse Act. The Nation is looking to Congress to provide the building \nblocks to prepare for and respond to bioterrorism. H.R. 3448 takes \nseveral good steps to coordinate and strengthen Federal programs and \nhelp states and communities prepare for bioterrorism and other public \nhealth crises. As an original cosponsor of the Senate companion bill, I \nam proud to support the final product. The work that the bill managers \nand their staff have done in preparing this important legislation is to \nbe commended.\n  H.R. 3448 provides $1.1 billion in funding for grants to state and \nlocal governments to prepare response plans, buy equipment, and train \nhealth care workers for bioterrorism and other public health \nemergencies, and an additional $520 million for community hospitals. \nThe Act authorizes funding and establishes safety procedures for \nscientists to use pathogens for vaccine and disease research. H.R. 3448 \nbuilds up many of the Nation's resources that have been weakened from \nyears of neglect and also addresses several new concerns.\n  Early detection of a biological threat is critical in minimizing the \nnumber of people exposed to an agent and the extent that the agent or \ndisease will spread. New tools capable of detecting small quantities of \ninfectious agents in food, water, air and other vectors are needed. For \nthis reason, I introduced S. 1560, the Biological Agent-Environmental \nDetection Act of 2001. I am pleased to see provisions of my bill \nincluded in H.R. 3448, especially the authorization of funding to \nimprove testing, verification, and calibrating of new detection and \nsurveillance techniques and tools. Scientists and engineers in our \nuniversities and national labs are conducting exciting research on air \nand water monitoring and developing satellite-based remote sensing \ntechnologies to identify weather patterns that contribute to the spread \nof infectious disease and biological or chemical attacks. I am \nconvinced that these men and women can develop robust, effective, and \naccurate detection methods.\n  Creating a critical line of defense against bioterrorism must involve \nhealth care professionals. Through hearings and discussions with health \ncare providers and bioterrorism experts, it is clear that our doctors \nand nurses are not trained to recognize or respond to bioterrorism. For \nthis reason, Senator Rockefeller and I introduced S. 1561, \nStrengthening Bioterrorism Preparedness Through Expanded National \nDisaster Medical System Training Programs. I am pleased that H.R. 3448 \nincludes our proposal to use the existing emergency communication \ninfrastructure, disaster training program, and community partnerships \nwithin the nation's 163 Veterans Affairs hospitals to train VA and \nDepartment of Defense staff and local health care providers in \nrecognizing and treating victims of biological weapons.\n  This is but one way in which the Department of Veterans Affairs \nserves the nation in bioterrorism preparedness and public health. The \n$133 million dedicated to VA will expand these efforts and is well \ndeserved.\n  Congress has not forgotten the role our local and community hospitals \nwill play in such a crisis. We also are working to give our medical \nprofessionals, public health officials, and emergency managers the \nearliest possible warning of pending outbreaks. The problems we face \nwith bioterrorism are not new, nor are they related solely to \nbioterrorism. Our hospitals lack the capacity to handle even a handful \nof extra patients during flu season, let alone hundreds of people \nseeking critical care during an intentional epidemic. Passing the \nPublic Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act \nis only the first step in making America safer. Now we can provide the \nhard working men and women in public service, academia, and private \nindustry with the resources needed to continue protecting this country \nfrom bioterrorism.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Public \nHealth Security and Bioterrorism Response Act. This act represents a \ncritically important turning point in the readiness of our public \nhealth system to respond to the challenge of bioterrorism. In many \nplaces in our Nation the public health infrastructure has been \nunderfunded and understaffed. The anthrax attack has demonstrated that \nour system can be overwhelmed by a bioterrorist attack. This bill \nprovides essential assistance to our network of local and state health \ndepartments, public health laboratories, hospitals and health care \nfacilities so that they can protect all of us in the event of further \nbioterrorist attack, or of other infectious disease outbreaks.\n  We in Minnesota have long been aware of the dangers of bioterrorism \nthanks to the efforts of Mike Osterholm, head of the Center for \nInfectious Disease Research and Policy\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n\nat the University of Minnesota. I am very glad that this bill is \nproviding for the kind of bioterrorism preparedness our nation needs.\n  This bill provides block grants to states to improve public health \ndepartments and to get the equipment they need, and to help local \ngovernments safeguard their communities from these threats. The bill \nalso provides grants to hospitals and other health care facilities to \nimprove their abilities to respond quickly and effectively to a \nbioterrorist attack. I am pleased that the authorization for our \nhospitals has been increased from $370 to $520 million. I am also glad \nthis bill emphasizes getting funds to the local level. That is very \nimportant. In fact, I would have even gone further in setting aside \nfunds specifically for localities. I am also glad that the antitrust \nexemption in the Senate bill has been dropped from the conference \nreport.\n  As Chair of the Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training, I am \nparticularly glad that this bill recognizes the threat of bioterrorism \nin the workplace. Virtually all of the anthrax attacks involved places \nwhere people work, including media offices, the U.S. Postal Service and \nhere in the Congress. I am especially happy that this bill includes \nlanguage which I had suggested to direct the National Institute of \nOccupational Safety and Health to expand research on the health and \nsafety of workers who are at risk for biological threats or attacks in \nthe work place.\n  Finally, I am particularly pleased that my provisions regarding \nmental health were included in this important bill. We know from the \noutstanding hearings on mental health and terrorism, chaired by Senator \nKennedy in the HELP Committee, that the preparedness and response \nactivities for the mental health consequences of bioterrorism are as \nimportant as all other public health initiatives this Congress can \nsupport. Recent press reports citing research on the psychological \nconsequences of exposure to terrorist attacks, as well as the necessity \nof dealing with ongoing threats, have demonstrated clearly that mental \nhealth is an integral part of our ability to respond appropriately to \nbioterrorism attacks.\n  I am particularly pleased that Public Health Security and \nBioterrorism Response Act established mental health response \npreparedness as one of the primary goals in our national initiative The \nmental health provisions in the bill will support federal, state, and \nlocal efforts to enhance the preparedness of public health institutions \nto coordinate mental health services. The bill also establishes as one \nof the primary responsibilities of the federal Working Group on \nBioterrorism and Other Public Health Emergencies to make \nrecommendations regarding the preparedness of public health \ninstitutions and emergency service personnel to detect, diagnose, and \nrespond appropriately with regard to mental health needs in the \naftermath of a biological threat or attack.\n  A special focus on children's mental health was established through a \nrequired National Advisory Committee on Children and Terrorism, whose \nresponsibilities include making recommendations regarding the \npreparedness of the mental health care system to respond to \nbioterrorism as it relates to children. Similarly, a required Emergency \nPublic Information and Communications Advisory Committee will include \nexperts on behavioral psychology among its members and will make \nrecommendations on appropriate ways to communicate public health \ninformation regarding bioterrorism. The bill also includes mental \nhealth training as one of the designated funding activities, \nspecifically to enhance the training of health care professionals to \nrecognize and treat the mental health consequences of bioterrorism or \nother public health emergencies. And finally, the bill authorizes \nfunding for mental health counseling programs to be coordinated by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to develop and maintain various \nstrategies for providing mental health counseling and assistance to \nlocal and community emergency response providers, veterans, active duty \npersonnel, and individuals seeking care at Department VA medical \ncenters following a bioterrorist attack or other public health \nemergency. The VA program also includes funding for training and \ncertification programs.\n  We know one for thing for sure. It is a mistake to believe that \nbioterrorism events cannot have lasting impact on the mental health of \nthe individuals who experience them. Let us not repeat the mistakes \nthat were made in the aftermath of the Vietnam war, when the trauma \nexperienced by veterans and their families was ignored or trivialized \nuntil well after the optimal time for treatment was past. We have \nlearned from the outstanding research funded by the National Institute \nof Mental Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs regarding the \nseverity of the trauma-related disorders and the effective ways in \nwhich it can be treated. We must ensure that all federal, state, and \nlocal public health efforts to respond to and prepare for bioterrorist \nattacks take advantage of this knowledge.\n  I do not believe that mental health problems are a widespread or \ninevitable consequence of bioterrorist attacks. But as we heard from \nthe experts at the HELP Committee hearing, we should not underestimate \nthe severe impact that these events have on people's sense of identity \nand safety, and how the multiple losses and horrific experiences they \ngo through has the potential to affect them for a long while. There \nhave been many reports in the media of the heightened sense of anxiety \nand vulnerability throughout our country. These feelings are normal and \nI have confidence that most Americans will be able to deal with these \ncrises. But I also firmly believe that the Federal, State, and local \ngovernments can play a major role in helping people to understand what \nhas happened to them, and establish programs for mental health services \nfor those who will need it. We in Congress are doing our part by the \ninclusion of these mental health initiatives within this bill.\n  In closing, this bill represents an essential step forward in \nsafeguarding both the physical and mental health of our nation in the \nevent of further bioterrorist attack.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last year, the weakness of our Nation's \nability to respond to a bioterrorist attack was exposed. To properly \nprepare for the future, we must begin to think of our Nation's public \nhealth system as the front lines in our battle against terrorism. \nUnfortunately, our troops were inexperienced, our radar was out of \ndate, and we were short on ammunition. Right now we don't have enough \nvaccines to protect every American. Public health officials were \nwithout the tools and training they need to detect an outbreak and \nrapidly respond.\n  Prudence demanded action. That is why Senator Specter, Senator Byrd \nand I crafted and passed a $3.6 billion bioterrorism initiative to \nreverse this alarming trend. As a result of this effort, our Nation's \ndefenses against bioterrorism has improved since September 11 and the \nanthrax attacks of last October, but much more still needs to be done.\n  As chairman of the Labor-Health and Human Services Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I held several hearings with a broad variety of people, \nranging from leaders of the Federal Government to first responders to \nour local public health workers.\n  As a conferee for the bioterrorism bill, I'm proud of the bipartisan \nwork we have been able to achieve on this plan to boost our Nation's \nbioterrorism prevention and preparedness. The initiatives included in \nthis conference report will build on the Harkin-Specter bioterrorism \nplan that President Bush signed into law in January, and will \naggressively ramp-up efforts to keep America the safest country in the \nworld.\n  I am especially supportive of the provisions in this conference \nreport that I proposed in a seven-point plan I released following the \nanthrax attack last fall.\n  Specifically, the measure will:\n  Increase training for public health and medical officials: State and \nlocal officials, as well as doctors, nurses and other health \nprofessionals will be trained in diagnosis and treatment of \nbioterrorism exposure, as well as rapid communication to colleagues on \ncase exposure and the identification of trends.\n  Bolster vaccine stockpiles: Currently our stockpile of small pox \nvaccines could only vaccinate about 25 percent of Americans, and our \nanthrax vaccine\n\n[[Page S4783]]\n\nstockpiles are also vastly inadequate. This legislation will increase \nfunding to increase supplies and improve systems of transport to make \nsure that the appropriate pharmaceuticals can quickly get where they \nare needed.\n  Ensure that there are round-the-clock disease investigators in every \nstate: A number of states have no full-time experts charged with \nidentifying and dealing with infectious diseases. Federal support can \nbe used to ensure that every single state has at least one professional \nin charge of detecting disease and notifying proper authorities.\n  Increase hospital surge capacity: The conference report will increase \nfunding for planning and staffing to meet possible high-volume cases of \ninfectious disease exposure. Funds would be administered through an \ninnovative grant program that provides support for wide-ranging \ninitiatives that will improve state and local hospital preparedness for \nresponse to bioterrorism and other public health threats.\n\n  Improve surveillance and information sharing capacity at all levels \nof government: The legislation will ensure that all local health \ndepartments have access to the Health Alert Network. Currently, health \ndepartments in some states don's have fax machines and Internet access. \nFunding will expand the Health Alert Network so that health \nprofessionals are able to quickly key in on outbreaks and share their \ninformation around the country and the world.\n  Expand food safety inspections: Through this bill, every domestic and \nimporter of processed foods must register with the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, farms, restaurants and nonprofit food \nestablishments like soup kitchens are exempted. Also the FDA's \nauthority is expanded to allow them to stop any food or product that \nmay present a public health risk and allows the agency to ban importers \nwho repeatedly violate food safety regulations. Lastly, the FDA is \ngiven authority to inspect food processing establishment's records \nrelated to food safety. Currently the FDA can only get such records \nthrough court action.\n  Create and maintain a comprehensive database of the locations of \nbiohazardous pathogens: Finally, this legislation will for the first \ntime require that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and \nAgriculture closely regulate and register the possession, use and \ntransfer of the most dangerous pathogens like anthrax and small pox. \nSecurity standards for these facilities will be established, and all \npeople with access to the agents will be screened. Facilities with \nthese pathogens will be inspected, and violation of these rules will be \npunishable by strict criminal and civil penalties.\n  Again I am very pleased to support this conference report and I look \nforward to continuing to work in a strong bipartisan process with the \nPresident, Secretary Thompson and the rest of the administration to \nmake sure adequate funding is provided for these critically important \ninitatives.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the Senate is going to pass landmark \nlegislation today bolstering our Nation's efforts to prepare against \nfuture bioterrorist threats and attacks. As a member of the joint \nHouse-Senate bioterrorism conference committee, I am pleased to support \nthis conference report.\n  Eight months ago, five U.S. citizens died due to anthrax, buildings \nwere shut down, and thousands of Americans were tested for possible \nexposure. Our country learned first hand about the need for improved \nknowledge about biological weapons and agents--how to detect them, what \nto do in the case of exposure, and the need for accelerated research \nand development of countermeasures to defend against such agents.\n  The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response \nAct provides for the development of vaccines and drugs to defend \nagainst biological agents or toxins, improvement of public health \nemergency response efforts, tightening of requirements for individuals \nwho use and possess biological agents or toxins, enhancement of \nprotections for our food supply and agricultural research facilities, \nand the development of emergency response plans and security upgrades \nfor our Nation's water systems.\n  I would like to particularly highlight provisions in the conference \nreport to speed approval of vaccines and drugs developed as \ncountermeasures against biological weapons, improve security at \nfacilities where such countermeasures are researched and developed, and \nstrengthen federal penalties for acts of sabotage against such \nfacilities.\n  These provisions I introduced as part of freestanding legislation \nlast November, S. 1635, along with Senators Gregg and Frist. I believe \nthat these provisions are at the heart of our preparedness for future \nbioterrorist threats and attacks.\n  I am thankful to my fellow Senate and House conferees for working \nwith me to include a proposal I offered to provide grants for \nproficiency testing of laboratory personnel in identifying biological \nagents and toxins. Laboratory personnel will be on the front lines of \nour detection efforts, and we must make sure they can identify \nbiological toxins and agents.\n  All States, including Arkansas, will benefit from grants to improve \nplanning and State preparedness efforts, enhance laboratory capacity \nand educate and train health care personnel. I am also pleased with the \ninclusion of $5 million in grants for small community water systems in \norder to conduct vulnerability assessments, prepare emergency response \nplans, and make security upgrades.\n  In summary, this is comprehensive legislation and it is needed \nlegislation. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness \nand Response Act lays the foundation for significant changes in \nAmerica's infrastructure, training, and response programs to protect \nour Nation's citizens against deadly weapons, particularly biological \nand chemical agents.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today we will have the opportunity to \nact positively on one of the most important pieces of legislation that \nwe will consider in this Congress--the Public Health Security and \nBioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. I am pleased that \nwe are able to vote today on this most vital piece of legislation. Many \nof our colleagues have worked very hard on this legislation but would \nlike to take this opportunity at the outset of these comments to \nacknowledge the work of Senator Kennedy, and Senator Frist for \noriginally introducing this bill in the Senate, as well as Congressman \nTauzin and Congressman Dingell for their work in the House.\n  From the events on September 11, and the anthrax incidents here in \nour Capitol and around the country, we know first hand that terrorist \nattacks on America continue to pose a real threat. We are not immune to \nthe cowardly attempts by well-armed and well-financed groups who intend \nharm upon us, and we must continue to stand strong against those that \nresent our nation's unyielding commitment to preserve freedom \nthroughout the world.\n  Today, Congress is taking a step in the right direction. The Public \nHealth Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 \nsolidifies the emergency measures taken last fall by Congress to \nsafeguard the health of all Americans. The Act greatly enhances our \nability to prevent and detect bioterrorist threats, and it gives us the \nresources we need in order to effectively care for our citizens in the \nevent that another biological attack takes place on American soil.\n  The act is a comprehensive, interdepartmental effort to ensure the \nsafety of American families. This legislation will ensure proper \ncommunication across Federal agencies so that all of our available \nresources are put to their best use. As the cornerstone of our \nemergency response to public health threats, hospitals will be provided \nample resources in order to ensure their preparedness in the event of a \nbiological attack. In addition, we have greatly enhanced our ability to \ntrack labs and individuals who possess materials that could be used in \nbioweapons aimed at people or the food we consume, and there are strong \nmeasures taken to further protect the food supply throughout America.\n  A primary focus of our efforts is to ensure a National Pharmaceutical \nStockpile, and to increase production of vaccines for some of the most \ndeadly diseases, including smallpox. There are also provisions for more \ntimely FDA review of generic drugs, and it reauthorizes the \nPrescription Drug User\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\nFee Act, PDUFA, an important measure to ensure that newly developed \ndrugs are made available to those who need them most in a safe and \ntimely fashion.\n  I am also pleased that this bill includes language requiring drinking \nwater systems across the country to assess their vulnerability to \nterrorist attack and to develop emergency response plans to prepare for \nand respond to such attacks. We all hope there is no need for \nimplementation of these plans, but information leads to preparation, \nand I am pleased to have a bill today that recognizes the crucial \nimportance of assessing and addressing potential vulnerabilities.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I have \nworried about the lack of information within the Federal agencies about \nthe security of our Nation's critical infrastructure and facilities. \nFor instance, I am aware of one provision in the Clean Air Act which \nrequires the Department of Justice to assess the vulnerabilities of \nchemical plants. This provision was enacted years before the tragic \nevents of September 11th, but the assessment is not yet complete. And \nrecently, in the wake of criticism that our government should have been \nmore prepared for terrorist attacks, I read a chilling statement from a \ngovernment official: ``People are saying we didn't connect the dots. \nIt's awfully hard to connect the dots if people don't give you the \ndots.''\n  I do not doubt that industry, communities, local and State \ngovernments and emergency responders are taking security measures \nseriously. But important provisions in this bill will enable our \ngovernment to ``connect the dots,'' that is, to understand the safety \nof our Nation's water supply. The substantial funding in this bill will \nprovide enhanced resources for completion of vulnerability assessments \nquickly, and in a thorough manner. And by requiring that these \nassessments be provided to the Environmental Protection Agency, we will \nhave the ability to evaluate the security needs of our drinking water \nsystems and to measure our national preparedness for potential threats \nagainst our water supply.\n  In addition, we have addressed the concern that some information in \nthese assessments may be sensitive in nature. Although we recognize \nthat it is most often community knowledge and involvement that is most \neffective in addressing a community's needs, we also recognize that \ninformation in the wrong hands can endanger a community. This bill \nbalances these competing concerns by exempting the content of the \nassessments from the Freedom of Information Act, by requiring \nimplementation of protocols to secure and limit access to the documents \nat the EPA, and by imposition of criminal penalties upon persons \ndesignated by the EPA Administrator to have access to the documents in \nEPA's possession who knowingly or recklessly disclose those documents. \nIt is important to note, however, that there is not a restriction on \nEPA's discussing the content of the assessments with persons who may \nbenefit from information about the security of our nation's water \nsupply, such as state and local officials, nor is there restriction \nintended by this bill upon a water system's voluntarily sharing \ninformation with other systems, emergency responders or communities. \nOur attempt to provide a safeguard against broad disclosure of \nsensitive information does not lead us to conclude that our citizens \nshould not have the information they need to protect and inform \nthemselves.\n  Finally, I had hoped that this bill would encompass wastewater \nsystems in addition to drinking water systems. I intend to pursue \ncomparable legislation for wastewater systems in this legislative \nsession.\n  This legislation reflects a remarkable effort that drew from the \njurisidictions of several Senate and House Committees including the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions, the Energy and Commerce, \nFinance, Ways and Means, Agriculture, Judiciary and my own Environment \nand Public Works. The many Members from these Committees and the \nconferees are to be commended for their contributions.\n  Once again I want to acknowledge the yeoman's work done by our staff. \nIn particular I want to recognize HELP Committee staff including, David \nNexon, Paul Kim, David Bowen and David Dorsey from Chairman Kennedy's \noffice; Vince Ventimiglia, Steve Irizarry and Katy French of Ranking \nMember, Senator Gregg's office; and the staff of Senator Frist, \nincluding Dean Rosen, Helen Rhee and Shanna Christrup, and Doug Campos-\nOutcalt. Credit also goes to Debra Barrett, Raissa Geary, Adam Gluck, \nKate Hull and Rhonda Richards. Finally, I want to acknowledge my own \nstaff, Sean Donohue, Eric Silva, Allison Taylor and Jo-Ellen Darcy who \nworked diligently to ensure that appropriate public health safeguards \nwere part of this measure, including environmental provisions that will \nhelp provide for the safety of our public water systems.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise in strong support of passage of \nthe conference report for H.R. 3448, the Public Health and Bioterrorism \nResponse Act.\n  This legislation will make our Nation better prepared for \nbioterrorist threats and other public health emergencies.\n  That is why I am pleased that this bill includes funding to bolster \nthe National Pharmaceutical Stockpile, including enough smallpox \nvaccine to protect every American.\n  We must ensure that there are sufficient vaccines, drugs, and medical \nsupplies available to protect Americans against any potential \nbiological attack. I believe this bill moves us one step closer to \nprotecting every American from this threat.\n  It is also crucial that we assist our States and local hospitals and \nhealth departments in beefing up their systems, including training \npersonnel and first-responders on how to respond to a bioterrorism \nattacks.\n  This legislation includes $1.6 billion for fiscal year 2003 to \naddress these needs.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conference report includes a \nprovision which I sponsored along with Senator Judd Gregg, R-NH, \nestablishing strict new controls for laboratories that handle anthrax, \nsmallpox, and more than 30 other deadly pathogens.\n  These provisions are the product of extensive negotiations with a \nnumber of other Senators including, Senator Frist, Kennedy, Harkin, and \nDurbin, as well as House Conferees, and the administration.\n  The threat of biological attacks became front page news last fall, \nwhen deadly anthrax attacks killed five people, infected 23 people, 11 \nwith inhalation anthrax and 12 with cutaneous anthrax, and shut down a \nSenate office building for 3 months.\n  The FBI has poured extraordinary resources into apprehending the \nperpetrator. Over the past 5 months, FBI agents have interviewed more \nthan 5,000 people and offered a $2.5 million reward. Unfortunately, it \nhas been unable to locate a single witness, fingerprint or a match to \nthe handwriting found on the envelopes.\n  We still do not know when or if the perpetrator will be found.\n  It became clear during the investigation of the anthrax attacks that \nthe regulations governing these dangerous substances were too lax.\n  Our government did not keep track of who possesses these materials.\n  No special registration was required to possess these agents.\n  Nor were background checks conducted on the laboratory personnel who \nhandled or had access to these agents.\n  Under these security conditions, a rogue employee or outside \nterrorist group could easily gain access to some of the most dangerous \npathogens on Earth.\n  To close these loopholes, I introduced the Deadly Biological Agent \nControl Act last fall with Senator Jon Kyl, R-AZ, and a similar \nprovision was approved as part of the fiscal year 2002 Department of \nDefense Appropriations bill.\n  I am pleased that key portions of this legislation were included in \nthe final comprehensive bioterrorism package.\n  The conference report has the following key provisions: All labs that \npossess these dangerous agents would have to get registered with the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services or the Department of \nAgriculture, for animal pathogens.\n  The registration process would include rigorous background screening \nby the Department of Justice of any laboratory employees intending to \nhandle the agents.\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\n  Anyone who possesses these agents without obtaining a registration \nwill be subject to 5 years in Federal prison.\n  The legislation also creates, for the first time, a national database \nof dangerous pathogens, so that the characterization, location and use \nof these agents can be tracked.\n  Tighter controls of these agents are critical because they can be \nconverted into weapons of mass destruction.\n  In addition, to make sure that this list of dangerous agents is kept \nup-to-date, it must be reviewed a minimum of every two years.\n  We need these strong measures because in the wrong hands, these \nbiological agents can be converted into weapons of mass destruction.\n  According to the calculation of some experts, biological weapons are \npound for pound potentially more lethal even than thermonuclear \nweapons.\n  For example, the World Health Organization estimates that 50 \nkilograms of the virus that causes the plague, aerosolized over an \nurban city of 500,000, would incapacitate one fifth of the population \nand kill 55,000.\n  A 1993 report by the U.S. Congressional Office of Technology \nAssessment estimated that between 130,000 and 3 million deaths could \nfollow the aerosolized release of 100 kilograms of anthrax spores \nupwind of the Washington D.C. area, lethally matching or exceeding that \nof a hydrogen bomb.\n  In sum, I believe it is critical that these laboratory security \nprovisions were incorporated into this bioterrorism bill.\n  Any comprehensive bioterrorism preparedness package would be \nincomplete without addressing laboratory security here in the United \nStates.\n  These controls are reasonable and necessary, given the extraordinary \nthreat posed by biological and chemical weapons.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank the members of the bioterrorism conference committee who have \nworked tirelessly over the last few months to craft this comprehensive \nresponse to our Nation's needs in bioterrorism. I rise today to make \none point for the record in regards to this legislation. Following the \nSeptember 11th attacks, Secretary Thompson, under the authority granted \nto him by Section 319 of the Public health Services Act, provided \nresources to rebuild and replenish our Nation's emergency health care \nproviders who were directly affected by this terrible disaster. In sum, \nthe Secretary awarded over $35 million in grants to hospitals, \nambulance companies, and other first responders who responded or stood \nready to respond to the health needs of those injured in the attacks on \nthe World Trade Center and the Pentagon. These awards were made in \nrecognition of the contributions that these providers made, regardless \nof their ownership. I commend the Secretary for this action.\n  Disaster strikes without respect to hospital ownership. By exercising \nhis discretion to award grants to all hospitals who responded, both \nprivate and public, Secretary Thompson recognized this important point \nand more importantly, fulfilled the statutory purpose of Section 319, \nproviding continued access to necessary acute care, Nationally, there \nare 5,194 hospitals, and of those approximately 1,200 are for-profits. \nThat is one out of every four hospitals. In many markets, for-profit \nhospitals--not the tax-exempts--serve as the safety net or sole-\ncommunity providers and that makes them 100 percent of the market in \ntheir communities. In my home State, approximately \\1/3\\ of the \nhospitals are for-profit. If a bio-terrorist attack were to ever happen \nin Louisiana, I can guarantee you that our investor-owned hospitals \nwill play a critical role in the response. Those who are affected by a \nbio-terrorist attack will go to their local hospital for help; they \nwill not check first to see how the hospital is being run.\n  I am pleased that the conferees added language in this bill to \nstrengthen the Secretary's authority to act as he did in this regard \nfollowing September 11th. I hope that this administration and the \nadministrations that follow will continue to recognize the important \nrole that all of our hospitals play in the delivery of emergency health \ncare.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand we have one more speaker on \nour side who is on the way to the floor. I guess there are about 5 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I wish to comment on the efforts of our friend and colleague from New \nYork, Senator Clinton, on the pediatric drug labeling rule.\n  As Senator Clinton pointed out, this issue is of great importance to \nherself, Senator Dodd, and Senator DeWine. Senator Dodd, who is \nchairman of the Children's Caucus, Senator DeWine, and Senator Clinton \nhave worked very effectively on the question of pediatric drugs, \nparticularly on the recent reauthorization of pediatric drug \nexclusivity.\n  I had hoped we would be able to secure the Pediatric Rule in this \nconference, but we were unable to do so. The research which would flow \nfrom this important rule is critical to children. That is why the FDA \nand the Administration took another look at their proposal to suspend \nthe Rule. It was very wise of them to review that decision and to keep \nthe Rule in place. But with the litigation ongoing, it is still being \nchallenged. This is something we in the Senate will give focus and \nattention to in the very near future.\n  I have spoken with Senator Dodd, Senator DeWine, and Senator Clinton. \nThey know that we will address the Pediatric Rule in our committee in \nthe near future. We will talk to our colleagues about the timing. But \nwe will try to address it in the near future. We thank them for their \ncontinued interest.\n  So my colleagues understand what is at stake, let me repeat: without \nthe Rule, there will be less research conducted on the impact of many \ndrugs on children, and some products will not be studied at all.\n  Again, I give my colleagues the assurance that we will pursue this \nissue in the coming months. We can't afford to compromise children's \nhealth.\n  Mr. President, during consideration of the bioterrorism legislation, \nthere were a number of items which our colleagues raised which were \nincluded, a great majority of which were strengthened and which we were \nable to include in the conference report.\n\n  I talked with Senator Carnahan about the importance of developing a \nWeb site on bioterrorism so that accurate and good information would be \navailable and accessible to people across the country. This has been \nincluded. It will provide important, accurate information to the public \nas a result of Senator Carnahan's legislation. We are certain this will \nbe helpful to families, not only in her State but across the country.\n  Senator Tim Johnson had some important proposals on agricultural \nbioterrorism. Those provisions were added to strengthen the food safety \naspects of our legislation. We have included those, not least of which \ncalls for the President's Council on Food Safety to develop in a timely \nbut collaborative manner a national strategy for food security.\n  Senator Wellstone had major proposals on enhancing the FDA's ability \nto protect the public health. We included many of those, particularly \nthose strengthening oversight of drug safety and drug promotions.\n  Senator Daschle was enormously interested in how we were going to \nprotect America's farm families. We have many additional protections \nincluded in the legislation dealing with agroterrorism, such as mad cow \ndisease, which are very important. His work with Senator Roberts led to \na broad increase in resources and requirements for USDA.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wyden). The Senator from Massachusetts has \n6 minutes 10 seconds. The Senator from New Hampshire has 6 minutes 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time be equally charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the information of the membership, we\n\n[[Page S4786]]\n\nunderstand Senator Collins will be coming in a few moments. After she \nspeaks, we intend to yield back the remaining time and move to a vote. \nI anticipate we will have a vote on the conference report in probably \nabout 10 minutes. We will ask for the yeas and nays. So Members should \nbe alerted that we will proceed in that manner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in a moment, I will yield to Senator \nCollins. But let me, again, thank the chairman for the expert and \nprofessional way in which he handled this bill and moved it through the \nprocess. It is not the beginning; it is not the end; it is the middle \nof the process. But as a result of this bill, we will have put in place \nthe mechanisms to produce the vaccines we need as a nation in order to \nprotect ourselves from some of the most virulent biological agents with \nwhich we might be attacked--a very important step.\n  As a result of this bill, we will begin the process of significantly \nupgrading all the public health capabilities across this Nation, \nwhether it is in large States, small States, large cities, small \ncities. That is very critical because, as we learned so well in the \ninstance of 9-11, the public health capability of dealing with a crisis \nis one of the core elements of the first responder, the first line of \ndefense when it comes to a situation resulting from someone attacking \nour Nation, especially with a biological or chemical agent.\n  So these two basic streams of effort, which are the core of this \nbill--the bill has a lot more in it, but that is the core of this \nbill--are going to make, I believe, a dramatic and significant \ndifference in our capabilities as a nation to handle the threat which \nwe, regrettably, confront now of someone using a biological or chemical \nagent against us as a nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes, if she wishes it, if I have \nit, to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, I begin by thanking Senator \nKennedy, Senator Judd Gregg, Senator Bill Frist, and all of those who \nhave worked so hard to bring this important legislation to the floor.\n  I am convinced that the bioterrorism bill to which we are about to \ngive final approval will make a real difference in our Nation's ability \nto detect and, in the unfortunate event, respond to a bioterrorism \nattack.\n  I am particularly pleased that the legislation includes food safety \nprovisions which I have advocated for some time.\n  In 1998, in my capacity as chairman of the Senate Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, I conducted a 16-month investigation \ninto the safety of imported food. What we found was truly frightening. \nWe discovered that the FDA inspects fewer than 1 percent of all \nshipments of imported fruits and vegetables. And we discovered that the \nsafety net for ensuring that imported food was, indeed, wholesome and \nsafe was deeply flawed.\n  We found that an unscrupulous shipper could very easily ship tainted \nfood from one port to another without detection. If the system was that \nvulnerable to an unethical shipper, think what a determined terrorist \ncould do.\n  So I am convinced the provisions included in this bill will make a \nreal difference in helping to ensure the safety of our food supply.\n  I note that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy \nThompson, recently testified before the HELP Committee that one of his \ngreatest concerns was the vulnerability of our food supply.\n  I believe the provisions that are included in this bill will help to \nensure that our food supply is safe from a terrorist attack.\n\n  We have a long way to go in the war against terrorism, but this major \nbioterrorism legislation is an important step in securing the United \nStates of America.\n  Again, I commend the two leaders of our committee and all of those \nwho have worked so hard to bring us to agreement on this important \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, finally, again, I thank my colleague, \nSenator Gregg, and Senator Frist, Senator Collins, and all of our \nMembers for their cooperation and their help.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote in favor of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last Friday, May 17, marked the 1-year \nanniversary of the release of President Bush's National Energy Policy. \nAnd the day after tomorrow, May 25, will mark the one-month anniversary \nof the Senate's completion of its consideration of the Energy Policy \nAct of 2002. I believe that it is appropriate to take stock of where we \nwere 1 year ago, where we are today, and what we need to do next to \nmove this process forward.\n  One year ago, when President Bush released his National Energy Policy \nPlan, his proposal was little more than a glossy brochure. The summary \nof all the recommendations in the President's Plan, which appeared as \nthe first appendix in his report, amounted to a mere 17 pages of text. \nMost of these recommendations were stated in very broad terms, and only \nabout 20 actually related to legislation. A classic example of the \nrecommendations in the President's Plan is the following one relating \nto electricity reform. Here is the electricity recommendation in last \nyear's plan, in its totality:\n\n       The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the \n     Secretary of Energy to propose comprehensive electricity \n     legislation that promotes competition, protects consumers, \n     enhances reliability, promotes renewable energy, improves \n     efficiency, repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act, \n     and reforms the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act.\n\n  That was it for electricity. Now those 44 words include some very \ngood thoughts. I am sure that a lot of work went into developing them. \nBut it wasn't something that Congress could immediately turn around and \nsend to the President's desk for signature.\n  So, over the last year, we have done a tremendous amount of work in \nCongress, and especially in the Senate, to put real flesh on the bones \nlaid out in the President's plan. In the Senate Energy Committee, we \nheld over 2 dozen hearings in this Congress on various aspects of \nenergy policy, seeking to get broad and inclusive input into our bill.\n  In the case of electricity, instead of the 44 words contained in the \nPresident's plan, the Senate developed and passed 80 pages of \nlegislative text on electricity reform. Our provisions sought to give \nreal meaning to the general principles of protecting consumers, \npromoting competition, and promoting renewable energy. We had a lot of \nhelp and input from the Administration, but the work was really done \nhere in the Senate.\n\n  We are now at the beginning of the next phase in the legislative \nprocess. That is conference with the House of Representatives. We have \na lot of work to do, but it cannot begin until the leadership of the \nHouse of Representatives decides who will represent them in a \nconference.\n  I have to confess that I am getting a little frustrated at the delay \nin moving to this next phase. When the Senate passed its bill, the \nHouse majority whip put out a press release calling this body a bunch \nof ``do-nothing Daschlecrats'' and stating:\n\n       Now, it's important that we move quickly to work out the \n     differences between the House and Senate bills.\n\n  I agree with the second part of his comments, but his own colleagues \nin the House of Representatives apparently do not. Senators Daschle and \nLott named our Senate conferees on May 1. After three weeks of silence \nfrom the House on who their conferees might be, it seems that all we \nare getting from the House is a lot of delay.\n  And there is a tremendous amount of work to be done to have a \nsuccessful energy conference, even before we sit down around a table \nsomewhere.\n  First, we will have to decide how the conference will be organized, \nincluding how it will be chaired. We seldom go to conference on energy \nbills. The last conference on an energy bill, the Alaska Power \nAdministration Sale and Asset Transfer Act, took place 7 years ago, in \n1995. The House of Representatives chaired that conference. If one \naccepts the notion that conference chairmanships alternate between the \nHouses, then that means that it is now the Senate's turn to chair an \nenergy conference.\n  And, judging from both the lack of forward motion from the House on \nnaming their conferees and some of the informal comments from the House \nleadership on their vision of what a conference would look like, I \nthink that there might be some important advantages to Senate \nchairmanship of the conference.\n  A number of leading members of the House of Representatives seem to \nbe of the opinion that there should be a lot of televised meetings of \nconferees. I have nothing against openness, but I don't think that lots \nof televised meetings would be conducive to actually getting an energy \nbill out of conference. My prime mission in chairing a conference would \nbe getting a bill, not getting Nielsen ratings. We should regard the \ntime that conferees are actually present in the same room as a limited \nresource, to be used to promote forward motion, and not grand-\nstanding.\n  Second, there have been rumblings that some in the House leadership \nmight prefer to delay a conference until September. There are so many \ncomplex issues to be dealt with in this bill that delay would result in \nno conference report. I would prefer to see us begin work as soon as \nthe organization of the conference itself was worked out, much along \nthe lines of how issues were dealt with during past energy conferences.\n  I am very much looking forward to learning whom we are supposed to be \nnegotiating with from the House of Representatives. I'm not going to \ninitiate discussions with the House of Representatives, though, that \nmight be regarded as attempts to pre-conference\n\n[[Page S4788]]\n\nthe bill, or parts of it, prior to knowing who all the legitimate \nparticipants will be from the House.\n  But once the House has made its selection, I would propose that the \nconferees from both Houses take the following three key steps.\n  First, we should get the conference leadership from both Houses into \na room to get the organization and ground rules of the conference set \ndown as our first order of business.\n  Second, we should have the appropriate Senate and House staffs meet \nto work out a mutually agreed-to side-by-side presentation of the \nbills, so that there is common agreement as to which proposals are \nsimilar enough to be paired up in the negotiations. For the tax \nprovisions, the Joint Committee on Taxation has already prepared a \ndraft side-by-side that can be reviewed by both sides. We need to get \nthe corresponding treatment for the energy policy provisions done in a \nconsensual manner between the two Houses.\n  Third, we will have to decide whether there will be subconferences; \nand if so, how many; and what each will encompass.\n  What I have just laid out is a substantial amount of preparatory work \nthat is now on hold. And time is slipping away from us in this \nCongress. If we adjourn in early October, as is likely, then we may \nhave only 12 or 13 weeks of session left in this Congress. That is less \ntime than one might think, and there will be a lot of other issues that \nwill occupy the time and attention of leading members of this \nconference.\n  I hope we can get started with the critical organizational phase of \nthe discussions as soon as possible. But there is no way that can \nhappen, without knowing who the conferees from the House will be. I \nurge my colleagues in the other body to give this high priority so that \nthe real work can begin.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if my friend will yield for a question.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Recognizing the extended effort that was gone through \nin the time sequence we spent on the floor, I am sure my friend from \nNew Mexico would agree, had we been able to proceed within the \ncommittee process, having the educational activities associated within \nthe committee structure as opposed to on the floor of the Senate, it \nwould have saved us a lot of time. Nevertheless, I think my friend from \nNew Mexico would agree this was a dictate by the Democratic leadership.\n  I think he would also agree that the House did move on their energy \nbill much earlier than we were able to because we had to go through the \nfloor process. I think my friend would agree the general understanding \nis the House intends to name conferees as soon as we return from this \nrecess.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Just to respond, the point my colleague makes is one he \nmade numerous times during the debate of the energy bill here on the \nSenate floor. Clearly, that is his point of view.\n  We were able to produce a bill. I think it is a far superior bill to \nthe one the House produced last summer.\n  The main point I am trying to make is we cannot move any further down \nthe road toward enacting an energy bill unless we get a conference. It \nhas been a month since the Senate passed its bill. It is time the House \nappointed their conferees.\n  Madam President, let me go ahead with the second of the issues I want \nto deal with, and that relates to retirement security. How much time \nremains, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4788-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4788-S4789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RETIREMENT SECURITY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Briefly, what I want to do is summarize these four \npoints.\n  Retirement security is an issue that is of great concern to virtually \nall Americans. I believe there are four essential issues embedded in it \nwhich we need to begin dealing with in this Congress.\n  There has not been much interest on the part of the administration in \ndealing with these issues. If there has been, I missed it. But I \nbelieve Congress needs to take the initiative to begin dealing with it. \nThe four issues I believe deserve the greatest attention are:\n  First of all, We need to recognize that everyone who works in this \ncountry ought to be entitled to a pension of some sort--a pension, a \n401(k), some kind of provision for their retirement in addition to \nSocial Security. I think that should be a goal to which we should all \nagree.\n  Second, all workers should have a right to secure retirement savings. \nWe should eliminate the problems of mismanagement of people's \nretirement savings that we saw in the case of Enron. Senator Kennedy \nhas put together legislation we have reported out of the HELP Committee \nthat tries to close some of those loopholes, eliminate some of those \nabuses, and deal with the looting of retirement savings that \nunfortunately has occurred and is permitted under current law.\n  Third, all workers must have pension portability. This is a difficult \nissue but an important one. Most workers will have somewhere between 10 \nand 15 jobs during their career. That is the way of the modern economy. \nWe need to be sure they can move their pension from job to job and not \nlose their pension benefits because they are forced to change jobs in \nmidcareer.\n  Fourth, all workers should have retirement benefits comparable to \nthose of the highest paid executives in the company. We cannot have one \nset of rules for the top management and a different set of rules for \nthe rest of the people in the employ of that corporation. We need to \nhave comparable tax provisions so there is not a set of tax provisions \nthat allows for the putting away of postretirement income for the top \nexecutives of the company while the average worker of the company is \ndenied a reasonable pension.\n  Last week I came to the floor to talk about our Nation's gap in \npension and retirement plan coverage.\n  Although Enron has been the focus of much of our attention, we cannot \nignore the disturbing trend that pension coverage in our country has \nnot budged from roughly 50 percent coverage over the past 30 years. \nMinorities, particularly Hispanics, fare significantly worse with 73 \npercent of all Hispanics in the private sector not having a retirement \nor pension plan. Quite simply, we must do more.\n  In light of Enron and other corporate abuses, it is patently evident \nthat we must strengthen our retirement and pension laws so that \nemployees' retirement savings are given real protections. We must \nprotect the retirement savings of our workers from unscrupulous \nexecutives who are willing to use their positions to enrich themselves \nat the expense of the employees. We must also be sure that employees \nare protected from various conflicts of interest that allow \naccountants, analysts, and employers to act in their own self-interest \nand financial well being instead of the best interests of the \nemployees. In particular, we must be sure that we do not change the law \nto expose employees to new conflicts of interest, as would occur if we \nallowed conflicted investment advisers to invade the secure world of \nERISA protected retirement plans. Of course, all of these protections \ndon't mean much if employees do not have the ability to diversify out \nof employer securities so that they are not financially ruined when \nthere is an economic downturn or their employer goes out of business. \nSadly, the House-passed bill does not provide any of these protections \nin any meaningful way.\n  Although we have made great strides in the past several years, we \nstill have more to do to be sure workers with traditional pension plans \nare able to take their savings with them when they move on to a new \njob. While retirement plans are more portable than traditional \npensions, we must still make sure that employees have the right to take \nwhat is theirs with them if they change employment. In these cases, \nplan portability is not the only issue, concerns over vesting and the \nability to diversify out of employer stock are equally important.\n  Finally, we need to ensure that executives of companies do not walk \naway from a business with millions in benefits when the employees are \nsent home with a retirement account full of worthless employer stock. \nIt is fair that executives have more money in their retirement \naccounts--that is one of the benefits of being a higher salaried \nemployee. What isn't fair, though,\n\n[[Page S4789]]\n\nis when executives have millions in deferred compensation and other \nexecutive benefits that have been funded by tax-preferenced vehicles \nlike corporate owned life insurance none of which is available to the \nworkers. If a benefit does not meet non-discrimination rules, it is \nunclear to me why a company should be able to be fund these executive \nbenefits through tax-preferred chicanery.\n  As we move into the 21st century it is important that we take note of \nthe state of our private retirement system and work to improve it. Too \nmany Americans still do not have any pension or retirement coverage. \nThat must improve. We must also strengthen our retirement system to \nprovide employees with real protections for their retirement savings--\nnot symbolic changes as proposed by the House and Administration. We \nmust provide our workers with increased pension portability and true \nownership of all their retirement assets. Finally, we must change our \nlaws so that companies are not able to take advantage of loopholes in \nthe Tax Code that give them significant tax relief when funding \nexecutive retirement benefits that are not available to the workers. We \nwill need much than proposed by the administration and passed by the \nHouse if we want a world where ``what's fair on the top floor should be \nfair on the shop floor.'' I hope my colleagues from across the aisle \nare ready to match legislation with their rhetoric. If not, \nunfortunately, this Congress will come to a close with workers once \nagain getting the short end of the bargain.\n  These are very important issues. When we return after this week-long \nrecess, I hope we can put some serious effort into dealing with them. I \ncommit to proposing some legislation to try to help move us in that \ndirection.\n  My time has expired, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4789-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4789-S4792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE EXPANSION ACT--Continued\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of the \ncompromise trade package that is now before the Senate and to praise \nboth sides for recognizing the need of retaining the linkage of trade \npromotion authority (TPA) and trade adjustment assistance (TAA) during \nfloor consideration.\n  I would first like to commend Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member \nGrassley for their efforts in crafting this package.\n  Not only have they worked in a bipartisan manner to ensure that it is \nthe product of principled compromise, but they have also sought to \nensure that many of my concerns regarding the deficiencies of past \nextensions of trade authority--most notably, a lack of accountability \nand consideration of the needs of small businesses--have been \naddressed. In the same manner, both agreed to a critical expansion of \nthe existing TAA program while also including provisions I advocated to \naccelerate assistance to dislocated workers and provide them with \ngreater options in the utilization of these benefits.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for \ntheir tenacity as we worked through the health care provisions in the \nTAA package during the last four weeks. Their commitment to this effort \nmade it possible for the three of us to develop this agreement, and \nwhile both sides have made significant concessions to finalize this \ndeal, we believe these health care provisions are a solid contribution \nto the TAA package.\n  At the beginning of the TPA-TAA debate in the Senate, everyone \nbelieved the fight over health care would doom Senate passage, but \ntogether we have proved them wrong. On that note, I would also like to \ncommend the staff of both Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley who \nworked so hard to develop this compromise against tremendous odds.\n  The Finance Committee has been working on the TPA and TAA legislation \nfor nearly a year now, and, as a member of that committee, I have been \nextensively involved in its development. Through hearings and markups, \nalong with numerous discussions, we have extensively debated this \nlegislation--and will likely continue to do so until the final vote.\n  My decision to support this package, and the TPA section in \nparticular, was by no means a foregone conclusion, as I have opposed \ntrade agreements and fast-track authority in the past. I did so because \nI never felt they struck the proper balance between free and fair \ntrade, and I have been concerned that both Republican and Democrat \nadministrations approached the enforcement of U.S. trade laws not with \nvigor, but with benign neglect.\n  However, when the Finance Committee marked up this fast-track \nlegislation in December, I supported it precisely because it does \nstrike the appropriate balance, and because of this administration's \ncommitment to aggressively enforce our trade laws so that American \nworkers aren't undermined by unfair trade practices.\n  Furthermore, while some oppose linking TPA and TAA as contained in \nthis trade package, my support is contingent on this linkage and I have \nrepeatedly emphasized the importance of joining these proposals that \nare inextricably joined. TAA would not even exist if not for the fact \nthat trade agreements impact U.S. jobs, so attempting to bifurcate TAA \nand TPA is like trying to divide the ``heads'' from the ``tails'' on a \ncoin--sure, it may be possible, but the end product won't be worth one \nred cent!\n  We must never forget that in the engagement of trade there is a \ndownside--chiefly, that real lives are affected--people not just \nstatistics. When Americans become unemployed due to increased imports \nor plant relocations to other countries, it is because of trade \nagreements negotiated by the government of the United States and passed \nby Congress. Therefore, we have no obligation to also work toward \nforging a system that provides these trade-impacted Americans with the \nnew skills needed to gain new employment.\n  And lest anyone question the need or value of the program, consider \nthe fact that TAA has served not only as a life-saver but also as an \nopportunity-creator for individuals to be retrained so they can re-\nenter the workforce as quickly as possible. Since October 1997 to \ntoday, 9,200 Mainers have benefitted from TAA. Nationally, during this \nsame time-frame, almost 1 million people were covered by TAA. In Maine \nright now, 1,102 people are receiving TAA benefits.\n  In fact, in Maine it's been a whole litany of closings from a variety \nof industries since NAFTA: Carleton Woolen Mills lost 600 jobs, Dexter \nShoe Company lost 550 jobs, Kimberly-Clark lost 450 jobs while Mead \nPaper lost 472 jobs and G.H. Bass footwear lost 355 jobs, as did Cole-\nHaan Manufacturing, while Eastland Shoe Manufacturing lost 250 jobs and \nSaucony closed with 110 workers, and just recently, Hathaway Shirts, \none of the oldest and last remaining domestic shirt-makers, with 300 \nworkers. Many of these people turned to TAA.\n  The final provisions of the legislation before us were in question up \nuntil the last minute, but they make vital improvements and expansions \nto the program, including several I have fought for. Specifically, \nbesides consolidating the current TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs into one, \nmore efficient program, the bill includes my proposal to speed up \nassistance to displaced workers by decreasing the TAA petition time for \ncertification from 60 days to 40 days. Reducing this time by 20 days \nwill allow people to get on with their lives that much quicker.\n  The bill also includes my proposal to create a new pilot program \nunder the Small Business Administration (SBA) that will test how TAA \ncan help those seeking to start their own business by assisting with \ndevelopment plans without the loss of their TAA benefits. It also \nallows for customized, employer-sponsored training programs where a \nworker can learn a specialized skill while on the job.\n  And the legislation also establishes a performance accountability and \nreporting system. A concern expressed to me by Maine officials has been \nthat, without taking into account the economic conditions of the \nstates, good systems could be erroneously judged bad due to an economic \ndownturn of a state. By factoring-in this new criteria, we ensure that \nsuch a vital component of the overall picture is part of the equation.\n  Beyond these provisions, the TAA legislation also recognizes the fact \nthat it is not only people but communities\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\nthat can be adversely impacted by job loss or plant relocations. It \ndoes so by creating a new Office of Community Trade Adjustment at the \nEconomic Development Administration (EDA) that will work closely with \nstate and local officials to develop a strategic plan when a community \nsuffers massive layoffs. The Office can dispense grants that could \nprove critical in getting these communities back on track.\n\n  Moreover, this bill addresses another issue that has created problems \nin my state this year--the current budget for training assistance. \nSince last year, Maine has run short of training funds by approximately \n$2.7 million, forcing them to apply for five different Department of \nLabor National Emergency Grants and potentially causing a freeze in \nretraining assistance. By providing $300 million in funding, this \nshortfall will be fully addressed.\n  And we didn't stop there. Not only does this funding level address \nState shortfalls, but it also ensures expanded coverage for secondary \nworkers affected by trade. Specifically, under the compromise developed \nby Senators Grassley and Baucus, secondary workers with a direct \nrelationship to the downsizing or closing of a plant will be covered by \nTAA, while so-called downstream workers covered now under a Statement \nof Administrative Action as part of the NAFTA-TAA program will also be \ncovered through the SAA's codification.\n  And, as I stated earlier, bipartisanship also prevailed on the \ncontentious health care issue. Since the end of last year, the health \ncare provision seemed to be the one that would divide us and perhaps \neven bring down this trade package. Well, Madam President, through the \nhard work and dedication of many offices, this obstacle has been \naverted.\n  The health care compromise included in this agreement provides a 70 \npercent tax credit for trade-impacted workers to continue their health \ncoverage for themselves and their family. This tax credit is \n``advanceable'' so that people will receive this assistance immediately \nrather than paying up front to get a tax refund later. The tax credit \nis also refundable and, as such, provides the full level of the tax \ncredit regardless of whether the individual will owe any taxes that \nyear.\n  Trade-affected workers can use this tax credit toward the cost of \nCOBRA health coverage from their former employer, if that is available, \nor they can purchase private health coverage through purchasing groups, \nstate high-risk pools, or other group purchasing arrangements \nestablished by the states. Workers can also use the tax credit toward \ntheir current private health coverage.\n  Through these and other provisions, what we have before us today is a \nbill that recognizes that our desire to trade is dependent on our \nability to assist those adversely affected by trade. An expanded TAA \nprogram will be part and parcel of an extension of trade negotiating \nauthority--and American workers will be provided with the assistance \nthey need and deserve.\n  In that light, as the world grows ever closer, the implications of \nour trade agreements are more critical--and more magnified--than ever \nbefore. As I mentioned earlier, my past opposition to fast-track, due \nto concerns about the balance between free and fair trade and our \nenforcement of our trade laws, have been addressed in this bill.\n  The bottom line is that enforcement is an inseparable component of \nfree and fair trade. If you don't believe me, just look at the record. \nIn the past, when free trade and fair trade have been treated as \nmutually exclusive, import-sensitive industries in Maine and America \nwere decimated by foreign competitors. Why? Because foreign businesses \nenjoyed the benefits of a lack of reciprocity in trade agreements--\nforeign industry subsidies--dumping in the U.S. market--and nontariff \ntrade barriers. That's why, as a Member of the House in 1986, I \nlamented that we were running up ``the white flag of surrender in the \ninternational marketplace.''\n  The ``white flag'' is perhaps best represented by the shoe industry, \nwhich is one that has borne the brunt of our trade policies. In 1986, \nfor example, it experienced an 82 percent import penetration with over \n750 million pairs of shoes entering this country annually. Japan, on \nthe other hand, allowed only 1 million pairs of shoes to be imported \nand Brazil had a 100 percent tariff effectively barring imports. The \nU.S. industry filed a trade relief petition under section 201, and a \nfive year temporary quota was recommended by the International Trade \nCommission (ITC), but the Administration did not act on it. In short, \nwe abandoned our workers, our industry and our trade policy in the \npursuit of free trade.\n  And the surrender of our rights under our own trade laws has had \nserious consequences in the lives of real people. In Maine alone, we \nlost nearly 15,400 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA's inception, \nincluding 2,400 textile jobs, 6,000 leather products jobs, 500 apparel \njobs, 3,700 paper and allied products jobs, and 4,800 footwear jobs, \nexcluding rubber footwear, and 5,200 manufacturing jobs so far just \nthis year. We failed those people because we abdicated our \nresponsibility to take a balanced, comprehensive and integrated \napproach to trade.\n  That is why I worked to ensure that the ATPA legislation contains at \nleast a 15 year tariff phaseout for rubber footwear, which is supported \nby the domestic industry. As it was originally written, the ATPA would \nhave signaled the end of our rubber footwear industry by setting a \nprecedent for all other countries. How? By matching this tariff \nphaseout to the seven years left under the NAFTA, other countries in \nfuture agreements would unquestionably seek the same.\n  During negotiations over NAFTA, the U.S. industry fought to be \nexcluded but grudgingly accepted a 15 year phaseout as a recognition of \ntheir import-sensitivity. This is exemplified over the past decades by \nthe decrease we've seen in jobs in this industry from 26,000 workers in \nthe early 1970s to 2,600 today. And I might add, more than a third of \nthose remaining jobs are located in Maine. So to have subjected this \nindustry to the same phase-out date as that required by NAFTA would \nhave put them at yet another debilitating disadvantage by depriving \nthem of another eight years of adjustment. So when it comes to ATPA, to \ndo anything but provide at least the 15 years prescribed under NAFTA \nwould have been unconscionable.\n  And while we cannot bring back these or other jobs that were lost due \nto the miscues of the past, we can learn from those miscues and apply \nthe lessons to our present and future actions. We can change our \napproach at the negotiating table. We can enforce existing trade laws.\n  In the real world, we have to acknowledge that there are many nations \nthat don't care about labor or environmental standards. And that \ncreates a tilted playing field where it's harder for us to compete. In \nthat regard, this bill makes significant progress on the issues of \nlabor and the environment and I believe it is both a necessary and \nimportant distinction that separates this proposal from prior \napproaches to fast track. The bill before us today not only sets as an \noverall objective the need to convince our trading partners not to \nweaken their labor or environmental laws as an inducement to trade, but \nit also requires the enforcement of existing labor and environmental \nlaws as a principal negotiating objective.\n  The legislation also recognizes the need to take steps to protect the \nimport sensitive textile and apparel industry. It calls for reducing \ntariffs on textiles and apparels in other countries to the same or \nlower levels than in the U.S., reducing or eliminating subsidies to \nprovide for greater market opportunities for U.S. textiles and \napparels, and ensuring that WTO member countries immediately fulfill \ntheir obligations to provide similar market access for U.S. textiles \nand apparels as the U.S. does for theirs.\n  And this legislation includes new negotiating objectives to address \nthe issue of foreign subsidies and market distortions that lead to \ndumping. As a result, many industries stand to benefit from the \nadoption of this legislation, including the forest and paper, \nagriculture, semiconductor, precision manufacturing, and electronic \nindustries of my home state. According to Maine Governor Angus King the \nfast track approach is, ``On balance--beneficial to Maine. There might \nbe some short term problems, but in the long run, we have to \nparticipate in the world economy.\n  And Maine has been participating. From 1989 to 1999, total exports by\n\n[[Page S4791]]\n\nMaine companies increased by 137 percent from $914 million to $2.167 \nbillion, with the largest industry sector for trade being \nsemiconductors--employing about 2,000 in Maine. The computer and \nelectronics trade, which includes semiconductors, accounted for 33 \npercent of Maine's exports in 1999, followed by paper and allied \nproducts at 17 percent.\n  The Maine industries that benefit from exports have also seen job \ngains in the state. From 1994 to 1999, the electrical and electronics \nindustry had a job gain of 2.3 percent and the agriculture, forestry \nand fishing industry saw a 19 percent increase in jobs. In 2000, \nMaine's exports supported 84,000 jobs.\n  And two other Maine industries--the import-sensitive salmon \nacquaculture industry that was the target of dumping by Chile, and the \nrubber footwear industry that's been severely impact by past trade \nagreements--stand to benefit from commitments I've received from the \nadministration to stand firm on antidumping laws and to negotiate \naggressively on their behalf in future agreements.\n  I have also worked in the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATP) to \nprovide the rubber footwear industry with a comparable tariff provision \nto that which they received in the NAFTA. The original ATPA further \nthreatened this industry by giving the four Andean nations a tariff \nphase-out schedule that was only half as long as the 15-year schedule \ncontained in the NAFTA. I am pleased that this legislation now contains \nthis same 15 year phaseout because without this we would be setting a \nprecedent that would be demanded by other countries as well.\n\n  These measures and commitments represent a significant strengthening \nof our resolve and our ability to utilize existing remedies to protect \nAmerican industries and workers. This comes not a moment too soon, as \nthe success of our economy relies more than ever on fair and freer \ntrade--U.S. exports accounted for one-quarter of U.S. economic growth \nover the past decade, nearly one in six manufactured products coming \noff the assembly line goes to a foreign customer, and exports support \none of every five manufacturing jobs.\n  Given these facts, it is understandable concern that the U.S. has \nbeen party to only 3 free trade agreements while there are more than \n130 worldwide. Since 1995, the WTO has been notified of 90 such \nagreements while the U.S. only reached one in the trade arena, the \nJordan Free Trade Agreement. In contrast, the European Union (EU) has \nbeen particularly aggressive, having entered into 27 free trade \nagreements since 1990 and they are actively negotiating another 15. \nPerhaps not surprisingly, the Business Roundtable reports that 33 \npercent of total world exports are covered by EU free trade agreements \ncompared to 11 percent for U.S. agreements.\n  Why should these facts raise concerns? Because every agreement made \nwithout us is a threat to American jobs. Nowhere is this better \nexemplified than in Chile which signed a free trade agreement with \nCanada, Argentina and several other nations in 1997.\n  Since that time, the U.S. has lost one-quarter of Chile's important \nmarket, while nations entering into trade agreements more than captured \nour lost share. According to the National Association of Manufacturers \n(NAM), this resulted in the loss of more than $800 million in U.S. \nexports and 100,000 job opportunities. One specific industry affected \nwas U.S. paper products which accounted for 30 percent of Chile's \nimports but has since dropped to only 11 percent after the trade \nagreements were signed.\n  We need to look to the future of our industries and open doors of \nopportunity in the global marketplace. In order to do so responsibly, \nwe need to learn every economic lesson possible from the past, and this \npackage provides for not only a study I requested of the economic \nimpact of the past five trade agreements, but also an additional \nevaluation of any new agreements before TPA is extended.\n  And we need to make sure that everyone who can benefit from these \nagreements can get their foot in the door. Small businesses, for \nexample, account for 30 percent of all U.S. goods exported, and in \nMaine more than 78 percent export, so I am pleased this bill includes \nmy proposals placing small businesses in our principle negotiating \nobjectives.\n  Small businesses also face the biggest hurdles to engaging in \ninternational trade, even as it provides them with best opportunity for \ngrowth. So we must ensure their views and needs are addressed in any \nagreement reached, and I want to thank the chairman and ranking member \nof the Finance Committee for including my provision to create an \nAssistant U.S. Trade Representative for Small Business and my proposal \nrequiring the USTR to call for a small business advocate at the WTO in \norder to ensure that small businesses have advocates at the table \nduring all negotiations.\n  Finally, the package now includes consultation rights for the House \nand Senate Committees with oversight of the fishing industry. As the \npast chair and current ranking member of the Commerce Subcommittee on \nOceans and Fisheries, I can tell you that the actions of other \ncountries with regard to fishing plays a crucial role in ensuring our \nindustry has a level playing field on which to compete. Last year this \ncountry exported $11 billion worth of edible and nonedible fish \nproducts, and in Maine the industry, which is our 5th leading exporter, \ngenerates 26,000 jobs.\n  The bottom line is international trade is inextricably linked to the \neconomic future of the United States. The adoption of this \ncomprehensive package will ensure that trade agreements will be pursued \nin a fair and balanced manner to the benefit of all Americans while \nalso recognizing the need for expanded assistance for those who lose \ntheir jobs due to trade, and I urge its adoption. Thank you. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time under the quorum call be charged \nequally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise to voice my support for the \npending legislation, the trade promotion authority, as well as the TAA, \na bill that is before us, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. While it \nis not a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination, it is \nimportant in two respects. It promotes trade and it gives the President \nthe opportunity to craft free trade agreements and open markets.\n  Pennsylvania, for example, had exports in 2000 to the tune of $24 \nbillion. We export to over 204 foreign destinations. It is a very \nimportant part of Pennsylvania's economy, and it would be vitally \nimportant for Pennsylvania if we could open markets particularly with \nSouth America. We can begin to structure free trade agreements.\n  Several South American countries, for example, are very big users of \nthe Port of Philadelphia. Free trade agreements would mean a lot to \nbusinesses in Philadelphia, as well as our transportation industry in \nPennsylvania, which is a big part of the Pennsylvania economy.\n  We have tremendous opportunities in Pennsylvania with our \nmanufacturing base, our high-technology industries, our agriculture, to \nexport not just to South America but around the globe.\n  This is a great opportunity for this administration to structure \ndeals, to bring down tariffs, and to allow us to compete better in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  While I do have some concerns about the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nAct, I do believe it is important for us to pass a trade adjustment \nassistance act that does deal with some of the downsides. I think there \nare a lot of upsides, a lot of good, quality jobs. But there will be \nsome who will lose their jobs, and we need to be there to be helpful, \nto deal with those who are hurt by the actions of the Federal \nGovernment, by trade agreements that result in people losing their \njobs.\n  In the end, there is no question that trade is a net positive for \nthis country. It will improve the quality of life for millions of \nAmericans, and not just for\n\n[[Page S4792]]\n\nthose who will get better paying jobs because of trade but also people \nwill be able to get better quality goods and less expensive goods as a \nresult of trade with countries around the world.\n  So this is a win-win, in my opinion. We will be taking care of those \nwho will be hurt and, at the same time, we will be expanding \nopportunities for millions of people and create a better way of life \nfor our citizenry here at home.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we are about to begin a series of votes \non amendments that have been pending on the trade package. I urge \nSenators to stay on the floor and to respect the need to discipline \nourselves in regard to the amount of time allocated for the votes. \nOftentimes, 10- or 15-minute votes turn into half-hour votes. So, \nplease, stay on the floor. We have at least 8, perhaps as many as 10, \nrollcall votes that will be occurring momentarily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4792-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4792-S4793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2551\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Prior to that, I urge our colleagues to consider the \nfinal piece of business. I am pleased the distinguished chair of the \nAppropriations Committee is on the floor. He and I have had many \nconversations with regard to the need to pass the supplemental.\n  The President has admonished the Senate to complete our work on the \nsupplemental before Memorial Day. I have indicated to Senator Byrd that \nthat would be my desire, to complete our work on the supplemental prior \nto Memorial Day. And I indicated on the Senate floor earlier today it \nwould be my hope that we could complete our work.\n  Obviously, there are many pieces of legislation that await us when we \nreturn.\n  So for a lot of reasons, the fact that this money is going primarily \nto defense and homeland security--we have seen warnings now issued in \nthe last couple of weeks with regard to the need to respond even more \nconsequentially to our homeland security requirements--I think the \nurgency of the bill is very much in evidence.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately following \nthe disposition of the trade bill, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 2551, the Senate supplemental appropriations bill; \nthat there be 10 hours for debate on the bill, equally divided between \nthe chairman and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee; \nthat all amendments be relevant to the bill and limited to 30 minutes \nof debate, equally divided in the usual form, with the amendment debate \ntime counting toward the 10-hour cap; and that upon the disposition of \nthe amendments, the bill be read a third time and passed, without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN.--and I will object--first of all, I believe it is the \nprocedure in the Congress for all revenue bills to be passed by the \nother body first. Isn't that correct? We would wait for the other body \nto proceed with their completion of the appropriations bill, which they \nhave not done.\n  Madam President, just last night my office received these two \ndocuments: one at 50-some pages and the other 50-some pages, which is \nan explanatory statement of the recommendations of the Senate \ncommittee. We have not had a chance, obviously, to go through that long \nappropriations bill.\n  I noticed, among other supplemental appropriations, there is $5 \nmillion for individual quota fishing loans. I knew we were in an \nemergency here in the country--these fishing loans for halibut, I guess \nthere is a halibut problem up in Alaska of which, unfortunately, the \nNation has not been made aware.\n  But buried in this bill are other ``emergencies,'' such as the \nhalibut emergency for $5 million. There are fundamental changes made in \nthe aviation loan program which was passed overwhelmingly by this body \nfor the airlines, which really has nothing to do with supplemental \nappropriations. There are many other policy changes, as is the practice \nof the Appropriations Committee--as is the practice.\n  I am not going to agree to any unanimous consent request. This bill \nhas been over since April. We just got it last night. And you expect us \nto agree to 10 hours of debate and passing this bill? No. No. It is \ndisgraceful.\n  We are going to change the way we do business around here. The \nappropriators are going to understand that there are other Senators who \nneed to be involved when in an emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill there are policy changes which have nothing to do with any \nnational emergency--whether they be a change to the aviation loan \nprogram or whether they be an emergency for halibut.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, let me respond briefly, because I know \nthe distinguished Republican leader would like to make a comment as \nwell.\n  With regard to the House action, of course, we wouldn't complete our \nwork on the bill until the House has done its work. We expect that will \nbe done shortly. We have done similar appropriations work on many \noccasions in the past. We need to move forward.\n  As I said, there is an urgency to many of the provisions of this \nlegislation. We are talking about defense and homeland security in \nparticular.\n  I would also note that this bill is subject to amendment. Senators \nwishing to offer amendments would be entitled to do so.\n  I am disappointed we were not able to get the unanimous consent \nagreement. I think it does again delay our chances to complete this \nwork and to get it done in a way that accommodates the President's \nrequest and our appreciation for the urgency of addressing this work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we received this request at approximately \n5:28 this afternoon. I will make a couple of points with regard to the \nlegislation, some of it with regard to what Senator McCain was just \nsaying.\n  I understand the Senate bill was reported last night and we were only \nable to get a copy of the measure earlier today. Senator McCain and \nothers are going through the bill to see exactly what its present \ncondition is. It is obviously in the legislative process. It is \ndifferent from what the President had requested. It is different from \nwhat the House passed. Therefore, we need to make sure we know exactly \nthe present condition of what is in the bill.\n  For instance, the President asked for this supplemental for defense \nand homeland security, about $27.1 billion. The House-passed bill that \nwe have not yet received is at approximately $29.4 billion. This bill \nis approximately $31 billion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question on that?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it the Senator's recollection that when this side \nof the aisle was in the majority, the other side always insisted that \nthe appropriations bills come over from the House before the Senate \nwould be allowed to act? Is that not the recollection of the Senator?\n  Mr. LOTT. I know in the past my colleagues on the other side insisted \nwe wait on the House appropriations bill in order to provide a defense \nof germaneness. So that has been the practice; the Senator is correct.\n  I understand we are going to get the House bill later tonight, but it \nmay be, actually, in the morning before we get it. I also understand \nthat no report was filed with the bill, although there is some sort of \nexplanatory statement. Perhaps that will be helpful and maybe that is \nintended to be in place of the report. That is a concern, too.\n\n  The consent that was propounded asked for debate and amendment limits \nbefore Members even really knew what\n\n[[Page S4793]]\n\nwe would be amending. It puts us in a very difficult position.\n  Having said all of that, certainly this measure is vitally important. \nI have already been talking to Senator Daschle about what is the best \nway to go to it, what is the earliest time we could go to it. Even if \nwe took it up and some wanted time later on tonight or tomorrow, it \nlooks to me as if it would take quite some time to get it done. We \nwould not be able to get into conference with the House before we come \nback from the Memorial Day recess.\n  I am hoping we could go ahead and talk back and forth and try to get \nagreement that when we come back from the recess, if we don't get some \nagreement worked out otherwise, it would be the pending business or we \nwould quickly get a process so we could start work on it Monday when we \ncome back or Tuesday, the 4th, and hopefully get agreement relatively \nquickly, even with amendments, once people know what they are amending, \nand then be able to get it right on in to the conference with the \nHouse.\n  Clearly, we do need to get this done. I must say that it has been a \nslow process. The request from the administration was slow coming. The \nbill coming from the House has been slow. Now here we are right up \nagainst this recess. It has not been the best way to do it.\n  It is about $4 billion more than what the President asked. I am sure \nthe mix within that $31 billion has been changed. We need to take a \nlook at it. Hurriedly, we have been trying to go through what has been \nadded. Clearly, a lot of it is not national defense or homeland \nsecurity related: things such as the senior farmer's market nutrition \nprogram, money for a national polar orbiting operating environmental \nsatellite system, some amount of money for attorney retention allowance \nfor the District for attorneys that, even though they got a bonus for \nstaying with DC, they subsequently became union members and were not \nentitled to the bonus. This would say they can keep the bonus. There is \nU.N. population fund language in here which always causes a fuss.\n  Just looking hurriedly over the amendments on agriculture, justice, \ncommerce, DOD, education, a lot of issues that would not be described \nin any way as relating to national defense and homeland security, we \nneed a little time to review all this and see what amendments may be \nnecessary.\n  I must say--I know Senator Byrd understands this--I always am very \nantsy about proceeding without Senator Stevens being around when we are \ndoing appropriations bills. So that is a factor, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4793-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2551\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent--this is a \nmodification of the earlier request--that the Senate would proceed to \nthe House supplemental appropriations bill on Monday, June 3, at a time \nto be determined by the majority leader after consultation with the \nRepublican leader so we could get to this bill immediately upon our \nreturn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I object, for two reasons. First, it \nseems to me the whole issue is urgency. We are talking about defense \nand homeland security. If there is any urgency to making the commitment \nto getting the work done, it ought to be now, not a week or 10 days \nfrom now.\n  Secondly, we don't know when the House will produce the bill. Perhaps \nthe House will complete its work; perhaps it will not. We know we have \na job to do. As we have done on so many other occasions, we have done \nour work and waited for the House to act. If the House completes its \nwork, perhaps that is something we can do. But we are not in a position \nto know what the House is going to do. Obviously, it would be very \ndifficult for us to build a consent agreement around House action that \nmay or may not take place.\n  I do object. I do recognize, as the Senator from Mississippi, the \ndistinguished Republican leader, has noted, we will have to reach some \nagreement. If it can't be done now, it will have to be done soon. It is \ndisappointing that it cannot be done now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to mention just an example of why we need to go \nthrough this legislation. It has just been pointed out to me, here is \n$2 million in this bill, which is entitled ``Supplemental Appropriation \nAct for Further Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the \nUnited States''--that is the title of this legislation----\n  Other related agencies, Smithsonian Institution construction, $2 \nmillion: the committee recommends an amount of $2 million within \nconstruction to initiate the planning and design of an alcohol \ncollection storage facility. The Smithsonian holds the largest \ncollection of this kind in the world, and at present a large portion of \nit is stored in the National Museum of Natural History. The Smithsonian \nhas requested this amount and the fiscal year 2003 budget estimate \nindicates it is a most important safety and security project.\n  Given this information, the committee has advanced the appropriation \nof funds required in planning and design in order to accelerate the \nproject.\n  All of those bugs that are stored in alcohol in the Smithsonian--when \nwe are trying to recover from and respond to the terrorist attacks on \nthe United States by moving some alcohol encased bugs from one facility \nto another--this is another example of why in the world we need to \nexamine this legislation.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is going to be recognized. There is a \nprovision in this bill that is far more serious than moving bugs stored \nin alcohol for $2 million. That has to do with the aviation program. \nThe legislation was passed by this body overwhelmingly because of the \ndanger of airlines going bankrupt, and now one major airline at least \nwill not be eligible for loans because there is not enough money there \nand we are going to see major airlines in America go bankrupt if we \ndon't avoid that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I want to pick up on what the Senator \nfrom Arizona said. He is ranking member on the Commerce Committee. They \nworked diligently on putting together the aviation loan program. One \nairline has access to the program, and that happens to be America West. \nThere is another airline that is on the brink of bankruptcy that is \nhemorrhaging money right now, but it has brought in a management team \nto restructure the airline. Part of this restructuring plan is US \nAirways' access to this fund. What is in the appropriations bill will \ndeny them access to this fund until the fall of this year, which may be \ntoo late for them to be able to get the adequate capital to continue \noperation. We may be bankrupting an airline that serves the whole \nnortheastern quadrant of the United States for I don't know what \nreason.\n\n  I have no idea why this provision is in here, but we are pulling the \nrug out from under an airline that was probably the airline most \naffected by 9-11. This is the airline with its hub at Reagan National, \nwhich was shut down and flights were restricted. This is an airline \nthat flew out of New York, and it served the area most impacted by 9-\n11. And now we have an appropriations bill that is going to probably \ndeny them survival. It is the most impacted airline by 9-11 and we have \na bill here that is supposed to help us recover from 9-11, and it may \nbe the death knell of the airline.\n  The bottom line is, this bill is not ready for passage. There are \nserious changes that must be made in this legislation for this bill to \ngo through the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4793-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4793-S4818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE EXPANSION ACT--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. What is the order before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The last 10 minutes of debate are reserved by \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3527\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, what is the question before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 3527 by the Senator from South \nCarolina to amendment No. 3447 offered by the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the purpose of my amendment is because we \nare on the verge of passing fast-track legislation that would tie the \nhands of Senators who wish to amend trade agreements that come before \nCongress. It is imperative that we as members of the legislative branch \nbecome more active in the negotiation of those agreements. We must \nestablish the means for Senators and Representatives to be consulted on \ntrade negotiations in order to allow them to advise the administration \non how to best protect the interests of their constituents.\n  Based upon the trade act of 1974, members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee and the House Ways and Means Committee are able to serve as \ncongressional advisers for trade policy. Members of those committees \ncan also exercise oversight on the implementation of trade agreements. \nBut the rest of the Members of the Senate and the House are left out in \nthe cold when it comes to being able to sit in on important trade \nnegotiations and being consulted on the contents of a trade agreement \nbefore it is sent to Congress for approval.\n  My amendment corrects this situation by enlarging the congressional \noversight group so that the group would be comprised of 11 Senators and \n11 Representatives who do not serve on the Finance Committee or the \nWays and Means Committee. The congressional oversight group can then \nserve with the members of the committee of jurisdiction to advise \nnegotiators in the executive branch on how to craft a trade agreement \nthat promotes fair trade practices and protects the interests of our \nconstituents.\n\n  My amendment does not take any powers away from the committees of \njurisdiction. To the contrary, the amendment contains specific language \nthat directs the cochairman of the congressional oversight group to \nopen their meetings and to share all information with members of the \nFinance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee.\n  These committees and the congressional oversight group should work \ntogether to promote consultation between the executive and legislative \nbranches on trade agreements. I do trust the Finance Committee to \nconsult with other Senators on the contents of trade agreements, but as \nRonald Reagan once said, ``Trust but verify.''\n  Let the committees of jurisdiction do their work, but let us also \nallow a broader membership of the House and Senate to participate in \nthe consultations on trade agreements. The particular needs of our \nindividual States may not be apparent to members of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Incidentally, Madam President, proponents of the fast-track bill have \nargued that we need to pass this legislation to allow the President to \nnegotiate trade agreements. But the President already has the power to \nnegotiate agreements with foreign countries. We do not need legislation \nto give the President his inherent powers.\n  What fast track really does, however, is to cut out the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives from proposing amendments to trade \nagreements. If Congress cannot amend trade agreements, it is all the \nmore important for Members of Congress to become more involved in the \nnegotiating process by broadening the membership of the congressional \noversight group, as my amendment does. Congress may have a better \nchance at influencing prospective trade agreements to take into account \nthe interests of our constituents. I urge my colleagues to vote for the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I advised my colleague from West \nVirginia several hours ago that I was going to move to table his \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, one, I didn't want to speak against the \namendment of my friend and colleague and move to table it without him \nhaving a chance to make his presentation.\n  I happen to be a member of the Finance Committee, and the Finance \nCommittee does have principal jurisdiction over trade. If we are going \nto have a trade advisory committee that would advise the administration \nand is composed of members appointed by the Senate President pro \ntempore, with the advice of the leaders, as proposed in this amendment, \nit also says to exclude members of the Finance Committee. I cannot \nimagine doing that. It sets up a separate committee, but we have a \ncommittee of jurisdiction that deals with trade. Now it says we are \ngoing to have a separate committee that will do the same thing. We \ndon't do that in Appropriations or in the Judiciary Committee or Energy \nor in any other committee.\n  I think the committee process needs to work. This is as if to say \nlet's have a duplicate committee outside of the Finance Committee. I \nthink it is a serious mistake, a bad precedent. Maybe we should have \ntwo committees for everything, and if somebody doesn't like what comes \nout of the original committee, we can go to the other committee. I \ncannot imagine legislation that says let's have a separate committee \nand exclude members of the Finance Committee. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport a motion to table the amendment.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this bill prevents the Senate from enacting \na resolution of disapproval against a trade agreement that it finds \nobjectionable, unless the Finance Committee chooses to report such a \nresolution to the full Senate. A resolution of disapproval enacted by \nthe Senate would withdraw the application of fast track procedures to \nany bill the President submits to the Congress to implement a trade \nagreement.\n  Although, at first glance, the bill before us appears to permit a \nSenator to introduce a resolution of disapproval rejecting fast track \nprocedures applied to a trade agreement that is brought back to the \nSenate by the President, the reality is that such a resolution most \nprobably would never come to the floor of the Senate for a vote.\n  This is because the bill states that, once a resolution of \ndisapproval is introduced and referred to the Senate Finance Committee, \nit will not be in order for the full Senate to consider the resolution \nif it has not been reported by the committee. In other words, a \ndisapproval resolution cannot be forced to the floor through a \ndischarge of the Senate Finance Committee. The way this bill is \ncurrently written, if a resolution of disapproval is not reported out \nof the Senate Finance Committee, it might as well never have been \nintroduced. The resolution may simply lie there until it dies.\n  This means that, so long as the Senate Finance Committee endorses the \nPresident's agreement, the views of the rest of the Senate are \nirrelevant. Enacting fast-track in this bill prevents the Senate from \nexercising its Constitutional responsibility to reject or modify trade \nagreement that are not in the best interests of the American people.\n  It is imperative that every Senator retain his or her right to \nintroduce a resolution of disapproval that can be considered in the \nlight of day by the full Senate. To this end, my amendments require \nthat, upon introduction, any resolution of disapproval--including an \nextension resolution of disapproval--will be referred not only to the \nSenate Committee on Finance, but also to the Senate Committee on Rules \nand Administration. The Rules Committee is essential to this process, \nbecause it is charged with making the rules and procedures that govern \nthis institution, and its expertise is essential to our enforcement of \ncommitments undertaken by our trading partners in the trade agreements \nnegotiated by the President.\n  Under these amendments, each of these committees will be required to \nreport the resolution of disapproval that has been referred to it \nwithin 10 days of the date of its introduction and, if either of these \ncommittees fails to report the resolution of disapproval within that \ntime, either of these committees shall automatically be discharged from \nfurther consideration of the resolution. The resolution shall then be \nplaced directly on the Senate calendar. Once the disapproval resolution \nis placed on the Senate calendar, any Senator may make a motion to \nproceed to consider that resolution, and the motion to consider the \nresolution shall not be debatable.\n  If enacted as currently written this bill would effectively cut a \nmajority of Senators out of the trade regulation process, preventing \nthem from correcting sweeping changes in trade law that could unfairly \naffect the lives of their constituents who rely on the Senate to \nprotect their interests.\n  I can't support surrendering the rights and prerogatives, the duties \nand responsibilities of the Senate to any President, Democrat or \nRepublican. We in the Congress have an obligation to strike down trade \nagreements that adversely affect the American people. But it is \nimpossible for us to do so if we do not provide ourselves the \nopportunity to adequately review, debate, amend, or reject their \nprovisions as we are rightly empowered to do under the Constitution of \nthe United States. These amendments ensure that we retain the power to \nmodify or reject trade agreements that are not in the best interests of \nthe United States and, in so doing, protect the economic well-being of \nthe Nation and of the people we represent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment. It \ndoes away with the very purpose of this legislation before us, and that \nis to give the President credibility at the negotiating table and to \nhave a process by which Congress will consider the results of \nnegotiation. So it strikes at the disapproval resolution process. This \namendment adds language, then, directing the procedural disapproval \nresolutions be referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration. \nThe effect of the amendment on trade promotion authority is threefold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  Senators kindly take conversations off the floor so the Senator can \nbe heard. The Senator has a right to be heard.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First, it wrests control over consideration of \nprocedural disapproval resolutions from the Finance Committee and gives \nit to the Committee on Rules and Administration; second, to make \nprocedural disapproval resolutions open for debate with automatic \ndischarge from committee of jurisdiction; third, to provide for an \nunlimited number of procedural disapproval resolutions to be considered \nduring any given session of Congress.\n  The intent is clear. It is an attempt to weaken trade promotion \nauthority and create multiple and unlimited opportunities to derail \ntrade promotion authority procedures during any given session of \nCongress. If the amendment is agreed to, a single Senator can put \nforward a resolution which would stop a particular trade negotiation in \nits tracks. We all know there are some Senators who do not like trade \npromotion authority and do not even like international trade. Should \nthis amendment be agreed to, you can be assured that the Senate will be \nconsidering multiple procedural disapproval resolutions during any \nCongress.\n  Let us be clear. This amendment is designed to weaken trade promotion \nauthority procedures, procedures which have effectively worked for over \n50 years in advancing international trade interests. It really comes \ndown to this: Either you believe in the proven effectiveness of the \ntrade promotion authority procedures or you do not. If you do, then I \nstrongly urge you to oppose this clever yet potentially devastating \namendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S4796]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3461\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, once again, will the Chair please state \nthe regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 3461 offered by the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  Under the agreement, there is 1 minute equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, this amendment is offered by myself and \nSenator Dodd and others. It is an important and simple request for our \ntrade negotiators to respect the role of Congress and elected State and \nlocal officials to determine the nature and scope of significant public \nservices.\n  Regardless of my colleagues' view on TPA, it is one thing to delegate \ncongressional authority on trade negotiations, but it is a serious leap \nbeyond that to delegate constitutional responsibilities of elected \nofficials when it comes to determining what public services should be \nprivatized.\n  This amendment would establish as a principal negotiating objective \nthat\n\n[[Page S4797]]\n\ntrade agreements should not include a commitment by the United States \nto privatize significant public services, such as Social Security, \nnational security, public health and safety, and education.\n  This is simple and straightforward. We should not be turning over, to \nthe delegation of unelected trade negotiators, determinations about \nissues such as Social Security and national security. That should be \ndetermined here, with debate on the floor of the Senate and the House \nof Representatives, and by duly elected officials. Straightforward, \nsimple.\n  Mr. President, as I have explained, my amendment establishes as a \nnegotiating objective that trade agreements exclude commitments by the \nUntied States to privatize significant public services. The amendment \nspecifies four types of public services that represent core functions \nof Government and that are specifically protected. These include \nnational security, Social Security, public health and safety, and \neducation.\n  I want to make clear for the record, however, that these four areas \nare not the only types of public services that would be protected by my \namendment. Since this legislation establishes only broad negotiating \nobjectives, not highly detailed requirements, I have not listed each \nand every affected public service with great specificity. However, it \nis my intention that the amendment would apply to a wide range of \npublic services. These include, for example, public transportation, \npublic utilities, the Untied States Postal Service, and law \nenforcement, as well as other significant public services provided at \nthe federal, state and local levels.\n  For a public service to be protected under the amendment, it would \nhave to be ``significant.'' This is designed to ensure that the \namendment not be interpreted too broadly to apply to even small and \nrelatively marginal types of services. For example, if a local \ngovernment decides to maintain a small snack bar at a local pool, I \nwould not conclude that this is a significant public service that could \nnot be opened to private competition. However, the provision of water \nor sewer services, which are provided on large scales by a substantial \nnumber of municipalities, and are important for the protection of \npublic health, would be covered.\n  In any case, again note that the amendment deals only with trade \nnegotiating objectives. It would not completely tie negotiators' hands \nor trigger any lawsuits. It simply says that our objective should be to \nleave the provision of significant public services as a decision for \nelected officials, not distant, unelected trade bureaucrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. And what \ntroubles me most about the amendment is that it unnecessarily carves \nout privatization of particular service sectors from negotiations. \nThese service categories include national security, Social Security, \npublic health and safety, and education, as well as other significant \npublic services.\n  This language is so broad that it could be used by our trading \npartners to close off market access to U.S. service exports. This \nsituation could be especially troublesome in the telecommunications \nsector where many of our trading partners maintain government-owned \ntelecom companies.\n  Including this language, which is very sweeping, in the trade \npromotion authority bill could severely undermine our ability to open \nthese markets. That is why I ask my colleagues to reject the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Amendment No. 3470 by the Senator from \nLouisiana, Ms. Landrieu.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking the chairman \nand ranking member of this committee. I do support the underlying bill. \nI have tried to be helpful through this process in passing this bill.\n  However, there are maritime workers in our Nation who have been \nadversely affected because of a recent ruling. They are not entitled to \nbenefits under this bill. Instead of picking up employment checks, or \npaychecks, they will be picking up unemployment checks, unless this \namendment passes. So for port communities such as New Orleans and \nHouston and New Jersey and New York and Seattle, where maritime workers \ncould qualify, this amendment will help. It only costs $10 million. It \nlasts for only 3 years. Out of an $8 billion bill, our maritime workers \ndeserve some help. They have earned it; they deserve it. That is what \nmy amendment does.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the Landrieu \namendment No. 3470 violates section 311(a)(2)(B) of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I do not see Senator Jeffords. On behalf \nof Senator Jeffords, I offer amendment No. 3521.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I do not think there is any objection to \nthis amendment. This is in proper order, and I ask for it to be \naccepted.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 3521.\n  The amendment (No. 3521) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3467\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is my understanding the next amendment \nis No. 3467 by Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am a first-generation American. My \nfather fled persecution from Russia, and I am always most proud of our \ncountry when we promote human rights.\n  This is an amendment that simply says surely one of our objectives \nshould be to promote human rights and democracy, and we call on our \ntrading partners to strive to meet these human rights standards.\n  There are somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 governments in the \nworld today that systematically practice torture. At the very minimum, \nwe can at least say one of our objectives in trade policy will be to \npromote human rights and democracy. That is all this amendment does. I \nthink it means our country leads with our own values. I think it is \nimportant we make that statement, and I hope there will be a strong \nvote in favor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Opportunity is the greatest of human rights anywhere in \nthe world. Trade is all about opportunity, so this whole bill is all \nabout human rights. This amendment upsets a carefully crafted \nbipartisan compromise dealing with these complex relationships between \ninternational trade, workers' rights, and the environment, and it does \nso by undermining the fundamental purpose and proven effectiveness of \nour trade promotion authority.\n  This amendment offers vague new standards stating that the countries \nshould strive to protect ``internationally recognized civil, political, \nand human rights,'' without even defining those rights. It sets our \nnegotiators up for failure and jeopardizes this bill.\n\n  If we really want to promote democracy and human rights abroad, then \nwe should all oppose this amendment and pass the bill because history \nshows that time and again open markets help foster a more open \npolitical system and the human rights that go with it. Mexico is an \nexample. There is Taiwan and South Korea, all sorts of examples of \nhuman rights being better today than they were 50 years ago, all \nbecause of more open markets and international trade.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following the vote on the Wellstone \namendment, we will immediately go to a vote on the substitute that is \nnow before the Senate. I ask if that needs a rollcall vote because we \nare going to have to vote on the bill itself, so I do not know if we \nneed to vote twice. I again ask, do we need a rollcall vote? I ask \nSenators to make that decision during the time we are voting on the \nWellstone amendment. It would seem to me this would be a good time to \nvoice vote that and wait until there is final passage on the bill \nitself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, earlier today \nI saw some language that indicated that the committee, in an \namendment--I assume it was going to be included in the managers' \namendment, or under the rubric of ``technical amendments''--was making \ndirect appropriations. I ask the manager of the bill right here and \nnow, is there any amendment in either the technical amendments or the \nmanagers' amendment that purports to make a direct appropriation?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I inform the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nthe answer is no, there is not.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have the list in front of me. As I recall discussions \nof this list, I don't remember anything that has any appropriations in \nit whatsoever and it is not our intent to appropriate money in these \namendments.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I might further respond to my good friend from West \nVirginia, I have just been informed we don't believe there are any such \nprovisions, but we are scrubbing it right now to make sure. We don't \nbelieve, at this point.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I think we ought to have a quorum call so we \ncan take a good look and be absolutely sure.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3467\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Wellstone \namendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I want a vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on the motion to \ntable? There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The language is being changed so it makes a reference to an \nauthorization, not to an appropriation. It earlier made appropriations \nin this bill. That was not the intent, Mr. Baucus has assured me.

So we have stricken several of them.\n  Just to make doubly sure that this bill does not make any \nappropriations, I offer the following amendment, which, is agreed to, \nwould save a lot of time:\n       At the end, add the following:\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no \n     direct appropriation may be made under this Act.''\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3548) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank all Senators.\n\n\n                            u.s. trade laws\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last year, nearly two-thirds of the Senate \nsent a letter to President Bush emphasizing that new trade agreements \nmust not weaken trade remedy laws such as antidumping and \ncountervailing duty law.\n  The fast track bill we are considering today reemphasizes that point. \nSection 2(c)(9) of the bill instructs the President to preserve, in all \ntrade negotiations, the ability of the United States to enforce \nrigorously its trade remedy laws and to avoid any agreement that would \nrequire weakening of the current U.S. antidumping, countervailing duty \nand safeguard remedies.\n  Today, I would like to make two key points about this provision. \nFirst, the Committee on Finance regards strict adherence to the section \n2(c)(9) directive as critical in advancing the economic interests of \nthe United States in future trade agreements. The bill's language here \nis unambiguous in the sense that, rather than establishing preservation \nof our trade remedy laws as simply a ``negotiating objective,'' it \nbluntly states that the President ``shall'' preserve those laws.\n  Second, the negotiating instruction encompasses any weakening of the \nexisting remedies, whether at the level of statute, regulation or \nagency practice. This means that the President ``shall'' reject any new \ninternational rule or obligation whose acceptance would lead to relief \nunder our existing trade laws becoming more difficult, uncertain, or \ncostly for domestic industries to achieve and maintain over time.\n  I am very concerned about the Administration's decision in Doha last \nyear to put U.S. trade laws on the negotiating table. Many of our \ntrading partners have only one goal to weaken our trade laws so they \ncan gain an unfair competitive advantage. A number of WTO Members have \nput forward some specific proposals. I want to highlight today a few \nexamples of new international obligations that have been proposed by \nWTO Members, and that would obviously result in a weakening of U.S. \ntrade laws, including: One, a ``public interest'' rule politicizing and \nencumbering the administrative processes under which these laws are \ncurrently applied; two, a requirement to exempt from trade remedy \nmeasures items alleged to be in ``short supply'' in the domestic \nmarket; three, a so-called ``lesser duty'' rule limiting antidumping \nand countervailing duties to some amount less than the calculated \nmargin of dumping or subsidy, such as the amount supposedly necessary \nto offset the injury; and four, any extension of faulty dispute \nresolution models such as Chapter 19 of the NAFTA.\n  Mr. President, there are other examples, but these are some of the \nkey concerns that I have and I know many of my colleagues share. I also \nwant to emphasize that this is very much a bipartisan issue. Members on \nboth sides of the aisle feel strongly about protecting U.S. trade laws. \nAnd along those lines, I believe my good friend and ally in protecting \nU.S. trade laws, would like to express some of his concerns about this \nissue.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I certainly share the Senator's concern regarding \nthe potential for new trade agreements to weaken U.S. trade remedy \nlaws, in particular the antidumping and countervailing duty laws. These \nessential laws level the playing field on which our firms and workers \ncompete internationally, and serve the crucial function of offsetting \nand deterring some of the most harmful unfair trade practices affecting \ninternational trade today.\n  The steady leadership the Senator has provided on this issue has been \nadmirable, and I certainly hope the message has gotten through. It \nwould be a serious mistake indeed to think that an agreement or package \nof agreements can be successfully presented to\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\nCongress for approval, under fast-track rules or otherwise, if it \nincludes any weakening changes to our trade remedy laws.\n  I believe the Senator has accurately captured the general definition \nof a ``weakening'' change, and I agree fully with the examples he has \nlaid out. I want to ask about some other proposals which have already \nsurfaced at this early stage of the WTO negotiations, and which in my \nview must be rejected under the standard set out in section 2(c)(9).\n  These proposals include:\n  One, changes to the rules for ``sunset'' reviews of antidumping and \nCVD measures which would make it more difficult to keep relief in \nplace; two, additional constraints or criteria for dumping \ncalculations, in areas where current WTO rules and U.S. law vest \ndiscretion in the administering authority; and, three, special rules \nand standards that would make it easier for a particular group of \ncountries, such as developing countries, to utilize injurious dumping \nor subsidies as a means of promoting their own industries at our \nexpense.\n  Am I correct in my view that accepting any such changes, as some \ntrading partners have requested, would weaken our existing trade \nremedies?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, those are certainly changes that would weaken our \ncurrent remedies, and which would fail the test set out in section \n2(c)(9). I also understand that my colleague and friend, Senator \nRockefeller, who has worked very closely with me on the defense of our \ntrade remedy laws over the years, has some points to add concerning \nsection 2(c)(9).\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I also wish to clarify with my colleagues that \nsection 2(c)(9) is a ``no weakening'' provision, and not a ``no net \nweakening'' provision. In other words, the President is directed to \nreject any new international obligation whose acceptance would impair \nour current trade remedies in the way you have described--by making \nrelief costlier, more uncertain, or otherwise harder to achieve and \nmaintain over time. An agreement that includes such changes must be \nrejected, and it is no answer--insofar as section 2(c)(9) and the \nintent of the Congress is concerned--to contend that the agreement in \nquestion also includes some ``strengthening'' provisions.\n  That would include any revisions that intended to ``strengthen'' the \ndisciplines governing other countries' trade laws, including those in \nthe developing world.\n  I personally believe that until the United States has a documented \nrecord of challenging those foreign trade laws at the WTO--and for some \ninexplicable reason we do not--there is no justification for saying \nexisting WTO rules are not sufficient to ensure due process and \ntransparency in foreign trade laws.\n  Additionally, I think it is important to clarify that this \nnegotiating directive does not preclude U.S. negotiators from \naddressing the very serious shortcomings that have become apparent in \nthe operation of the WTO dispute settlement system. As explained in the \nFinance Committee's report on the TPA measure, in a series of decisions \ninvolving trade remedy measures, the WTO Appellate Body and lower \ndispute settlement panels have fabricated U.S. obligations which our \nnegotiators never accepted and have blatantly disregarded the \ndiscretion which the Uruguay Round negotiators intended for national \ninvestigating authorities to retain.\n  These WTO tribunals have violated their mandate not to increase or \nreduce the rights and obligations of WTO Members; have imposed their \npreferences and interpretations, and those of a biased WTO Secretariat, \non the United States and on other WTO Members; and have issued \ndecisions with no basis in the legal texts they supposedly were \ninterpreting.\n  I believe this may be because other countries have been far more \naggressive about challenging our trade laws at the WTO than we have \nbeen in challenging theirs. The effect has been to upset the careful \nbalance achieved in the Uruguay Round by adding new, and wholly \nunwarranted, constraints on the use of trade remedies.\n  Before we vote on the bill, am I correct in understanding that \nsection 2(c)(9) does not preclude a forceful U.S. agenda to address the \nproblems plaguing WTO dispute settlement?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is perfectly correct. I might add that the \nTPA bill includes several additional provisions designed to ensure a \nforceful U.S. response to the WTO dispute settlement problem, and \nsection 2(c)(9) presents no barrier whatsoever in that regard.\n\n\n    livestock and meat products as perishable and cyclical products\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy regarding \nthe coverage of trade promotion authority. My understanding is that TPA \nincludes special provisions regarding perishable and cyclical products. \nIt is my understanding that this language would clearly cover livestock \nand fresh meat products as they are perishable and cyclical \nagricultural products.\n  I believe that the language and the coverage are clear, but want to \nmake sure that our negotiators are well aware of our intent and \ncoverage of this legislation and the expectations we have for inclusion \nin future trade agreements.\n  Reasonable people know that fresh meat is perishable, but many people \nmay not be aware that livestock can be perishable as well. Cattle ready \nfor slaughter, for example, must be processed within two to three weeks \nof reaching their optimal weight. Once above the optimal weight, cattle \ngain fat and not muscle. With this quality loss, livestock producers \nsuffer drastic price discounts that can wipe out their profits. Clearly \nmeat production and livestock are also cyclical. Again, taking cattle \nas an example, the price follows a 10-year-cattle-cycle--the expansion \nand contraction of the nation's cattle herd have historically affected \ncattle prices.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise in support of my colleague's \ninterpretation. It seems quite clear to me. This is important to the \nmeat and livestock industry. For example, TPA addresses eliminating the \npractices of foreign governments that adversely affect the trade of \nperishable and cyclical products, and the elimination of such practices \nin the livestock and meat sector would be to the advantage of U.S. \nproducers. No reasonable person would suggest that the definition of \nperishable and cyclical agricultural products would fail to cover \nlivestock and meat production.\n  TPA also calls for improving import relief mechanisms to recognize \nthe special characteristics of perishable and cyclical products, which \nwould include livestock and meat. Such improvements to import relief \nmechanisms could include faster and more effective time frames for \nimposing import relief measures as well as improved means of \ndetermining industry support in import relief investigations. Along the \nsame lines, TPA provides that U.S. import relief measures for \nperishable and cyclical agricultural products should be as accessible \nand timely as those of other countries.\n  TPA also states that the U.S. Trade Representatives, prior to \ncommencing negotiations concerning agriculture, shall work to develop a \nposition on perishable and seasonal products that will lead to an \ninternational consensus on the treatment of these products in dumping \nand safeguard investigations ``and in any other relevant areas.'' I \nunderstand that livestock and meat production would be included in \nthese negotiations as they are clearly covered under the definition of \nperishable and cyclical agricultural products.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their comments \nand I agree completely with them that the definition of perishable and \ncyclical agricultural products includes livestock and meat production. \nIt is clear to me that there can be no other reading of the legislation \nand I believe that our colleagues intended for these products to be \ncovered. We expect our negotiators, to include these products under \nthese provisions.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I also agree with my colleagues, views on \nthis important issue. The intention of the members on this matter is \nclear: The definition of perishable and cyclical agricultural products \nincludes livestock and meat production.\n\n\n              Enforcement of Proper Labeling of Basa Fish\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Every authorization of fast-track authority since the \nTrade Act of 1974 has been accompanied by a strong confirmation of \nCongressional\n\n[[Page S4801]]\n\nintent that U.S. law will be vigorously enforced to ensure that the \nincreased trade enabled by agreements reached under the negotiating \nauthority is fair.\n  This year, Congress has responded to a failure to enforce existing \nlaw by twice enacting provisions to ensure that imported species of \nfish are not illegally passed off in the U.S. market as ``catfish.'' \nThe Food and Drug Administration has consistently authorized only North \nAmerican Freshwater Catfish to be marketed as ``catfish'' in the United \nStates, a practice that has existed commercially for over thirty years. \nU.S. law now prevents other species from using the term catfish in \nlabeling or advertising. Let me be clear, the vast majority of this \nimported species of fish has never, and I repeat, never, reached \nAmerican consumers under any legal name. It has reached the consumer in \nsignificant quantities only being misbranded as ``catfish.''\n  Congress most recently addressed this illegal misbranding in the farm \nbill, known officially as the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n2002, which was signed by the president last week. The fraud of \nmisbranding seafood is referred to as ``economic adulteration.'' Under \nU.S. law, economic adulteration is illegal at every level of commerce. \nMisbranding at the time of importation, or changing a legal name after \nimportation, is a violation of U.S. law. These laws have simply not \nbeen enforced. The relevant provision in the 2002 farm bill now makes \nit clear that false labeling or advertising of another species of fish \nas ``catfish'' is illegal. There is also an original provision in the \n2002 farm bill that applies to seafood, including the species that have \nbeen misbranded as ``catfish.'' These provisions of law are a clear \nexpression of congressional intent that applicable law must be \nvigorously enforced.\n  This is a necessary condition to the success of open trade.\n  I would like to confirm that in granting Trade Promotion Authority \nfor trade agreements, Congress intends that: Government agencies with \nrelevant enforcement authority will exercise their authority sua sponte \nto prevent the illegal practices that have plagued our catfish \nindustry; effective enforcement action will be undertaken at all levels \nof trade to prevent the economic adulteration that has adversely \naffected U.S. catfish farmers and the consuming public; and enforcement \naction will include addressing violations of law with respect to \nmisbranding and other improper labeling, Customs marks of origin, \nincluding misbranding that indirectly indicates a false origin, false \nor misleading representations in advertising and other practices.\n  We recognize that problems occur when our markets are open. However, \nour enforcement authorities must address those problems quickly and \neffectively in order to ensure that the increased competition from \nimports into our market is on fair terms. It is only fair competition \nthat provides the benefits we seek for our economy, and that helps our \nproducers remain internationally competitive.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I can confirm the Senator's understanding, and I would \nlike to express my personal support with respect to preventing the \nunfair practices that have threatened our U.S. catfish industry. Our \nclear intent is that U.S. law be fully enforced, not only as it \nconcerns our catfish farmers but all U.S. producers, to ensure that \ntrade is fair.\n\n\n               Certification of Trade-Affected Industries\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to talk with \nSenator Grassley about the trade adjustment assistance bill and the \nimportant amendments that have been offered by Senators Bayh and \nEdwards.\n  These amendments would provide automatic certification for trade-\naffected industries. I believe that the Secretary of Labor already has \nthe discretion to certify particular industries under the TAA program. \nAnd I believe that she would have the discretion under the TAA bill we \nare now considering.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As the Senator knows, I support the trade adjustment \nassistance program, and recognize that--beyond some individual \ncompanies and workers--there are also particular industries that face \ndislocation as a result of trade. The recent finding by the \nInternational Trade Commission regarding the steel industry further \nemphasizes this point. In that vein, there appears to be a need for \nfurther coordination between ITC determinations and Federal assistance \ngiven to workers impacted by trade.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is an important issue. As a Senator Edwards has \nspoken about many times, the textile industry has been adversely \naffected by increased imports and by companies shifting production \noverseas.\n  And the steel industry, as Senator Bayh has emphasized, suffers from \na flood of unfairly trade imports. Indeed, many steel products are \ncovered by the President's recent decision to impose restrictions under \nour safeguard laws.\n  So in this case, the ITC has already made a finding of trade-related \ninjury. I would encourage the Secretary of Labor to expeditiously \nimplement procedures regarding industry-wide certification.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree there needs to be a stronger tie between ITC \nfindings and worker assistance--specifically Trade Adjustment \nAssistance. It is my understanding that the ITC is currently required \nto notify the Secretary of Labor of any affirmative injury \ndetermination, and that the Secretary must give expedited consideration \nto petitions for TAA certification by workers in the domestic industry.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In closing, let me add that I appreciate the help of you \nand your staff in working to reach a bipartisan compromise on this \npackage. I hope we can continue to move together in a bipartisan \nfashion.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am also pleased that we were able to come to \nagreement on a bipartisan trade package. It was the right thing to do \nfor our nation's farmers, workers, and companies.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment \nwhich recognizes the importance of the automotive industry to the U.S. \neconomy and to our international trade agreements. The auto industry is \na cornerstone of the U.S. economy, directly or indirectly supporting \none out of every 15 jobs in America. Auto manufacturing and related \nindustries account for 6.5 million jobs nationwide, nearly a quarter \nmillion of which are in my home state of Ohio. Ohio boasts the 2nd \nhighest auto industry employment in the country, and that industry \nrepresents $22.6 billion in wages and benefits for Ohioans. \nFurthermore, the production assembly line that characterizes the modern \nautomobile industry was invented in the American Midwest and is now \nused in factories across the globe.\n  Currently, the U.S. automotive market is the most open and \ncompetitive in the world. Our allies in Europe and our trading partners \nin developing nations alike have free access to American markets and \nconsumers. Unfortunately, that is not true for American auto \nmanufacturers. United States companies face significant pre-meditated \ntrade barriers in the same countries that enjoy free trade and exports \nto the United States. In fact, the automotive industry trade deficit \nhas accounted for one-third of the total U.S. trade deficit since 1992.\n  These results do not represent the intent or spirit of the free trade \nagreements signed in recent years, such as NAFTA and GATT, and the time \nhas come to remove the barriers to free and open trade for American \nautomobile manufacturers.\n  I know firsthand how difficult it is to open trade for American auto \nmanufacturers. I vividly recall the free trade mission that I led in \n1997 to South Korea. I spent two days with top government leaders and \nprivate sector groups urging them to open their markets to non-Korean \nmade automobiles. Quite frankly, although they listened, I felt I was \ntalking to a brick wall and received absolutely no satisfaction \nwhatsoever. On the contrary, the Korean officials were proud to report \nthat their imports doubled yet the actual number of those imports was a \nmere fraction of Korea's total auto sales.\n  That was 1997 and today--May 22, 2002--5 years later there has been \nno progress since I visited. Mr. President, I would have hoped that \nthings would have improved. Last year, South Korea exported more than \n1.5 million vehicles to the world, while importing only 7,747. Also \nlast year, South Korea exported more than 618,000 vehicles to the U.S., \nwhile importing a mere 2,854 from\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\nthe U.S. In fact, South Korea sells more cars in the U.S. per day than \nU.S. manufacturers sell in South Korea all year.\n  In addition to unfair trade regulations, the Korean authorities use \nanother barrier to prevent their citizens from buying American cars: \nintimidation. According to auto industry sources, Koreans caught \ndriving American-made cars can anticipate such punitive measures as \ngetting pulled over by the police, being subject to more parking \nviolations, and even experiencing more frequent and severe tax audits \nthan their neighbors who drive Korean-made automobiles. Why would any \nKorean citizen choose to drive an American vehicle when faced with \nconsequences like these?\n  Currently, the Baucus-Grassley TPA bill includes 14 major objectives \nfor U.S. trade negotiators. The first of these objectives is to expand \ncompetitive market opportunities for U.S. exports in foreign markets by \nreducing or eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers that prevent U.S. \ngoods from entering these markets. Our amendment states that as trade \nagreements are negotiated in the future, U.S. trade negotiators should \nspecifically aim to open up export markets for U.S. automakers and \nvehicle parts manufacturers.\n  Opening up export markets for U.S. automakers and parts manufacturers \nis critical, because in the future, the majority of growth in these \nindustries will not be in the U.S., but in the developing nations of \nAsia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Our amendment will tell trade \nnegotiators that they need to make sure that U.S. automakers are in a \nposition to compete fairly in these high-growth markets.\n  Today, sales of new passenger vehicles account for nearly 4 percent \nof total U.S. GDP. Clearly, the automotive industry is important to the \neconomic growth and stability of our economy and we must take action to \nprotect and strengthen an industry so vital to our nation.\n  Our amendment will make a difference for American manufacturers, \nconsumers and our economy as a whole. Without it, one of America's most \nimportant manufacturing industries could soon take second place to \nforeign competitors. Opening new markets for our products helps create \njobs and stimulate our economy, both of which are especially important \nas we seek to move out of recession. I urge my colleagues to join in \nthis growth and vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the trade \npromotion authority bill.\n  I am glad that we are finally debating this legislation. For years, \nthe Senate has given lip service to the need for TPA. It's about time \nwe got down to it.\n  I believe in free and fair trade, and I believe that TPA is crucial \nto our nation's economic future, and it has the potential to benefit \nthe United States greatly. Trade creates better jobs. It creates \neconomic opportunity. And while some people see free trade as a zero-\nsum game where there are winners and losers, they're wrong. Healthy \ntrade makes winners out of everyone and enables nations to make the \nbest use of their resources. Strong, vibrant trade provides a rising \ntide that lifts all boats.\n  We understand this in Kentucky. Last year, we sold over 48.8 billion \nworth of exports in more than 100 nations abroad. This includes over $1 \nbillion in agricultural products. Mr. President, this provided a real \nand meaningful boost to our local economy.\n  Best of all, countries that trade together do not fight and are less \nlikely to work against each other. Instead, trade helps bring nations \ntogether in working toward a common goal of mutual economic benefit \ninstead of armed conflict. In the wake of September 11th, this is more \nimportant than ever.\n  The United States needs Trade Promotion Authority. It expired almost \neight years ago, and our trade policy has been adrift since them. If \nAmerica is going to continue as the world's economic superpower, and to \nremain fully engaged in the international marketplace, we need to give \nPresident Bush the ability to effectively negotiate trade agreements \nwith other nations.\n  Currently, the United States only has three preferential trade \ncompacts; the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and \nMexico; a free trade agreement with Israel; and, our trade agreement \nwith Jordan. But in recent years our trading partners around the world \nhave at last count entered into almost 150 preferential trade compacts.\n  These are missed opportunities for us. Other nations are talking and \nnegotiating. They are enacting treaties to help their economies and \ntheir peoples. But, we are being left behind.\n  Passing a good, clean TPA bill would give us a chance at getting in \non the action. It would lead to better paying jobs for our workers, and \ngive them the opportunity to prove once again that they are the best \nand most productive in the entire world. Only by passing TPA and \nentering into new and better compacts will we be able to knock down \ndiscriminatory, unfair trade barriers and to increase the flow of goods \nand services we can sell abroad.\n  If we want a seat at the negotiating table. If we want to offer more \neconomic opportunity to American workers, we have to pass TPA. If we \ndon't, we will literally be missing the boat.\n  Until we pass TPA, other nations are going to be very hesitant about \nentering into compacts with us. No other country is going to want to \nnegotiate with a President who then has to submit a treaty to a \nCongress which has the power to nitpick every single line of an \nagreement to death. Trade treaties are complex, interwoven agreements. \nEach individual bit is not perfect. But taken together as a whole, they \ntypically promote our national interest.\n  I am sure that if every Member of Congress has their way, they would \nrewrite line by line provisions in each of the major treaties we have \npassed in recent years. That sort of politicking might play well to \nindividual constituencies back home, but it doesn't serve the larger \neconomic interest of America.\n  To my colleagues who don't like TPA and think that it is an unwise \ndelegation of congressional authority, I have to disagree with them. \nPassing this bill still gives every single member of Congress the right \nto support or oppose a treaty they don't like. Under TPA, I have voted \nfor treaties I like, and against treaties I don't like. It might not be \nthe perfect way to legislate, but it is effective and fair.\n  Every President since Gerald Ford has had TPA. I supported TPA--or \n``fast track'' or whatever you want to call it--for President Reagan. I \nsupported it for the last President Bush. I supported it for President \nClinton. And I support if for our current President. I voted for it the \nlast time I had the opportunity, in 1998 when it came to the floor and \nlost in the other body.\n  And I support TPA now.\n  Like I said before, TPA is not perfect, but it's effective. And the \nbill in front of us today is not perfect.\n  I have supported amendments to help steel workers and textile workers \nthat failed on the floor. I wish they hadn't. In Kentucky, we have a \ngood steel industry, and I want to nourish it along. It's been hard hit \nin the last few years by the dumping in the United States of cheap \nforeign steel that has unfairly and illegally cut the legs out from \nunder our domestic producers.\n  In south-central Kentucky, many of my constituents who used to work \nin the textile mills have been left high and dry when companies moved \nabroad in the wake of NAFTA, by the way an agreement that I opposed \nunder the old fast-track rules.\n  I would like to do more in this bill for them. Workers in those \nindustries need our help. They show that all trade agreements aren't \nperfect.\n  We are at least including some meaningful trade adjustment assistance \nin the package to help those who are forced to transition to different \njobs because of trade. Expanded trade usually leads to better jobs for \nworkers. But they often need smart, effective assistance to make the \nchange to new occupations. I support trade adjustment assistance to \nhelp them. The last time Congress considered TAA provisions was in 1998 \nwhen the other body looked at this issue. I was a member then, and I \nvoted for $1 billion in trade adjustment assistance for dislocated \nworkers. Fortunately, this type of assistance often helps workers move \nmore quickly back into the workforce.\n  I support the training and education provisions in this legislation. \nThey will help. Will they be enough? I don't know.\n  As for the rest of the TAA package, I believe there are some problems \nwith\n\n[[Page S4803]]\n\nthe structuring of the new health and wage benefits that I would like \nto see cleaned up in conference.\n  After years of budget surpluses, we are back to looking square in the \nface of a budget deficit in 2002 and beyond. Now the pending \nlegislation proposes to add potentially billions in new entitlement \nspending to the deficit each year. A budget crunch is not the time to \nguarantee new entitlements no matter how well intentioned they are.\n  By passing this legislation before us now, we would be cutting off \nour nose to spite our face, encouraging free trade and more economic \nactivity on the one hand, and growing the federal budget deficit by \nleaps and bounds on the other hand. That doesn't make economic sense, \nand that sort of contradiction would eventually catch up to us and lead \nto even bigger problems.\n  Also, if you read the fine print of the health and wage sections, I \nthink you will find that it is so complicated that it might not even \nwork. I am afraid that it might offer a false promise of assistance to \nworkers who need help the most.\n  For instance, the wage supplemental provision would require the \nfederal government to pay up to $5,000 for up to two years to workers \nover 50 years old if they lose their jobs due to trade activity and \nthey take a lower paying job.\n  I am afraid that this proposal would actually discourage workers from \ntaking similar paying or higher paying jobs. It just doesn't make sense \nto me to encourage people not to work. Instead of this approach, it \nwould help more if we ploughed this money back into education and \nretraining.\n  Everyone knows the old saying about providing a man a fish so he can \neat today or teaching him how to fish so he can feed himself forever. I \nthink that applies here.\n  We also have to ask how well will these new entitlements be managed \nand who will do it. Who's going to be in charge of determining whether \nor not a worker lost their job because of trade? What agency is going \nto manage the nuts and bolts of this potentially gigantic program? How \nwill the IRS respond to the administration if another health tax credit \nis being dumped on its plate? There are just too many unanswered \nquestions.\n  In the end, I am afraid we might not be able to keep many of the \npromises my colleagues want to make under the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance section. For many workers who are struggling now, that would \nbe the cruelest thing we could do to them.\n  The TAA provisions still pose many unanswered questions, and I hope \nthat we will first focus on the areas that have worked before--job \ntraining and education--before going off into new entitlement programs \nthat might not really work and actually serve to undermine the larger \ngoals of the overall legislation.\n  In conclusion, this isn't a perfect bill. I, like all of my \ncolleagues, would write it differently. But is a good effort on an \nimportant subject that America must address if we are going to secure \nour economic future. As I noted earlier, it's been four years since \neither body voted on TPA, and the failure of the House to pass a bill \nin 1998 has led to years of delay. We cannot let that happen again. We \nhave to vote to pass this bill.\n  I am not willing to let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and I \nurge support for the legislation.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Dayton-\nCraig amendment. This amendment reduces Trade Promotion Authority to \nsomething that exists in name only. With all due respect to the \nsponsors of this amendment, it is a backdoor attempt to gut this bill \nand still allow people to say they voted for free trade. It would have \na chilling effect on international trade negotiations.\n  Supporters of the Dayton-Craig amendment claim that unless you \nsupport their amendment then you do not support upholding U.S. trade \nlaws. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  I stand before you as a strong free trader who is a proponent of \nvigorous enforcement of our country's trade laws. I supported NAFTA and \nGATT as Governor and PNTR for China as a Senator. I've seen Ohio \nbenefit from NAFTA with a net increase of approximately 55,000 jobs and \nI've seen it also lose out as a result of our President not having \nTrade Promotion Authority.\n  At the same time, no one cares more about making sure our trade laws \nare followed. Ohio has lost tens of thousands of steelworker jobs as a \nresult of foreign steel dumping, which led me to urge the President to \nuse Section 201 authority to help provide relief to our nation's steel \nindustry. He did so and our steel industry now has a breather to \nreconstitute itself and regain its competitive footing.\n  I also have been a committed advocate of strengthening enforcement of \nour trade laws by addressing the human capital needs in the Commerce \nDepartment's international trade divisions. I recently held a hearing \nin which I pushed Undersecretary for International Trade Grant Aldonis \non the need to address these very concerns.\n  In little more than a year in office this Administration has already \ndemonstrated its commitment to U.S trade laws. In a letter to Congress \nthis week, Commerce Secretary Don Evans, Agriculture Secretary Ann \nVeneman and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick point out:\n\n       We have been committed not just to preserving U.S. trade \n     laws, but more importantly, to using them. The Administration \n     initiated an historic Section 201 investigation that led to \n     the imposition of wide-ranging safeguards for the steel \n     industry. The Administration's willingness to enforce \n     vigorously our trade laws, in Canadian lumber and other \n     cases, sends the clearest signal of our interest in defending \n     these laws in the WTO.\n\n  Our trade laws are part of the overall trade equation that enhances \nAmerican competitiveness by helping to guarantee new access to world \nmarkets. They require the approval of Congress before any changes are \nmade. To buy the argument that opposition to this amendment equates to \nrelinquishing control of our trade laws is to believe that Congress is \nsimply going to give up its legislative duty to the executive branch. \nThat is not going to happen. The argument is simply groundless and \nwithout merit.\n  Additionally, logic dictates that no trade negotiator is going to \nagree to something which will automatically be rejected by Congress. \nThe congressional observers guarantee that Congress is aware of what is \nbeing negotiated as it is happening. Congress has the final say in \napproving trade deals with its final vote and if I am confident of \nanything it is that this body is willing to hold up any and all \nlegislation that gives a member even the most minor case of heartburn.\n  Trade Promotion Authority does not equate to gutting our trade laws. \nThis Administration has already proven itself to be a strong defender \nof our trade laws and, regardless, Congress has the final say over \nlegislation, not the executive branch.\n  Furthermore, this amendment should be opposed because of the chilling \neffect it will have on the negotiating process. Sufficient safeguards \nalready exist in the TPA legislation to guarantee the legitimate and \nconstitutional role of Congress as the final guardian of trade law. \nThis amendment goes beyond that, however, with limits which would \nessentially allow additional and superfluous votes to hold hostage \ninternational trade negotiations.\n  As a manager, I would never assign a task to someone without also \nempowering them with the tools and authority to get the job done. \nDayton-Craig takes those tools away. Its effect wouldn't be felt \nsomewhere down the road, it would have an impact now, today. The very \nfact that this amendment has been offered has had an impact already on \nour trading partners, I am sure.\n  Again, Ambassador Zoellick writes that:\n\n       The rest of the world will determine that the U.S. Congress \n     has ruled out even discussion of a major topic. Other \n     countries will refuse to discuss their own sensitive \n     subjects, unraveling the entire trade negotiation to the \n     detriment of U.S. workers, farmers and consumers.\n\n  Without the ability to engage our trading partners effectively on \ntheir own trade laws, we cannot hope to see other countries raise their \nlaws to U.S. standards. Our country's exports are frequently targeted \nby foreign trade interests for action. Between 1995 and 2000, our \nexports were targeted for action in foreign countries 81 times. Other \ngovernments do not necessarily\n\n[[Page S4804]]\n\nshare our commitment to fair and open procedures, such as those \nconducted by our International Trade Commission.\n  To prevent unfair trade actions against our exporters, we must have \nthe leverage to engage them constructively. This amendment strips us of \nthat ability, which is one reason 79 agricultural groups urge us to \nreject the Dayton-Craig amendment.\n  If anyone is opposed to free trade, I urge them to vote their \nconscience. While I disagree with them, I respect their position, but \ndon't pretend to be for free trade and then call for an amendment which \nguts the ability of our President to negotiate the agreements that make \nfree trade a reality.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, it had been my hope that the Senate would \nvote today on my amendment to the Baucus substitute amendment No. 3401 \nto the trade bill, H.R. 3009. Sadly, that will not be the case because \nof procedural roadblocks that foreshadow the kinds of obstacles that \npassage of the underlying bill will raise when we consider future trade \nagreements in the Senate.\n  My amendment is about fairness for secondary workers who I believe \nare being treated unfairly. This is why I voted against cloture for the \nunderlying substitute, and one of the reasons why I will vote against \nthe bill on final passage.\n  Nonetheless, I want to take a few moments to point out the plight of \nsecondary workers, and urge my colleagues to pay close attention to the \nissue as it continues to develop after we pass this bill later today. \nSeveral things have been said on the Senate floor about trade \nadjustment assistance, TAA, and secondary workers during the length of \nthis discourse on trade, and I think it is important to go back and \nhighlight some of them and reiterate what the truth is in this debate.\n  Most importantly, I think it is imperative that we realize that \nhowever many jobs we may create through export-related activities, we \nmay lose many more due to the impact of imports. The choice before us \nis, how do we treat those workers adversely impacted by trade \nagreements in the future? Is it not fair to try to change the rules \ngoverning our trade policy to make a more fair and equitable \ndistribution of benefits to those harmed?\n  If my colleagues believe that is the case for some workers, as \ndemonstrated by the support for TAA in NAFTA and the reauthorization of \nthe program in the legislation before us, then it should be the case \nfor all workers. It continues that this should mean that TAA is \navailable for a particular worker whether they are employed by a \nfactory that is directly shut down by trade, or if they work for a \ncompany that supplied parts to that first factory, only if that \nparticular worker has become unemployed due to the effects of trade.\n  I mentioned in my earlier remarks that the TAA Program has been a \nsuccessful one since its inception, and I want to reiterate that. In \nfact, since April 1975 through December 2001, almost 3 million workers \nwere certified as TAA eligible. However, almost 2.5 million workers \nwere also denied certification. This demonstrates the demand for this \nimportant program, but also reflects the fact that it is a difficult \nprocess--something that would not be altered should we allow secondary \nworkers to be a part of it.\n  Another point I would like to reiterate from my earlier remarks is \nthe fact that since the ratification of NAFTA, TAA has applied to \nsecondary workers that lose their jobs as a result of the NAFTA trade \nagreement. In fact, a total of almost 700,000 workers applied for \nNAFTA-TAA certification from January 1994 through December 2001, and \nover 400,000 were granted certification.\n  Although the exact numbers of how many of those beneficiaries were \nsecondary workers are unknown, the fact remains that they have the \nright to apply for eligibility. Unfortunately, under the pending bill, \nsecondary workers whose jobs have been lost due to a possible trade \nagreement with Chile, or Singapore, or any other country, will not be \neligible to even apply for certification under TAA.\n  Now let me relay some facts about secondary workers and TAA. A GAO \nreport from October 2000 estimated that there could be from 34,000 to \n211,000 secondary workers annually who could potentially apply for TAA \nbenefits. This reflects the depth and reach of trade's effects on the \nlivelihoods of American workers.\n  Another GAO report from July 2001 showed that $494 million was \nexpended on re-training for about 170,000 workers under TAA. This \nbreaks down to less than $3,000 per worker. I think many would agree \nthat is a small sum comparatively speaking, particularly when one \nconsiders the amount of training or schooling an individual can gain \nfrom that amount of money.\n  It is precisely these kinds of workers that so need this type of \ninvestment in training and schooling. The GAO reports I earlier \nreferenced cited the fact that about 80 percent of workers using TAA \nbenefits in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 had a high school education or \nless, compared to 42 percent in the labor force as a whole.\n  In other words, this is a modest increase in funds for TAA benefits \nthat will go a long way toward a worker's developments of new skills, \nand reentry into the workforce to be a productive citizen once again.\n  It is not an excuse to claim that the Department of Labor does not \nhave adequate resources and staffing to deal with an expansion of the \nTAA Program to secondary workers. First of all, the Department has the \nexperience in dealing with this issue, since it already decides on \ncertification for secondary workers under NAFTA. Second, I believe we \nhave a responsibility to add funding for the Department of Labor in \norder for it to be able to deal with a potentially larger increase in \nits workload.\n  This issue is part of our choice here--do we discount these workers \nwho have added to the economy, who pay taxes, and who provide for their \nfamily, just because they do not happen to be directly employed by a \nparticular firm that was shut down by trade? Again, this is unfair \ntreatment to a segment of our population that deserves our help.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to join the debate over trade \npromotion authority legislation before the Senate.\n  I am in my 10th year as a member of the U.S. Senate and I have \nconsistently voted for measures to open new markets to our exporters \nand our workers.\n  Today, I will vote for trade promotion authority, or TPA. New export \nopportunities for Washington State will support economic recovery and \nexpansion.\n  Washington State is the most trade-dependent State in the country. \nInternational trade matters tremendously to each and every region of my \nState and to every sector of our economy. Trade matters to my State in \ngood and bad economic times. We are an export State. We have a trade \nsurplus. We are also a port State and gateway to Asia and the world.\n  My constituents benefit from trade at every point. We grow the \ncommodities. We move containers and cargo from ships to rail to \ndestinations throughout the country. We manufacture, build, design, \ndevelop, finance and insure goods and services traded globally each and \nevery day. Trade jobs--estimated to be one in three jobs in Washington \nState--are good family wage jobs in my State.\n  Importantly, this legislation also significantly expands trade \nadjustment assistance. I have always supported trade adjustment \nassistance. I commend the Finance Committee, the Democratic leader and \nthe bipartisan work which led to the expanded TAA package in this \nlegislation.\n  I was a cosponsor of S. 1209, the Trade Adjustment Assistance for \nWorkers, Farmers, Fisherman, Communities and Firms Act of 2002. The TAA \nlanguage in this legislation is really a product of S. 1209 and the \nbipartisan work of many in the Senate to expand TAA.\n  More workers will be eligible for trade adjustment assistance. Some \nworkers from secondary industries will be covered for the first time \nunder the Senate TPA bill.\n  The Senate legislation provides community assistance, particularly to \nrural communities, who see significant job loss related to trade. \nCommunities will have the opportunity to seek grant assistance to \nimplement economic diversification plans.\n  Farmers and fishermen will also be eligible for TAA assistance.\n\n[[Page S4805]]\n\n  Importantly, the Senate bill provides new health benefits to \ndisplaced workers. A new 70 percent up-front, refundable tax credit for \nCOBRA coverage will enable many workers and their families to keep \ntheir health insurance.\n  The Senate has considered a number of important amendments and issues \nin this debate over trade promotion authority. I voted for a number of \nimportant message amendments. I encourage the administration as it \neventually moves forward with trade talks to give serious consideration \nto the expressed will of the Senate.\n  I expect a significant bipartisan vote for trade promotion authority \ntoday. Then the legislation must go to conference with legislation \nadopted by the House of Representatives. The House TPA bill is very \ndifferent from the Senate bill. Conference committees require \ncompromise, and I anticipate changes to the Senate-passed version.\n  Regardless of the conference committee outcome, the administration \nshould not disregard the Senate TPA debate. The Senate addressed some \nvery difficult issues. In future trade talks, the administration will \nbe called upon to address issues like those raised on the Senate floor. \nSome in this body will judge trade agreements submitted to the Congress \non these issues. The administration now knows a great deal about the \nconcerns of the Congress. There will be fewer surprises for either the \nCongress or the administration as the future negotiations occur thanks \nin part to the Senate debate.\n  I want to be very clear about my expectations for the upcoming TPA \nconference committee. I strongly believe any agreement between the \nHouse and the Senate must include the Senate trade adjustment \nassistance package.\n  It is tremendously important to me that we do all we can to boost \njobs and create jobs that rely on international trade. Expanded trade \nis a recipe for economic growth in Washington State. That is why I will \nvote for trade promotion authority and advocate for my State's many \ntrade interests with the President and this administration.\n  At the same time, I know that every worker, every industry, every \ncommunity does not share the benefits of expanded trade equally. Where \ndislocation and hardship occurs, as a result of international trade, \nour government should play an activist role in helping workers and \ncommunities through these changing and challenging economic times.\n  The Congress has an opportunity to do both on this legislation. We \ncan move forward to create and protect trade jobs. And we can do the \nright thing in helping workers and communities combat unfair foreign \ntrade practices and the changes in the global economy.\n  TPA, or fast track, has been granted to every administration since \nPresident Gerald Ford was in office. Congress has granted this \nauthority to Democratic and Republican Presidents. Granting this \nauthority which I will support does not obligate any Senator to support \nan agreement. And I will certainly scrutinize any agreement submitted \nto the Congress by the President under TPA.\n  My vote for trade promotion authority is a vote to open markets to \nU.S. exporters and their workers. It is a vote for equitable and \nreciprocal access to foreign markets. The U.S. marketplace is the \nworld's largest market, and our market is open with few restrictions to \nthe world. I want to see the President go abroad on behalf of the \nAmerican people with the goal of opening markets and supporting U.S. \nworkers.\n  My vote for trade promotion authority is a call on the President and \nthe administration to strengthen the international trade system and \nparticularly, to strengthen the dispute settlement process for trade \ndisputes. The Senate legislation contains important transparency \nguidance to the administration calling for public access to WTO and \nother international trade proceedings.\n  My vote for trade promotion authority represents my continued belief \nthat environmental protection and worker rights are legitimate trade \nissues. These issues must be included in trade negotiations if the \nCongress is to continue to have bipartisan support for international \ntrade initiatives.\n  The Senate legislation contains a number of negotiating objectives of \ngreat importance to Washington. The legislation directs U.S. \nnegotiators to seek a revision of WTO rules that disadvantage the U.S. \nin tax cases like foreign sales corporations which benefit U.S. \nexporters. Additionally, the Senate bill provides guidance to the \nadministration in a number of important Washington state industries \nlike agriculture and high-technology.\n  Of great importance to me and to Washington State is the Senate \nlanguage on trade in commercial aircraft. This legislation directs U.S. \nnegotiators to address the use of unfair subsidies and non-tariff \nbarriers by Airbus. I continue to believe Airbus manipulates the \ncommercial aircraft market through subsidies and an assortment of non-\ncompetitive practices. I have met with the U.S. Trade Representative \nregarding Airbus. I fully support the language in this bill to address \nunfair trade practices in commercial aircraft.\n  I will vote for passage for this legislation, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to send a strong message of support for trade and economic \nexpansion.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nconcerns about the trade difficulties suffered by our Nation's \nasparagus growers, and to discuss an important amendment I attempted to \noffer to the trade bill. Unfortunately, my amendment was blocked by \nsome of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  I know that in many respects global trade holds great promise for \nagriculture by opening new markets and building new demand for the \nbountiful, nutritious food and fiber that is grown in America. But, \nsome commodities have been harmed by past trade agreements. That is an \nimportant fact that should have been acknowledged and addressed during \nthe Senate's debate on trade agreements.\n  Under preferential treatment provided through the Andean Trade \nPreferences Act (ATPA), Andean countries, like Peru, have been shipping \nduty-free asparagus to the United States since 1992. The asparagus \nmarket is extremely sensitive to these imports. Many of the growers in \nmy state forecast an end to domestic asparagus production if something \nis not done soon to help. Last year alone, growers in Michigan lost \n$2.9 million due to competing duty free asparagus imported from Peru.\n  I support the goal of the ATPA B to encourage economic growth in \nAndean nations as an alternative to the production and export of \nillegal, narcotic drugs to the United States B but not at the expense \nof the entire domestic asparagus industry. Since enactment of ATPA, \nshipments of fresh asparagus from one Andean nation, Peru, have \nincreased from 14.5 percent of total imports to 41.3 percent. Since \n1992, shipments of frozen asparagus from Peru have increased from 3 \npercent of total imports to 71.4 percent.\n  I authored an amendment that would have helped to resolve this trade \nsituation and that would have provided some relief to domestic \nasparagus growers. My amendment was cosponsored by Senators Levin, \nMurray, Cantwell, Boxer, and Feinstein.\n  The amendment would have allowed preferential treatment of Andean \nasparagus up to a certain point and then established a safeguard for \ndomestic growers. In sum, my amendment allowed Andean imports of duty \nfree asparagus up to 30 percent of the total imports of asparagus into \nthe U.S. per year. Once the 30 percent threshold was met, duty free \ntreatment would be suspended for the remainder of the calendar year.\n  This was a reasonable solution that would have helped both our \nnation's asparagus growers and would have allowed imported Andean \nasparagus to compete on a level playing field. It is unfortunate that \nthis amendment was not included in the trade bill. I intend to continue \nto work on this issue and consider other programs, such as market loss \npayments, that may provide some relief to the asparagus growers in my \nstate and across the nation.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of final passage of \nthis trade legislation. But I do so with the understanding and the hope \nthat a number of items in the bill now before us will, in the coming \nweeks, be adequately addressed in conference with the House. I \ntherefore voice my support, but not unconditionally.\n  The first element of this legislation, which frankly should have been \npassed\n\n[[Page S4806]]\n\nseparately earlier this year on the basis of its nearly unanimous \nsupport, is the extension and expansion of the Andean Trade Preference \nAct (ATPA).\n  The Andean Trade Preference Act was conceived a decade ago as part of \na mutual effort between the United States and the Andean countries to \nstrengthen our economies, which in turn, would help us in the war \nagainst drugs. In 10 years of existence, ATPA has become an essential \ntool for the commercial interchange between the United States and the \nAndean region. Approximately 140,000 new jobs have been created in the \nAndean region over this time period, and the steady flow of investment \nhas helped to double two way trade between the United States and the \nregion. Furthermore, great strides have been made in the war against \ndrugs; important drug cartels were disbanded, and hundreds of cocaine \nlabs were destroyed.\n  Today, the Andean region faces a very critical moment. ATPA is \nessential to guarantee sustainability of the achievements we have made \nover the last decade, and to encourage further progress toward the \nshared goal of negotiating the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). \nI am very pleased that the Senate will act, albeit late, to extend this \ncritical trade act.\n  Before I dwell on the concerns I have with trade-promotion authority \nportion of this bill, let me first speak to its strengths. Since trade-\npromotion authority lapsed in 1994, America has stood on the sidelines \nwhile other countries have brokered trade agreements that benefit their \nworkers, their businesses, and their economies. Soon after taking \noffice, President Bush called on Congress to grant him trade-promotion \nauthority to reassert America's leadership in promoting U.S. goods and \nthe expertise of our workforce to more markets. The need for expanded \nmarkets dramatically intensified after our nation's economy underwent a \ndecline last March, and the events of September 11th forced so many \nAmericans out of their jobs.\n  Trade-promotion authority provides the President with the flexibility \nhe needs to negotiate strong international trade agreements on behalf \nof U.S. workers and farmers while maintaining Congress' constitutional \nrole over U.S. trade policy. It represents a thoughtful approach to \naddressing the complex relationship between international trade, worker \nrights, and the environment without undermining the fundamental purpose \nand proven effectiveness of trade-promotion authority procedures. The \nbill before us will help us to achieve this goal. It not only sends a \nmessage that we are serious about the principle of open markets, but it \nwill be a powerful example, to nations around the world, of what trade-\npromotion authority can deliver: economic prosperity on a grand scale.\n  Specifically, it gives the administration the authority to negotiate \nand bring back trade agreements to Congress that will reduce trade \nbarriers, especially those based on unsound science, relating to the \nmanufacturing, services, agriculture, intellectual property, \ninvestment, and e-commerce industries. It helps to eliminate subsidies \nthat decrease market opportunities for U.S. agriculture, and unfairly \ndistort markets to the detriment of the United States. It preserves \nU.S. sovereignty while enabling new trade agreements that will create \nsolid economic growth, higher-paying jobs for hard-working Americans, \nimproved efficiency and innovation, and increased availability of \nattractively priced products in the U.S. market.\n\n  The Office of the U.S. Trade Representatives is similarly directed to \nvigorously enforce U.S. trade-remedy laws and avoid agreements which \nlessen the effectiveness of U.S. antidumping or countervailing duty \nlaws. This bill contains negotiating objectives on investment to \nincrease transparency for the dispute settlement process, calling for \nstandards for expropriation and compensation that are consistent with \nUnited States legal principles and practice in an effort to eliminate \nfrivolous claims. Perhaps most importantly, it expands and improves \nconsultations between the administration and Congress, before, during, \nand after trade negotiations and in the development of an implementing \nbill.\n  Also included in this legislation is language I authored to suspend \nfor a period of five years the 4.9 percent tariff on steam generators \nfor nuclear facilities. These generators are not manufactured in the \nUnited States. Tariffs should never be imposed on products that are not \ndomestically manufactured, especially those products that are critical \nfor maintaining the U.S. domestic supply of energy.\n  This tariff amounts to a ``tax'' of approximately $1.5 million per \ngenerator on consumers of electricity in those states where utilities \nwill have to import from overseas to meet the immediate need to replace \naging steam generators, which cost would be passed on to ratepayers. In \nthe case of the Palo Verde, Arizona plant--the nation's largest nuclear \npower facility in terms of production--the additional cost, due to the \ntariff, is over $8.2 million for the six generators that it will need \nto import.\n  Failure to suspend this tariff will unfairly result in higher energy \nprices for consumers, as the utility companies will almost certainly \npass on this tax to its customers.\n  This bill also includes the Kyl Customs Border Security Act \namendment, added unanimously by the Senate Finance Committee in \nDecember 2001, which will provide significant authority to help \nfacilitate legitimate trade, reduce illegal drug and contraband \ntrafficking and eliminate threats of terrorism.\n  The Kyl amendment authorizes funding to increase the very tools by \nwhich the Customs Service facilities cross-border trade, and fights \nterrorism and narcotics trafficking. Under the amendments, Customs on \nthe Southwest border will receive funding for high-technology \nequipment, including container inspection equipment, automated \ntargeting systems and surveillance systems, all of which will help to \nstop terrorism and illegal drug trafficking. The northern border is \nalso authorized to receive similar valuable equipment, as are out Gulf \nCoast seaports.\n  The Kyl amendment also mandates that cargo and passenger manifests be \nprovided in advance to Customs, whether such cargo or passengers enter \nby land, air or sea. I have learned that this provision is Commissioner \nBonner's number one anti-terrorism legislative priority. Advanced \nelectronic manifest data delivered to Customs is absolutely necessary \nfor the agency to identify individuals and cargo that should not enter \nthe United States. The amendment also authorizes funding for personnel, \ntechnology and for Customs' new computer system, ACE, Automated \nCommercial Environment, to bring the agency's tracking of business and \ntheir goods entering the country into the 21st century.\n  Under the Kyl amendment, the U.S. Customs Service itself, for the \nfirst time in over a decade, will also be reauthorized. As our nation's \noldest law enforcement agency, this is particularly important.\n  Finally, the Kyl amendment will close longstanding outbound smuggling \nthreats by clarifying that the Customs Service is authorized to search \noutbound international mail. I strongly believe that this section of \nthe amendment is integral to our efforts to combat money laundering, \ntechnology export violations, and terrorist funding crimes.\n  Currently, inbound mail, and most everything else leaving the \ncountry--cargo containers, luggage, boxes, individual persons--and \nstamped mail on a person--is searchable by the Customs Service. The \nCustoms Service is only precluded from searching outbound mail. \nSmugglers may send drugs, finance terrorism, or send explosives on \naircraft by simply mailing their contraband or money out of the \ncountry. My amendment, added to the trade adjustment assistance bill \nduring that bill's consideration in the Finance Committee, would \nauthorize the search of all first class mail by Customs, as long as the \nCustoms Service has reasonable suspicion about such mail. The amendment \nalso clarifies, through codification, that all mail besides that \nconsidered first-class--referred to as ``mail not sealed against \ninspection--can be searched without reasonable suspicion. Under this \nprovision, none of the mail that is allowed to be searched is allowed \nto be read without a warrant.\n  During floor consideration of this trade package, Senator Jon Corzine\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\nraised objections to the outbound mail provision. Although I fully \nsupport the original outbound mail provision, and will support such \nprovision in conference, I appreciate the efforts of Senator Corzine \nand his staff to work with me and my staff toward resolution in this \nparticular debate. Substitute language has been accepted by the Senate, \nto replace my original language, that would exempt first-class mail \nwith a weight of under 16 ounces from the reasonable search authority \nthat we are attempting to authorize for the Customs Service. In \naddition, under this new language, a requirement has been placed \nrequiring the State Department to issue a report about whether or not \nthe ``in-transit'' mail authority provision, which will allow \nappropriate searches of international mail destined for a third country \nbut which travels through the United States on its way, is consistent \nwith international law.\n  Less than three weeks ago the Congress passed, and the President \nsigned into law, the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform \nAct, which will provide all areas of the Justice Department and the \nState Department with personnel and resources to fight the war on \nterrorism. In that bill, an interoperable data sharing system will aid \nall federal law enforcement to better track and identify would-be \nterrorists. Because of jurisdictional concerns about customs, that \nvitally important bill does not include resources for the Customs \nService. That is why it is so important that this bill include such \nfunding. The Kyl Customs Border Security Act does so and is an integral \npart of my decision to support the overall package.\n\n  Many have spoken about how trade-promotion authority will help the \nUnited States. I want to speak for a moment about how trade-promotion \nauthority will help my home state of Arizona specifically. This bill \nwill open new markets worldwide to Arizona goods and services. That, in \nturn, will boost local communities' economies, provide job security for \nthe hundreds of thousands of Arizonans whose work depends on exports--\nthe backbone of the Arizona economy.\n  One out of every five manufacturing job in Arizona is tied to \nexports. An estimated 70,400 Arizona jobs support the manufactured-\ngoods-for-export industry directly. Wages of workers in jobs supported \nby exports are 13 to 18 percent higher than the national average. \nRoughly 5,060 Arizona citizens hold jobs related to agriculture \nexports. Arizona exported $333 million in agriculture in 1999. And last \nyear, Arizona sold more than $10 billion worth of exports to nearly 200 \nforeign markets, and produced and exported more than $9.4 billion worth \nof manufactured items such as computers, electronics, machinery, \ntransportation equipment, fabricated metal products and appliances. \nArizona relies on its exports with export sales of nearly $2,000 for \nevery state resident. Clearly, trade-promotion authority only brings \nmore good news to Arizona's entrepreneurs and small businesses.\n  But as I mentioned above, there is much that needs to be done before \nwe can deliver this good news. Let me briefly elaborate on my specific \nconcerns that will need to be addressed in conference. First, it is \nimperative that we remove the so-called ``Dayton-Craig'' language that \nwould permit the raising of a point of order if the implementing \nlegislation negotiated under trade-promotion authority amends U.S. \ntrade remedies law, however technical or even beneficial the change. \nThis language, if kept in the final legislation, will unravel \nsuccessful trade negotiations, and it is wholly unnecessary to add it \non top of language already included and explicitly states in the bill, \ni.e., the directive to ``preserve the ability of the United States to \nenforce rigorously its trade laws'' and ``avoid agreements that lessen \nthe effectiveness of domestic and international disciplines on unfair \ntrade.''\n  I am also disappointed by the multitude and details of the trade \nadjustment assistance (TAA) provisions in this legislation. I firmly \nbelieve that, rather than enacting a whole host of new entitlements, \nthe best assistance we can provide to unemployed (or displaced) workers \nis enhanced free trade, which will in turn provide greater job \nopportunities. However, this legislation has become burdened with a \nvariety of new and expended entitlements that, while well-intentioned, \nwill only serve to distort the free-market and delay the inevitable \nbenefits of freer trade for our citizens.\n  One of thee provisions is a ``wage insurance'' entitlement, which \nwould provide up to a $5,000 subsidy for older TAA-certified workers \nwho are subsequently employed at lower-paying jobs. Aside from a \ncomplete lack of data supporting the efficacy of such a proposal, this \nprovision would create significant disincentives for workers to forgo \nneeded training and/or a more intensive job search. Instead, it will \nlikely result in workers choosing lower paying and perhaps lower-\nskilled jobs with the taxpayers liable for the difference.\n\n  Another provision in this legislation provides an advanceable, \nrefundable health insurance tax credit to TAA-certified workers. The \ncredit is set at an arbitrarily high percentage of the premiums' cost--\n70 percent--and can only be used to subsidize the cost of company-based \nCOBRA or pooled health insurance policies. Additionally, it can not be \nused for the purchase of individual market policies, which might better \nsuit the workers' health needs at a reduced cost. I believe that it is \nunfair for American taxpayers, many of whom may not have health \ninsurance themselves, to provide such a generous health insurance \nsubsidy.\n  Despite the serious concerns I have expressed about these provisions, \nI intend to vote in favor of this overall legislation at this time. \nBut, as I mentioned earlier, this is a qualified vote. Unless \nsubstantial improvement is made to this legislation during conference, \nI will not vote for the bill when it returns.\n  With few exceptions, I believe that the House-passed language on TPA, \nTAA and ATPA is far superior to the Senate-passed language. And there \nare some specific items that must be addressed in a House-Senate \nconference before I can vote in favor of a final bill.\n  First, the conference report must maintain the 2002-2006 suspension \nof 4.9 percent tariff on steam generators for nuclear power facilities.\n  Second, the conference report must remove the so-called ``Dayton-\nCraig'' language.\n  Third, it must either eliminate or substantially improve the language \ncreating a ``wage insurance'' program for TAA-certified workers age 50 \nand older.\n  Fourth, the conference report must also make significant improvements \nto the health insurance tax credit for TAA-certified workers.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on addressing these \nconcerns, and I hope to be able to vote for final passage of this \nimportant legislation.\n  As a matter of principle on the one hand, and of sound economic \npolicy on the other, I believe that we must grant the President trade-\npromotion authority. And, as has been stated by many of my colleagues, \nwe must be careful to ensure that the final language of the bill \npreserves this authority. So while I believe that this bipartisan \neffort represents a strong vote in favor of trade-promotion authority, \nI caution that there is still work to be done before it can be sent to \nthe White House.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when fighting for American working men and \nwomen, most members of Congress want to go into the ring with both arms \nswinging. That is why I am at a loss to understand why some members of \nCongress are willing to tie one hand behind their back when it comes to \ntrade. The way I see it, fast track ties one hand behind our collective \nback when trade agreements come before the Congress.\n  I have some serious concerns with the Baucus-Grassley fast track \nlegislation being considered by the Senate. Granting the President \nbroad fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements means Congress \nmust adopt a law to implement any trade agreement on a straight up of \ndown vote, without the ability to offer amendments. I believe in free \ntrade. I support the Jordan Free Trade Agreement, the Vietnam Free \nTrade Agreement and granting China PNTR. But I am reluctant to give up \nthe Congressional right to amend trade legislation, sight unseen. When \nwe do that, we are throwing away on of the most effective tools in \nforcing fairer trade practices.\n  We should negotiate trade agreements to protect human rights as well\n\n[[Page S4808]]\n\nas labor and environmental standards. The Senate should have acted to \nensure that these and other provisions addressing fairness in trade \npractices are included in future trade agreements. The Baucus-Grassley \napproach doesn't provide us with the means to do that and in fact fall \nfar short of achieving these goals.\n  America's trade policy over the past 30 years has helped create a \none-way street. The U.S. market is one of the most open in the world, \nyet we have failed to achieve foreign markets being equally open to \nAmerican products. Some of the trade agreements the U.S. has entered \ninto have fallen far short of opening foreign markets. To ensure free \nand fair trade will be achieved in any future trade agreement, Congress \nmust not give up its ability to amend the legislation implementing the \nagreement.\n  I have fought hard to strengthen U.S. trade laws to help open foreign \nmarkets to American and Michigan products such as automobiles, auto \nparts, communications equipment, cherries, apples, and wood products.\n  The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), enacted January 1, \n1994, is a good example of a trade agreement negotiated under ``fast \ntrack'' authority. It contained provisions allowing Mexico to protect \nits auto industry and discriminate against U.S. manufactured \nautomobiles used cars and auto parts for up to 25 years. It allowed \nMexico to require auto manufacturers assembling vehicles in Mexico to \npurchase 36 percent of their parts from Mexican parts manufacturers. It \nalso allowed for 25 more years the Mexican law against selling American \nused cars in Mexico, a highly discriminatory provision against U.S. \nautos.\n  When NAFTA was presented to Congress, it was an agreement which \ndiscriminated against some of the principle products that are made in \nMichigan. I surely could not vote for the bill the way it was written, \nnor could I try to amend the bill because the fast-track authority the \nPresident had at that time prohibited implementing legislation from \nbeing amended. Consequently, after NAFTA was enacted, the U.S. went \nfrom a trade surplus of $1.7 billion in 1993 to a trade deficit of $25 \nbillion with Mexico in 2000. Over the same period, our trade deficit \nincreased from $11 billion to $44.9 billion with Canada. Since NAFTA \nwas enacted, the automotive trade deficit with Mexico has reached $23 \nbillion.\n  Moroever, between January, 1994 and early May 2002, the Department of \nLabor certified over 400,000 workers as having suffered job losses as a \nresult of increased imports from or plant relocations to Mexico or \nCanada. These job losses occurred all over the country as well as from \naround the State of Michigan. For example, 27 employees from the Blue \nWater Fiber company in Port Huron who produced pulp for paper lost \ntheir jobs as a result of NAFTA imports. 129 employees of Alcoe \nFujikura Limited in Owosso who made electronic radio equipment lost \ntheir jobs to Mexico. 1,133 employees of the Copper Range Mine in the \nUP lost their jobs when operations were moved to Canada. 300 employees \nof Eagle Ottawa Leather in Grand Haven who made leather for automobile \ninteriors lost their jobs when their jobs moved to Mexico. The list of \nNAFTA-TAA certified jobs losses goes on and on. These are not job \nlosses from a level playing field. These are losses from a sloping \nfield tilted against us.\n  We have lost too many manufacturing jobs because our trade policies \nhave been so weak over the decades. I've always believed that when \ncountries raise barriers to our products that we ought to treat them no \nbetter than they treat us. Fast track authority makes it more difficult \nfor Congress to insist on fair treatment for American products and \nequal access to foreign markets.\n  Calling NAFTA a free trade agreement was disingenuous. NAFTA \nprotected Mexican industries and it also gave special treatment to \ncertain industries. For example, leather products and footwear got the \nlongest U.S. tariff phase out--15 years--and it include safeguard \nprovisions against import surges in these sectors. Agricultural \nCommodities/Fruits and Vegetables including sugar, cotton, dairy, \npeanuts, oranges, also got a 15-year U.S. tariff phase out, a quota \nsystem, and the reimposition of a higher duty if imports exceed agreed-\nupon quota levels. It is clear that those who are represented at the \nnegotiating table are able to strike favorable deals to protect certain \nindustries and products. That is not free trade.\n  NAFTA was not the only trade agreement that included specially \ntailored provisions for certain products. The trade bill we are being \nasked to vote on contains special provisions to protect textiles, \ncitrus and some other speciality agriculture commodities.\n  The Andean Trade Preferences Act also protects certain industries. \nATPA expands duty free access to Andean nations for some previously \nexcluded categories of products but there are significant exclusions or \nspecial rules that continue to protect them. The exclusions in the \nSenate ATPA bill include: most footwear; textiles and apparel are \nincluded but are subject to a number of special rules and limitations \nsuch as requiring that certain apparel products be sewn with U.S. \nthread in order to receive duty-free access, requiring the use of a \ncertain spandex product made exclusively by the DuPont company, \nrequiring the use of U.S. yarn throughout in order to qualify for duty-\nfree access; and canned tuna is included but the Senate bill allows \nduty free treatment for very limited quantities of cannot tuna to be \nimported and subject to a very restricted rule of origin.\n  These are special protections being granted to specific industry \nsectors. Why are these products be treated in a privileged manner over \nother important U.S.-made or grown products? This is not free trade.\n  I believe that writing labor and environmental standards into trade \nagreements is an important way to ensure that free trade is fair trade. \nRegrettably, this legislation does not go far enough to assure \ninternational labor and environmental standards will be present in \ntrade agreements. We need trade agreements with enforceable labor and \nenvironmental provisions but this bill does not provide it.\n  This is unfortunate given the U.S. Senate is already on record \nsupporting strong labor and environmental standards in trade \nagreements. The Senate passed the Jordan Free Trade Agreement on \nSeptember 21, 2001. The Jordan agreement broke new ground in its \ntreatment of labor and environmental standards in trade agreements. For \nthe first time, it required that the parties to the agreement reflect \nthe core internationally recognized labor rights in their own domestic \nlabor laws.\n  The bill the Senate is considering today does not require countries \nto implement the core ILO labor standards. It only requires them to \nenforce their existing labor laws, however weak they may be. It also \nspecifically states that the U.S. may not retaliate against a trading \npartner that lowers or weakens its labor or environmental laws.\n  This language undercuts our ability to negotiate strong labor and \nenvironmental standards in future trade agreements because our trading \npartners know we can not enforce what we negotiate through the use of \nsanctions and the dispute settlement process.\n  American workers already compete against workers from countries where \nwages are significantly lower than in the United States. They should \nnot have to compete against countries that gain an unfair comparative \nadvantage because they pollute their air and water and fail to allow \ntheir workers to exercise rights that are fundamental. The United \nStates enacted environmental standards that protect our air and water. \nWe have enacted labor standards that allow for collective bargaining \nand the right to organize, that prohibit the use of child labor and \nprovide protections for workers in the work place. These are desirable \nstandards that we worked hard to get. Why should we force American \nworkers to compete against countries with no such standards or \nprotection for its workers?\n  There are many ways to improve this fast track legislation to address \nsome of the concerns I've outlined. I supported many of these efforts. \nFor Congress to give up its role under the Constitution without those \nprotections is to fail to learn from our past mistakes. To do so means \nwe have willingly tied one hand behind our back in the fight for free \nand fair trade. That is something I am simply unwilling to do.\n\n[[Page S4809]]\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to detail some of the \nbenefits of trade promotion authority to American agriculture.\n  Our President, regardless of party, has not had trade negotiating \nauthority since 1994. While other countries have been busy negotiating \ntrade agreements, the world's superpower has been sitting on the \nsidelines. Today, over 150 trade agreements exist worldwide; the United \nStates is party to only three. This disparity must be remedied, but \nwithout trade promotion authority, U.S. exporters and our nation's \nfarmers may be left stuck in the mud. The question is not whether the \nU.S. should have free trade or no free trade. The question is, will the \nU.S. participate in the world economy or will we be left behind?\n  TPA is critical to the administration's credibility at the \nnegotiating table. Without TPA, our negotiators may not even get a seat \nat the table, much less have the opportunity to negotiate vigorously \nfor our national interest. With 96 percent of consumers living outside \nthe United States, the absence of negotiating authority is a price we \ncannot afford to pay.\n  One third of U.S. farm acres is planted for export, 25 percent of \ngross farm income is export dependent, and over 12 million U.S. jobs \ndepend on exports. Nearly 100 commodity and agricultural groups and a \nbipartisan group of ten former U.S. Secretaries of Agriculture support \nTrade Promotion Authority.\n  Where would American agriculture be without international trade? Last \nyear, U.S. agricultural exports totaled $51 billion. This year, federal \nofficials expect this number to grow to $53.5 billion, an agricultural \ntrade surplus of $14.5 billion. Can we find an additional $14.5 billion \na year in the federal budget to offset these losses?\n  According to the USDA, U.S. agriculture is 2\\1/2\\ times more trade \ndependent than the general economy. American agriculture needs trade \npromotion authority to reduce worldwide tariffs. While the average \ntariff assessed by the United States on agricultural products is less \nthan 5 percent, the average agricultural tariff assessed by other \ncountries exceeds 60 percent.\n  As a Senator from Illinois, I represent a big agricultural state with \ntotal cash farm receipts totaling $7 billion in the year 2000. With a \n42 percent reliance on agricultural exports, Illinois ranks sixth with \nagricultural exports of $3 billion. My State's top agricultural exports \ninclude--soybeans and soybean products at $1.1 billion, feed grains and \nfeed grain products at $946 million, live animals and red meats at $277 \nmillion, and wheat and wheat products at $124 million. When it comes to \nIllinois agriculture, open markets and trade promotion authority are of \ntantamount importance.\n  Illinois is the largest soybean producing state in the nation. Under \nthe Uruguay Round, South Korea is required to reduce its tariffs on \nsoybean oil by 14.5 percent from 1995 to 2004. USDA has reported that \nthis ``tariff reduction has supported a threefold increase in export \nvolume.''\n  Illinois is also the fourth largest pork producing State in the \nNation. Since the Uruguay Round agreement went into effect, U.S. pork \nexports have increased by almost 90 percent in volume and approximately \n80 percent in value from 1994 levels.\n  Additionally, Illinois ranks second in corn production. While Brazil, \nChile, Paraguay, and Uruguay can trade corn with Argentina duty free, \nU.S. corn is assessed an eleven percent import tax.\n  Voting against fast-track authority means you endorse the status quo \nof high tariffs and limited access for U.S. goods, while voting for \nfast-track gives the administration the tools needed to remedy some of \nthese egregious inequities.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the legislation that we are about to pass \nis the most difficult bill that the Senate has considered this year. \nLike nothing else that we have seen this year, trade promotion \nauthority has put some of my most deeply-held beliefs in conflict with \neach other.\n  TPA does two things. First, it makes a broad statement about the \nimportance of international trade. Accurate or not, there is a belief \nin this city that you must support TPA to demonstrate your unflinching \nsupport for greater opportunity for U.S. businesses abroad. The \nWashington view is that you must support TPA if you believe that \npolitical liberalization comes from economic liberalization.\n  The facts suggest that, certainly, lowering barriers to trade in the \nworld is good for U.S. businesses and good for the U.S. economy. \nBusinesses in Massachusetts sold more than $19.7 billion worth of goods \nto more than 200 foreign markets last year. That is more than $3,000 \nworth of goods sold abroad for every resident. And, while we tend to \nthink of international trade as being the playground of big business, \nalmost 75 percent of my State's exporting businesses are small \nbusinesses. Of larger businesses which have overseas subsidiaries, \nalmost three-fourths of profits earned abroad are returned to parent \ncompanies in the United States. That means more jobs and higher wages \nat home. Today, one-tenth of all jobs in this country are directly \nrelated to our ability to export goods and services. When you consider \nmultiplying effects, that number rises to nearly one-third. So there \nare clear benefits at home to increasing America's access to markets \nabroad.\n  I also believe that trade and trade agreements have a role to play in \nhelping us achieve our foreign policy goals. The direct American \ninvestment that comes to foreign countries as a result of free trade \nagreements can reduce corruption and promote strong democratic \ninstitutions, like an independent judiciary and vibrant non-\ngovernmental organizations. And by making other countries stakeholders \nin a rules-based system of trade, we can diminish the possibility of \ntrade disputes escalating into open conflict.\n  I do support improving Americans' access to foreign markets, and I \nfirmly believe in the power of open markets to create open societies. \nAnd so, reluctantly, I will support this bill.\n  I say ``reluctantly'' because I do not believe that the TPA equation \nis balanced. Granting TPA to any President requires a significant \namount of trust. Granting TPA means that you trust the President to \nnegotiate trade deals that are consistent with our American values.\n  The statistics I just recited show that trade is good for the \neconomy. And, certainly, economic development is one important element \nof those values. But I am afraid that, in recent years, some of our \nother core beliefs have not been a part of the national debate over \ntrade.\n  When the President negotiate agreements that will lower tariffs and \nother barriers to trade, it is, in my judgment, equally important that \nhe make sure that our Nation's strong environmental and labor laws are \nupheld. It is equally important too that he ensure that we have a forum \nto export our views on these issues to the nations with whom we engage \nin expanded commerce.\n  I do not mean to suggest that we can simply direct other countries to \ndevelop environmental laws or labor laws that equal our own. True \nreform in developing nations, be it the development of democratic \ninfrastructure, or the growth of a vibrant labor movement, cannot \nsimply be exported from the United States. These concepts must come to \nfruition through the will of the people.\n  However, no one disputes that the United States has a significant \nrole to play in helping other countries breathe the air of political \nfreedom. So, too, should the United States play a leading role in \nhelping developing countries breathe clean air and help create programs \nthat provide workers with a safe workplace and the chance to earn a \ndecent wage.\n  Unfortunately, it is clear that, despite the best intentions of NAFTA \nand in developing the World Trade Organization, labor and environmental \nissues have not been treated at the same level in our trade policy as \ninvestment rights or intellectual property rights. That is \ndisappointing.\n  I regret that this President's track record on domestic labor issues \nand domestic environmental issues does not fill me with confidence that \nour Nation's trade policy will be a tool used to help other nations \nimprove their political, environmental and social climates. At every \nturn, he has sought to diminish the gains of the labor movement and \nroll-back environmental regulations in his own country. I surely hope \nthat this is not the message that\n\n[[Page S4810]]\n\nhe intends to carry with him as he negotiates free trade agreements \nwith Chile, Singapore and others.\n  Some of us in this body have put forth amendments which we believe \ncould have helped us to trust the President more. These amendments \nwould have elevated labor and environmental protections to the same \nlevel of intellectual property protections, or, as my amendment would \nhave, guaranteed that future trade agreements would not corrode \nAmerican legal principles and Constitutional rights. All but one of \nthese were unsuccessful.\n  The defeat of these amendments leave us with no safeguards for \nlegitimate public health and safety laws. We have no assurances that \nother nations with whom we forge agreements under this bill will honor \ntheir existing labor or environmental laws. We have no reason to \nsuspect that the President will be a forceful advocate for some of our \ncountry's most cherished beliefs: that clean air, clean water and \npreservation of the outdoors are worth fighting for; that workers \nshould have the right to organize; and that U.S. sovereignty must be \nprotected.\n  In spite of these glaring weaknesses, I intend to support this bill. \nThat is how strongly I believe in the principle of free trade, and the \nbelief that we can help other countries improve their political \nenvironment by embracing them, not isolating them. But I would caution \nthis President and others that we need to pay much more attention to \nsome of these other trade issues, issues that have been on the margins \nof trade policy for too long. If we do not heed these warnings, then \nthat fragile coalition that holds supporters of free and fair trade \ntogether will crumble, as it nearly did in the House and nearly did \nhere in the Senate.\n  I would like to make one final point about this legislation. The bill \nthat we will pass shortly contains an enormous improvement in the trade \nadjustment assistance program. This is much-needed. In the long-run, \nmore international trade means more opportunity and jobs for Americans. \nIn the short-term, however, it creates changes in communities. Some \npeople lose jobs. Factories, the lifeblood of some towns and cities, \nclose. Eventually, new employment opportunities are created. But it is \nimperative that we have a way to ease that transition. This TAA package \ndoes just that. For the first time, we are subsidizing health care for \nlaid-off workers. That is a remarkable step forward. We are attempting \nsomething new by creating a wage insurance program to make sure that \nolder workers do not suffer sudden and destabilizing pay reductions. \nThese are critical expansions of TAA, and they could not be more timely \nfor some of my constituents.\n  In Northampton, MA, the Techalloy plant that processes wire rod steel \nwill close on July 1. They've been hurt by the President's decision to \nimpose 15 percent duties on raw wire rod steel from abroad. Now, I know \nthat the 42 workers currently at the Techalloy plant would much rather \nhave a job than TAA benefits. They want to work. It's not the same as \nmaintaining their job, but this new package will help these folks stay \non their feet while they seek new employment.\n  The TAA package that we will approve is welcome, and I am proud to \nsupport this provision. I particularly want to thank Chairman Baucus, \nSenator Grassley, and Senator Bingaman for all of their hard work in \nhelping shape this reauthorization of the TAA program.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the trade bill. \nI oppose this trade bill because it seeks trade that is more free than \nfair. It sends a very mixed message to America's working men and women \nand their families.\n  The good news is that the bill includes a real expansion of trade \nadjustment assistance benefits for Americans who lose their jobs as a \nresult of trade agreements. The House trade bill doesn't provide these \ntrade adjustment assistance benefits. I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nthe TAA bill and I commend Senators Bingaman and Daschle for their \nleadership to help workers harmed by trade.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers, Farmers, Communities, \nand Firms Act strengthens the existing TAA program. It broadens \neligibility to cover workers who lose their jobs due to increased \nimports, even if they don't directly work for a company that closes \ndown due to trade. It extends benefits to laid-off workers from 52 \nweeks to 78 weeks and increases job training funds. This bill also \nhelps communities adjust, because when a factory shuts down, it isn't \njust the workers at the plant who are affected.\n  Healthcare is a critical addition to the TAA program. People who lose \ntheir jobs can't afford healthcare on their own. This bill will help \nlaid-off workers buy healthcare coverage by covering 70 percent of the \ncost. I would have been happier with the 75 percent level in the \nCommittee-passed bill, but this is a very important step.\n  Wage insurance for older workers is another key addition to the TAA \nprogram. Experienced workers, even with training in new skills, often \ncannot get another job that pays them anything close to what they were \nearning. This bill will supplement wages to help these workers get a \nnew start in a new job. That is the good news.\n  The bad news is that the bill includes a renewal of Fast Track \nnegotiating authority. That means more Americans will lose their jobs \nin the name of free trade. More people will get TAA benefits, but more \npeople will need them.\n  Let me be very clear on one point. I support trade. I encourage \ntrade. Trade is very important to my state. Maryland workers can \ncompete successfully in a global marketplace, if they're given a level \nplaying field. That's why I support expansion of fair trade.\n  I oppose fast-track trade promotion authority now for the same \nreasons I opposed fast track when a Democrat was in the White House.\n  I don't believe Congress should give away our right and \nresponsibility to fully consider trade agreements.\n  The Bush administration has the authority to negotiate trade \nagreements. U.S. Trade Representative Bob Zoellick doesn't need fast \ntrack. He went to Doha to start another round of multilateral trade \ntalks without fast track. He can negotiate a free trade agreement of \nthe Americas without fast track. Hundreds of trade agreements have been \nreached and implemented without fast track.\n  What the Bush administration wants is to cut trade deals and limit \nthe power of Congress to review those deals. That is what fast track \nreally means.\n  Why is the role of Congress so important? To make sure the American \npeople get a good deal. I am ready to support trade agreements that are \ngood for America, agreements that are good for workers and good for the \nenvironment. Congress should consider trade legislation--and \namendments--to it using the same procedures we use to consider other \ninternational agreements and implementing legislation.\n  Proponents of trade agreements say it is inevitable that there will \nbe winnners and losers.\n  The problem is America's workers and their families always seem to be \nthe losers. They lose their jobs. They lose their healthcare. If they \nkeep their jobs or find new jobs, they lose the wage rates they have \nearned.\n  American workers aren't the only losers.\n  American consumers also lose.\n  I am particularly concerned that we don't regulate and inspect the \nsafety of imported food the way USDA regulates and inspects domestic \nfood products. Our trading partners set their own meat inspection \nstandards. Shouldn't we use our trade policy as leverage to make our \nfood safer?\n  Workers and children around the world also lose.\n  We should use the leverage of our trade agreements to ensure fair \ncompetition. That means workers in other countries should have the \nright to organize into unions. Without the strength of collective \nbargaining, their wages will always be below ours. They should also \nhave worker safety protection and retirement and healthcare benefits.\n  Children should be in school, learning the skills to be good citizens \nand participants in the global economy. Instead, children as young as \nsix years old put in full days of work. More than 350 million children \nunder the age of 18 work, according to the International Labor \nOrganization. More alarming is the fact that over 111 million of them \nare children between the ages of 5 and\n\n[[Page S4811]]\n\n14 engaged in ``hazardous work.'' And 5.7 million children are in \nforced and bonded labor.\n  How can we enter into trade agreements with countries that do nothing \nto protect their children? Is it fair for a 45-year-old on Maryland's \nEastern Shore to compete with a 12-year-old in Southern China?\n  Protecting against child labor and forced labor should be the core of \nany trade agreement.\n  I am proud to have cosponsored and supported amendments on labor \nrights, child labor, environmental protection, and other issues which I \nfirmly believe must be addressed in agreements to strengthen fair \ntrade.\n  I am particularly proud to have joined with colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle in an effort to provide a safety net for steel retirees \nwho lose their healthcare coverage due to unfair trade. A clear \nmajority in the Senate supported that amendment. We were blocked \nprocedurally by Senators who support trade and are unwilling to address \nits human consequences.\n  I have said before that I don't want to put American jobs on a Fast \nTrack to Mexico or a slow boat to China but that is exactly what is \nhappening as a result of NAFTA and China's admission to the World Trade \nOrganization. Black and Decker closed down a manufacturing plant on \nMaryland's Eastern Shore because they could get cheaper labor abroad. \nThey literally moved those jobs to Mexico and China. I am glad the \nexpanded trade adjustment assistance will help these workers but they \nshouldn't have lost their jobs in the first place.\n  I intend to stand up for American workers and consumers. I intend to \nstand up for the right and responsibility of Congress to fully consider \ntrade agreements. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the trade \nbill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we prepare to vote on this historic \ntrade package, our country is precariously positioned in the \ninternational trade arena. Many of our friends and allies no longer see \nthe United States as a nation that champions global free trade, but \nrather as a nation that increasingly fears foreign competition and \nseeks to erect barriers to trade in order to protect domestic \nindustries and advance narrow political agendas. A series of short-\nsighted, protectionist actions in recent years has jeopardized our \nrelationships with our most important trading partners.\n  Given our recent double standards on trade, it is not surprising that \nthe United States is quickly losing its credibility and leadership in \nchampioning free trade principles around the world. Our staunchest \nallies and most important trading partners are now doubting our \ndedication to the free trade principles we have long championed.\n  Many of the nations that engage in the free exchange of commerce are \nalso our staunchest allies in the war on terrorism. Over the past eight \nmonths, those countries have joined in our worthy cause, some making \nsubstantial sacrifices to advance our shared values. During that time, \neven as our allies have deployed their forces to stand alongside our \nown in Central Asia, we have pursued protectionist policies on steel \nand lumber, and passed into law a regressive, trade-distorting farm \nbill. We are already fighting one war on a global scale. We cannot \nsimultaneously fight a trade war.\n  The United States simply cannot afford to follow the dangerous path \nof protectionism. I hope that the passage of trade promotion authority, \nTPA, and the Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act, both of which are \nincluded in this package, will represent a turning point. Now is our \nchance to put a stop to our short-sighted protectionism and recognize \nthat such behavior has consequences.\n  As the rest of the world negotiates free trade agreements without our \nparticipation, the citizens of this country are losing out. Free trade \nstimulates economic growth, creates higher paying jobs, reduces the \ncost of goods and services, and promotes stability in regions of \nstrategic interest to the United States. Somehow, we seem to have lost \nsight of these overarching goals.\n  The Doha round of World Trade Organization, WTO, negotiations provide \nan opportunity for the United States to demonstrate to the countries of \nthe world our dedication to reducing barriers to trade on a global \nscale. Passage of this bill will enable the Administration to negotiate \nthe best possible agreements for America. Beyond the WTO, I look \nforward to the completion of bilateral trade agreements with Singapore \nand Chile, the opening of formal negotiations on new trade agreements \nwith nations like Australia, regional accords with the nations of \nCentral America, and ultimately, a Free Trade Agreement of the \nAmericas--a goal articulated by President George H.W. Bush fully a \ndecade ago, and one which we must recommit ourselves and our Latin \nfriends to achieving.\n  One of the most critical and time-sensitive components of this trade \npackage is the extension and expansion of the Andean Trade Preference \nAct, ATPA. In 1991, ATPA was created to expand the economies of the \ndrug-plagued nations of the Andean region. By granting duty-free and \nreduced-rate treatment to various products from Bolivia, Colombia, \nEcuador, and Peru, we hoped to strengthen the fragile economies of the \nregion, expand their export bases, and provide Andean farmers and \nworkers with legitimate employment outside of the drug trade. The \nAndean Trade Preference Act has worked. It has created new industries \nin the Andean region, and with them hundreds of thousands of jobs \noutside the drug trade. As the region's leaders will attest, it is a \nsuccess story.\n  Regrettably, ATPA expired on December 4, inflicting immediate harm on \nthe region, because Congress had not taken timely action on legislation \nto prevent its expiration. The House of Representatives passed an \nextension and expansion of ATPA over six months ago. On February 15 the \nPresident, citing national security concerns, took the unprecedented \nstep of extending a 90-day duty deferral of products under ATPA, giving \nCongress time to pass an extension. That 90-day deferral expired last \nweek while the trade bill remained mired in partisan debate before the \nSenate.\n  Our delay in extending and expanding ATPA impacts our national \nsecurity, stability in the hemisphere, and economic growth in Bolivia, \nColombia, Ecuador and Peru. These nations are on the front lines of the \nwar on drugs, their democracies threatened by criminals and terrorists, \ntheir people suffering from economic deprivation. It is time we \nrealized the impact our actions and inactions have, not just on the \nUnited States, but on the rest of the world as well. Our delayed action \nhas sent the very dangerous message that the United States is no longer \nengaged in the region.\n  Our hemisphere is in serous trouble. Democracy and free markets are \ntested by social instability, lack of economic opportunity, and the \nviolence wrought by drug traffickers and terrorist groups. From the \nFARC and the ELN in Colombia to Hezbollah in Ecuador and elsewhere in \nour hemisphere, terrorists take advantage of state failure and economic \nunderdevelopment to operate freely, and at grave risk to American \ninterests and those of our allies.\n  The Andean trade act is part of our active engagement in the region, \na gateway to economic opportunity and a symbol of America's commitment \nto the democratic stability and security of our Andean partners. The \nelected leaders of Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru know that \ndelivering economic opportunity to their people is the best means of \nprotecting democratic institutions and defeating terrorism and the drug \ntrade. They ask not for substantial American assistance, but for access \nto the American market through free and open trade. This serves not \nonly their interests but our own.\n  Unlike other efforts which provide direct grants, loans, or military \nassistance, ATPA costs the U.S. nothing. In fact, American workers and \nconsumers benefit from it through reduced prices on goods and services. \nThe U.S. International Trade Commission, ITC, has estimated that U.S. \nconsumers annually save over $20 million due to the benefits of ATPA. \nIn addition to cost savings, the Act also enhances American security. \nBy creating legitimate jobs outside the drug trade, bolstering state \ninstitutions, and expanding national economies, terrorists and drug \ntraffickers will no longer find such easy refuge in the Andean region.\n\n[[Page S4812]]\n\n  I regret that we had to consider three very important, and very \ndifferent, pieces of trade legislation in one package; I believe the \nend product suffered as a result. Passing these bills in this manner \nprevented us from adequately debating complicated and questionable \nprovisions. Indeed, this bill is far from perfect. I know that I am not \nalone in expressing my concern over some of the provisions now \ncontained within this trade package, particularly those which are \nclearly antithetical to the spirit of free trade.\n  The conferees certainly have their work cut out for them. Although \nrecent actions indicate that we may be taking steps backwards in \ncertain areas, it is incumbent upon the conferees to reaffirm the \nprinciples of free trade, and to receive the strongest support from the \nAdministration for their efforts. We must all ensure that we do not \nsacrifice free trade principles for a bill that is called ``free \ntrade,'' but does something else entirely. Even before Senate passage, \nefforts in the other body are underway to weaken provisions contained \nwithin this package. I hope that these efforts do not succeed.\n  That said, I believe this bill represents an opportunity to end \nAmerica's dispiriting slide backwards into protectionism. Passage of \nthis imperfect but important trade bill is a good start. It is time for \nAmerica to again lead the world on trade.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I thank Senators Baucus and Grassley for \nworking with me on my amendments to this legislation. They and their \nstaffs were very helpful.\n  There was one amendment that I filed to this bill that I had intended \nto offer dealing with tax incentives to help communities affected by \ntrade. I did not offer it because I know that the leaders of the bill \nas well as the leadership of the Senate all agreed that there would be \nno tax amendments to this bill. However, I would like to speak about \nthe amendment very briefly, because I intend to look for future \nopportunities to see it passed.\n  The amendment is designed to help communities devastated by foreign \ntrade get back on their feet by providing incentives for businesses to \nlocate in these areas.\n  Already, the Federal Government has policies to help communities in \ntrouble attract new business through tax incentives. The programs are \ncalled Empowerment Zones and Renewal Communities.\n  Here is the problem: These designations do not help struggling rural \ncommunities that have been hit with dramatic job losses only recently. \nA decade ago, these communities were home to busy textile plants. \nToday, they are being devastated as their major employers shut down and \nthousands of jobs disappear. Many of the people in these communities \nhave lived in these towns for generations. They should not have to move \naway just because the textile plant where they worked has closed down.\n  Retraining will help. I am pleased that my amendment to help improve \ntraining programs was passed by the Senate last week, but that training \nis not going to matter if there are not new jobs to take the place of \nthe ones they lost. We need to encourage investment in these trade-\naffected areas so workers do not have to pack up their families and \nmove to the city just to get a new job.\n  That is what my proposal is about. It is modeled after Empowerment \nZones and Renewal Communities. We'd create new Economic Revitalization \nZones for areas hard-hit by trade. Economic Revitalization Zones, or \nERZs, would be areas that have experienced major job losses in a \ncritical industries as a result of trade agreements or shifts in \nproduction. Communities would be eligible for designation as ERZs if \nthey are in a trade-affected state and a significant portion of their \nemployment base was dependent on an industry substantially affected by \ntrade. Benefits in ERZs would be similar to those in Renewal \nCommunities and Empowerment Zones.\n  Here are five examples:\n  One, a 20-percent wage credit for the first $15,000 of wages paid to \na zone resident who works in the zone;\n  Two, commercial revitalization tax incentives [write-offs for \ncompanies that revitalize abandoned or dormant industrial property];\n  Three, increased write-offs for capital investments;\n  Four, authority to issue tax exempt bonds to promote business \ndevelopment; and\n  Five, the New Market Tax Credit, which already provides incentives \nfor businesses to invest.\n  Economic revitalization zones would be a lifeline for communities \nthat are suffering from the negative effects of trade agreements. We \nowe this to the hardworking families in these communities. As the \nindustries they've relied on for decades are destroyed, the least we \ncan do is to help them plan for the future.\n  I believe this is an important proposal. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues who are on the Finance Committee to find other \nopportunities to advance this important initiative.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have a long-held interest in Latin \nAmerica, and, in my opinion, the renewal of the Andean Trade \nPreferences Agreement is one of the most important actions this \nCongress can take to promote economic growth, political stability, and \nprosperity in the Andean region.\n  I have come to this floor many times in the past year to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to the fact that Latin America is a region in \ncrisis, that we ignore at our peril. I believe that it is imperative \nthat we remain engaged with our neighbors to the South lest our neglect \nencourage even more instability in the region and foster conditions \nripe for terror, destruction, and the collapse of democratic \ninstitutions. While I could speak for hours about the dangers posed by \nthe horrors of drought and famine in Central America, the Argentine \neconomic crisis, or the turmoil in Venezuela, I will limit my comments \ntoday to the problems faced by the Andean region, and my belief that we \nmust have a multi-faceted approach to alleviating the crisis in the \nregion through military, humanitarian, and economic aid.\n  The Andean region is reeling from economic crises, natural disasters, \nand the effects of the war against drugs. Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, \nVenezuela, and Bolivia confront economic and social problems that \nthreaten the very fabric of Democracy in the region. Up till now, with \nthe possible exception of Venezuela, the governments of these countries \nhave done a good job of managing their problems in the face of near-\nimpossible odds. But, I believe, without consistent and steady U.S. \ninvolvement, and a greater willingness of Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru to \ncoordinate their efforts in drug eradication with Colombia, the \nsituations in these countries could become quickly unstable. We must \nremain continuously engaged and stop the cycle of neglect by which \nattention is focused on Latin America for short bursts of time, only to \nrecede when a crisis is over. We cannot allow the region to languish \nand fester while we ignore warning signs.\n  I have spoken about Colombia numerous times on this floor, and, in \nfact, just held a hearing on the Colombia situation in the Foreign \nRelations Committee last month. I would like to take a moment to \nrestate some of my comments from that hearing and alert my colleagues \nto some horrific statistics about the state of violence in Colombia. \nColombia's democracy is in crisis, and it didn't happen over night. \nColombia's civil society has been ripped apart for decades by violence \nand corruption, and has long been characterized as having one of the \nmost violent societies in the Western Hemisphere. Historically, \nColombian civil leaders, judges and politicians have put their lives in \njeopardy simply by aspiring to positions of leadership and \nresponsibility. The introduction of illicit drug cultivation and \nproduction has only heightened further this climate of violence. \nDespite fears that must be pervasive in every Colombian's heart, tens \nof thousands of men and women have still allowed their names to appear \non electoral ballots in election after election. These are truly \ncourageous people who deserve our respect and admiration.\n  Two years ago, I supported US efforts to become partners with the \nPastrana administration's efforts to address Colombia's problems. I \nsaid at the time that I believed that it was critically important that \nwe act expeditiously on the Plan Colombia assistance package because \nour credibility was at stake with respect to responding to a genuine \ncrisis in our own hemisphere. We also needed to make good on our pledge \nto\n\n[[Page S4813]]\n\ncome to the aid of President Pastrana and the people of Colombia in \ntheir hour of crisis, a crisis that has profound implications for \ninstitutions of democracy in Colombia and throughout the hemisphere.\n  No one I know claims that things have dramatically ``turned around'' \nin Colombia since the United States endorsed Plan Colombia and began \nproviding significant resources to support its implementation. \nNarcotraffickers, in concert with right and left wing paramilitary \norganizations, continue to make large portions of the country \nungovernable. Until recently their activities were restricted to \nsparely populated rural areas of the country--places where government \norder and services have never existed. Now, with the end of the FARC/\nGovernment peace process and in an effort to disrupt upcoming \nelections, the FARC is increasingly focused on urban areas, especially \ncritical economic infrastructure.\n  In the last 15 years, more than 200 bombs have exploded in Colombian \ncities. The number of assassinations is egregious. More than 300,000 \nordinary citizens, 4 presidential candidates, 200 judges and \ninvestigators, one half of Colombia's Supreme Court, 1,200 police, and \n151 journalists, have been murdered. Politicians such as Senator Martha \nDaniels have been killed while trying to negotiate peace, and municipal \nofficials are constantly running for their lives. As if this were not \nbad enough, Colombia also holds the world's kidnapping record, with \n3,700 abductions last year alone. Among those abducted, 50 were \npolitical candidates, such as Ingrid Betancourt, who is running for \nPresident, and one was a governor.\n  The rebel groups in Colombia have declared war on democracy and on \nthe people of Colombia. According to recent news reports, on May 2 the \nlargest single massacre of civilians in the recorded history of the \nconflict in Colombia took place. It began on May 1, in the village of \nBellavista, over 300 people sought refuge in St. Paul the Apostle \nchurch from door-to-door fighting between left and right-wing \nparamilitaries. But, in the violence-charged atmosphere of Colombia, \neven the refuge of a holy place was not enough to protect the \ntownspeople of Bellavista. Shortly before noon on May 2nd, a bomb \nthrown by leftist rebels of the FARC collapsed the roof of St. Paul the \nApostle, and 117 innocent civilians were killed--over a third of them \nchildren.\n  I grieve for the families of the deceased, and want them to know that \ntheir pain and sacrifice has not gone unnoticed in the United States. \nThe massacre of Bellavista is just yet another event in a series that \nillustrates why the United States has a responsibility to remain \nactively engaged in Colombia's struggle. We must help prevent \natrocities such as this massacre from ever happening again through a \ncombination of economic, humanitarian, and military aid. This \nnonsensical murder of civilians in Colombia must stop, and it must stop \nnow. While we are doing all we can to help stop these killings through \nPlan Colombia, the ripple effects of the region's crisis are felt by \nall of Colombia's neighbors--Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela. \nColombia's problems have a profound impact on the stability and \nsecurity of the entire region.\n  The region's economy is in distress, causing significant unemployment \nand hardship among the middle class. The economic situation in the \ncountryside is equally troublesome--a significant percentage of its \nrural population is barely able to eke out a living--with millions \nalready displaced from their villages from economic necessity or fear \nof civil conflict. Not surprisingly, these displaced persons have \nbecome the innocent foot soldiers in the ever-expanding illicit coca \nproduction that gets processed into cocaine and ultimately finds its \nway into America's schools and neighborhoods.\n\n  United States financial assistance has been heavily focused on the \nmilitary component of Colombia's counter narcotic effort with lesser \namounts available for other programs such as alternative development \nprograms, protection of human rights workers, resettlement of displaced \npersons, and judicial and military reforms. The United States can do \nmore to assist the region, particularly its economies by reauthorizing \nand expanding the coverage of the Andean Trade Preference Agreement. \nThis would help the region work its way out of its current economic \nrecession by giving a boost to key domestic industries while creating \nmore jobs for average citizens--other than in the coca fields.\n  Since 2000, the United States has committed almost $2 billion to the \nAndean region in support of Plan Colombia and the Andean Regional \nInitiative. As I have stated, although I continue to support these \ninitiatives, they alone will not resolve the region's problems. We must \ncomplement this assistance with extension of ATPA. By addressing the \neconomic needs of the area, as well as the military and humanitarian \nneeds we can begin to address the root causes of the narcotics industry \nand violence, while assisting Colombia's neighbors in protecting their \nnations from allowing the same problem to spread.\n  ATPA has been constructive in stimulating increased trade with \nBolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, but there is still a lot of work \nto be done. The full impact of ATPA has been somewhat lessened by the \nexclusion of key economic sectors from the agreement. A more robust \nATPA is needed if we are truly going to make a difference with respect \nto the lives of people in that region. Extension of the ATPA will offer \nmore opportunities to our Andean trading partners, while also enabling \nus to further pursue our own national interests in the region. Poverty \nand hopelessness are the incubators for lawlessness and civil strife. \nThe job creation and economic development that is part and parcel with \nexpanded trade opportunities are vital to enfranchising the middle \nclass in the political process and preventing rural residents from \nturning to cocoa as a crop of desperation.\n  With the ATPA, we can encourage the growth of legitimate businesses \nthat will benefit producers and consumers in our country and within the \nAndean pact. Since the ATPA was enacted in 1991, the primary goal of \nthe agreement has been to promote export diversification and broad-\nbased, sustainable economic development throughout the region. There is \nevidence that this initiative has borne fruit. From 1992 to 2000, the \nyears of implementation of ATPA, total coca cultivation in Bolivia \ndeclined by 68 percent, and in Peru by 74 percent. This decrease is the \nresult of aggressive eradication programs coupled with crop \nsubstitution by farmers in the region who have then taken advantage of \nATPA provisions to market their products in the US. In so doing, ATPA \nhas done more than expand trade, it has strengthened America's War on \nDrugs and the Andean region's fight against drugs and traffickers. The \nrenewal of the ATPA is a lifeline to Andean farmers and workers who \nwant to have legal employment but will do whatever they have to in the \nabsence of mainstream job opportunities to feed their families--\nincluding the cultivation of illicit crops.\n  ATPA has accomplished all this without negative effects at home. \nBetween 1991 and 2000, Andean exports to the U.S. increased 124 \npercent. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, in 2000, \nbilateral trade was valued at more than $18 billion and the Andean \nCommunity was the 16th largest consumer of U.S. exports. In comparison, \nthe value of U.S. exports to the Andean Community was 1.3 times greater \nthan that which was exported to the Central American Common Market. \nThis is nearly twice as large as exports to Eastern Europe.\n  As we move forward to extend the ATPA, I realize that for some, the \nissues of textile and tuna are delicate and contentious. I think that \nit is important to note that the extension of trade preferences to tuna \nin airtight containers would promote employment in the local \nindustries, and help depressed areas in the beneficiary countries \nthrough higher value-added exports with a true potential and minimal \nimpact on U.S. industry. Unfortunately, the ATPA bill before the Senate \ncontains restrictions which would grant the duty free benefits to \nimported canned tuna from the Andean countries, but limit the quantity \nto 20 percent of the U.S. domestic canned tuna production in the \npreceding calendar year. The quota that would be imposed makes the duty \nfree benefit virtually meaningless.\n\n[[Page S4814]]\n\n  The principlal beneficiary of the tuna provision is Ecuador--a \ngovernment that has been extremely cooperative in our efforts to \nimplement first Plan Colombia and now the Andean Regional Initiative, \nalthough controversial among Ecuadorans, the Government of Ecuador has \npermitted to use the airfield at Manta as a forward operating location \nfor critical activities in our regional counter rug programs. They have \nsuffered from the spill over effects of Plan Colombia as guerrillas and \npeasants have crossed into Ecuador's territories and sanctuary. The \nSenate provisions falls far short of what Ecuador deserves in light of \nall its support. In my view the House provision granting duty free \ntreatment to all imported canned tuna from the Andean countries is the \nmore appropriate response to Ecuador's friendship and support for U.S. \npolicies in the region. The argument that American Samoa will be harmed \nby the granting of this preference is bogus. One of the major employers \nin American Samoa, StarKist, has already indicated that it has no \nintention of reducing employment there even if the most generous \nversion of the ATPA Tuna preference language is enacted into law.\n  Expanding the ATPA to include textiles and apparel would not have a \nsubstantial negative impact on the U.S. economy. In 1999, textile/\napparel exports from Andean countries represented only 1.1 percent of \nthe total textile and apparel exports to the United States. On the \nother hand, the United States is by far the largest market for Andean \napparel exports, buying between 38 percent and 61 percent of all Andean \napparel exports. In fact with the expansion of opportunities for Andean \ntextile and apparel imports come increased opportunities for US \nfabrics, thread and even cotton exports to that region.\n  By extending ATPA, the United States is sending a clear signal that \nwe are going to continue the close and essential relationship we have \nestablished with our partners in the Southern Hemisphere. Given the \nextremely difficulties facing the region and the implication of those \ndifficulties on US interests working to make that relationship work is \nvery important. Taken together, these steps will generate jobs, \nstrengthen civil society, and deter illegal narcotics trade. All steps \nstrongly supported by the Congress and the American people.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \ntrade promotion authority. My decision to support this bill has not \nbeen an easy one. I respect the opinions of my colleagues who do not \nsupport trade promotion authority and I share many of their concerns.\n  However, two issues have changed my thinking on this matter: the \nnecessity of trade promotion authority to conclude multilateral trade \ndeals and the substantive worker protection provisions contained in the \nbill.\n  Therefore, I believe we must grant the President the trade promotion \nauthority to reclaim U.S. leadership in the global trade arena and \nprovide him the support he needs to conclude multilateral trade \nagreements that will benefit California and the United States as a \nwhole. And, as this bill does, we must do so in a way that provides \nprotection and support for workers who may be displaced from their jobs \ndue to increased globalization.\n  I have long supported free trade. Like many of my colleagues, I \nbelieve that expanding free trade and the exchange of goods, ideas, and \nservices across the global marketplace is vital to the success of \nAmerican industries, the creation of new jobs, and the economic well-\nbeing of all Americans.\n  My home State of California, which ranks among the top economies in \nthe world and leads the country in exports, has greatly benefitted from \npast free trade agreements and stands to gain even more from future \nnegotiations.\n  Now, I understand that many of my colleagues will point out that this \nadministration and its predecessor have concluded and signed trade \nagreements since fast-track expired in 1994. No doubt this is true and \nno doubt it will continue to be true.\n  Yet those agreements have been bilateral trade agreements. Many \nbilateral agreements have been signed without fast track authority.\n  One recent and noteworthy example is the United States-Jordan Free \nTrade Agreement. I voted for that agreement and I believe it is \nimportant tool to advance the cause of peace and stability in the \nMiddle East.\n  But while the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement is \npolitically vital, economically it is rather small bilateral trade \nbetween the two countries is approximately $600 million.\n  Multilateral negotiations, on the other hand, such as those aimed at \nestablishing a Free Trade Area of the Americas or the Doha round of \nglobal trade talks, involve far more countries, far more negotiators, \nand far more billions of dollars worth of trade.\n  As former Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher told me, \nour trade negotiators need fast track to tackle the difficult, complex, \nand diverse issues that inevitably arise in multilateral talks and get \nour partners to put the best deal on the table. Without it, we simpliy \ncan't close out these deals.\n  If our partners know that they will have to negotiate with Congress \nafter negotiating with the administration, the most sensitive issues, \nand the keys to unlocking new and expanding markets, will be taken off \nthe agenda.\n  Imagine if you were a party to a multilateral trade negotiation and \nyou knew that a final agreement would be open to amendment by the U.S. \nCongress. You would never agree to put your best offer on the table and \nyou would never agree to sign any agreement if you thought that the \ndeal you negotiated--one that would provide multiple benefits to both \nsides--would be change.\n  So, fast track becomes an imperative, if multilateral agreements are \nto be negotiated successfully.\n  But we must also remember that some workers and some firms do suffer \nas a result of increased trade and we have an obligation not to leave \nthem behind as global trade moves forward.\n  So protection for workers is important and vital to any trade \npromotion authority bill.\n  Consequently, I support the robust and expanded trade adjustment \nassistance package that will assist those workers in their time of need \nand help them find new jobs. Since 1962, trade adjustment assistance \nhas been a bridge between the global economy and the local economy.\n  Let their be no doubt that this bill is a step forward for American \nworkers. It provides assistance, training, and support for workers as \nthey move into a new career. Specifically, the bill expands eligibility \nfor benefits to secondary workers such as suppliers and downstream \nproducers who lose their jobs or may lose their jobs due to a loss of \nbusiness with a firm whose workers are TAA certified; extends income \nsupport from 52 to 78 weeks; provides a 70 percent advanceable, \nrefundable tax credit to help TAA workers make COBRA payments; \nincreases assistance for job relocation and job searches; increases the \ntraining budget to $300 million; establishes a wage insurance program \nto provide support to older workers who lose their job due to trade and \nare forced to take a lesser paying job; establishes trade adjustment \nassistance programs for farmers, fisherman, and communities affected by \ntrade, and finally; establishes a training program through the Small \nBusiness Administration for TAA-certified workers on how to start their \nown business.\n  Finally, let me turn now to my role as a Senator from the State of \nCalifornia. California is like no other State. It is the fifth largest \neconomic engine in the world with a $1.33 trillion economy. From high \ntech to agriculture, California is a leader in the U.S. and the global \nmarket, and it has greatly benefitted from free trade initiatives.\n  In 2001, 14.6 percent of U.S. exports came from California, totaling \n$106.8 billion, tops in the Nation. Exports support more than one \nmillion jobs for Californians.\n  Yet if California is to maintain its status as a global economic \nleader, our businesses and working people must have access to new and \nexpanding markets around the world. Trade promotion authority, as I \nhave indicated, is an important tool in that effort.\n  Global trade is with us. We simply can not ignore that fact. Turning \ninward, building barriers, and shutting out the outside world is not \nrealistic. We must deal with globalization and we must deal with it in \na way that enhances the ability of American exports\n\n[[Page S4815]]\n\nto reach new and expanding markets, while at the same time promoting \nrespect for labor rights and the environment and ensuring that no \nworker is left behind.\n  Trade promotion authority is the best vehicle for Congress and the \nadministration, working as partners, to build an effective trade agenda \nthat advances U.S. interests at home and abroad.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this legislation which has passed the \nSenate today is a great bipartisan success. I am thankful to my \ncolleagues for their support and willingness to work together in order \nto do this for the workers, farmers and companies of this country.\n  I would first like to thank Senators Gramm and Breaux and their staff \nfor helping to make this final vote possible. If it were not for their \nhelp in brokering a deal, we may not have reached this point today.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Baucus and his excellent staff for \nall the hard work and dedication which has gone into this bill over the \npast year. I want to specifically thank Mike Evans and John Angell as \nwell as the trade staff--Greg Mastel, Tim Punke, Ted Posner, Angela \nMarshall-Hoffman, Shara Aranoff, and Andy Harig. I appreciate their \nwillingness to work with my staff to accomplish so much.\n  I would also like to thank Polly Craighill of the Office of Senate \nLegislative Counsel, for her hard work, and great expertise in drafting \nthis bill.\n  Finally, I would like to thank my staff, beginning with my Finance \nCommittee staff director, Kolan Davis and my trade counsels Everett \nEissenstat and Richard Chriss, who have worked tirelessly to bring this \nbill to fruition. I credit them with much of today's success. It was \ntheir hard work, along with the help of Carrie Clark and Tiffany \nMcCullen-Atwell, that helped us to this point.\n  I look forward to a productive conference, and swift passage of the \nconference report, so we can get this to the President's desk, and \nenacted into law.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nH.R. 3009, the Andean Trade Preference Act and the Baucus-Grassley \namendment granting the President trade promotion authority and renewing \nthe trade adjustment assistance.\n  While I do not support this particular bill, I am not opposed to \ntrade and recognize the great economic benefit it has brought to my \nState. In South Carolina, many foreign firms have made substantial \ninvestments in manufacturing facilities. These plants, and the workers \nthey employ, produce goods for domestic consumption and for export. \nAlso, numerous American firms export their products. The volume of \ngoods moving through the port of Charleston is an indication of the \nimportance of trade to South Carolina. Charleston is one of the busiest \nseaports in America.\n  History has taught us that in order for countries to buy from us, we \nmust buy from them. Indeed, our continuing trade deficit shows just how \nmuch of this we as Americans do. The problem is that too many of our \ntrading partners refuse to trade with us fairly. They want to export to \nthe American market, but they do not want to let our products into \ntheir domestic markets. I would note that the United States Trade \nRepresentative has published his 2002 National Trade Estimate Report on \nForeign Trade Barriers. In this annual report, numbering 455 pages, he \ncatalogs the barriers ``affecting U.S. exports of goods and services, \nforeign direct investment by U.S. persons, and protection of \nintellectual property rights.'' Clearly, this report indicates our \ntrade negotiators have much to do to get our trading partners to open \ntheir markets to U.S. exports.\n  The United States has long been the leader in promoting trade. In \n1994, the United States entered into the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, NAFTA, and 1 year later became a charter member of the World \nTrade Organization, WTO. NAFTA established a free trade area between \nthe United States, Canada, and Mexico. The WTO was an endeavor to \nestablish an international organization and procedures to reduce and \nhopefully eliminate capricious and arbitrary barriers to trade.\n  NAFTA opened the doors to imports of textiles and apparel from \nMexico. While the potential for cheap textile and apparel imports was \ngreater under the WTO, the WTO contains an Agreement on Textiles and \nClothing, ATC, which would eliminate all quotas on textile and apparel \nproducts beginning on January 1, 2005. The ATC provides the U.S. \ntextile and apparel industries with a ten-year transition period to \nprepare for this elimination. However, this ATC adjustment phase has \nbeen repeatedly breached by legislative actions such as the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act, the Caribbean Basin Initiative, as well as \nExecutive Branch decisions permitting additional import quotas for \nnations such as Pakistan and Turkey. Additionally, American textile and \napparel industries have been seriously harmed by substantial \ntransshipments of apparel. As a result, U.S. textile and apparel \nindustries are being subjected to more and more unfair international \ncompetition without the full benefit of the transition period permitted \nunder the ATC.\n  Because of these unfortunate and short-sighted policies, almost \n700,000 U.S. textile and apparel workers have lost their jobs. Nearly \n55,000 jobs were lost in South Carolina with a devastating effect on my \nState's economy. This is compounded by the thousands of jobs that have \nbeen lost in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia as well as \nother States. These numbers do not include the lost jobs in the steel, \nfurniture, and other manufacturing industries. In addition there are \nthe job losses in secondary industries such as equipment makers, \nservice firms, and transportation enterprises. Finally, there are the \ncommunity job losses in the local businesses, including department and \ngrocery stores, pharmacies, and automobile dealerships, to just name a \nfew. The cost to local communities is staggering. While the toll on all \nthose who lose their jobs and their families is horrendous, it is even \nworse on older workers who have little chance of finding meaningful \nemployment.\n  The underlying bill, H.R. 3009, the Andean Trade Preference Act, \nATPA, seeks to renew a program that provided preferential, mostly duty-\nfree, treatment of selected U.S. imports from Bolivia, Colombia, \nEcuador, and Peru that expired on December 4, 2001. The purpose of the \nATPA is to encourage growth of a more diversified Andean export base, \nthereby promoting development and providing an incentive for Andean \nfarmers and other workers to pursue economic alternatives to the drug \ntrade. While this is a laudable goal, my objection is to those \nprovisions of this legislation that would give Andean textile and \napparel products the same preferences given to those from Mexico and \nthe Caribbean Basin. This action will further erode the quota \nprotection provisions guaranteed to the U.S. textile and apparel \nindustries under the ATC. These increases in textile and apparel \nimports into the United States will further destabilize the American \ntextile and apparel industries during the critical ten-year transition \nperiod and result in the loss of more American jobs.\n  This bill also reauthorizes Trade Promotion Authority. Trade \npromotion authority allows the President to negotiate trade agreements \nand submit them to the Congress for approval or defeat. No amendments \nare allowed, therefore no improvements can be made to such agreements.\n  My concerns are that future trade negotiators will be more interested \nin getting an agreement, any agreement, no matter what the cost to \nAmerican manufacturing, rather than protect the best interests of the \nUnited States. The emphasis of American representatives in previous \ntrade talks has clearly been for free trade at the expense of fair \ntrade. The current state of U.S. manufacturing is evidence of this sad \nfact. So granting the President TPA will result in the Congress being \npresented with no alternative other than to vote for or against the \ntotal agreement. I do not believe this is consistent with the \nConstitutional responsibilities of the United States Congress.\n  Particularly troubling about this grant of TPA is that our trade \nnegotiators have, and continue to place in negotiation, U.S. trade \nremedy laws. What we need, Mr. President, are not weaker trade remedy \nlaws but stronger ones. In addition, to the responsibility of \nprotecting U.S. workers and their employers, we have a strategic \ndefense\n\n[[Page S4816]]\n\ninterest in promoting and strengthening American manufacturing as \nopposed to letting it wither away. Again, what I am advocating is fair \ntrade not free trade.\n  Finally, included in the legislation is the renewal of Trade \nAdjustment Assistance, TAA. I support TAA without reservation, and I \nhave in the past attempted to strengthen TAA by making the \ncertification process easier. I regret that this TAA renewal provision \nis part of this legislation and was not considered separately.\n  In closing, I wish to state that I am for trade, fair trade. The sad \nexperience of our Nation with so-called ``free trade'' is that it \nresults in the loss of American manufacturing jobs. Unfortunately, this \nlegislation will pass the Senate and will undoubtedly be signed into \nlaw by the President. I call upon the President and administration \nofficials to negotiate for fair trade. I hope in the future \nnegotiations are conducted which result in rules that do not \ndiscriminate against American industry and agriculture, and which \nrequire our trading partners to open their domestic markets to U.S. \nproducts.\n  Because of the thousands of jobs that have been lost, not only in my \nState of South Carolina but in the Nation as a whole, and because of \nthe jobs which will be lost in the future, I will vote against this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been astonished that the Senate--the \nvery institution in which Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay, \nRobert Wagner, and Richard Russell once made important national policy, \neven it it meant defying presidents--would sit back and humbly and \nmeekly allow the interests of the workers in their states to be \nsacrificed upon the altar of the false promise of free trade.\n  These past few weeks, I have been even more disturbed that some would \nallow their concerns and their opposition to fast-track authority to be \nbought off with another false promise--the false promise of enhanced \ntrade adjustment assistance for workers impacted by trade.\n  I am not opposed to trade adjustment assistance in its intent and \npurpose. Trade adjustment assistance provides an important service when \nand where it is needed. But trade adjustment is not a panacea. Trade \nadjustment assistance is not a substitute for a job. Trade adjustment \nassistance is not a substitute for good trade policies. Trade \nadjustment assistance should never, never, be considered as a \nsubstitute for Congressional input into trade agreements, input that is \nessential for members of this chamber to be able to protect and promote \nthe interests of our constituents.\n  My opposition to giving fast-track authority to the executive branch \nis long-standing and unchanging. The Constitution obligates Congress to \nregulate foreign commerce. This means, at the least, that Congress must \nbe an active participant in trade agreements, not a rubber stamp.\n  Trade impacts every citizen of our country. It cuts across nearly \nevery aspect of our lives and livehoods. The way of life and work for \nmillions of American workers, for tens of thousands of American \ncommunities, are affected by the trade agreements. That is why trade \nissues must be debated and shaped by the legislative representatives of \nthe people. It is the hardworking, responsible people back home who \nwill keenly feel the impact of our trade policies.\n  I was sent here to represent the interests of my State. I am going to \ndo that to the best of my ability and this includes promoting and \nprotecting the thousands of West Virginia workers whose lives are \naffected by trade agreements.\n  It is difficult for me to understand why any member of this body of \neither political party, would surrender our constitutional prerogative \nto regulate trade to the executive branch.\n  The devil, as the saying goes, is in the details. And fast track is \nasking the Congress of the United States to ignore the details, at \ngreat peril to the workers of our States.\n  It is especially difficult to understand in this era when \nglobalization has rendered the industries and workers of our States \nmore and more vulnerable to the unfair, predatory trade practices of \nforeign countries.\n  Our States are drowning under a flood of cheap foreign imports, and \nit is not just manufacturing industries. Free trade with Mexico has led \nto a flood of Mexican imports that devastated Florida's tomato industry \nand forced thousands of agricultural layoffs. China is dumping garlic \non the United States and destroying the garlic industry in California.\n  Since 1994, when NAFTA created the free trade zone, North Carolina \nhas lost more than 125,500 jobs in the textile and apparel industries. \nThe Mississippi Business Journal reports that the garment industry in \nMississippi has virtually disappeared in the post-NAFTA era in that \nState.\n  Last May, the New York Times told of the closing of a cotton factory \nin Jacksonville, AL, and the devastating impact of that plant closing \non the town and its people. ``The good-paying textile jobs that built \nmany of the towns in the industrial South,'' the story reported, ``have \nbeen vanishing for decades as manufacturers improve profits by moving \nto countries where labor is cheaper. The North American Trade Agreement \n. . . was a death knell for working people like the millers in \nJacksonville.''\n  The American trucking industry is being clobbered by unfair and \nunregulated Mexican trucking.\n  The steel industry in Pennsylvania and West Virginia has been \nabsolutely devastated by the dumping of cheap foreign steel and of \nforeign, government-subsidized imported steel. A few weeks ago, \nPresident Bush pointed out that, ``Fifty years of foreign government \nintervention in the global steel market has resulted in bankruptcies, \nserious dislocation, and job loss.''\n  Estimates of job losses in the United States from NAFTA range from a \nhalf-million to more than a million.\n  The impact of job dislocation is devastating communities across the \ncountry. The impact of being displaced, that is, losing your job due to \na change in trade policy--that is, losing your job through no fault of \nyour own--is devastating both psychologically and financially to the \nindividual worker. For too many American workers, free trade has been \nand continues to be a long and frightening slide to financial disaster.\n  Additionally, there is the risk of loss of health insurance. When one \ndoes not have insurance and, therefore, cannot pay for proper \ntreatment, the result can be devastating.\n  Compound this with the loss of retirement security. When people lose \ntheir jobs, they can no longer contribute to their retirement account. \nWorse, they are too often forced to take out their retirement savings \nin lump sum payments in order to make mortgage payments or to feed \ntheir families, or to pay their health insurance, thus wiping out the \nfamily's future economic security. Americans are living longer now. \nMany of them fear that they will not to able to depend upon Social \nSecurity for a decent retirement. They know that they will need these \nsupplemental retirement savings. But, when displaced, and forced to \ndrain their retirement accounts, that economic security is difficult to \nmake up, if not lost forever.\n  And, of course, there is the loss of income. In addition to the \nobvious loss of income between jobs, there is the additional loss of \nincome when the displaced worker returns to lower-paying employment. \nWorkers who lose higher wage, industrial jobs are often forced to take \nlow-paying service jobs. Service jobs are notoriously lower paying jobs \nthat offer limited opportunities for advancement.\n  Studies of counties in Colorado, Missouri, and Mississippi have found \na declining standard of living for workers and their communities as \nthey moved from manufacturing to service jobs.\n  For many workers, the erosion in earnings after landing new \nemployment is telling. In the latter part of the 1990s, the weekly \nearnings of all reemployed workers fell 5.7 percent on average. Workers \ndisplaced from high-tenure jobs showed an average drop in earnings of \nover 20 percent after they found new, full-time jobs.\n  Even workers who manage to retain their jobs feel the impact of trade \nas the decline in American manufacturing has meant a declining standard \nof living, not just for the affected workers and their families but \nalso for their communities and their States. With the rise of \ninternational competition\n\n[[Page S4817]]\n\nand the shift to lower wage service jobs in the United States, real \nwages have stagnated, making life much more difficult for all American \nworkers. Today, even with some recovery in real wages due to the rapid \ngrowth in the economy in the 1990s, the average weekly wage is nearly \n12 percent less than at its peak in the 1970s. As I said, the devil is \nin the details, and these families see these details every day as they \nwork harder and run faster, only to continue falling further behind.\n  Is it any wonder that polls and surveys reveal that: 57 percent of \nall working adults oppose giving President Bush fast-track authority; \n78 percent of Americans believe that protecting American jobs should be \na top priority in deciding U.S. trade policy; and 68 percent of \nAmericans believe that trade details with low-wage countries such as \nMexico lead to lower wages for American workers.\n  Yet, I have sat back and watched in astonishment and shock as members \nof Congress have auctioned off this important constitutional obligation \nand the economic interests of their constituents for increased trade \nadjustment assistance benefits.\n  Last year, the nonpartisan United States Trade Deficit Review \nCommission pointed out that, ``workers adjustment assistance has often \nbeen the last component of a package intended to increase Congressional \nsupport for approving new trade agreements. As such, it has often been \nviewed simply as an afterthough rather than as an integral component of \nour trade policy.''\n  Trade adjustment assistance has become a labyrinth of rules and \nregulations. When the Trade Deficit Review Commission surveyed the \nstates for ways to improve trade adjustment assistance training \nprograms, the state agencies came up with more than 80 different \nrecommendations.\n  Now, Congress is about to be bought off for the promise of enhanced \ntrade adjustment assistance; that is, more band-aids to cover a gaping \nhemorrhaging of the livelihoods of American workers!\n  There is the promise of tax credits for health insurance--I am not \nsure how important tax credits are to unemployed workers who have no \nincome.\n  There is the promise of more retraining, but I am concerned that we \nmay be retraining for jobs that will not be there.\n  There is the band-aid of wage insurance. I point out that Congress \ntried this gimmick before with the 1988 Omnibus Trade and \nCompetitiveness Act (OTCA), and it failed miserably. Two States were \nselected to test the program. One state rejected the program because \nthey viewed it as too costly, bureaucratic and confusing. A single \nState was not considered enough of a sample from which to test the \nprogram, so the U.S. Department of Labor canceled the pilot program all \ntogether.\n  The Trade Deficit Review Commission--the commission this Chamber \ncreated to make recommendations for changes in trade policy--made the \nimportant point that, for trade policy to be truly effective, trade \nadjustment assistance ``must be a comprehensive safety met available to \nall who need it.'' If trade adjustment assistance is to work, it must \nbe comprehensive, flexible, and, according to the Trade Deficit Review \nCommission, it must be ``triggerless''--that is, it must provide \nbenefits to workers who lose their jobs whether it is due to trade \ndislocation, technological changes, or other reasons.'' This means, \namong other things, that there must not be distinctions between primary \nor secondary workers. We must realize that trade impacts the community \nas well as the individual. Everyone is impacted and affected.\n  Under the fast track legislation as it now stands, American truckers \nare ineligible for Trade adjustment assistance benefits because they \nare not considered ``worthy'' secondary workers.\n  In promoting the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the legislation that \nalso established trade adjustment assistance, President John F. Kennedy \ndeclared: ``There is an obligation to render assistance to those who \nsuffer as a result of national trade policy.''\n  It is an obligation, not a lever. It is an obligation, not a bone to \nbe thrown to a Congress acting more like administration lap dogs than \nthe legislative representatives of the American people.\n  I repeat myself. Trade adjustment assistance is no substitute for a \njob.\n  Trade adjustment assistance is no substitute for good trade policy, \nand good trade policy will only come from open debate, and the amending \nprocess--that is, the input from the members of this body who represent \nthe interests of the people of our states and the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that no one is requesting a vote on \nthe substitute or on cloture on the bill itself, and that the final \naction before the Senate will be a vote on the bill itself. Hearing no \nobjection, Mr. President, I therefore ask unanimous consent that the \ncloture vote be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the substitute amendment, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 3401), in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Is this final passage?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This is final passage.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

As \nwith so many pieces of legislation, this simply would not have happened \nwithout his masterful work on the Senate floor as well. I congratulate \nhim.\n  I thank all of the staff involved, my staff, Chuck Marr, and the \nstaff of the committee and others.\n  We now must turn to the schedule when we return.\n  There will be no further votes this evening, and we will not be in \nsession tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4818-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 4775 AND S. 625\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have been in consultation with the \ndistinguished Republican leader during the course of these votes. We \nhave reached agreement on proceeding to the supplemental and then to \nthe hate crimes legislation when we return. I know of no objection. So \nI will propound a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, June 3, at 2 p.m., the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 4775, the supplemental \nappropriations bill; that after the reporting of the bill, the text of \nthe Senate companion, S. 2551, be substituted in lieu thereof and \nconsidered original text, provided that no points of order be \nconsidered as having been waived by its adoption; that upon the \ndisposition of H.R. 4775, the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. \n625, the bill to assist local jurisdictions to prosecute hate crimes; \nfurther, that if on Monday, June 3, the Senate has not received from \nthe House the supplemental appropriations bill, the Senate proceed to \nS. 625 and it remain the pending business until the Senate receives \nH.R. 4775, at which time it be temporarily laid aside, the Senate begin \nconsideration of H.R. 4775, and that no call for the regular order \nserve to displace H.R. 4775.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and the \ndistinguished Republican leader for his help in working through this \nprocedural arrangement. I also thank the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee and the ranking member.\n  This will afford us the opportunity, at the earliest possible date, \neven though we are disappointed we are not able to take it up now, to \ntake it up as soon as the House completes its work, hopefully, on the \nMonday we return from the Memorial Day recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be brief. First of all, I, too, want \nto thank the managers of the trade legislation. It has taken a lot of \ntime and effort. There have been a number of problems along the way, \nbut the managers have been persistent. I commend Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley for their work. A lot of people have been involved and \nit was the right thing to do. The proof of that is the vote of 66 to \n30.\n  A lot of people would have thought 10 days ago that we could not get \nit done. We have a few barnacles, I am sure, that will be sheared off \nin conference, and a good bill will come out of conference. I commend \nthe managers for doing good work.\n  With regard to the unanimous consent request, I have a couple of \ncomments. I am glad we were able to work this out. We need to go to the \nsupplemental as soon as possible. This is an urgent supplemental for \ndefense to replace a lot of what has already been spent, and also for \nhomeland security. I was concerned that if we could not get it worked \nout today or tomorrow, if we came back, other issues might intervene. \nSenator Daschle has a commitment to try to move the other legislation, \nS. 625, dealing with hate crimes. This way, we could go to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill--assuming it is over here from the \nHouse--and complete it and then go to the next issue.\n  If we don't have a supplemental, for whatever reason, received from \nthe House, we can go to the hate crimes. When the supplemental comes, \nwe can interrupt that, get it done, and then go back to the other \nissue.\n\n  There will be a lot of debate about both of these issues. This seems \nlike a fair way to proceed. I want to emphasize the necessity to move \nas quickly as possible to the Defense authorization bill. The Armed \nServices Committee reported that bill out a couple weeks ago. We can't \nget started with our appropriations bills very well without that \ndefense authorization bill. It would make it possible to do the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  I am not trying to set up the order. I just want to remind the \nmajority leader that we need to do these defense issues as soon as \npossible so that we can go on to the appropriations bill so our men and \nwomen will know what they can count on in the defense bill.\n  This is a good arrangement at this time. Hopefully, we can complete \nboth of these bills the first week we are back, so we can get the \nsupplemental into conference and get it done and out of conference \nbefore the Fourth of July recess. I wanted to make those points.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank Senator Daschle for his cooperation. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank all Senators who worked so hard on \nthis trade bill. I particularly thank the majority leader, Senator \nDaschle. I think he is one of the main architects of the key provision, \ntrade adjustment assistance. He and Senator Bingaman have worked long \nand hard to help forge that portion of the bill. So I thank him and \nSenator Bingaman.\n  Also, I thank my friend from Nevada, Senator Reid. I don't know how \nwe would be here at this point without him. He has worked tirelessly \nand has done a super job with such equanimity and an even temper. I \ndon't know how he does it.\n  Also, I want to point out that a lot of work has gone into this bill. \nI don't think many people realize just how much work and dedication \ngoes into something such as this. There are a lot of people whose names \nare not well known. A lot of us here on the floor get some \ngratification from seeing our names in newspapers and on TV when \nsomething is accomplished. But the fact is the real work is done by \npeople who perform the most noble human endeavor--which is service to \ntheir country--virtually all day long, and many times with sleepless \nnights. Many are here tonight. I want people to know how hard they have \nworked.\n  I especially want to say thanks to Greg Mastel. I hired Greg \nspecifically to help get this legislation passed--and he has done a \ntremendous job.\n  I also want to thank many other committee staff, who have worked \ntirelessly on this legislation--John Angell, Mike Evans, Timothy Punke, \nTed Posner, Angela Marshall, Shara Aranoff, Andy Harig, Liz Fowler, \nKate Kirchgraber, and Mitchell Kent.\n  Senator Grassley also has a great team, and I thank them: Kolan \nDavis, Everett Eissenstat, and Richard Chriss.\n  And finally, it is an understatement to say that we all appreciate \nthe efforts of our skilled and patient legislative counsel--Polly \nCraighill, Stephanie Easley, and Ruth Ernst.\n  Although he is not here, I compliment my colleague, Senator Grassley, \nwho did a tireless job.\n  This is the most progressive and far-reaching trade bill that this \nSenate has passed in 15 years. This is a landmark bill. It is also very \nwell balanced. It modernizes fast-track trade promotion procedures, \nbrings them up to date. On the other hand, it includes very significant \nassistance to people who were dislocated under trade.\n  I think it will be a bill that, when looked back upon several years \nfrom now, is one of the landmarks and major benchmarks that has moved \nthe United States more directly and appropriately to engage the world \nin trade. I am proud of all the efforts of those here on the floor.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to express my gratitude to the two \nleaders for the order that has been entered with respect to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. That bill is a good bill. It was \nreported out of the Senate Appropriations Committee on yesterday by a \nvote of 29 to 0. It had unanimous support in the reporting of it on \nyesterday. That unanimous vote could not have been possible without the \ncooperation and support and leadership of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. \nTed Stevens.\n  The committee held extensive hearings, and the Senator from Alaska \nand I joined in issuing the request for witnesses. Every witness that \ncame before the committee had been agreed upon jointly by the Senator \nfrom Alaska and myself. Those hearings were important, they were \nproductive, and they brought forth exceedingly valuable information to \nthe members of the committee. And that information is reflected in the \nmakeup of the appropriations bill.\n  We had the local responders, the firemen, the police, the emergency \nhealth employees. We had seven Cabinet officers from the \nadministration, and we also had the Director of FEMA. We had mayors. We \nhad Governors. I was pleased with the hearings. I am very grateful and \nappreciative of the efforts that were made by Senator Stevens and the \nMembers on both sides of the aisle. The hearings were very well \nattended. So it is a good bill.\n  The war on terrorism proceeds. The Congress is receiving top secret \nbriefings from the Secretary of Defense and the FBI Director almost \nweekly. The country is on a heightened state of alert.\n  On March 21, 2002, the President submitted a supplemental budget \nrequest to prosecute that war.\n  The principal components of the President's budget request included \n$14 billion for the Department of Defense; $5.3 billion for homeland \ndefense, including $4.4 billion for the recently established \nTransportation Security Administration, $5.5 billion for New York in \nresponse to the September 11 attacks, $1.6 billion for international \nemergencies.\n  This supplemental bill provides for those emergencies, as requested \nby the President.\n  Just today, President Bush said, ``We've still got threats to the \nhomeland that we've got to deal with, and it's very important for us \nnot to hamper our ability to wage that war. . . .''\n  That is exactly what the supplemental appropriations deals with--\nhomeland security.\n  The supplemental bill includes $8.35 billion for homeland defense, \nand increase of $3 billion over the budget request. This $3 billion \nfocuses on problems that were identified during our homeland defense \nhearings.\n  Our committee held very extensive hearings. We heard from the first \nresponders, the state and local law enforcement personnel, the fire and \nmedical personnel, individuals representing the ports, and those who \nhad concerns about cyber security and the security of our nuclear \nweapons facilities and nuclear labs. We heard from those who are \nconcerned about border security, airport security, food and \nagricultural safety, nuclear non-proliferation programs, and the \nvulnerability of our water systems. We heard from seven cabinet \nsecretaries and the director of the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency.\n  All of this information led us to formulate a supplemental \nappropriations bill which cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee \nby a recorded vote of twenty-nine to zero.\n  Highlights include: $1.0 billion, $646 million above the request for \nfirst responder programs such as firefighting grants, State and local \nlaw enforcement grants, grants to State and local governments to fix \nthe interoperability problem between State and local police, fire and \nmedical personnel, emergency planning grants, funds to increase the \nnumber of FEMA search and rescue teams that have the training and \nequipment to combat biological, chemical and nuclear attacks and funds \nto make sure that we have standards for interoperable equipment; $970 \nmillion, $716 million above the request for port security including \ngrants to improve security at ports, for increased Coast Guard \nsurveillance, for increased Customs funding to improve container \ninspections overseas and to improve our technology on inspecting \ncontainers; $387 million of unrequested funds for bioterrorism, \nincluding funds to improve our toxicology and infectious disease lab \ncapacity at the Centers for Disease Control; $200 million, $174 million \nabove the request for security at our nuclear weapons facilities and \nnuclear labs; $154 million, $135 million above the request for cyber \nsecurity, with a special emphasis on helping the private sector defend \nitself from attack; $125 million, $84 million above the request for \nborder security, including resources for INS facilities on the borders \nand for deploying the system for rapid response criminal background \nchecks to 30 more ports; $100 million of unrequested funds for nuclear \nnonproliferation programs; $265 million of unrequested funds for \nairport security, including $100 million to help airports meet the new \nFederal standards for airport security; $200 million for USDA for food \nsafety labs, additional food inspectors, and for vulnerability \nassessments for rural water systems; $100 million for EPA to complete \nvulnerability assessments on the security of our water systems; and \n$286 million is provided for other homeland defense items such as \nSecret Service efforts to combat electronic crime, FBI counterterrorism \nefforts and funds for the Justice Department to develop an integrated \ninformation system.\n  The bill fully funds the President's $4.4 billion request for the new \nTransportation Security Administration, unlike the House which cuts the \nrequest by $550 million.\n  Just within the past few days, Vice President Cheney warned that a \nterrorist strike within our shores is ``almost certain.'' Defense \nSecretary Rumsfeld stated that it is inevitable that terrorists will \nacquire weapons of mass destruction. Secretary of State Colin Powell \nwarned that ``terrorists are trying every way they can'' to get \nnuclear, chemical or biological weapons. Security has been tightened \naround New York City landmarks. And Homeland Security Director Tom \nRidge said that, ``While we prepare for another terrorist attack, we \nneed to understand that it is not a question of if, but a question of \nwhen.''\n  The warnings are clear. The danger is real. We should act, not delay. \nWe should protect lives, not play politics. I urge Senators to move \nforward with this supplemental bill and to do so quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of our \nAppropriations Committee for his kind remarks and join him in \nrecommending the bill to the Senate that we will debate when we return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4819-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4819-S4820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DUTCH HARBOR\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today because, \non Sunday, I will travel to the Island of Unalaska and attend the first \nin a series of meetings that will take place to commemorate and to \nhonor those who died in the attack by the Japanese in June of 1942 \nagainst what was then known as Dutch Harbor.\n  Dutch Harbor is a harbor within the Bay of Alaska. It is an area not \nquite 2,000 miles out from Anchorage. It is a very interesting place. \nIt is a wonderful place to be.\n  The people of Dutch Harbor will start a weeklong series of events to \nhonor the people who served in our military during the time of the \nJapanese attack against Dutch Harbor.\n  I am indebted to the University of North Carolina online library for \nits Aleutians Campaign Web site which we researched today to make \ncertain I would properly report this attack to the Senate today.\n  On June 3, 1942, the Japanese, having come into Alaska at Attu and \nKiska, where they invaded our islands and occupied them, moved on up \nthe Aleutian chain and attacked Dutch Harbor. There was located near \nDutch Harbor an Army fort known as Fort Mears.\n  This attack, by the way, to give it some historical reference, was \nabout the same time as the attack on Midway Island. It was about 6 a.m. \nwhen four bombers approached Dutch Harbor and released 16 bombs on the \nfort and into\n\n[[Page S4820]]\n\nthe area of Fort Mears. Fourteen actually fell into the congested area \nof Fort Mears occupied by Army personnel. Two barracks and three \nQuonset huts were destroyed, and several buildings were damaged by the \nhits and resulting fire. About 25 men were killed and about the same \nnumber wounded that day.\n  About 15 fighters and 13 horizontal bombers participated in the raid. \nThere were fighters from Fort Glenn that tried to intercept the \nbombers, but to no avail.\n  At 6 p.m. on the next day, June 4, fire was opened again as 10 \nfighters attacked the naval air station at Dutch Harbor. Then 11 \nbombers delivered a dive-bombing attack through a series of openings in \nthe overcast, which is almost a normal situation in the Aleutians. The \nchief damage was to four new 6,666-barrel fuel tanks to supply our \nmilitary in the Aleutian chain. An old station ship, the Northwestern, \nwas set afire and partly destroyed. The Japanese also scored hits on a \nwarehouse and an empty aircraft hangar.\n  The final attack on Dutch Harbor came about 25 minutes later when \nfive planes dropped 10 bombs near a magazine area that was on the south \nslope of Mount Ballyhoo.\n  The air raids on Dutch Harbor killed 33 U.S. servicemen, 10 \ncivilians, and wounded 50. Japanese troops, arriving with a task force \nof 2 aircraft carriers, 12 destroyers, 5 cruisers, 6 submarines, 4 \ntroop transports, and other vessels, subsequently occupied these \nIslands of Kiska and Attu for over a year.\n  If anyone wishes to pursue the history of this war in the Aleutians, \nI recommend the ``1000 Mile War'' written by Brian Garfield. It is a \nvery interesting book. His thesis is that by splitting their military, \nparticularly their navy, the Japanese lost the war because they lost \nthe Battle of the Coral Sea due to the fact their vessels were in the \nAleutian Islands and split off from the regular navy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after my remarks an \narticle from the Unalaska/Dutch Harbor Historical Timeline be printed \nin the Record. It is entitled ``Where does the Name ``Unalaska'' Come \nFrom?''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I shall enjoy being at Dutch Harbor on \nSunday, and I commend to the Senate the memory of the fact that there \nis another harbor that was attacked. Pearl Harbor was attacked, as we \nknow, in December of 1941. Dutch Harbor in our State was attacked 6 \nmonths later in June.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              Where Does the Name ``Unalaska'' Come From?\n\n                            (By Ray Hudson)\n\n       The name ``Unalaska'' does not reflect a thwarted attempt \n     to secede from the 49th State, nor does it imply that the \n     residents of Unalaska view their community as one that runs \n     counter to the majority of the State, although some might. \n     Either of those explanations would be more interesting over \n     the last two hundred years.\n       Between 1890 and 1899 the United States Board on Geographic \n     Names standardized the spelling of this town and the Aleutian \n     island on which it is located by selecting ``Unalaska'' from \n     several names that had been in use up to that time. \n     Variations included ``Ounalashka,'' ``Ounalaska,'' \n     ``Oonalaska,'' and ``Oonalashka.'' These spellings all \n     derived from the Russian spelling of a word which was itself \n     a shortened version of an original aleut word: \n     ``Agunalaksh.'' Unalaska island may have derived its name \n     from its proximity to the Alaska Peninsula. The Aleuts called \n     the Alaska Peninsula ``Alaxsxa'' or ``Alaxsxix''--the \n     ``mainland.'' The Russians adopted this as ``Alyaska'' from \n     which ``Alaska'' is derived. ``Popular belief has it, \n     incorrectly, that the name means `The Great Land', with \n     almost sacred connotations.''\n       Thus ``Unalaska'' does not mean not-Alaska, nor not-the-\n     Great-Land. If anything, the name defines its geographical \n     location in terms of the Alaska Peninsula.\n       In fact, to compound confusion, this town has three names. \n     First, there is ``Unalaska.'' Before ``Unalaska,'' however, \n     this community was known as ``Iliuliuk'' in Russian or in \n     Aleut as ``Iluulux'' or ``Illuulax.'' This early word \n     referred to the curved approach one took in a skin boat when \n     approaching the village. The word may also have had \n     connotations of ``Harmony.'' (In 1806 after almost 30 years \n     of sporadic fighting with the local Aleuts, Nikolai Rezanov \n     of the Russian-American Company named the community ``Dobroye \n     Soglasiis''--the Harbor of Good Accord. [Ignoring the Russian \n     presence, the Spanish laid a surreptitious claim to Unalaska \n     on August 5, 1788, and called it ``Puerto de Dona Maria Luisa \n     Teresa de Parma, Princesa de Asturies''.] The third name \n     which is frequently applied to this community is ``Dutch \n     Harbor.'' This specific harbor is one of many within the \n     greater Unalaska Bay and is said to have been given its name \n     because a Dutch vessel was the first to anchor there. The \n     name dates from the late 18th Century. In the 1880's a dock \n     was built at Dutch Harbor and people sailing to Unalaska \n     booked passage for Dutch Harbor. During WWII the military \n     constructed a runway at Dutch Harbor, not far from the dock. \n     After the war private airplanes took over the airstrip, and \n     so people flying into Unalaska were ticketed for Dutch \n     Harbor.\n       Consequently, new-comers often refer to this city as \n     ``Dutch Harbor'' while more permanent residents use \n     ``Unalaska'' and really old-time Aleut speakers say \n     ``Ounalashka.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on this last Monday in May, Americans \nobserve Memorial Day. On this day, we honor the fallen heroes of past \nand present wars, the mighty who have fallen in battle, by flying \nflags, laying wreaths at soldiers' graves, and other appropriate forms \nof tribute.\n  On Monday, the mournful sound of taps will echo across the rows of \nheadstones in quiet veterans' cemeteries and other cemeteries across \nthe land. These will be followed by the sharp report of a 21-gun \nsalute.\n  Families across America may leaf through old boxes of photographs and \nremember their own losses--the doughboy uncle who fell in France in \n1918; the Marine Corps cousin lost on Tarawa in World War II; the Army \nnephew cut down in Korea; or the Navy pilot brother shot down over Binh \nHoa in Vietnam; the sons lost so recently in Afghanistan. They will \nworry about family members on duty in farflung corners of the globe in \nBosnia, Saudi Arabia, Korea, Afghanistan, Colombia, and in other \ndistant places.\n  Memorial Day is a time of public patriotism leavened by private \ngrief.\n  In my own State of West Virginia, that undercurrent of private grief \nis sharpened by recent loss. Last Sunday, Sgt. Gene Arden Vance of \nMorgantown was killed in Afghanistan while carrying out a surveillance \npatrol with other coalition forces. He was 38 years old. He leaves \nbehind his wife Lisa, a young daughter, and many family members and \nfriends.\n  Sergeant Vance's sacrifice and the pride and suffering of his family \nremind us all of the human costs of war.\n  Sergeant Vance's name now joins a long honor roll of West Virginia's \npatriots who have given their all whenever and wherever duty has \ncalled. He will be remembered in our hearts and honored each Memorial \nDay by all who loved him and all who love the Nation he served so well.\n  Originally May 30, the Memorial Day holiday was moved for convenience \nsake to make a welcome 3-day weekend. Many people know Memorial Day \nonly as a marker for the end of the school year, the beginning of \nsummer, the opening of the neighborhood pool or the start of the \nbarbecue season. Few recall its roots in the civil war, or its gradual \nevolution from ``Decoration Day'' as it was called when I was a boy, to \nhonor fallen civil war soldiers to a day to honor the dead from all \nwars. But this year, as fresh graves scar the landscape, the grim \nreminder of the human costs of this strange new war on terrorism, I \nthink perhaps more people will hang an American flag by their door or \nwear a red poppy on their lapel. The wave of visible patriotism that \nblossomed in the aftermath of September 11 has faded somewhat. The \nflags may be tattered and torn, the signs and banners mostly gone, but \nthe powerful emotion still surges in our veins. In Memorial Day, I \nsuspect that the red, white, and blue will reemerge with vigor.\n  It is reassuring to me to see Americans so proud of their flag, their \nNation, the men and women in uniform. It is reassuring to see how \ndearly we hold the rights and liberties that are the legacy of our \nFounding Fathers. Our collective outrage, and then defiance, toward \nthose who would attack our freedom is all the proof we need of the \ncontinuing strength of the American revolutionary spirit that created \nthis great Nation. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln made a brief \naddress at Gettysburg, PA. He said, in part:\n\n       We are met to dedicate a portion of it [the battlefield] as \n     the final resting place of those\n\n[[Page S4821]]\n\n     who here gave their lives that this Nation might live. It is \n     altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in \n     a larger sense we cannot dedicate--we cannot consecrate--we \n     cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, \n     who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor \n     power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long \n     remember, what we say, but it can never forget what they did. \n     It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated to the \n     unfinished work that they have thus far so nobly advanced. It \n     is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task \n     remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take \n     increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the \n     last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve \n     that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this \n     nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and \n     that government of the people, by the people, for the \n     people, shall not perish from the earth.\n\n  That spirit lives on, undaunted and undefeated by the events of \nSeptember 11 and unbowed by the continuing threats made against us. A \ncivil war could not extinguish it; a war of terror will not break it. \nThat strength and that resolve, even in the face of the greatest \nsacrifice, will continue to sustain our Nation. In the effort to avenge \nthe deaths of our innocent civilians and to rid the world of Osama bin \nLaden's terrorist network, more American soldiers' lives will be put in \nharms' way and some of our brave sons and daughters will again be \ncalled upon to give that ``last full measure of devotion'' for their \ncountry, as Sergeant Vance has been called. That is not a pleasant \nthought, but a true one.\n  This war on terror may take our sons and daughters from us, but their \nblood, their sacrifice, will leave a lasting legacy.\n  May we, on this Memorial Day, rededicate ourselves to the high and \nnoble patriotism for the Nation which they so unstintingly exemplified.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4823-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n[[Page S4823]]\n\nSenate\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, this evening I rise to discuss one of the \nmost serious issues as America prepares to defend itself against \nterrorism, and that is the vulnerability which is represented by our \n361 seaports and the thousands of cargo containers which each day flow \nthrough those seaports to all America.\n  On December 20, 2001, over 5 months ago, the Senate unanimously \npassed a comprehensive seaport security bill. This came after a 2-year \neffort by Senators Hollings and McCain and myself. Despite the new \nsecurity threats that served as the catalyst for passage of this bill \nlast December, I am concerned that as of this evening the House has yet \nto pass companion legislation.\n  While we await House of Representatives action, there have been \npublished reports that 25 Islamic extremists, since March, have stowed \naway in cargo containers and entered this country. Those entries were \ngained in, as reported, four U.S. ports: Long Beach, CA, Savannah, GA, \nand Miami and Fort Lauderdale, FL. These extremists, in some instances, \ndisguised themselves as stevedores and disembarked into the communities \non which those ships had called.\n  I consider these reports to be credible. I see this as one of the \nmost recent and disturbing examples of the vulnerabilities that exist \nat our Nation's seaports.\n  September 11 was a tragic, horrific day. As a result, we restructured \nour aviation security to prevent another attack. We still have the \nopportunity to be responsible and to protect our seaports before they \nare attacked. Thus far, we have failed to do so.\n  Today, the U.S. Customs Service agents inspect less than 3 percent of \nthe 16,000 cargo containers that arrive on U.S. shores from nations \nwhich are not contiguous with the United States every day. If the bill \npassed by the Senate had been signed into law and implemented before \nthese 25 so described extremists attempted to enter this country in a \ncargo container, we might have seen a different outcome.\n\n  Under our legislation, advanced reporting requirements would help \nCustoms electronically receive vital information on ships before they \narrived at a U.S. port. This means that information on ships and \ncontents, passengers, and crew members who were suspect could be \nreviewed before the ship arrived.\n  With new funding of over $700 million, local ports would be able to \nupgrade security infrastructure. The Customs Service would have more \ninspectors and agents, as well as new screening and detection \nequipment. This would fortify our frontline defense against those who \nwould attempt to breach our shores. Ports would be better prepared for \na security breach because they would be required to have a \ncomprehensive security plan that would meet minimum security \nguidelines.\n  Currently, we have no Federal security guidelines or security \nrequirements. A new maritime security force would have been established \nunder the legislation which the Senate passed over 5 months ago. This \neffort would bring together those trained in antiterrorism, drug \ninterdiction, navigation assistance, and facilitating responses to \nsecurity threats.\n  Keeping our Nation's seaports secure is an important job not just for \nAmericans who live in one of the communities served by our 361 \ncommercial ports but everywhere in between. Citizens who live inland \nare as vulnerable to security breaches as those who live near seaports. \nContainers from ships being transferred to railway cars and long-haul \ntrucks that travel throughout cities and towns represent the potential \nshell which would surround a weapon of mass destruction. A container is \nfilled allegedly with legitimate cargo at a distant site. There might \nbe contained in that legitimate cargo a biological, a chemical or, God \nforbid, a nuclear device.\n  That device would then be connected to a global positioning device \nwhich would allow for constant monitoring of where that specific \ncontainer was located. That weapon of mass destruction would also be \nequipped with a standoff detonation capability so when the global \npositioning device indicated that the container was at the most \ndangerous place where the greatest damage would be done to our country, \nit could be ignited.\n  While we cannot expect to screen every marine container entering into \nthe United States, we need to provide some expectation of inspection, \nand some level of deterrence, to dissuade smugglers from using a very \nefficient U.S. intermodal system.\n  I am encouraged by the news today that Congressman Don Young of \nAlaska and other concerned members of the House of Representatives have \nagreed that seaport security legislation will be on the House agenda \nafter the Memorial Day recess.\n  I urge the House to not only expeditiously enact this legislation, \nbut work with me and my colleagues in the Senate to expedite the \nconference committee to resolve any differences that may exist, and \nquickly send it to the President, who is anxious to sign this into law.\n  By working rapidly, we can provide greater security for our citizens \nat America's open front door--our nation's seaports.\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know the hour is late and the day has \nbeen long and the staff and the pages and the Presiding Officer are \ntired. And so is this Senator. But I would like to take about 7 or 8 \nminutes to talk about a subject that is very dear to my heart.\n  Mr. President, ``Honor thy father and thy mother'' is the fifth of \nGod's holy commandments.\n  For many of us--especially at my age--we can no longer do that \n(except in memory). We had our chance, and now they are gone. I never \nknew my father, and my mother died in 1986 when she was 93.\n  For those of us who have lost parents, we will be forever burdened by \nthe haunting question: Did we adequately fulfill that commandment or \ncould we have done more?\n  And, if one has a heart instead of a stone, we look around and see \nother living mothers and fathers whom it is not too late to still \nhonor. I know I do.\n  And that is why I rise again--as I will do ad nauseum until something \nis done--to plead for action on prescription drugs before the August \nrecess.\n  We must attack this problem by addressing both sides of the \nequation--prescription drug coverage and prescription drug cost.\n  We cannot truly help our senors unless we increase the coverage and \nlower the cost. Coverage and cost.\n  I am a cosponsor of three bills that would do both those things.\n  First, Senator Bob Graham of Florida and I have introduced a bill \nthat would increase coverage by adding an affordable prescription drug \nbenefit to Medicare.\n  For our neediest seniors, those who earn less than $11,900 a year, \nour bill would cover 100 percent of their prescription drug costs. They \nwould pay no premiums, and Medicare would pick up the entire cost of \ntheir prescriptions.\n  About a third of our Medicare beneficiaries fall into this category. \nThat's roughly 12 million seniors.\n  those who earn more than $11,900 would pay premiums of $25 a month or \nless, depending on their income. And they would pay an affordable share \nof the cost of each prescription.\n  No senior would have to spend more than $4,000 a year out of their \nown pocket. Right now, about 3 million seniors are spending more than \n$4,000 a year out of their own pocket on prescriptions.\n  The two other bills of which I am a co-sponsor deal directly with the \ncost of prescription drugs. We must bring the cost of these drugs down. \nA miracle drug can't work miracles if no one can afford it.\n  As many of you know--and as most of the seniors in this country \nknow--you can buy the same drug in the same bottle for a much cheaper \nprice in Canada and other countries than you can in the U.S.\n  In Canada, you can buy Tamoxifen, the drug for breast cancer, for \none-tenth what it costs in the U.S. Celebrex, which is used for \narthritis, costs 79 cents a tablet in Canada, but $2.20 a tablet in the \nU.S. Those are two of many examples.\n  A bipartisan group of senators has introduced a bill to let drug \nstores and medical distributors buy U.S.-made drugs in Canada--where \nthey are sold much more cheaply--and then resell them here in the U.S.\n  If our seniors could buy their drugs at the lower Canadian prices, \nthey could save an estimated $38 billion a year.\n  Our seniors should be able to get their medications at the best price \npossible, and they shouldn't have to ride a bus to Canada to do it.\n  The other bill I am co-sponsoring that would help bring down the cost \nof prescription drugs is the Fair Advertising and Increased Research \nAct of 2002.\n  We have all seen the endless stream of ads on TV about the latest \nwonder drugs for high cholesterol of arthritis or cancer.\n  I have visions of that purple pill that keeps spinning into my living \nroom and bedroom whenever the TV is on. You can't escape it.\n  You can't escape these ads. They are everywhere. We are drowning in \nthem. And the millions of dollars the drug companies are spending on \nthem is sending the price of prescriptions through the roof.\n  Our bill doesn't ban this TV advertising, but it does say to the drug \ncompanies: Spend as much on research as you do on advertising.\n  Our bill would limit the tax deduction a drug company can take for \nadvertising expenses to no more than the amount they deduct for \nresearch and development costs.\n  Americans today are being forced to subsidize prescription drug \nadvertising both when they pay their taxes and again when they go to \nthe pharmacy to buy their prescriptions. That's not right, and our FAIR \nAct would help stop it.\n  We must do something soon. If I were to stay in the Senate as long as \nSenator Thurmond, I don't believe I would ever figure out how this \nwonderful place works.\n  I have come to accept that, just as I came to accept that the \nintricacies of cricket and even hockey escape me.\n  But I have known the infield fly rule since I was 12. And I also know \nwhat the men and women my age and a little older in middle America are \nsaying and thinking.\n  What's that Latin phrase--the vox populi? Well, the vox populi of \nthis nation's elderly are discouraged and displeased.\n  But they are not disorganized, and they are definitely not \ndisenfranchised.\n  And if we don't show them some results instead of rhetoric pretty \nsoon, they are going to come after us with their pitchforks and their \npill cutters * * * and something we in here fear even more: Their \nballots. And who could blame them?\n  In 2000, both parties said prescription drugs was at the top of the \nlist, at the front of the line. Our seniors have been waiting in line \nfor a long time. Waiting as we debated many other worthwhile \nissues. Waiting, as we keep smiling at them, telling them: Now, be \npatient; you are next.\n\n  Do you know what makes people madder than anything? Making them wait \nin line for a long time and then, when they think they are just about \nto go to the front of that line, someone cuts in front of them. That is \nwhat we have been doing to our senior citizens. Every time we take up a \nnew issue, no matter how good it is, every time we take up a new issue \nother than prescription drugs, we are bumping our seniors from the \nfront of the line that they have been waiting in for years.\n  We cannot throw this issue into another election cycle. They will not \nstand for it. We cannot keep our seniors waiting in line through \nanother election.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to first of all apologize to the \nPresiding Officer and others for taking a few extra minutes in what has \nbeen a long day and evening for all of us here. But I wanted to take a \nfew minutes to close business in the Senate today and express my views \non the final passage of H.R. 3009, the Trade Promotion Authority bill.\n  My friend and colleague, the Presiding Officer, will appreciate the \nreasons when I get through with these remarks. I normally submit my \nstatement and have it included in the Record. But I wanted to take a \nfew minutes and express my thoughts publicly.\n  I rise this evening to talk about the omnibus trade bill the Senate \njust voted in favor of on final passage.\n  The bill which was before us granted the President with what is \ncalled fast-track trade authority. The bill we just voted on has a \nfundamental flaw, in my view. Unfortunately, it lacks the minimum \nprotections of environmental labor standards by countries that seek \nenhanced trade relationships with the United States. Senate passage of \nthis bill will signal reverse progress made\n\n[[Page S4825]]\n\nover the past decade to ensure that free trade does not come at the \nexpense of American workers and American principles.\n  Let me also quickly add that this is the first trade agreement, with \nthe exception of one 14 years ago, I ever voted against. I am a strong \nsupporter of trade agreements. I had hoped very sincerely to vote for \nthis one because I believe it is critical to portray the well-being of \nour own Nation for the promotion of democracy and enhancement of \neconomic opportunities for others around the globe. I tried as hard as \nI could to find my way to vote for this particular bill, but I just \ncould not at the end of the day.\n\n  Fast-track authority, as we all know, eases the way for American \nPresidents to be able to negotiate international trade agreements by \nlimiting congressional approval with just an up-or-down vote, and with \nno amendments on trade accords that come before the U.S. Congress. This \nmakes it much easier for Presidents to be able to negotiate agreements, \nand then let the Congress just have one vote--yes or no.\n  I have understood the value of that in times past. But that value and \nthat agreement to allow Presidents, regardless of party, to be able to \ndo that, has always been contingent on certain objectives that an \nAmerican President and his negotiating team would have to pursue which \nwe felt strongly about as a people, and very much wanted to see as part \nof any negotiations not just for our own citizenry but values and \nprinciples which we believe are inherent in the right of all people \nendowed by their creator with those rights.\n  Unfortunately, as a result of what happened here over the past number \nof days, I think we took a step backwards and not forwards in the \nevolving process of objectives of a free, open and democratic society \nthat tries to enhance those common values for others with whom we \nnegotiate.\n  Although Congress has continuously granted Presidential fast-track \nauthority between 1974 and 1994, it has refused to renew that authority \nsince then. The reason for this change of heart was simple: There were \nmany in Congress who believed that a policy of unfettered trade with \ncountries with weak or nonexistent labor standards, environmental \nstandards, and the like were putting U.S. companies at a competitive \ndisadvantage--costing American workers hundreds of thousands of jobs \nand pressuring the United States to lower our own workers' health and \nsafety standards. Instead of lowering our standards, our trading \npartners should be raising theirs.\n  President Bush contends that America has missed out on portrayed \nopportunities due to the lack of fast-track authority. I contend quite \nthe opposite is true.\n  Since 1994, the United States has become a party to nearly 200 trade \nagreements with countries in the Caribbean Basin, which I strongly \nsupported; the Sub-Saharan-African agreements; Southeast Asia; the \nMiddle East; and elsewhere in the world. Far from hampering free trade, \nCongress's role in helping to craft the final language of trade \nagreements over the past 8 years developed new international norms and \nprotected people's rights across the globe with whom we have entered \ninto those agreements.\n  The most recent of these agreements--and the one which I had hoped \nwould become the basis--in fact, Bob Zoellick, who is the chief trade \nnegotiator, mentioned back some months ago that he wanted to use the \nUnited States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement as the model for this fast-\ntrack authority. All of us here unanimously voted for the United \nStates-Jordan Free Trade Agreement.\n  I can't tell you how enthused I was when Bob Zoellick made those \nremarks. I thought this administration understood the evolutionary \nprocess of trade agreements.\n  The Jordan-United States Free Trade Agreement was, in my view, the \nbest free trade agreement we had negotiated, and should have been the \nstandard by which all future trade agreements would be judged. But \nunlike previous trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade \nAgreement--which I strongly supported, along with the Presiding \nOfficer; and the Jordan FTA--the Jordan FTA actually includes \nprovisions safeguarding minimum labor standards in the main text of the \nagreement, and it permits sanctions should our trade partner fail to \ncomply with their own labor laws in order to gain an advantage over us \nin trade.\n\n  The Jordan Free Trade Agreement passed 100 to zero in this body. It \nwas unanimously supported by every single Member only a few months ago.\n  With Congress poised to renew Presidential fast-track authority, it \nis now, it seems to me, more important than ever that the President's \nfreedom to negotiate free trade agreements operate within a framework \nthat upholds universally recognized labor standards. Because the Jordan \nlanguage provides such a framework, there was a great deal of \noptimism--myself included--that the Jordan standards would be strongly \nincluded in the legislation renewing fast-track authority. That was the \nevolutionary process.\n  However, the fast track bill that passed the House and the one that \njust passed this body does not include Jordan standards, and the Senate \nversion, although going a little further, also fails to obtain the \nJordan language. An amendment that I offered requiring new fast-track \nauthority to be in parity with the Jordan standards was voted down by a \nvote of 52 to 46.\n  That would mean that the fast track bill that goes to the President \nnow will not prevent our trading partners from violating domestic labor \nlaws in their own country to gain a competitive advantage over American \nworkers and businesses, which was one of the major provisions of the \nJordan FTA. Nor, as it is currently drafted, does the trade bill \nrequire countries with whom we trade to strive--to strive; that is all \nit is as an objective--to meet the standards of the International Labor \nOrganization's declaration of workers' rights.\n  There are 27 pages of negotiating objectives covering every \nimaginable issue that the Finance Committee saw in its wisdom to \ninclude, such items involving insurance, and e-commerce, technology, \nand the like. None of those objectives are absolutely required to be in \nevery agreement. We merely state that trading negotiators should have \nthem as their objectives to try and pursue during those negotiations.\n  I found it rather stunning that the members of this Senate with the \nsupport of the administration could not agree to take the exact \nlanguage out of an agreement that had passed 100 to zero, in the year \n2001, and include it as part of the objectives of the fast-track \nauthority dealing with labor rights. To not do this was a major \nsetback, and it raises too many concerns in my own mind about whether \nor not this administration or successor administrations would pursue \nthose values and ideals which we have so strongly made a part of our \nown society and pursued as trying to be included in the rights of \nothers around the globe, that I felt I had no other choice, at the end, \nbut to vote against this bill.\n  Since neither the House bill nor the Senate bill includes the Jordan \nlabor standards or something comparable, the President may not be in a \nposition to prevent our trading partners from violating domestic laws \nin their own country to gain a competitive advantage over American \nworkers and businesses. Nor, as it is currently drafted, does the bill \nrequire countries with whom we trade, as I said, to strive to meet the \nstandards of the ILO. This means our trading partners may fail to \nprohibit child labor or forced labor if no such domestic laws exist.\n\n  That was part of the language in the Jordan Free Trade Agreement that \nis missing from this bill: abolish child labor, eliminate \ndiscrimination--these are basic labor rights. To be turned away, after \nwe already agreed to an agreement back only some months ago in the \nJordan Free Trade Agreement, I found rather remarkable; that is, that \nwe would not accept those as negotiating objectives--not requirements, \nbut objectives--in the 27 pages that included everything else you could \npossibly imagine. But abolish child labor, eliminate discrimination, \nagain these are basic rights.\n  I saw that as a step backwards. We have entered the 21st century, we \nought to try to pursue at least those rights and raise them with people \nwho want access to our markets, I found that terribly disheartening.\n  Instead of including provisions to protect not only hardworking \nAmericans but hardworking people around\n\n[[Page S4826]]\n\nthe globe, and improve conditions with nations who want access to our \nmarkets, the Senate, in my view, seems to be content to continue \nincreasing the amount of trade adjustment assistance paid to hundreds \nof thousands of American workers who lost jobs due to trade agreements \nwith countries that disregard their workers' rights. While this \nassistance is desperately needed by working families hardest hit by \ntrade agreements, it is not a long-term solution, and it certainly is \nnot a trade policy.\n  I am all for providing trade adjustment assistance. But it almost \nseems like raising a white flag in many ways in terms of what happens \nin our own country, so that all I can do is go back home to my own \nconstituency and say: Don't worry; if you lose your job, I am going to \nsee to it you get some assistance in the process.\n  I am glad we are doing it, but in a way it is an abdication, in my \nview, of what we ought to be doing when it comes to workers' rights \nhere and workers' rights around the globe.\n  As I said a while ago, I have long supported efforts to promote free \ntrade for the simple reasons that trade opens markets for American \ngoods and services, and trade allows us to compete globally, which is \ngenerally good for American businesses and workers.\n  Over the years, I have supported virtually every one of these \nagreements. So I am saddened, as I stand here this evening, that I was \ncompelled, as a result of what was excluded from this bill, to vote \nagainst this trade promotion authority.\n  But I feel very strongly that in order for trade to be a vehicle for \nimproving the lives of men and women in this country--for it truly to \nbe a ``rising tide that lifts all boats''--trade agreements must uphold \ninternational standards that the United States has long supported in \nthe areas of labor and the environment. I remain unconvinced that the \nBush administration is committed to including such standards, absent \nCongressional action in these areas. That is why I voted against the \nrenewal of Presidential fast-track authority, despite my support for \nsimilar authority in the past.\n  I do not dispute that there are many important provisions in this \nbill. I have strongly supported the renewal of the Andean Trade \nPreference Act, which, again, I know the Presiding Officer has fought \nfor very, very hard over the years. He and I have spent a lot of time \ntalking about how to move that forward. It saddens me deeply that I am \nthrown into the position, because of what happened here, to have a vote \ncast against an agreement that I think is extremely important. But I am \nquite confident had the Andean Trade Preference Act been a freestanding \nproposal here, an overwhelming majority of Members would have supported \nit, and that act would have become law in its own right.\n\n  That act, of course, expired last December because Congress failed \nthe act. I wish we had done the Andean Trade Agreement as a \nfreestanding bill because it has broad-based support that would benefit \nboth the United States and the Andean nations who are participants in \nthe agreement.\n  My vote against the underlying bill should not be interpreted as any \nopposition, whatsoever, to the Andean agreement. I will speak \nseparately about that agreement. In fact, I have added some remarks for \nthe Record to be printed prior to the adoption of the bill this evening \nspecifically talking about the Andean Trade Agreement.\n  Were the Andean agreement the only issue we were being asked to vote \non today, my decision with respect to how to vote would be an easy one. \nI would have voted overwhelmingly, strongly for that bill.\n  Unfortunately, there is a lot more in this bill than the renewal and \nexpansion of ATPA. There are also a number of important provisions that \nhave been excluded from the bill. I believe that the adoption of the \nDayton-Craig amendment allays some concerns that I had; namely, that \nthe Bush administration was prepared to jettison U.S. trade laws \ndesigned to protect U.S. companies and workers against unfair trade \ncompetition. I believe that the Senate has put the administration on \nnotice that this is unacceptable. And it remains to be seen what will \nhappen to this provision during conference.\n  The Senate began consideration of trade legislation on April 29, and \nthere have been more than 18 rollcall votes on amendments offered by \nmyself and other colleagues of ours in this Chamber. Many of these \namendments were crafted in order to ensure that there are sufficient \nsafeguards to ensure that working men and women in our own country will \nnot be adversely affected by future trade agreements.\n  By and large, the Republican Members of this body have voted in \nlockstep against these amendments, regardless of their merits. I think \nthat strategy was extremely unwise because it sends the wrong signal to \nU.S. negotiators and to foreign governments with whom we will be \nshortly entering into negotiations.\n  The bill's provisions related to negotiating objectives with respect \nto labor and environmental matters, human rights, and the like, are \ninadequate, in my view.\n  I would like to think we have finally reached common ground with \nrespect to the importance of including enforceable labor and \nenvironmental provisions in trade agreements. Trade agreements can no \nlonger just be about investments, tariffs and duties. Trade agreements \nmust also include provisions that ensure that the environment and \nworkers' rights will also be protected. I see no reason we should not \nwant to take steps to make sure that such trade agreements include \nlanguage which would encourage countries to improve their labor laws so \nthat someday we will see child labor abolished and discrimination \neliminated.\n  Unfortunately, last week this body took a step back from the progress \nwe made in the latter part of the 20th century, when it comes to trade \nagreements, when the two workers' rights amendments that both Senator \nLieberman and I introduced were tabled. My amendment simply attempted \nto carry forward protections that have already been approved \noverwhelmingly in this body in the context of the United States-Jordan \nagreement.\n  This was not some killer amendment. It was merely commonsense \nlanguage already adopted unanimously by this body. The managers of this \nbill have mistakenly been saying that the bill follows the labor \nconditions contained in the Jordan agreement. My amendment would have \nmade sure that these basic labor rights we have already approved once \nwere fully incorporated into this bill.\n  The few Jordan standards that are in the bill have been made \nmeaningless by the rejection of Senator Lieberman's amendment which \nwould have deleted four lines from the bill that were added by Senator \nGramm of Texas. The Gramm language states that a party has the right to \nestablish its own domestic labor standards and levels of environmental \nprotection regardless of how these domestic laws may deviate from \naccepted international norms in these areas. That is the language of \nthe bill now.\n  If the Gramm language is retained in conference, as I suspect it will \nbe, other countries can weaken their labor and environmental laws to \ngain a competitive advantage, and we will have no recourse against such \nactions. That is clearly contrary to the interests of the United States \nof America.\n  I believe it is unwise that this bill has moved forward without \nlanguage that would have ensured enforcement of worker rights and \nenvironmental protection in future fast-track trade agreements.\n  I believe strongly that by not including these amendments, the Senate \nhas reversed the bipartisan progress we made only a few months ago when \nwe passed the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement. I believe the \nmanagers of the bill will regret that they have not been more forceful \nin their directions to the Bush administration and successor \nadministrations because it has shown little or no sensitivity with \nrespect to these matters. The managers may have been able to get this \nlegislation passed, as they have, but I will predict that if the \nadministration ignores concerns expressed by myself and others on these \nsubjects, they will find it extremely difficult to get congressional \napproval for future agreements that are concluded pursuant to the \nauthority in this bill.\n  I have no doubt that this legislation is going to survive the House-\nSenate conference and will shortly become law. It will then fall to the \nadministration to build minimum labor standards into future trade \nagreements. It will be\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\nup to Congress to vote down agreements that fail to ensure that our \ntrading partners respect and uphold workers' rights. The continued \ngrowth of international trade will only benefit workers in America and \naround the globe if increased trade goes hand in hand with respect for \nlabor rights, protection of the environment, and a shared commitment to \nmaking the lives of working people around the globe better.\n  I hope the administration takes note of this free traders vote today. \nThey didn't need it. It wasn't necessary. The bill passed \noverwhelmingly. But I know there are many who voted for this \nlegislation who did so with a great concern considering the progress we \nhave made over these past number of years; then to have as an \nunderlying agreement a major step backwards from the achievements we \nhave accomplished as a Congress. I believe if the administration fails \nto do what it ought to do, it is likely to find more Members of this \nbody who have been traditionally free traders walking away from future \nagreements that could enhance the opportunity for people in this \ncountry and elsewhere around the globe.\n  I apologize to the Chair and members of the staff who have to listen \nto these remarks at this late hour. I wanted to be on record publicly \nabout a vote I cast, I regret I had to cast, given a long, strong \nrecord of supporting trade agreements over the years. This bill has \ngone in the wrong direction. I could not in good conscience lend my \nname to a proposal I think will cause serious problems in the years \nahead.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4827-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF LARRY J. HOAG\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am really pleased to come to the floor of \nthe United States Senate today to recognize the long Federal service of \nLarry J. Hoag, the Senate Armed Services Committee's Printing and \nDocuments Clerk.\n  For the past 40 years, Larry Hoag has remained true to his chosen \nvocation, the time-honored art of printing. A native of Easton, PA, he \nspent the first dozen of his professional years working as a printer in \nprivate industry. We are indeed fortunate that in 1974 Larry decided to \nenter public service and joined the Government Printing Office as a \nprinter/proofreader. Twelve years later, because of his experience and \nexpertise, Larry Hoag was detailed to the House Committee on Armed \nServices. After about 10 years on the House side, in 1995 he was \ndetailed to the Senate Armed Services Committee staff by then-Chairman \nStrom Thurmond. In just under a year, Chairman Thurmond asked Larry \nHoag to leave the Government Printing Office and join the staff of the \nCommittee. On June 3, 1996, he became the Printing and Documents Clerk \nfor the Committee on Armed Services.\n  The job of Printing and Documents Clerk for our committee is \nparticularly demanding and challenging. Given our committee's broad \njurisdiction, we have a large number of oversight hearings. \nTraditionally, our committee has always taken great pride in the \npublishing and preservation of our hearings and reports. We recognize \nthe historical importance that these documents have for the Senate and \nour Nation. In addition, we want the public to know as much as possible \nabout the work of our committee. Throughout his time with our \ncommittee, Larry Hoag made important contributions to that effort.\n  For over 28 years, Larry Hoag has served his country as a \nprofessional printer. In closing, I first want to thank Larry for his \ndedicated service to the Nation and to the staff of the Armed Services \nCommittee. I also want to thank his wife, Norma, for her sacrifices and \nsupport to Larry during his long and distinguished career. All of us on \nthe Committee are sorry to see Larry leave, but we wish him and Norma \nall the best in the future and hope that he will always stay in touch \nwith his many friends in the Senate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and bid farewell \nto Larry J. Hoag, upon his retirement as the Printing and Documents \nClerk for the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  A native of Easton, PA, Larry began his career in printing as an \napprentice with the Mack Printing Company in Easton in 1962. In 1974, \nLarry came to Washington, DC to work for the Government Printing \nOffice, GPO, and later, as a GPO detailee, was assigned to the House \nArmed Services Committee, where he served for 10 years.\n  Larry wisely moved to the Senate side of the Capitol on June 3, 1966, \nwhen he was appointed to the Senate Armed Services Committee staff by \nthen Chairman Strom Thurmond. When I became Chairman of the Committee \nin January of 1999, it was an easy decision to ask Larry to remain a \nvital part of the Armed Services family. Larry has continued his \ndistinguished service under our current chairman, Senator Carl Levin.\n  Larry's experience has been instrumental in the publication of \nhundreds of hearing transcripts, committee prints, and reports. He has \nalso served as liaison between the committee and GPO, to assure that \nthe committee's printing needs were given the highest priority when we \nwere under tight deadlines. Larry also helped in preparing the binding \nof committee prints and reports, in maintaining stationery and paper \nsupplies, and in responding to numerous and varied requests for \ncommittee publications.\n  Larry and his wife, Norma will now begin a ``second career'' as they \nmove to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina where Larry may try his hand in \nreal estate. On behalf of my colleagues and the committee staff, I wish \nyou and your family good health and best wishes in your retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4827-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4827-S4828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       REMEMBERING GRACIA AND MARTIN BURNHAM ON MEMORIAL DAY 2002\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, for millions of Americans, this Memorial \nDay will be a day of reflection and remembrance with family and friends \nin honor of the brave men and women in uniform who have sacrificed to \ndefend our freedom. Sadly, for Gracia and Martin, May 27, 2002 will \nmark the 1-year anniversary of the day they were taken hostage in the \nPhillippines by a band of brutal terrorists.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues who are not familiar with the \nBurnham's plight, I will briefly recount their tragic tale. Martin and \nGracia Burnham of Wichita, Kansas, are missionaries for New Tribes \nMission, a U.S. based organization that builds churches among tribal \npeople who currently have no access to the gospel. Martin and Gracia \nhave lived in the Philippines since they joined New Tribes in 1986. \nMartin worked as a mission pilot, transporting medical supplies, \npassengers and mail around the island nation. Gracia worked as an \neducator and cared for their three children--Jeff, Mindy and Zack.\n  On May 27, 2001, Martin and Gracia were celebrating their 18th \nWedding anniversary at a resort area in the Phillippines when they and \n18 other guests were taken hostage by a Muslim extremist group known as \nAbu Sayyaf. Since that time, 15 of the original hostages have been \nfreed or allowed to escape. Three others, including California resident \nGuillermo Sobero, have been killed. Today, the Burnhams and Ediborah \nYap, a Filipino nurse, are the only hostages that remain in captivity.\n  Since their captors are being pursued by Philippine authorities, the \nBurnhams live on the run in jungle camps and struggle to survive on a \npoor and unpredictable diet. To avoid detection, they endure long \nmarches over rough terrain and frantic escapes from gun battles between \ntheir captors and government soldiers.\n  I have taken a special interest in this case because Gracia Burnhams \nparents, Betty Jo and Norvin Jones, live in Cherokee Village, Arkansas. \nUnderstandably, Mr. and Mrs. Jones are very worried about their \ndaughter and son-in-law's physical health and safety. Both Martin and \nGracia have lost considerable weight. During the most recent film \nfootage of the Burnhams taken last November, they both looked pale, \nundernourished and weak. Even more troubling are unconfirmed reports \nthis week that Martin's health has deteriorated so badly that he must \nbe transported on a stretcher.\n  Unfortunately, it has been several months since we have heard from or \nseen footage of Martin or Gracia. The most recent proof of life came in \nletters from Martin and Gracia sent in January. Even though there have \nbeen signals in recent months that an agreement to release Gracia and \nMartin was close at hand, the leader of Abu Sayyaf\n\n[[Page S4828]]\n\nrecently indicated they are no longer interested in negotiating for \ntheir freedom.\n  It is important to note, that Abu Sayyaf is a Muslim-separatist \norganization with admitted ties to al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. Their \ngoal is to establish an independent homeland under Islamic rule in the \nsouthern Philippines. Unfortunately, Abu Sayyaf has used kidnaping \nbefore to further their cause. In 2000, the group reportedly received \nmillions in ransom in exchange for the release of 21 tourists kidnaped \nin Malaysia.\n  The U.S. Government has responded to this tragedy by sending a \nsizeable contingent of U.S. troops to the Phillippines to help train \nPhilippine soldiers who are pursuing the Abu Sayyaf rebels. In fact, \nthe Philippine deployment is the second-largest military operation in \nthe U.S. war on terrorism. Unfortunately, U.S. soldiers who are well \ntrained in hostage rescue missions have not been permitted to actively \npursue Martin and Gracia's captors to win their release.\n  Today, I want to thank the Philippine government for its cooperation \nin the war on terrorism and their efforts to free the Burnhams. \nHowever, I believe more can be done and so I call on Philippine \nauthorities to make every possible effort to free Martin and Gracia \nfrom their brutal captivity, including allowing US troops to actively \nparticipate in their rescue. I also call on our own government to \nincrease pressure on Philippine authorities to help us achieve our \ncommon goals in the fight against terrorism. I fear that time may be \nrunning out for Martin and Gracia and we shouldn't let the 1-year \nanniversary of their capture pass by without renewing our efforts to \nuse every tool we have available to save their lives.\n  So, as we pause on Monday to honor members of the Armed Forces who \ngave their lives in defense of freedom--including 10 American \nservicemen who died in a helicopter crash in the Philippines in \nFebruary--we should take great pride in our Nation and its commitment \nto preserve peace and security at home and abroad. We should also be \naware that the plight of the Burnham's is a sad reminder that our fight \nfor freedom continues today. I can think of no greater tribute to honor \nour brave soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice, than winning \nfreedom for Martin and Gracia Burnham and defeating their captors who \nseek to destroy the values we cherish as Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4828-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EAST TIMOR\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this week, East Timor became the first \nnew nation of the 21st century.\n  This breathtaking milestone is the culmination of a long and violent \nroad to independence for the East Timorese people. Portugal ruled East \nTimor for over 400 years before pulling out in August 1975. East Timor \nwas independent for just four months before it was invaded by Indonesia \nin December that year. The U.N. General Assembly and Security Council \nstrongly condemned the invasion and never recognized Indonesian \nsovereignty over East Timor.\n  After two decades of unrest, former Indonesian President B.J. Habibie \nfinally agreed to a referendum in January 1999. In August that year, \nthe people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence \nfrom Indonesia, and they did so at great personal risk. Before, during, \nand after the vote, the Indonesian military and anti-independence \nmilitia groups killed more than a thousand people and displaced \nthousands more, hoping to intimidate the independence movement.\n  Although the militias succeeded in destroying seventy percent of East \nTimor's infrastructure, they failed to derail East Timor's desire for \nfreedom. Ninety-eight percent of the Timorese population turned out to \nvote on Election Day. The people of East Timor subsequently elected a \nConstitutional Assembly and, on April 14, 2002, they elected Xanana \nGusmao as their first President.\n  As East Timor at long last takes its rightful place in the \ninternational family of nations, it is a time of great hopes. But it is \nalso a time of great challenges. East Timor is rebuilding itself from \nashes following 24 years of Indonesian rule, and her people have \nsubstantial economic needs. According to the United Nations Development \nProgram, East Timor is the poorest country in Asia and one of the 20 \npoorest nations in the world. Almost half of East Timor's population \nlives on less than 55 cents a day and nearly 60 percent are illiterate. \nThe unemployment rate is 80 percent.\n  The most pressing needs are the problems of poverty and economic \ngrowth and the building of solid democratic institutions that can deal \nwith the challenges East Timor will face. Our country must show the \nEast Timorese that we will support the efforts of the world's newest \ndemocracy. It is a unique opportunity to do it correctly from the \nstart.\n  America's embassy in Dili is up and running, but it is being run by a \nCharge d'Affairs. To show maximum support and ensure that our \ncommitment to assisting East Timor is strong, an Ambassador to East \nTimor should be nominated immediately.\n  The Peace Corps Director is already based in Dili, and the first \ngroup of volunteers should be in East Timor in June. To ensure that the \nPeace Corps will succeed in providing appropriate health and education \nassistance, we must ensure that the Peace Corps in East Timor receive \nthe financial resources it needs.\n  Our Nation can also assist East Timor on the road to economic \ndevelopment by promoting trade in promising industries. The \nadministration should introduce the tools and programs to facilitate \ntrade and investment in East Timor--such as the Generalized System of \nPreferences--soon.\n  East Timor is also developing its armed forces. Australia and \nPortugal are leading the effort in providing training for the new \nmilitary. The U.S. and other regional countries are providing some \ntechnical assistance. To help professionalize the army and promote \nhuman rights, the United States should provide excess defense materials \nand international military education and training. Additionally, \nAmerica should keep our peacekeepers in the international force in East \nTimor until the UN determines that its mission is complete. The U.S. \nshould also maintain the humanitarian assistance through the U.S. Group \nin East Timor, USGET, with regularly scheduled ship visits that have \nplayed a vital role in rebuilding schools and orphanages and providing \nbasic health care.\n  Finally, the United States must reiterate its interest in ensuring \nthat members of the Indonesian military are held accountable for the \n1999 atrocities in East Timor. The East Timorese need to know not only \nthat their concerns have been heard, but also that the United States is \ncommitted to upholding high standards of democracy and justice.\n  The people of East Timor have chosen democracy. This is an important \nopportunity for the United States to ensure that the East Timorese \npeople are part of one of the world's great success stories. We have \nseen the risks of failed states in places like Afghanistan and Somalia. \nFailure in East Timor cannot be an option.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4828-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4828-S4829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STEENS MOUNTAIN RUNNING CAMP\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, in the 106th Congress, we were \nthe sponsors of the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and \nProtection Act of 2000, a landmark piece of legislation to enhance the \nprotection of the Steens Mountain area in southern Oregon, while \npreserving the historic ranching and recreational opportunities in the \narea. It took us over 1 year to negotiate out the provisions of this \nbill between Members of Congress, the Secretary of the Interior, the \nGovernor of Oregon, the local ranching community, local outfitters, and \nenvironmental organizations.\n  It was clear at the time that we were trying to create a new, \ninnovative approach to cooperative management of the area between the \nfederal government and the local landowners. We believed that \nOregonians, as leaders in environmental stewardship, could craft a new, \nlocally supported approach that did not attempt to impose on this \nmanagement area an existing land management classification. That is why \nthe area is called the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and \nProtection Area. We also created a Steens Mountain Advisory Council, a \ndiverse group\n\n[[Page S4829]]\n\nof stakeholders who are to provide ongoing input concerning the \nmanagement of the area to the Bureau of Land Management.\n  I am becoming increasingly concerned, however, about efforts to harm \nthe operations of the Steens Mountain Running Camp, an excellent \nfacility that has trained thousands of runners and has operated on the \nmountain for the past quarter century. I am concerned that the \noperations of the camp are trying to be harmed by those who have a more \nrestrictive reading of the implementation of the Steens Mt. Protection \nAct than we intended. It was clearly congressional intent that historic \nuses of the mountain be allowed to continue under this Act. In fact, \none of the objectives of the Area, as identified in the statute, is \n``to promote grazing, recreation, historic and other uses that are \nsustainable.'' Isn't that your understanding?\n  Mr. WYDEN. That is certainly my understanding, and I agree with you \nthat it was clearly our intent that the running camp be able to \ncontinue its historic operations on the mountain under this Act. In \nfact, the House report language states that the Act ``is intended to \nenhance statutory protections for the area while maintaining the \nviability of historic ranching and recreational operations in the \nSteens Mountain area.'' The real tragedy of this situation is that the \nrunning camp conducts most of its operations on the mountain on private \nlands, and is only in the wilderness areas on the mountain for two \neight-hour periods the entire year. Most of the environmental \norganizations in Oregon support the running camp and the unique \nexperience it offers to high school athletes. It would be a shame if \nthese young runners were denied this experience because of the extreme \nsolitude guidelines that a select few are trying to impose on the area, \nbecause I believe that these young people know and appreciate the \necological values of the wilderness that they are using.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I am committed to a resolution of this situation \nthat enables the Steens Mountain running camp to continue its historic \noperations on the mountain.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I share that commitment, and I look forward to working \nwith you and the Bureau of Land Management to ensure that congressional \nintent is following on this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4829-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EDWIN COLODNY: A VERMONT LEADER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished Vermonter, and my friend, Edwin Colodny. Ed Colodny spent \nthe early years of his life growing up in Burlington, VT. After \ngraduating from Burlington High School, Ed Colodny entered public \nservice as a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army serving with the Office \nof the Judge Advocate General. Ed's next career step brought him to the \nbusiness world where he joined U.S. Airways. During his 35-year career \nwith the company, Ed rose through the ranks to become President and \nChief Executive Officer. U.S. Airways grew from a small regional \ncarrier to a major national airline with $6.5 billion in revenues \nduring his tenure--no doubt due in great part to his tremendous \nleadership.\n  The University of Vermont is Vermont's largest public institution of \nhigher education. The school is one of the oldest in our nation, \nfounded by Ira Allen, the younger brother of the leader of the Green \nMountain Boys, Ethan Allen. Throughout its more than 200-year history, \nUVM has played an important role in the lives of many Vermonters.\n  Over the past decade, a number of different people have occupied the \nUVM President's Office. This leadership turnover has led to some \nchallenges for the school. Last February, UVM faced a particularly \ndifficult time when its sitting President resigned in the middle of the \nacademic year. The school was in the midst of implementing major \nprogram reforms and budget cuts as part of a strategic plan that had \nbeen adopted by the Board of Trustees; the faculty were organizing a \nunion; and, ongoing student housing issues created some tension between \nthe University and the local Burlington community. The prospect of a \nleadership void at such a tumultuous time, while a lengthy search for a \nnew President was underway, posed a daunting challenge for the school \nand its leaders.\n  It was in that time of need that Ed Colodny agreed to give up his \nwork in private legal practice and move back to Vermont with his wife \nNancy to serve as UVM's Interim President. We are all extremely \ngrateful to them for making that sacrifice. Ed has skillfully guided \nthe University through a difficult time, while continuing to implement \nimportant policies and reforms that will provide a strong and valuable \nfoundation for the incoming President. The Board of Trustees recently \nappointed Dr. Daniel Fogel to become UVM's new President and he will be \nformally taking over the post in July. Thanks to Ed's hard work and \nstrong vision over the past year, as well as that of his entire \nleadership team, Dr. Fogel will be welcomed by a stable university that \nis prime for a promising future.\n  In Ed's short time as President of UVM, he never lost focus of what \nUVM and all higher education institutions must be about--academic \nexcellence. Last fall, to celebrate the University's 210th year, Ed \nrevived the longstanding but dormant tradition of holding an Opening \nConvocation ceremony. This was a special opportunity for the UVM \ncommunity to kick off a new academic year together, and to reaffirm its \ncentral mission of providing a high quality education to students in \nthe Green Mountains of Vermont. Ed recognized people's desire to have \nan opportunity to come together and celebrate the pride they hold for \ntheir school and all that it has to offer.\n  As Ed said when announcing the revival of this tradition, ``The \nconvocation is an opportunity for us to come together as a university \ncommunity and reaffirm our commitment to the academic ideals we \ntreasure deeply.'' Those words symbolize so much of what Ed has offered \nUVM over the past year. He has reminded us of the potential power and \nsuccess that the UVM community possesses when it comes together. He has \nreminded us of the need to be committed to academic ideals. And, \nthrough his leadership in a time of need, Ed has reminded us of the \npowerful role just one person can play in the lives of so many others.\n  On behalf of myself, and all Vermonters, I thank my good friend Ed \nColodny for his leadership, his commitment to higher education, and his \nservice and dedication to UVM and the State of Vermont. Marcelle and I \nknow we are all better off as a result of Ed and Nancy Colodny's time \nrevisiting Burlington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4829-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE D.

Mr. President, today I wish to address some of the issues \nraised by the White House's revelations last week that President Bush \nhad been briefed on August 6 on Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and \non plans by al-Qaida to hijack airplanes.\n  I understand that there was no advance knowledge that al-Qaida was \nplanning to hijack airplanes and fly them into the World Trade Center \nor the Pentagon. I understand that there was no advance warning that \nthis was to take place on September 11.\n  I believe the President when he states that had he known that the \nWorld Trade Center and the Pentagon\n\n[[Page S4830]]\n\nwere going to be attacked on September 11 by hijacked planes, he would \nhave taken immediate action. Likewise, I believe none of my Democratic \ncolleagues have suggested otherwise. I am certain that the President \nwould have acted swiftly and effectively to prevent those attacks. In \nretrospect there are numerous actions which I am certain both the \nadministration and the Congress wished we had taken when the Director \nof Central Intelligence first warned the President about terrorist \nattacks in the United States. An inquiry into what was done and what \nwent wrong are legitimate questions which should be answered by the \nadministration, and I hope will be.\n  But rather than concentrating on the past, I would like to focus my \nremarks on what now needs to be done to prevent future attacks. I do \nnot agree with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's recent conclusion that it \nis inevitable that terrorists will gain access to weapons of mass \ndestruction and will use them. Our policy should be designed to deter \nterrorists from obtaining weapons of mass destruction in the first \nplace. If we have the right strategy and implement it effectively, then \nthe eventuality Secretary Rumsfeld assumes will not take place.\n  The administration is demanding that all agencies and departments \nproduce performance plans and strategies to ensure that they are \nmeeting their missions and using their budgets effectively. The \nCongress should be allowed to ask if the administration is managing \nhomeland security effectively and meeting its mission. Three factors \nthat can be used in judging success are transparency, public benefit, \nand leadership.\n  Transparency refers to how the administration communicates with the \npublic and policymakers. Is the administration sharing information \neffectively? Is the information easily found and understandable? The \nconfusion surrounding the anthrax exposures and the spate of recent \nterrorist warnings indicate that it is failing.\n  Public benefit refers to how clearly the administration establishes \nthe cause and effect relationship between its actions and the general \ngood. Do people feel safer in the aftermath of the administration's \nefforts? Is it clear that the administration's actions will result in a \nsafer and more secure society? Vice President Cheney's remarks on \nSunday that the question is ``when'' not ``if'' a terrorist will attack \nthe United States suggests that the administration has not met its most \nbasic mission of homeland security and the war on terrorism.\n  Leadership is a broad term. Partly, it refers to using past and \ncurrent information for future decisions. Leadership also refers to \nadmitting when mistakes were made and identifying where failures \noccurred. Have we learned from past mistakes and are the lessons being \nused? Do the administration's actions inspire confidence in their \nability to enhance our lives?\n  The administration is right when it suggests that the Congress \nreceived many of the same warnings that it did in the months leading up \nto September 11. But it is the White House and executive branch \nagencies which have the responsibility and the capability of ensuring \nan adequate response to those warnings. One of the first hearings I \nheld after becoming chairman of the International Security, \nProliferation, and Federal Services Subcommittee of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee was a hearing on July 23, 2001, on ``FEMA's Role in \nManaging a Bioterrorist Attack and the Impact of Public Health Concerns \non Bioterrorism Preparedness.'' Since that hearing, we have come some \ndistance in improving our capability but we still have a long way to \ngo.\n  For example, the administration needs to implement a long-term \nhomeland security strategy that matches the threats we face. The Office \nof Homeland Security is still a work in progress. When my colleagues \nsuggest that the head of that office should be Senate confirmable, they \nare right.\n  Governor Ridge is well-meaning but lacks the authority or the \ninstruments to effect sufficient coordination and implementation by a \ndiverse set of Federal agencies all charged with overseeing different \naspects of homeland security. That is why I support S. 2425, introduced \nby Senator Lieberman, to establish a Department of National Homeland \nSecurity and the National Office for Combating Terrorism. I am pleased \nto note that the Committee on Governmental Affairs reported favorably \nthe bill this week.\n  I call on the administration to do the following: Carefully evaluate \nhow agencies are structured to respond to terrorism. Eliminate \nfragmentation to achieve cohesive government operations. Reorganization \nalone will not fix communication problems.\n  Ensure that Federal agencies have the information they need and know \nwhat to do to protect against terrorism. Government organizations must \nhave the proper internal structure and resources to identify, share, \nand act upon information swiftly.\n  Direct Federal agencies on what a ``high state of alert'' means and \nwhat agencies need to do to respond. Organizations lose the ability to \nrespond if the agencies remain on a prolonged state of high alert. \nThere needs to be clearer communication of a relatively lower state of \nalert so that agencies can respond more effectively. Agencies need to \nhave accurate information so that they may ``stand down'' in periods of \nrelative calm.\n  The administration needs to clarify the proper role of the military \nin homeland defense responses before a massive attack requires its \nextensive involvement.\n  Federal agencies should know what ``success'' means and have an idea \nof what the agencies need to accomplish to make progress.\n  The most effective way to respond to terrorist attacks is to prevent \nthem from happening. The only way to do this is through intelligence \nand coordination. This was the real failure prior to 9-11 and it \ncontinues to be a problem today. Communication and intelligence sharing \nbetween Federal law enforcement and the intelligence community are \ndysfunctional. Local and State leaders are crying out for some way to \nshare information and intelligence.\n  These are enormous challenges but these are critical times. I fear \nthe atmosphere in Washington is still one of ``business-as-usual,'' and \nI am concerned that the administration is reluctant to make the changes \nwhich are needed in as timely fashion as is required if we are going to \nbe better prepared for the ``perhaps more devastating attack'' which \nVice President Cheney predicted would next come, or if we are going to \navoid the type of attack by a terrorist with a weapon of mass \ndestruction as imagined by Secretary Rumsfeld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4830-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4830-S4831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   POW/MIA MEMORIAL FLAG ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as we approach Memorial Day I would like \nto begin my statement today describing a powerful and emotional sight \nthat moves up to the core of our faith and beliefs about America and \nabout those who served in the Armed Forces of our Nation.\n  Many of us have visited one or more of the military academies that \ntrain America's future military leaders. These academies have varied \nmissions and yet all of them share in the critical task of developing \nleaders for their particular branch of service. On the grounds of each \nacademy is a chapel, spectacular places that are easily identifiable as \nplaces of worship.\n  In each chapel, a place has been reserved for those Prisoners of War \nand the Missing in Action from each particular service. A pew has been \nset aside and marked by a candle, a powerful symbol that not all have \nreturned from battle. These hallowed places have been set aside so that \nall POW's and MIA's are remembered with dignity and honor. It is a \nmoving and emotional experience to pause at these reserved pews, to be \nencouraged by the burning candle, to recall the valor and sacrifice of \nthose soldiers, sailors, marines, and pilots and to be inspired today \nby what they have done.\n  Yet, I believe we can and should do more to honor the memory of all \nthe POW's and MIA's who have so gallanty served our nation.\n  On August 10, 1990, the 101st Congress passed P.L. 101-355 which \nofficially recognized the POW/MIA flag. Displaying this flag is a \npowerful symbol to all Americans that we have not forgotten, and will \nnot forget.\n  Last September, I introduced S. 1226, the ``POW/MIA Memorial Flag Act \nof 2001.'' This act would require the display of the POW/MIA flag at \nthe World\n\n[[Page S4831]]\n\nWar II Memorial, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial, on any day on which the United States flag is \ndisplayed.\n  As my colleagues well know, the United States has fought in mnay \nwars, and thousands of Americans who served in those wars were captured \nby the enemy or listed as missing in action. In the 20th century alone, \nmore than 147,000 Americans were captured and became prisoners of war; \nof that number more than 15,000 died while in captivity. When we add to \nthe number those who are still missing in action, we realize that more \ncan be done to honor their commitment to duty, honor, and country.\n  The display of the POW/MIA flag would be a forceful reminder that we \ncare not only for them, but also for their families who personally \ncarry with them the burden of sacrifice. We want them to know that they \ndo not stand alone, that we stand with them and beside them, as they \nremember the loyalty and devotion of those who served.\n  As a veteran who served in Korea, I personally know that the \nremembrance of another's sacrifice in battle is one of the highest and \nmost noble acts we can do. Let us now demonstrate our indebtedness and \ngratitude for those who served that we might live in freedom.\n  Just as those special reserved pews in the chapels of the military \nacademies recall the spirit and presence of our POW's and MIA's, so too \nwill the display of their flag over the World War II Memorial, the \nKorean War Veterans Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial be a \nspecial reminder that we have not forgotten, and will not forget.\n  I invite my Senate colleagues to please join me in passing this \nimportant bill S. 1226, to ensure our POW/MIAs are not forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4831-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN PRAISE OF FOSTER PARENTS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today we celebrate May as National Foster \nCare Month, and in Idaho, Foster Care Appreciation Month. Although this \nmonth is almost over, the need for foster care remains critical. I \nwould like to take a moment today to talk about the important role that \nfoster parents play in maintaining the safety and welfare of some of \nour most vulnerable citizens.\n  According to the Administration of Children and Families within the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there are an estimated \n565,000 children in foster care across this nation. In Idaho, 1,276 \nchildren in need have been given temporary refuge in foster homes. \nThere are 470 licensed foster homes available in Idaho to provide a \nfamily setting for children who have lost their parents, or whose \nparents, for whatever reasons, can no longer provide appropriate care. \nFoster care is intended to be temporary--until a child can be returned \nsafely to his or her parents, or, if that is impossible, placed in a \npermanent, loving adoptive home.\n  Many foster parents take an active role working with the child's \nfamily to help them become safely reunited, or end up adopting the \nchild themselves. One such foster couple is Manual and Catalina Godina \nof Parma. The Godinas have been foster parents since 1999, caring for \nnearly 20 children of all ages. After her five biological children grew \nup and married, Catalina spent her days babysitting grandchildren. She \nheard a foster care recruitment announcement on the radio and told \nManuel she wanted to get involved. She then applied to see if they \ncould qualify and, fortunately, they did.\n  Catalina has seen first hand the need for foster care when her infant \nnephew was removed from a drug-abusive home to be placed in his \ngrandmother's care. She wanted to do something to help kids, so she \nopened up the Godina home to them. Catalina knows many kids who come \nthrough the system are mistreated, and she's trying to do her part to \nbring some joy into their lives. ``They need some love, caring and a \nlot of attention,'' she says.\n  Manual and Catalina have hosted children for as little as 2 weeks, \nbut currently their foster family includes a teenager who has lived \nwith them for 3 years. On May 9, the Godinas adopted 3-year old Dimber, \na beautiful boy who's been in their lives since he was 9 days old. They \nfell in love with Dimber, and when he became available for adoption, \nthe Godinas applied, ensuring him a permanent, loving home.\n  There are many more foster families who mirror the compassion and \nlove expressed by the Godinas. Sadly, however, there are far more \nchildren needing temporary refuge than there are Godinas or other \nfoster families who can care for them. The purpose of National Foster \nCare Month has been to raise awareness of these issues and invite \ncaring adults across the Nation to consider helping a child in need by \nbecoming a foster parent. I salute all foster families and urge my \ncolleagues to continue spreading this message in their home States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4831-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4831-S4832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                INVESTIGATING THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to oppose the \nformation of a new commission to investigate the events of September \n11, 2001. The suggestion has been made that such a commission should be \nmodeled after the commission which investigated Pearl Harbor and the \ncommission which investigated the assassination of President Kennedy.\n  Having been assistant counsel to the Warren Commission investigating \nthe assassination of President Kennedy, I have some background in the \nway the commission was organized. I can say, with that experience, that \nit would take a very long process to form a new commission. The Warren \nCommission was compelled to go out and hire staff. They hired lawyers \nfrom around the country--mostly young lawyers, like myself, back in \n1964. The difficulty to obtain investigators was a very paramount one. \nThey had to turn to the FBI, something which could not be done on an \ninvestigation of September 11 because the FBI itself is under scrutiny.\n  It is my view that it is important that we proceed on an expedited \nbasis to have the appropriate oversight. We now know, with the \nrevelation of the Phoenix memorandum, that on July 10, 2001, there was \nsome substantial cause to be concerned about an attack by Osama bin \nLaden from the air. We know from the information available back in \n1996, from the Pakistani terrorist Abdul Hakim Murad, who had \nconnections with al-Qaida, that at that time there were plans to fly a \nplane into the CIA headquarters or other tall buildings. We know that \nwith the arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui, on August 17, 2001, that it was \nnot really a matter of putting the dots together.\n  However, as Senator Graham, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, pointed out recently:\n\n       I believe that if all the information that was known about \n     the plans of Osama bin Laden, to train persons in the United \n     States in aviation and understand the way in which the \n     commercial aviation system in the United States operated--had \n     all those been available to one set of analysts, it is \n     possible that they could have put those pieces together.\n\n  Senator Graham went on to point out that:\n\n       . . . handled differently, it might have been a different \n     outcome.\n\n  From my own experience as chairman of the Intelligence Committee in \nthe 104th Congress, and from chairing the Judiciary subcommittee on \nDepartment of Justice Oversight, there is experience in those oversight \ncommittees which cannot be duplicated by a commission.\n  We have had on the Judiciary Committee, which does have oversight \nresponsibility on the FBI on reorganization, the grave difficulties of \ngetting information from the FBI. We know their procedures. What is \nevolving, in rather short order here, is a showing that it is really \nnot a matter of putting together the dots, but just a matter of knowing \nwhat information was in the files, because of the variety of warnings \nabout bin Laden, hijackings of commercial airliners, and flying into \ntall buildings.\n  This ought to be handled on an expedited basis. There is considerable \nexperience in the Intelligence Committee and in the Judiciary Committee \nwith experienced attorneys, former prosecutors, and investigators. It \nwould be a major mistake to be diverted to a commission on the analogy \nof the Warren Commission or the Pearl Harbor Commission. I say that \nespecially as to the Warren Commission where I saw personally the grave \ndifficulties of getting organized.\n\n[[Page S4832]]\n\n  The Intelligence Committee has primary jurisdiction over the events \nof September 11. There is some authority and oversight by the Judiciary \nCommittee, as we had hearings recently with FBI Director Mueller on \nreorganization and as we have had closed-door sessions. However, as \nmore of this information is coming out, it is apparent that there is a \nneed for oversight and for some direction to be sure that these \nfailures do not repeat themselves. With the imminent possibility of \nanother terrorist attack--as the President, the Secretary of Defense, \nand the FBI Director have said that there is an inevitability of \nanother attack--the experience and institutional knowledge of the \nIntelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee ought to be used to \noversee the FBI and CIA so that we can take action to stop another \nattack.\n  I thank my colleague from North Dakota for permitting me to speak. I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4832-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred June 19, 2001 \nin Medford, OR. A Hispanic man was assaulted by a man who yelled \n``white power''. The assailant, Keith A. Hollensbe, 20, was charged \nwith third-degree assault and first-degree intimidation in connection \nwith the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4832-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week many of our Nation's police \nofficers joined together in Washington, DC to celebrate National Police \nWeek. It began Monday, May 13 with a candlelight vigil at the National \nLaw Enforcement Officers Memorial. The week-long tribute to our \nNation's Federal, State and local police officers honors those who died \nin the line of duty and those who continue to serve and protect us \neveryday at great personal risk.\n  According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, in \n2001 there were 230 police officers killed in the line of duty. While \nmany of the officers who were killed in the line of duty over the past \nyear died as a result of the tragic events of September 11, there were \nmany other officers who died because of gun violence. Of the 230 police \nofficers killed in the line of duty last year, 68 were killed by a \nfirearm.\n  To help stem the tide of gun violence, Senator Reed introduced the \nGun Show Background Check Act. I cosponsored that bill because I \nbelieve it is an important tool to help to prevent guns from getting \ninto the hands of criminals. This bill simply applies existing law \ngoverning background checks to persons buying guns at gun shows. It is \nsupported by a variety of law enforcement organizations including the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, Major Cities Chiefs of \nPolice, National Black Police Association, Police Foundation and \nNational Troopers Coalition. We should stand with our Nation's law \nenforcement community and take this common sense step to reduce gun \nviolence.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of gun safety \nlegislation. This is one step we can take to try to make sure guns do \nnot get into the hands of criminals and others prohibited by law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4832-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ROBERT J. DOLE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL AND REGIONAL \n                             OFFICE CENTER\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Senator Bob Dole \nand to thank you for your support of H.R. 4608, naming the Department \nof Veterans Affairs medical and regional office center in Wichita, KS, \nas the Robert J. Dole Department of Veterans Affairs Medical and \nRegional Office Center.\n  In the words of Senator Dole, ``Anyone who wants to understand me \nmust first understand Russell, KS. It is my home, where my roots lie, \nand a constant source of strength. My father's view of the world as \n``stewers versus doers'' registered early. From my neighbors, I learned \nto feel deeply for God, country and family. In Russell, I came to \nunderstand there are things worth living for, and, if need be, dying \nfor.\n  The Russell of my youth was not a place of wealth. Yet it was \ngenerous with the values that would shape my outlook and the compassion \nthat would restore life's richness after I had begun to doubt my future \nfollowing the war. Ever since, I have tried in my own way to give back \nsome of what the town has given me. I have tried to defend and serve \nthe America I learned to love in Russell.''\n  That quote shows Senator Dole's dedication, passion, and love for \nKansas and the United States. It only begins to vocalize the \nrelationship he has had with the people of Kansas. Although many of my \ncolleagues know and served with Senator Dole, I want to briefly recount \nhis distinguished record of military and public service.\n  Bob Dole's heroism during WWII earned him two purple hearts and the \nBronze Star Medal. While serving our country in the 10th Mountain \nDivision in Italy, he was wounded trying to save a downed radioman. \nInjured badly and left for dead, Bob Dole survived nine long hours on \nthat battle field paralyzed from the neck down and with a shattered \nshoulder. After spending time in a field hospital, he was transported \nback to a military hospital in the United States where he underwent \nnine surgeries over 3 years. It is a testament to Bob Dole's strength \nand character that he has overcome unbelievable obstacles.\n  As a, Russell County Attorney, Kansas State Legislator, U.S. \nCongressman, Senator, longest serving Senate Majority Leader and \ncandidate for president, Bob Dole has tirelessly served the people of \nKansas and this country. As a statesman, Senator Dole was always \navailable. He listened and learned from Kansans whose concerns were as \ndiverse as Kansas itself, economic development needs of our State's \nurban areas, support for disabled Americans, assistance for \nagricultural producers, and benefits for our veterans.\n  After leaving elected office, Bob Dole has kept giving of himself. In \n1997, he agreed to serve as chair for the National World War II \nMemorial. He has since raised awareness and money to build a national \nmonument in support of those who fought for our country during WWII.\n  Republicans, Democrats, politicians, farmers, veterans, and business \nowners know and respect the extraordinary statesman from Russell, KS, \nwho still to this day has the receipts from the people of his hometown \nwho helped pay for his medical bills after the war. He is a man of \nhumility, leadership, courage, and pride.

Thank you, Mr. President, my discussions with \nMissourians reflect that their predominant concern these days is \nsecurity security from the terrorist threat, and also security in their \npersonal lives. Our seniors are deeply concerned about the price of \nprescription drugs, how to remain living independently in their own \nhomes, and being able to afford their expenses living on a fixed \nincome. May is Older Americans Month, and I want to take this \nopportunity to focus Congress' attention on the work that needs to be \ndone to meet our commitment to seniors. That work includes passing a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, providing seniors with the \nopportunity to live independently in their own communities, and \nincreasing funding for the Older Americans Act.\n  I am a proud member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which \nis charged with overseeing issues of importance to seniors. In my \ncapacity as a member of that Committee, last summer I chaired a hearing \nin Jefferson City, Missouri on the high cost of prescription drugs.\n  I want to share a story with you. At the hearing, a 92-year-old woman \ntold me how ashamed she felt when she had written a check to cover her \nmedication--knowing she did not have the money in the bank to cover it. \nShame on us, I thought Shame . . . on us for allowing such indignities \nto be inflicted upon our senior citizens.\n  It is wrong to force older Americans to choose between rent and food \nand the medications they need to stay healthy. That is why I am urging \nCongress to enact a meaningful, affordable, and universal Medicare \nprescription drug benefit this year. I have also written to the \nChairman of the Senate Budget Committee supporting $750 billion over \nten years for the senior drug benefit. In addition, I am supporting \nlegislation that would lower the price of prescription drugs for all \nAmericans by closing loopholes in current law that allow brand name \ndrugs to keep lower cost generic drugs from entering the market.\n  I believe that it is important for seniors to live independently in \ntheir own homes and communities for as along as possible. That is why I \nfought to secure $1.28 million in last year's appropriations bill to \nestablish a Naturally Occurring Retirement Community (NORC) pilot \nprogram in St. Louis. The funds will support medical care, nutrition \nassistance, social services, and caregiver supports to residents of \nNORCs in St. Louis. This approach will allow seniors to stay in \ncomfortable, less expensive surroundings while maintaining their \nindependence and dignity. Services are cost-effective because seniors \nare living in a centralized area.\n  Finally, I would like to voice my support for increased funding for \nthe Older Americans Act. This Federal program provides critical \nnutrition and support\n\n[[Page S4834]]\n\nservices to seniors across Missouri, as well as across the country. \nEarlier this year, I wrote the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee that oversees this program and requested a 10 percent \nincrease in funding for the Older Americans Act, brining the total \nfunding to $1.319 billion. This support for increased funding also \napplies to the National Family Caregiver Support Program and the Older \nAmericans Act Nutrition Program. I will continue to work hard for this \nincrease because of its importance to seniors.\n  Once again, I want to recognize how vital it is that Congress \ncontinue to keep in mind the needs of our country's seniors as we move \nforward through the legislative process this year. There are many \nissues of importance that still need to be addressed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4834-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            EDUCATION HEROES\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I salute some \neducation heroes in my home state of Oregon. I want to recognize the \nefforts of both the South Coast Interagency Narcotics Team and a group \nof Millicoma Middle School 8th graders from Coos Bay, Oregon.\n  For 3 years, the South Coast Interagency Narcotics Team, SCINT, has \nvisited local middle schools to run their ``Pathfinders'' drug abuse \nprevention program. As part of the Pathfinders program, experts in drug \nabuse prevention visit 6th, 7th, and 8th grade classes for 2 weeks \nevery year to teach our young adults about the dangers of drugs. Not \nonly does the SCINT team teach students about the physical harm drugs \ndo to our bodies, but, perhaps most importantly, they teach students \nabout the effect drugs have on our minds, and about how young adults \ncan make the right choices when it comes to avoiding drug abuse.\n  What makes the Pathfinders program stand out is that just over 1 \nmonth ago we saw the results of that program in action. On April 18, \nwhile on a field trip to our state capitol in Salem, 19 students from \nthe Millicoma Middle School were approached by a drug dealer. Luckily, \nthose 8th grade students were the first in Coos Bay to complete all 3 \nyears of the Pathfinders program, and knew exactly how to respond. The \nstudents just said ``no'', went on to their hotel, and alerted their \nchaperones, which is precisely what they were taught to do.\n  I am extremely proud of these students, and I know their community is \nproud as well. Not only were they recognized by their middle school \npeers, but they will soon be recognized by their new high school as \nwell. Next fall, Marshfield High School will welcome those special 8th \ngraders as freshmen, and will dedicate a new American flag to fly above \nthe high school in their honor. The flag will serve as a reminder to \nall students that strong character coupled with good choices have \nalways served our nation well.\n  The education that takes place in our schools has real world \nconsequences, and it is essential that we take time to salute the \npeople who help our nation's young adults make proper choices in their \nlives. Teachers, administrators, parents, and community members like \nthe South Coast Interagency Narcotics Team are to be commended for \ntheir work, because without their efforts 19 more middle school \nstudents might be experimenting with drugs. Nineteen more middle school \nstudents could very well be dropping out of school or even going to \njail. I want to thank the South Coast Interagency Narcotics Team and \nthe Millicoma Middle School for reminding us once again that our \ncommunities are producing just the kinds of citizens we want leading \nAmerica into the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4834-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TUBBY RAYMOND FIELD\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, late last year, I offered a tribute \nto the legendary University of Delaware football coach, Harold \n``Tubby'' Raymond, on the occasion of his 300th career victory. A few \nshort months later, after 36 years as head football coach and a total \nof 48 years at Delaware, Coach Raymond decided to retire. And now, with \na vote by the Board of Trustees this Tuesday, May 21st, the University \nhas decided to designate the football field as ``Tubby Raymond Field.''\n  Like many Delawareans, present and relocated, I welcomed the \nUniversity's decision with enthusiasm. I am a graduate of the \nUniversity of Delaware. For a while, Tubby was my backfield coach, and \nI am one of many great fans and proud friends of Tubby Raymond. He \ndeserves this honor; as his successor K.C. Keeler, who also played for \nTubby--played more and played better, I might add--said, while looking \nover the Delaware football field, ``the man built this place.''\n  I will resist the temptation to recount again the remarkable success \nof University of Delaware football teams under Tubby Raymond, who ended \nhis head coaching career with a record of 300-119-3, a winning \npercentage of .714.\n  But I would like to share a comment Tubby made, in response to a \nquestion he has been asked countless times in the course of his storied \ncareer. He was asked if he regretted not moving to coach on Sunday or \nat a bigger school, a I-A program, like his alma mater, the University \nof Michigan. Tubby said that he always had everything he wanted at \nDelaware, adding, ``I'm just as proud of the players who have gone on \nto be successful in business and other careers, as I am of those who \nhave gone to the NFL.''\n  As a coach, Tubby Raymond has been a dedicated and very successful \nteacher, and the fact that he will be the speaker at this Saturday's \ncommencement ceremony reflects the respect he has earned in the \nUniversity community, well beyond the Athletic Department.\n  Tubby hasn't been able to leave the coaching completely behind, \nhowever; as he watched them setting up chairs on the football field for \ngraduation, he shook his head with a slight wince, and said, ``They're \ngoing to kill some grass.''\n  The grass will grow back, and Tubby Raymond Field will be in good \nshape for the opening game on August 29th, when the name will become \nofficial. For the first time that many Delawareans can remember, Tubby \nwill not be the coach. He will be the guest of honor, and it is Tubby \nRaymond who has honored us by his dedication as a coach and a teacher, \nhis loyalty to the University of Delaware, his leadership in our \nState--and for those of us who are really lucky, the blessing of his \nfriendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4834-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4834-S4835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TAHLEQUAH STUDENTS RECOGNIZED AS CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on May 4-6, more than 1,200 young \npeople from across the country came to Washington, DC to compete in the \nnational finals of the ``We the People: The Citizen and the \nConstitution'' program funded by the Department of Education and \nadministered by the Center for Civic Education. This program teaches \nstudents to think critically, and to present oral arguments based on an \nin-depth understanding of the history and text of our founding \ndocuments. This is the most extensive education program of its kind, \nreaching more than 26.5 million students in elementary, middle and high \nschools. The competition simulates a congressional hearing whereby \nstudents testify as constitutional experts before a panel of adult \njudges. It is inspiring to see the future leaders of our Nation in \nactive pursuit of the fundamental principles of government.\n  I am pleased that 15 students from Tahlequah High School in \nTahlequah, Oklahoma were among the finalists in this national event. My \ncongratulations go out to Chris Augerhole, J. R. Baker, Chad Blish, \nRyan Cannonie, Taylor Gibson, Carlton Heard, Corbin Heard, Zach Israel, \nDoug Kirk, Helena Loose, Lacie Newman, Tim Pace, Rebecca Walker, Derek \nWhaler, Brandon Zellner, and their teacher Norma Boren.\n  Independent studies by the Educational Testing Service revealed that \nstudents enrolled in this curriculum ``significantly outperformed \ncomparison students on every topic.'' While only 48 percent of 18-30-\nyear-olds voted in the 2000 elections, 82 percent of ``We the People'' \nalumni reported voting in 2000. It is refreshing to see the difference \nthat can be made in the lives of students when they are taught to \ndevelop reasoned commitments to American values.\n  Again, I want to affirm the efforts of Tahlequah High School along \nwith all the students across the country that participate in this study \nof our great Nation. We all know today's youth are tomorrow's leaders. \nThrough their understanding of history, these students\n\n[[Page S4835]]\n\ncan better prepare their generation to face the challenges that lie \nahead.

GEORGE RUPP, PRESIDENT, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. George \nRupp for his distinguished career as the 18th President of Columbia \nUniversity. On June 30, 2002, Dr. Rupp will retire from this position, \nafter a remarkable record of service to New York City and to higher \neducation in America.\n  Dr. Rupp, a New Jersey native, is both a dedicated scholar and \neducator. After graduating from Princeton University with high honors, \nhe received a Bachelor of Divinity degree magna cum laude from Yale and \na Ph.D. in the study of religion from Harvard. He served as the John \nLord O'Brian Professor of Divinity and dean of the Harvard Divinity \nSchool and then as President of Rice University for eight years. In \n1993, Dr. Rupp headed from Texas to New York with a vision, and today \nColumbia University is a stronger, more vibrant institution because of \nhim.\n  Under Dr. Rupp's nine-year tenure, one of the nation's most important \ncenters of intellectualism has flourished. Columbia University will \ncommemorate its 250th anniversary as a model of academic excellence and \ncommunity service. Its core missions of teaching, research and public \nservice have enriched New York City, New York State and our country \nbeyond measure.\n  Dr. Rupp has enhanced the quality of education at Columbia University \nby increasing attention to the importance of teaching; creating, among \nother things, teaching awards for faculty and graduate assistants. He \nhas refocused the University's teaching and research to emphasize \nmultidisciplinary efforts, bringing together scholars from different \ndepartments, schools and even outside institutions. Such efforts have \nled to the establishment of several new centers at Columbia, including \nthe Earth Institute, Columbia Genome Center, Center for Biomedical \nEngineering, International Research Institute for Climate Prediction, \nand Center for New Media Teaching and Learning.\n  Student life on campus has also improved significantly since Dr. Rupp \nbecame President. He has promoted diversity and held the University to \nits promise of need-blind admissions and full-need financial aid at \nColumbia College. He has overseen the addition of women's varsity teams \nin swimming, softball, field hockey, rowing, lacrosse and volleyball, \nproviding women with the same number of sports teams as men. Over the \nlast few years, six new buildings have been constructed and 19 more \nhave been renovated under his direction.\n  Dr. Rupp has also been steadfast in expanding the role of Columbia as \nan engine of high-tech growth and innovation. The recent scientific \nadvances made at the University have been successfully translated into \nscores of valuable technologies which have also led to the development \nof numerous start-up firms in the area. Under Dr. Rupp, the University \nhas established the Audubon Biotechnology and Research Park, the first \nbiomedical research and development park in New York City, a facility \nwhich is a keystone to the future of the biomedical enterprise in the \nregion.\n  In summation, I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to \nPresident George Rupp for his contributions to American higher \neducation, his unfailing commitment to public service, and his \ndedication which has distinguished his career as a scholar and \neducator. I wish Dr. Rupp well in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4835-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4835-S4837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CELEBRATING ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, every year during the month of May, \nour National comes together, in appreciation and celebration of Asian \nAmericans and Pacific Islanders and their unique and varied history and \ncontributions to our country. In fact, this May is the 10th Anniversary \nof the enactment of Public Law 102-450, which officially extended what \nwas known as Asian Pacific American Heritage Week to the entire month \nof May of every year.\n  Although celebration of Asian American and Pacific Islander cultures \nand histories has become a large part of Asian American Pacific \nIslander Heritage Month, this time was designated primarily to focus on \nlearning more about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and their \nhistory. Too few of us know in any great detail the stories of Asian \nAmericans and Pacific Islanders. This is discouraging because Asian \nAmericans and Pacific Islanders are such a vibrant addition to the \nmosaic that is America.\n  For instance, few realize that the first Filipino community in the \nU.S. was established in the Louisiana bayou around 1763. Not many of us \nknow that the Bing cherry, a popular product of the Pacific Northwest, \nwas developed by a Chinese American horticulturist named Ah Bing. And \nin Florida, another Chinese American, named Lue Gim Gong, developed an \norange which was resistant to frost, a boon to the Florida agricultural \nindustry.\n  Hawaii's Duke Kahanamoku was a five-time Olympic medal winner and is \nrecognized internationally as the father of modern surfing. Duke \nKahanamoku holds a unique place in surfing history and his Olympic \nfeats are legendary over 80 years since their achievement.\n  One of the most amazing advances in medicine, organ transplantation, \nexists today largely because of a Japanese American, Dr. Paul Terasaki, \nwho helped develop a test to determine the compatibility of a donated \norgan and its intended recipient.\n  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, have made names for themselves \nin the fields of music, acting, fashion, athletics, academia, medicine, \nscience, literature, cuisine, and many more. Immigrants from Asia and \nthe Pacific have contributed so much to the rich American tapestry. \nGiven their longtime presence here on our shores, there can be no \ndenying that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are an integral part \nof the fabric of America.\n  Aside from being an enriching and valuable addition to America, Asian \nAmerican and Pacific Islanders are also one of the most diverse and \nfastest growing segments of our population. The Asian American and \nPacific Islander community is made up of more than 36 distinct \nsubpopulations with differing cultures, religions, traditions, and \nbeliefs, speaking more than 100 different languages. U.S. Census \nfigures show that the Asian American and Pacific Islander population \ngrew at a rate about five times that of the national rate between 1990 \nand 2000. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders now make up 4.2 percent \nof the U.S. population, around 11.9 million people strong. The Asian \nAmerican and Pacific Islander\n\n[[Page S4836]]\n\npopulation grew by 72 percent in a single decade. While my home state \nof Hawaii is probably most closely identified as having a large Asian \nAmerican and Pacific Islander population, it is interesting to note \nthat in the decade between the last two decennial censuses the Asian \nAmerican and Pacific Islander population in Las Vegas, Nevada, \nincreased 286 percent, in Atlanta, Georgia, there was a 200 percent \nincrease, in Austin/San-Marcos, Texas, an increase of 175 percent, in \nDenver/Boulder/Greeley, Colorado a 115 percent increase, and in \nDetroit/Ann Arbor/Flint, Michigan, a 111 percent increase. Hopefully \nthese figures will begin to dispel the notion that Asian American and \nPacific Islander growth is strictly a West Coast or Eastern Seaboard \nphenomenon.\n\n  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are also key players in our \nnation's fight against terrorism and efforts to improve homeland \nsecurity. For instance, my good friend and former colleague, Secretary \nof transportation Norman Y. Mineta, is working to keep our nation's \nroads and skies safe. His life story is truly amazing. Interned as a \nyoung boy during World War II by his own government, he grew up to be a \npublic servant who has devoted his life to public service on behalf of \nour country. From his days as a local California politician, to his \nservice in the U.S. House of Representatives, his formation of the \nAsian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies, his \nChairmanship of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and \nPacific Islanders, his tenure as Secretary of Commerce, and now as \nSecretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta has broken down barriers and \nserved his constituents and our nation with integrity and distinction.\n  As Chief of Staff, United States Army, General Eric K. Shinseki has \ndistinguished himself as a leader of outstanding courage and impeccable \nintegrity. The people of Hawaii are immensely proud of Ric Shinseki, a \nson of Kauai who has risen to the top post in the Army. Considered an \nenemy alien at birth, he is the first Asian American to wear four \nstars. General Shinseki's illustrious career speaks to his commitment \nand valor and represents the promise and greatness of America. In every \nway, General Shinseki exemplifies what is best about our nation and the \nmen and women sworn to defend it.\n  I have mentioned some of the little known, yet positive, history of \nAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders, but before I conclude my remarks \ntoday, I want to highlight some less positive history, which is also \nlittle known. Our Nation has not always welcomed Asians and Pacific \nIslanders with open arms and sadly the treatment many immigrant groups \nreceived was truly shameful. I am speaking of events such as the \ninternment of nearly 120,000 aliens and Americans of Japanese ancestry \nvia Executive Order 9066 during World War II; the Immigration Act of \n1924 which led to an almost complete halt of immigration from Asia; the \nexclusion of the Chinese laborers who built the transcontinental \nrailroad from the famous photo of the driving of the golden spike at \nPromontory Point, ``whitewashing'' history of their important \ncontribution; and the Chinese Exclusion Act, first enacted in 1882 and \nnot repealed until 1943. Most recently, of course, we have the \nunfortunate acts of xenophobic and anti-Muslim violence perpetrated in \nthe days and weeks after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on \nour Nation where many of the victims were actually Asian Americans.\n\n  Regrettably, ignorance and prejudice continue to adversely impact \nAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders as they go about their daily \nlives. Last year, Representative David Wu from Oregon was denied entry \nto the Department of Energy on official business solely because of his \nnational origin. Hawaii's Governor, Ben Cayetano, a Filipino America, \nwas recently asked for his passport when checking into a hotel in \nNevada. These high profile incidents underscore the indignities, \ninsults, and discrimination that Americans of Asian or Pacific Islander \ndescent encounter on a daily basis because some people feel they do not \n``look American.''\n  There is an adage that says, ``Experience is a hard teacher because \nshe gives the test first, the lessons afterwards.'' My hope, as the \n2002 Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month comes to close, is \nthat we, as a Nation, having been through these tests, have truly \nlearned a lesson. The theme of this year's Asian American Pacific \nIslander Heritage Month is Unity in Freedom. The simplicity of this \ntheme belies its profoundness. Only by having the freedom to celebrate \nour individual diversity can we truly come together as one Nation. If \nyou go through your pockets or purses and take out any coin minted in \nthe United States, you will see the motto: ``E Pluribus Unum''--from \nmany, one. This motto first appeared on our coinage back in 1795. I see \n``Unity in Freedom'' as a continuation of our Nation's lengthy and \ngrand tradition of respecting an encouraging individual rights while \nsimultaneously acknowledging that the key to our success as a country \ncomes from our ability to lay our individual differences aside to work \ntogether for a common goal.\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Asian \nPacific American Heritage Month. Every May we acknowledge the many \naccomplishments and profound contributions that people of Asian and \nPacific Island descent have made to New Jersey and to our country. The \ncelebration also affords us the opportunity to recognize the strength \nthe United States draws from its diversity, especially those \ncontributions made by Asian Pacific Americans.\n  The formal recognition of Asian Pacific American Heritage began in \n1979 with a weeklong celebration. In 1992, President George Herbert \nWalker Bush signed Public Law 102-450, devoting the entire month of May \nto acknowledge the history, concerns, and contributions of Asian \nPacific and Americans.\n  Today, Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander lineage total nearly \n11 million people. The Census Bureau projects that the Asian Pacific \nIslander population will grow to nearly nine percent of the American \npopulation by the middle of the century.\n  Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander heritage have been \ninstrumental in the development and sustaining of both the national and \nNew Jersey economies. Figures from the last economic census compiled in \n1997 attribute more than 2.2 million jobs nationwide and over $306 \nbillion dollars to Asian and Pacific Islander-owned businesses. New \nJersey ranks fifth nationwide in the number of firms owned by Asian and \nPacific Islanders with over 41,000 businesses generating sales and \nreceipts totaling over $16.7 billion.\n  Although some Asian Pacific Americans are beginning to enjoy success \nin the United States, Asian immigrants and Asian Americans have met \nroadblocks. From racist Chinese exclusion laws to being unjustly held \nhostage in internment camps, Asian Pacific Americans too often have \nbeen shunned as untrustworthy foreigners, not accepted as ``true \nAmericans'' because of their appearance or their cultural and religious \ntraditions. Unfortunately, racism against Asian American continues \ntoday. Hate crimes perpetrated against Asians and Asian Americans have \nincreased in frequency and intensity in the wake of the terrorist \nattacks against the United States.\n  All Americans should remember that we are a nation of immigrants and \nwe should reaffirm our commitment to diversity, mutual respect and the \nAmerican Dream. We must remember that although people we meet on the \nstreet, schools, stores or even airplanes may be of a different ethnic \nor religious background, they are still our co-workers, neighbors, and \nfellow Americans.\n  I hope you will join me in recognizing the hard work and sacrifices \nmade by Asian immigrants and Asian Americans for our country. \nThroughout our history, Asian immigrants and Asian Americans have \ncontributed to our nation's growth and have fought to protect our \nnation. Today, Asian Americans continue to help make our country great \nthrough contributions as diverse as they different countries of origin. \nI applaud the efforts of Asian immigrants and Asian Americans who \ncontinue to work towards the American dream, and I thank them for their \nmany contributions to our great Nation.\n\n[[Page S4837]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4835-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4835-S4837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CELEBRATING ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, every year during the month of May, \nour National comes together, in appreciation and celebration of Asian \nAmericans and Pacific Islanders and their unique and varied history and \ncontributions to our country. In fact, this May is the 10th Anniversary \nof the enactment of Public Law 102-450, which officially extended what \nwas known as Asian Pacific American Heritage Week to the entire month \nof May of every year.\n  Although celebration of Asian American and Pacific Islander cultures \nand histories has become a large part of Asian American Pacific \nIslander Heritage Month, this time was designated primarily to focus on \nlearning more about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and their \nhistory. Too few of us know in any great detail the stories of Asian \nAmericans and Pacific Islanders. This is discouraging because Asian \nAmericans and Pacific Islanders are such a vibrant addition to the \nmosaic that is America.\n  For instance, few realize that the first Filipino community in the \nU.S. was established in the Louisiana bayou around 1763. Not many of us \nknow that the Bing cherry, a popular product of the Pacific Northwest, \nwas developed by a Chinese American horticulturist named Ah Bing. And \nin Florida, another Chinese American, named Lue Gim Gong, developed an \norange which was resistant to frost, a boon to the Florida agricultural \nindustry.\n  Hawaii's Duke Kahanamoku was a five-time Olympic medal winner and is \nrecognized internationally as the father of modern surfing.

Mr. President, last week I had the privilege of \nattending a dinner honoring six extraordinary Delawareans, three \ncouples who have generously extended the success, spirit and strength \nof their own lives to the immeasurable benefit of our State. They were \nhonored for, what I thought was a wonderful phrase, their \n``transformational leadership'' by the Delaware Region of the National \nConference for Community and Justice, the NCCJ.\n  Lillian and Jack Burris have volunteered for and contributed to more \npublic service organizations than many of us could name. Last year, \nthey were honored as a couple with the United Way's Alexis de \nTocqueville Society Award.\n  Among other endeavors, Lillian is a charter member of the Milford \nHousing Corporation, a trustee of Wesley College and a member of the \nboard of the Kent and Sussex Counties Mancus Foundation, which serves \ndisabled citizens. Perhaps most impressively, she was Delaware's Mother \nof the Year in 1992.\n  Jack has been chairman of the State Integrity Commission for over a \ndecade; he is a 35-year board member at Milford Memorial Hospital, a \nformer trustee of the University of Delaware, and in 1994, was inducted \ninto the Delaware Business Leaders Hall of Fame. He can still out-work \ncolleagues half his age.\n  Julie and Charlie Cawley have become remarkable leaders, both in the \nbusiness community and personally, in supporting charitable and \neducational organizations through their Cawley Family Foundation and \nthe MBNA Foundation, which coordinates the considerable volunteer \nefforts of the more than 10,000 MBNA employees in Delaware.\n  Julie, a former special education teacher, is a leader in some of the \nmost effective nonprofit organizations and educational efforts in our \nState, including the Ministry of Caring, Catholic Charities, Meals on \nWheels, the Centreville School and Bayard House, a residential program \nfor pregnant teenagers and young women.\n  Charlie serves on the board executive committees of the University of \nDelaware and the Grand Opera House in Wilmington. His other board \nmemberships, past and present, are too numerous to name I'm afraid I \nmight leave out something important but I know he takes particular \npride in his service on the board of the Metropolitan Wilmington Urban \nLeague. And Charlie not only serves, he truly leads, inspiring others \nto get involved.\n  Joan and Stacey Mobley are one of those impressive doctor-lawyer \ncouples, but despite all those advanced degrees, they have made good \ncertainly as community leaders. They currently co-chair the capital \ncampaign of the Delaware Art Museum, which is undertaking a major \nrenovation and expansion.\n  Joan Mobley, M.D., serves on the board of the University of Delaware, \nis an advocate for the Open College Door Program at Delaware State \nUniversity, and serves on the board of overseers for the Delaware \nCollege of Art and Design. Joan also sits on the Board of Professional \nResponsibility of the Delaware Supreme Court, and chairs the nominating \ncommittee of our YWCA.\n  Stacey Mobley, lawyer, chaired one of the most successful statewide \ncharitable fund-raising campaigns in Delaware history, at a time when \nit wasn't easy, raising $27 million for the United Way. He, too, has \nserved on numerous boards through the years, including his leadership \nhere in Washington on behalf of the National Building Museum and the \nArena Stage. Last year, Stacey was appointed by our Governor to chair \nthe Delaware Strategic Economic Council again, taking the job when the \nchallenge is considerable.\n  Six extraordinary people, and perhaps the most extraordinary thing \nabout them is that for every public effort, every board membership, \nevery charitable contribution that I could name and document, each of \nthem has undertaken many more private acts of generosity and \n``transformational leadership.'' It is my very great privilege to know \nall of them personally, and to be able to honor them as friends, as \nwell as community leaders.\n  I would like to put into the Record the comments made by Stacey \nMobley, accepting the NCCJ award on behalf of all six honorees, and I \nask that his remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follows:\n\n                       Remarks by Stacy J. Mobley\n\n       On behalf of Joan and myself, let me say that we are \n     humbled to be honored by the NCCJ tonight--and to be honored \n     along with Lillian and Jack Burris and Julie and Charlie \n     Cawley. Considering their extraordinary contributions to \n     Delaware over the years, it's truly overpowering to be \n     included with them.\n       The Cawleys and the Burrises have asked me--in the interest \n     of time--to deliver remarks for all six of us. So let me \n     begin by saying we all extend our thanks not only to the \n     NCCJ--which has so generously honored us--but to our family \n     and our friends who have bolstered us through the years, \n     often served with us, answered our pleas for contributions or \n     support, or just agreed to share their ideas at a focus \n     group. As Dr. King once said: ``Our destinies are tied \n     together. None of us can make it alone.'' We're all part of \n     an extended family--a community of friends--that nurtures \n     each other's dreams and shares each other's happiness. So the \n     six of us would like to take a moment to thank all of you who \n     have been such wonderfully supportive family, and great \n     companions through our lives.\n       At the first meeting with Muriel Gilman and Barbie Riegel \n     to discuss this award, they explained that the NCCJ was \n     honoring us for what it calls ``transformational leadership'' \n     in bettering our communities. That seems a most appropriate \n     theme to focus on, considering the work of the NCCJ, itself. \n     For 75 years, the NCCJ has encouraged ``transformational \n     leadership'' across this nation as the organization has \n     helped fight bias, bigotry and racism, while promoting \n     understanding and respect among all peoples. The work has \n     never been easy--and I might suggest that it has never been \n     more important a task than it is today.\n       Sadly, understanding and respect among all peoples seem to \n     be dwindling values in our world. Despite the advanced \n     telecommunications devices we invent, and despite the \n     Internet, which puts the wisdom of the greatest minds at our \n     fingertips, we still seem incapable of learning from the \n     past. As we look with empathy and helplessness at the \n     conflicts that tear apart peoples around the world, we wonder \n     why these twin values of understanding and respect for each \n     other's differences are so elusive. People of differing \n     religions, races and ethnicity's have caused each other \n     tremendous pain over centuries of recorded time because fear \n     and hatred have too often been instilled from infancy. And \n     regrettably, nobody seems above it. It has been true of \n     Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Buddists, Serbs, \n     Croats . . . and the list goes on. In the places where there \n     is no understanding of each other, there is no mutual \n     respect. And as surely as night follows day, distrust and \n     hatred seem to follow.\n       Conversely, in the places where there is an effort to \n     understand and respect each other's differences, people can \n     live and work side-by-side, gaining strength from their \n     diversity.\n       As our world struggles with seemingly insoluble problems--\n     in the Middle East, the Balkans, Northern Ireland, India, \n     Africa, and a dozen other global hot spots--we find ourselves \n     praying for an outbreak of peace. We all share such a \n     spectacularly beautiful little island in this massive solar \n     system, you wonder--as Rodney King asked: ``Why can't we all \n     just get along?''\n       And while those of us in the comparatively little outpost \n     called Wilmington, Delaware, are not in the position to solve \n     the world's problems, we give thanks in our own community for \n     an organization such as NCCJ which has--as its reason for \n     existence--the goal of bringing people together. NCCJ helps \n     build ``communities of justice'' through an array of programs \n     that reach our young people, extend into the workplace, and \n     cross lines of faith. And events, such as this one, tonight, \n     remind us all how important it is for each of us to \n     strengthen our communities by ``giving back'' in some \n     meaningful way. Some of us ``give back'' with our time and \n     talents, enlivening Boards and Task Forces with our creative \n     energies. Some of us ``give back'' by writing generous checks \n     to support capital campaigns to expand our communities. \n     Others of us have chosen to build a business, to pursue \n     public service, or to mentor at-risk kids.\n       But through our individual actions, we're all saying that \n     we understand the interpersonal bonds implied in the word \n     ``community''--and the commitment in the word ``friendship.'' \n     This room is filled with a community of people who are \n     remarkably different from each other--in gender, race, \n     national origin, sexual orientation, age, and religion. Yet \n     we treasure our community so deeply that we have made a \n     commitment to work together to make Delaware the kind of \n     peaceful place in which we'd be proud to raise our children \n     and our grandchildren. . . .

Mr. President, I am so proud today to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues the good work of a young constituent of \nmine, Joe Pung of Smith Creek, MI. Joe Pung is an Eagle Scout with \nTroop 178 of Port Huron, MI, and as an Eagle Scout project, Joe \nundertook the establishment of a missing in action war memorial in the \nGoodells Community Park in St. Clair County, MI. Joe told me in a \nletter that he committed himself to this project because he felt ``very \nsad'' that the men and women who are missing in action from WWI, WWII, \nKorea, and Vietnam and who ``gave so much are forgotten by our \ncommunity, and,'' he said, ``I would like to change this.'' And change \nthis he did.\n  Joe, who graduated from Port Huron High School in June of last year, \ncame up with a plan and raised all the money for this project, some \n$8,000, from local businesses. Using that money and several in-kind \ndonations, including two three-ton cobblestone pillars, two lights, and \nstonework, Joe erected a 34-foot flagpole with the pillars on each side \nand the names of the missing in action and prisoners of war engraved on \nstone plaques on top of the pillars.\n  The memorial is going to be dedicated this Memorial Day, May 27. I \nknow I speak for all of us in this body when I say ``congratulations'' \nto Joe for a job well-done, for thinking about those who have gone \nbefore us and who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms, and for \nreminding us all about the real meaning of Memorial Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4838-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4838-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4838-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 12:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3167.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to establish a \nprogram for Federal flight deck officers, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I'd like to talk about an \nissue of vital importance to the people of the United States. Is our \ngovernment doing absolutely everything in its power to prevent another \noccurrence such as the one on September 11, where our own airplanes, \nfull of innocent men, women, and children, were hijacked and turned \ninto guided missiles, killing thousands? We have taken many steps to \nprevent this from happening again, such as increased security checks \nand reinforcing cockpit doors. But for some reason we hesitate to take \nthe additional step of ensuring our aircrews have the ability as well \nto guard against the terrorist threat. Today, I am proud to represent a \nbipartisan coalition including Senator Zell Miller, Senator Conrad \nBurns, Senator Frank Murkowski, Senator Jim Bunning, and Senator Strom \nThurmond in introducing the Arming Pilots Against Terrorism and Cabin \nDefense Act of 2002.\n  Armed pilots are our first line of deterrence and the last line of \ndefense to protect an aircraft from terrorist takeover. Trained Flight \nAttendants are an important part of an integrated, layered strategy to \nfight terrorists from the cabin to the cockpit. Flight Attendants need \nmore training to defend themselves and the American people from future \ncontemplated acts of terrorism.\n  This legislation sets up a voluntary program to train and deputize \npilots in the proper use of a firearm. The bill further repeals the \nauthority of the Undersecretary for Transportation Security to block \narmed pilots. The Senate passed legislation as part of the aviation and \nTransportation Security bill to authorize a pilot ``to carry a firearm \ninto the cockpit if--(1) the Undersecretary of Transportation for \nSecurity Approves.'' For some reason, the Undersecretary has not \napproved this measure. It is time to mandate a program to train and arm \npilots now.\n  Section 3 of the bill addresses the concerns of our Nation's Flight \nAttendants. The bill sets up detailed requirements and training which \nwill prepare Flight Attendants for potential threat conditions. The \nbill further sets up a new Aviation Crewmember Self-Defense Division at \nthe Department of Transportation to aid in the training of Flight \nAttendants.\n  The bill mandates the development and fielding of a wireless \ncommunications device system so the pilots may communicate with flight \nattendants discreetly. Finally, the Transportation Security \nAdministration is required to study the issue of less than lethal \nweapons for Flight Attendants.\n  The opponents of armed pilots argue that firearms are too dangerous \nto be used in airplanes. Federal Air Marshals are armed with guns and \nthey sit in the passenger cabin of commercial airliners. We should not \nprevent the pilots who are separated from the passengers by a \nreinforced cockpit door, and\n\n[[Page S4842]]\n\nagain, serve as the last line of defense, from being armed. It is time \nto establish and implement a comprehensive training program, and arm \npilots immediately after its completion.\n\n  Pilots have told me that a stun guns or a tazer is not the answer. \nThose two tools are a good supplement for a firearm, but they are not a \nreplacement. Again, if firearms are good enough for the Federal Air \nMarshals, they are good enough for our Nation's pilots. An Air Force \nfighter jet shooting down a commercial airline full of passengers is a \nscary and unthinkable prospect. Armed pilots are a reasonable \nalternative to an Air Force Pilot shooting down a commercial airliner.\n  I disagree with the Undersecretary for Transportation Security that a \nreinforced cockpit door and armed Federal Air Marshals are the final \nanswer. I believe that armed pilots and trained Flight Attendants give \nthis Nation an integrated system to fight hijackers. Pilots working \ntogether with Flight Attendants are the best method to thwart the will \nof terrorists. Armed Pilots and trained Flight Attendants need to be \ngiven the tools to stop those who would use commercial aircraft to \nagain attack at the heart of the United States of America.\n  Flight Attendants were executed on September 11 by terrorists. Giving \nFlight Attendants the training contained in the bill is the least we \ncan do for these brave individuals. Don't forget that Flight Attendants \nwere specifically targeted by the terrorists and this bill will help \nflight attendants to have a fighting chance.\n  This is an important and necessary tool in the war against \nterrorists. Please support and co-sponsor the Arming Pilots Against \nTerrorism and Cabin Defense Act of 2002.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2554\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nenhance beneficiary access to quality health care services under the \nMedicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Congress has its hands full with health \npolicy issues this year, ranging from health insurance for workers \ndisplaced by trade policies, to the Patients' Bill of Rights, to \nMedicare prescription drugs. All of these issues are pressing. But \nCongress must not lose sight of another pressing issue in health \npolicy: supporting patients in rural America and the health care \nproviders who care for them.\n  Under current law, rural areas are confronted with a series of \ninequities in Medicare payment policy. Few of these inequities have any \nbasis in sound policy; and all of them take away precious resources \nfrom rural communities.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to level the rural playing field. \nThe Revitalizing Underserved Rural Areas and Localities Act, the RURAL \nAct, would fix many of the inequities that exist under the current \nsystem and offer extra help to certain providers who struggle to \noperate in a rural, low-volume environment.\n  Many of these changes would impact Medicare payments to hospitals. \nFirst, the bill provides a full inflation update for small urban and \nrural hospitals. Under current law, hospitals are scheduled to receive \na payment increase that is 0.55 percent less than the rate of inflation \nnext year. The RURAL Act would erase that reduction in Fiscal Year \n2003. My bill would also equalize the base payment amount for hospital \ninpatient services. Under current law, the base payment amount, also \nknown as the ``standardized amount,'' is lower for rural and small \nurban hospitals than for urban providers. This system unfairly \npenalizes smaller facilities, and I want to change to a single, equal \nrate.\n  The RURAL Act would also make gradual changes to the hospital wage \nindex, so that the true cost of providing care in rural areas can be \nmore accurately measured. And the bill recognizes the special needs of \nproviders with low patient volumes, by giving them incremental payment \nincreases based on their patient volume.\n  My bill also addresses several ambulance issues that I've heard a lot \nabout from the rural health care community. It makes clear that when \nproviders have a reasonable medical basis for using an air ambulance, \nthey should receive proper payment for that service. And it would allow \nhospitals with 25 beds or less to be reimbursed on a cost basis for \nambulance services.\n  The bill contains special provisions for the roughly 600 critical \naccess hospitals, or CAHs, nationwide. First, it says that when a \npatient is referred to a CAH for lab services, the hospital is \nreimbursed on a cost basis. It would also modify the emergency room on-\ncall rules to allow reimbursements to physician assistants, nurse \npractitioners, and clinical nurse specialists. And it would remove \nCAHs' 35-mile requirement for cost-based ambulance reimbursement.\n  I also recognize the enormous challenges of delivering home health \nservices in rural and frontier areas, where distance and volume \nconstantly work against the provider. That's why my\n\n[[Page S4844]]\n\nbill would extend the 10 percent add-on for home health services \ndelivered in rural areas for another three years. And for agencies in \nso-called ``frontier'' areas, there would be a 20 percent add-on.\n  Finally, my bill includes provisions aimed at helping physicians who \npractice in rural areas. Under the existing system, payments under the \nphysician fee schedule are reduced for rural doctors, often \nsubstantially, by a factor known as the Geographic Practice Cost Index, \nor GPCI. My bill would put a floor on this factor, increasing payments \nto rural physicians. The bill would also improve the Medicare Incentive \nPayment Program, MIPP, an important initiative intended to facilitate \nrecruitment and retention of physicians in rural areas. Finally, while \nthe sustainable growth rate payment formula is not addressed in this \nlegislation, I believe it is critical that Congress act this year to \nmitigate the drastic cuts in payments under the Medicare physician fee \nschedule.\n  This bill represents a starting point, a first step towards \ncorrecting flawed policies that punish rural areas. As the Finance \nCommittee considers Medicare legislation in the coming months, I urge \nmy colleagues to support these important rural provisions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 2556. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain facilities to the Fremont-Madison Irrigation District in the \nState of Idaho; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fremont-\nMadison Conveyance Act. The purpose of this act is to authorize the \nSecretary of the Interior to convey title to certain facilities to the \nFremont-Madison Irrigation District.\n  The District has long operated and maintained these facilities since \nthey were constructed and the United States will be fully reimbursed \nfor the cost of construction by the time of the transfer. Under this \ntitle transfer, there is expected to be no change in the operation of \nthe facilities. The measure would also require any necessary actions to \nbe taken to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act and local \nenvironmental needs.\n  This proposal is consistent with Bureau of Reclamation policy to \ntransfer title to facilities to irrigation districts that have long \noperated and maintained those facilities. As you know, Congress has \nauthorized similar title transfers in the past and it would be \nappropriate to do so for this district.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Allard, Mr. Kennedy, \n        and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 2557. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access to Medicare+Choice plans for special needs medicare \nbeneficiaries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill help one of the most vulnerable segments of the Medicare \npopulation; the Medicare Improvements for Special Needs Beneficiaries \nAct of 2002 will improve access to quality health care for frail, \nelderly Medicare beneficiaries living in nursing homes or the \ncommunity.\n  Approximately six million of these individuals are eligible for both \nMedicare and Medicaid coverage. These ``dual eligibles,'' as they are \ncalled, are the most vulnerable group of Medicare beneficiaries. They \nare elderly or disabled and poor, and many have serious health risks \nand complex medical, social, and long-term care needs. Care for these \nbeneficiaries is fragmented, and many face barriers to needed services. \nDual eligibles represent a disproportionate share of Medicare spending.\n  A small number of health plans specialized in providing quality \ncoordinated care to frail elderly Medicare beneficiaries through \ndemonstrations and the Medicare+Choice program. These specialized plans \nare a Medicare+Choice success story, fulfilling the program's original \ngoals by employing innovative clinical models of care that improve care \nand health outcomes while reducing medical costs. These plans currently \nserve approximately 25,000 Medicare beneficiaries, most of whom reside \nin nursing homes.\n  The model is simple: teams of physicians and nurse practitioners work \ntogether to provide as much primary, preventive, and acute care as \npossible on site, in a nursing home facility or in the patient's home. \nFor institutionalized enrollees, this means fewer trips to the \nemergency room; for community-based enrollees, it means avoiding \nnursing home placement. If enrollees can be treated successfully \nwithout a trip to the hospital or placement in a nursing home, they \nremain healthier and costs to the Medicare program are reduced.\n  These specialized plans are currently facing regulatory barriers that \nprevent them from becoming permanent Medicare+Choice program options \nand expanding service to frail and elderly beneficiaries in the \ncommunity. The Medicare Improvements for Special Needs Beneficaries Act \nof 2002 provides improved beneficiary access to Medicare+Choice plans \nby removing these barriers and allowing plans to specialize in serving \ndual eligible, institutionalized, and other frail beneficiaries.\n  Specially, the bill would allow a special Medicare+Choice program \ndesignation in order to allow these plans to target enrollment to the \nfrail elderly and concentrate care on this vulnerable population. As a \nsafeguard, our bill also includes several quality assurance and \nreporting requirements which these plans must adhere to in order to \nremain in the program.\n  The Congress is continually trying to improve our nation's health \ncare system and improve service for Medicare beneficiaries. I believe \nthis legislation takes a small step toward this goal. These programs \nare fulfilling the original promise of the Medicare+Choice program to \nimprove quality and lower costs, and this legislation is a no-cost way \nto continue this effort. These plans serve a unique and valuable \npurpose for a very vulnerable segment of our society. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nimprove the health and healthcare of one of the most fragile groups \nwithin our Medicare population. The Medicare Improvements for Special \nNeeds Beneficiaries Act of 2002 would improve access to quality \nhealthcare for frail, elderly Medicare beneficiaries living in nursing \nhomes or the community. Approximately 6 million of these individuals \nare eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid coverage, so-called ``dual \neligibles.''\n  These ``dual eligibles'' deserve our greatest attention. They are \nvulnerable financially as well as medically. Typically, these older \nAmericans suffer from the chronic health conditions compounded by \ncomplex social and acute care needs. Further, even with the best of \nintentions, their healthcare delivery is often limited by a health \nsystem that is fragmented and poorly coordinated. Despite 28 percent of \nMedicare spending going toward their care, the system fails at \ndelivering optimal coordinated health services.\n  While we have looked for success in our current Medicare+Choice \nplans, we find a system that is in need of serious restructuring and \ndevelopment. On the other hand, a small number of health plans already \nspecialize in providing the quality coordinated care that this \nvulnerable group needs. These plans are truly a Medicare+Choice success \nstory, however, limited through their demonstration status and relative \nsmall number. They have documented an improvement in care delivery as \nwell as health outcomes while actually reducing overall medical costs! \nThese plans currently serve 25,000 Medicare beneficiaries, most of whom \nare institutionalized.\n  How does this work? Through facilitating the physicians, nurses, and \nother health professionals to work together toward a common goal: \nbetter quality of life and health. By emphasizing preventive and \nprimary care as much as acute and tertiary care, these care-givers look \nas much at getting through a crisis as they do at preventing the next \nadverse health event. This leads to fewer urgent and emergent \nhealthcare visits, decreased need for skilled nursing facility \nplacements, and shorter and fewer hospitalizations. Anyone who has \nvisited an elder in the hospital knows that the cost of this care, \nhowever great, is small compared\n\n[[Page S4845]]\n\nto the unsettling nature of the event itself. Avoiding both is a win!\n  While the improvement in healthcare delivery and costs are important, \nthese plans can point to genuine improvements in health and quality of \nlife. The quality of life toward the end of the lifespan should be no \nless important than it is when we are younger. Communication and \ninvolvement of the beneficiary's family, when possible, also leads to \ngreater peace of mind and less anxiety for all.\n  Evercare, an affiliate of the United Health Group, has participated \nin the demonstration project since 1995. In that time they have \ndeveloped considerable experience and great success. They have reduced \ninpatient hospitalizations, patient mortality and improved clinical \nindicators of quality. All the while, they have also consistently \nachieved a 95% satisfaction rate among family members.\n  In this demonstration project, Evercare has increased the vaccination \nrate for pneumonia to \\2/3\\ from less than half for most nursing home \nresidents. Flu vaccine is delivered to 20 percent more patients than in \nthe standard care system, and over 90 percent of the residents have had \ndocumented discussions around their future care, compared with less \nthan 40 percent among general nursing home residents.\n  The time and effort spent on this demonstration project by Evercare \nand others has given us the necessary information to move forward and \noffer such care to the much larger group of seniors that might benefit. \nHowever, these plans are continuing to face substantial hurdles to \nbecoming permanent M+C options and expanding services to more \nbeneficiaries. The Medicare Improvements for Special Needs \nBeneficiaries Act of 2002 provides improved access to these plans by \nremoving the barriers and allowing plans to specialize in serving dual \neligible, institutionalized, and other frail beneficiaries.\n  This bill will allow a special ``Medicare+Choice'' program \ndesignation in order to allow plans to target enrollment to the frail \nelderly and concentrate care on this vulnerable population. The bill \nincludes specific quality assurance and reporting requirements to \nensure that these programs continue their success in improving health \nand healthcare.\n  While we seek more and better means of improving service for our \nMedicare beneficiaries, we should not lose sight of some of the small \nsuccess. Leveraging the success of the demonstration group. This piece \nof legislation will enable these programs to grow and mature, without \nadditional cost. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \npiece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Fitzgerald, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. \n        DeWine):\n  S. 2558. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe collection of data on benign brain-related tumors through the \nnational program of cancer registries; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bengin Brain \nTumor Cancer Registries Amendment Act. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senators Fitzgerald, Cantwell, and DeWine in this effort.\n  This legislation seeks to ensure that all forms of brain tumors are \naccounted for under the National Program of Cancer Registries. While \nthe distinction between benign and malignant is often the difference \nbetween life and death for many kinds of tumors, it is not so clear \nwhen it comes to tumors of the brain. Depending on location and size, a \nbrain tumor that is classified as benign can be equally life \nthreatening as a malignant brain tumor.\n  It is estimated that benign brain tumors account for almost 40 \npercent of the 35,000 brain tumors diagnosed each year. Currently, 21 \nStates, including my home State of Rhode Island, collect data on \nmalignant as well as benign brain tumors. Yet, there is no mechanism in \nplace to track the incidence of benign brain tumors at the Federal \nlevel. Moreover, variation exists in how different states have defined \na benign brain tumor. This lack of consistent data on the incidence of \nbenign brain tumors has hindered the ability of the scientific \ncommunity to invest appropriate resources into brain tumor research.\n  While our current data is insufficient, disturbing trends related to \nbrain tumors are nevertheless beginning to emerge. Brain tumors are the \nsecond leading cause of cancer death for children and the third leading \ncause of cancer death in young adults ages 15-34. Since 1975, the \nincidence of brain tumors has increased 25 percent for reasons that \nremain unknown. Tragically, our limited scientific and medical \nunderstanding of brain tumors is related to their incredibly high \nmortality rates. Only 37 percent of males and 52 percent of females \nsurvive five-years following the diagnosis of a primary benign or \nmalignant brain tumor.\n  By incorporating the collection of benign brain tumor data into the \nNational Program of Cancer Registries, we will take a crucial first \nstep toward better understanding the possible causes of this affliction \nand enhancing the ability of the medical community to devise improved \nmethods of diagnosis and treatment for all brain tumors.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure swift \nconsideration and passage of this legislation. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2558\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for a multi-agency cooperative effort to \nencourage further research regarding the causes of chronic wasting \ndisease and methods to control the further spread of the disease in \ndeer and elk herds, to monitor the incidence of the disease, to support \nState efforts to control the disease, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise before my colleagues today to \naddress the very serious matter of chronic wasting disease. As a United \nStates Senator, chronic wasting disease presents a great animal health \nchallenge. As a Veterinarian, chronic wasting disease presents an even \ngreater challenge to the scientific communities of both the States and \nthe Federal Government. In a mounting bipartisan effort to defeat the \ndisease, I, along with Senators Feingold, Kohl and Campbell, introduce \nthe ``Chronic Wasting Disease State Support Act of 2002.''\n  The importance of the title cannot be emphasized enough. Although the \nbill authorizes a substantial amount Federal funding to fight and \neradicate the disease, the States will retain their undisputed primacy \nand policy-making authority with regard to wildlife management. Nothing \nin this act interferes with or otherwise affects the primacy of the \nStates in managing wildlife generally, or managing, surveying and \nmonitoring the incidence of chronic wasting disease.\n  Chronic wasting disease, or CWD, may be a new threat to some. Others \nmay not be familiar with it at all. However, it is not new to those of \nus in Colorado and Wyoming, who have been dealing with it for over \ntwenty years, and if the disease continues to spread, those unfamiliar \nwith the fatal disease will, in time, become experts in CWD policy. The \nscientific community has gone to great lengths to deal with the disease \non limited budgets. These experts, through scientific publication and \nCongressional hearings, have told us that, although we have learned a \ntremendous amount about chronic wasting disease, there is much that we \ndo not know and much that we must do to eradicate it. One thing we do \nknow is that sound science is the answer, and that the Chronic Wasting \nDisease State Support Act of 2002 is intended to greatly increase \nresearch, monitoring, surveillance, and management of the disease on \nall levels.\n  Increased research and research funding is necessary because the \ndisease is quite simply a mystery--the origin and transmission of CWD \nis unknown. Unfortunately, the treatment for chronic wasting disease is \nall too familiar. The only way to treat an animal or to contain the \ndisease is to destroy the animal and cull the herd. Together, we must \nembark on an ambitious and sound scientific commitment for research and \ninvestigation to end chronic wasting disease. That is what this bill \ncalls for--cooperation and collaboration, working together at both the \nstate and federal level to achieve a common objective. We must end \nchronic wasting disease, and we must begin our eradication efforts now.\n  The impact CWD will have on wildlife and agriculture is undeniable, \nand the economic and emotional toll of the disease cannot be \noverstated. Communities that are economically reliant upon deer and elk \nrelated enterprises will feel the impact of CWD as concern about the \ndisease grows. But we can stop this, and we must stop this. We have an \nopportunity to restore cervid health, to contain the disease, and, most \nimportantly, to eradicate the disease. This is the challenge that I \nurge my colleagues to accept, and to take decisive action; adequate \nresearch funding that is directed toward the complete eradication of \nchronic wasting disease starts with this authorizing legislation.\n  In those States that are already dealing with CWD, the fiscal demands \nrequired to manage the disease is quite apparent. State budgets are \nstretched thin as they cull wild and captive herds and research for \nworkable solutions to stop the disease. An infusion of Federal \nresources and technical assistance is required to help the States keep \nCWD from spreading, to treat infected or exposed populations, and to \ngreatly expand research for testing and possible cures. This bill does \njust that by providing assistance in the form of grants, Federal \nresearch programs and incidence reporting, as well as scientific \nassistance. State and federal cooperation will protect animal welfare, \nsafeguard our valued livestock industry, provide relief to family elk \nranchers, help guarantee America's food safety, and protect the public \nhealth.\n  The Chronic Wasting Disease Act of 2002 provides the foundation for a \nnationwide increase in diagnostic capabilities. Undoubtedly, the spread \nof CWD and the increased awareness of the disease, will cause the \ndemand for testing to grow exponentially--this bill helps us prepare to \nhandle a large volume of cases efficiently and reliably. The \nlegislation calls for the development of new testing methods to help us \nunderstand the disease, as well as developing a live test.\n  Chronic wasting disease presents a common problem to the states and \nthe federal government. The federal conduit role that is provided in \nthe bill will allow animal health experts to unravel the CWD mystery. \nThe challenge we face is to achieve what we all recognize as a common \nobjective--to understand CWD and to eradicate it. But, we must act \nquickly or this disease will redefine the wildlife characteristics of \nour States. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2560\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Chronic Wasting Disease \n     State Support Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``chronic wasting disease'' means the \n     animal disease afflicting deer and elk that--\n       (1) is a transmissible disease of the nervous system \n     resulting in distinctive lesions in the brain; and\n       (2) belongs to the group of diseases known as transmissible \n     spongiform encephalopathies, which group includes scrapie, \n     bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and Cruetzfeldt-Jakob \n     disease.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the States retain \n     undisputed primacy and policy-making authority with regard to \n     wildlife management, and nothing in this Act interferes with \n     or otherwise affects the primacy of the States in managing \n     wildlife generally, or managing, surveying, and monitoring \n     the incidence of chronic wasting disease.\n       (2) Chronic wasting disease, the fatal neurological disease \n     found in cervids, is a fundamental threat to the health and \n     vibrancy of deer and elk populations, and the increased \n     occurrence of chronic wasting disease in regionally diverse \n     locations in recent months necessitates an escalation in \n     research, surveillance, monitoring, and management activities \n     focused on containing, managing, and eradicating this lethal \n     disease.\n       (3) As the States move to manage existing incidence of \n     chronic wasting disease and insulate non-infected wild and \n     captive cervid populations from the disease, the Federal \n     Government should endeavor to provide integrated and holistic \n     financial and technical support to these States.\n       (4) In its statutory role as supporting agent, relevant \n     federal agencies should provide consistent, coherent, and \n     integrated support structures and programs for the benefit of \n     State wildlife and agricultural administrators, as chronic \n     wasting disease can move freely between captive and wild \n     cervids across the broad array of Federal, State, and local \n     land management jurisdictions.\n       (5) The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, and other affected Federal authorities can \n     provide consistent, coherent, and integrated support systems \n     under existing legal authorities.\n             TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ACTIVITIES\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nColorado, Senator Allard in introducing comprehensive legislation to \naddress the problem of chronic wasting disease. I am delighted to be \nworking with him on this bill, and commend him and his staff for all \ntheir tireless efforts. This disease has become a serious problem \naffecting wild deer in my home State of Wisconsin.\n  Chronic wasting disease belongs to the family of transmissible \nspongiform encephalopathies TSEs, diseases. TSEs are a group of \ntransmissible, slowly progressive, degenerative diseases of the central \nnervous systems of several species of animals. Animal TSEs include, in \naddition to chronic wasting disease, CWD, in deer and elk, bovine \nspongiform encephalopathy in cattle, scrapie in sheep and goats, feline \nsponfiform encephalopathy in cats, and mink spongiform encephalopathy \nin mink.\n  States like mine are now contemplating how and where their Department \nof Natural Resources will cull deer in an attempt to slow the spread of \nthe disease, and it is a difficult choice. Wisconsin is contemplating a \nherd reduction of up to 15,000 animals in ten counties. With a disease \nthat has no known mechanism of transmission, large scale herd reduction \nmay not fully address the problem. Yet Wisconsin is in the difficult \nposition of not being able to put off taking action to slow the \nepidemic until every scientific question has been answered in detail. \nWisconsinites treasure the sight of deer in our woods and tourism and \nhunting are important to our State's economy, as well. In part, \nWisconsin's struggles to manage the disease have been complicated by \nstruggles to interact with a variety of different Federal agencies, \neach with differing and intersecting responsibilities on the issue of \nchronic wasting disease.\n  In that vein, the legislation we are introducing is comprehensive, \naddressing both short term and long term needs. It authorizes a $29 \nmillion dollar Federal chronic wasting disease program that will be \nadministered by the United States Departments of Agriculture, USDA, and \nInterior. It is similar to legislation introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by the Representative from Colorado, Mr. McInnis), \nwhich has been cosponsored on a bi-partisan basis by Wisconsin \ndelegation members in the House of Representatives. I think it is \nextremely appropriate that legislators from Colorado, the state that \nhas the longest history in chronic wasting disease, have made a \nconcerted effort to work with Wisconsin members who are struggling with \na new outbreak that has emerged solely in wild deer. I deeply \nappreciate the commitment of the Representative from Colorado, Mr. \nMcInnis, toward finding a solution that works for both our States. I \nthink these are good comprehensive efforts, and I would like to \nhighlight a few provisions in detail.\n  The bill I am introducing with the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard, \nrequires USDA to work jointly with Interior and authorizes them to give \nup to $10 million in grants to states to help them plan and implement \nmanagement strategies to address chronic wasting disease in both \ncaptive and wild herds of deer and elk. USDA is directed, in addition, \nto develop a national chronic wasting disease incident database, \nbuilding on the existing USDA reporting program.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard, \nhas incorporated provisions that I authored to address Wisconsin's \nurgent short term need for enhanced testing capacity. Under the bill, \nUSDA is required to release, within 30 days, protocols both for labs to \nuse in performing tests for chronic wasting disease and for the proper \ncollection of animal tissue to be tested. USDA is further required to \ndevelop a certification program for federal and non-federal labs \nconducting chronic wasting disease tests within 45 days of enactment. I \nhope all these measures will enhance Wisconsin' capacity to accurately \ntest deer this year. To address longer terms needs, the USDA is \ndirected to accelerate research into the development of live animal \ntests for chronic wasting disease, including field diagnostic tests, \nand the development of testing protocols that reduce laboratory test \nprocessing time.\n  This bill is appropriate, because state wildlife and agriculture \ndepartments do not have the fiscal or scientific capacity to adequately \nconfront the problem. Their resources are spread too thin as they \nattempt to prevent the disease from spreading. Federal help in the form \nof management funding, research grants, and scientific expertise is \nurgently needed. Federal and State cooperation will protect animal \nwelfare, safeguard our valued livestock industry, help guarantee \nAmerica's food safety, and protect the public health.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague from Colorado, Mr. \nAllard, to seek passage of this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (by request):\n  S. 2561. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to transfer \nfrom the Secretary of Labor to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \ncertain responsibilities relating to the provision of employment and \nother services to veterans and other eligible persons; to require the \nestablishment of a new competitive grants program through which \nemployment service shall be provided to veterans, servicemembers, and \nother eligible persons; and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \nrequested by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as a courtesy to the \nSecretary and the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. Except in unusual \ncircumstances, it is my practice to introduce legislation requested by \nthe Administration so that\n\n[[Page S4849]]\n\nsuch measures will be available for review and consideration. This \n``by-request'' bill contains four titles and proposes to move and \nmodify employment service programs for veterans and other eligible \npersons from the Department of Labor to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  Title I of the proposed bill contains provisions governing the \ntransition of certain veterans' employment services from the Department \nof Labor's Veterans Employment and Training Service, or VETS, program \nto a new program within the Department of Veterans Affairs to be known \nas the Veterans' Employment, Business Opportunity, and Training, or \nVEBOT, program. This bill would mandate that the VEBOT program provide \nperformance-based competitive grants to State Governors or other \nentities for the purpose of providing employment services to veterans.\n  The VETS program currently provides grants for Disabled Veterans' \nOutreach Programs and Local Veterans Employment Representatives, LVER. \nThese programs are staffed by State employees and provide employment \nservices for veterans through State employment service offices and one-\nstop centers.\n  Section 103 delegates responsibility to the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs to define by regulations virtually every aspect of the VEBOT \nprogram. This includes establishing and monitoring performance \nstandards for state VEBOT programs, eligibility criteria for VEBOT \nclients, services to be provided by these programs, and service \ndelivery practices.\n  Titles II and III mandate that responsibility for transition \nassistance and Homeless Veterans Reintegration Programs shall be \ntransferred from the Department of Labor to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  The transfer of veterans' employment programs currently administered \nby the Department of Labor to the Department of Veterans Affairs would \nbe completed by the later of September 30, 2003, or the date upon which \nthe regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \ngovern these programs take effect.\n  Again, I submit this for the review and consideration of my \ncolleagues at the request of the administration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and Secretary \nPrincipi's transmittal letter that accompanied the draft legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2561\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION I.

The Secretary of Labor \n     shall provide assistance to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     in gaining access to wage information for this purpose.\n       (f) Cost Principles.--(1)(A) Each Governor of a State or \n     other entity receiving funds under this section shall comply \n     with the applicable uniform-cost principles included in the \n     appropriate circulars or directives of the Office of \n     Management and Budget for the type of entity, receiving the \n     funds, as well as regulations prescribed by the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs. Each grantee shall establish such fiscal \n     controls and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary \n     to assure the proper disbursal of, and accounting for, \n     Federal funds allocated to any provider receiving funds under \n     this section and shall maintain appropriate records in \n     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles \n     applicable in each State. Each grantee shall comply with the \n     appropriate uniform administrative requirements for grants, \n     contracts and agreements applicable for the type of entity \n     receiving funds as promulgated in circulars or directives of \n     the Office of Management and Budget.\n       (B) If a grantee determines that a service provider acting \n     under a contract or sub-grant is not in compliance with the \n     requirements of this Act, the grantee shall take corrective \n     action either to secure the service provider's prompt \n     compliance or to remove the funds from the service provider \n     for failure to so comply. If the grantee fails to take such \n     corrective action, the Secretary may, pursuant to such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, remove funds from \n     the grantee and directly or indirectly solicit through a \n     competition a new grantee and service provider.\n       (2) Unless approved by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, \n     not more than 15 percent of the funds available under this \n     section to each State Governor or other entity may be \n     expended by a service provider and State Governor for costs \n     of administration. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations \n     governing the expenditure of funds for costs of \n     administration under this paragraph.\n       (g) Pilot Projects Authorized.--In connection with the \n     development and implementation of the VEBOT program, the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs, during each fiscal year, may \n     reserve up to 25 percent of the total available funding for \n     grants to finance national-level primary services and to \n     create pilot programs and demonstration projects to establish \n     the effectiveness and viability of special proposed \n     innovative program designs and service delivery systems.\n\n     SEC. 104.

Richard B. Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is transmitted herewith a draft \n     bill, the ``Veterans' Employment, Business Opportunity, and \n     Training Act of 2002,'' to amend title 38, United States \n     Code, to transfer from the Secretary of Labor to the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs certain responsibilities \n     relating to the provision of employment and other services to \n     veterans and other eligible persons; to require the \n     establishment of a new competitive grants program through \n     which employment services shall be provided to veterans, \n     servicemembers, and other eligible persons; and for other \n     purposes. I request that this bill be referred to the \n     appropriate committee for prompt consideration and enactment.\n       Title I of the draft bill contains provisions that would \n     transfer from the Secretary of Labor to the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs responsibility, as well as staffing, for the \n     administration of employment and other services to veterans \n     under chapter 41 of title 38, United States Code, and require \n     the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a new \n     competitive grants program, entitled the ``Veterans' \n     Employment, Business Opportunity and Training Program'' \n     (VEBOT), to replace current programs under chapter 41. The \n     VEBOT program would supplant three current grants activities \n     currently administered by the Assistant Secretary of Labor \n     for Veterans Employment and Training, including the Disabled \n     Veterans Outreach Program\n\n[[Page S4851]]\n\n     (DVOP), the Local Veterans Employment Representatives (LVER), \n     and the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP). \n     Because of the lead-time required to implement grants, VA \n     would keep existing Department of Labor-funded grants in \n     place during at least the first year after transfer. The \n     President's budget for Fiscal Year 2003 reflects the transfer \n     of $197 million and 199 full-time employee equivalents (FTEE) \n     from the Department of Labor to the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) to implement this proposal.\n       Over the last decade, veterans have received less-than-\n     adequate job-search assistance. A report issued by the \n     Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans \n     Transition Assistance, and at least four reports issued by \n     the General Accounting Office in the past five years, \n     extensively document long-standing shortfalls with the DVOP \n     and LVER programs. In spite of awareness in the veterans \n     community that these two programs are falling short of the \n     excellence that should be demanded of programs so important \n     to many veterans' ability to enjoy and secure the productive \n     life that their service defended for all Americans, \n     significant improvements to the programs have not occurred \n     because of legislative constraints. In order to improve \n     services to veterans, legislative reforms are essential. We \n     also believe that placement of the employment services \n     programs within VA will strengthen the focus on veterans' \n     needs. In light of VA's clear mission of service to veterans, \n     VA would be in a stronger position to objectively evaluate \n     veterans' employment assistance needs and develop a program \n     that better meets veterans' needs, while at the same time \n     ensuring adequate flexibility in design to allow for adapting \n     to the needs of future generations of veterans.\n       Section 102 of the draft bill would set forth a statement \n     regarding the establishment of a national performance-based \n     job-search assistance program that: (1) would provide high-\n     quality, job-search service to veterans, servicemembers, and \n     other eligible persons, focused on assisting such individuals \n     in obtaining and maintaining employment, as well as reducing \n     the duration of individuals' unemployment; (2) would assist \n     employers in locating and hiring qualified veterans, \n     servicemembers, and other eligible persons; and (3) would be \n     accessible to veterans, servicemembers, and other eligible \n     persons. VA would continue to aggressively use web-based \n     technology to provide better service to veterans around the \n     world.\n       Section 103 of the draft bill would require the Secretary \n     to establish the VEBOT program, through which State Governors \n     or other entities, as may be appropriate, would receive \n     grants for the purpose of providing for employment services \n     to veterans, servicemembers, and other eligible persons \n     within each State. The stated purpose of the VEBOT program \n     would be to assist veterans, servicemembers, and other \n     eligible persons in obtaining employment by providing for \n     access to optimal employment opportunities. The Secretary \n     would be required to ensure that all services under the VEBOT \n     program are provided through grants awarded either directly \n     or indirectly on a competitive basis and that such grants \n     include appropriate performance requirements with clear \n     outcome measures.\n       The Secretary would further be directed to prescribe \n     regulations that would address matters relating to the \n     development and implementation of the program, including: (1) \n     the determination of eligibility criteria for affected \n     veterans, servicemembers, or other eligible persons for \n     employment services and other related services that shall be \n     provided; (2) the nature and type of services to be provided; \n     (3) the most appropriate and efficient means to provide such \n     services; (4) the most appropriate means to monitor and \n     assess the performance of entities providing employment \n     services; (5) the manner in which the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs will cooperate with State employment agencies to \n     ensure that veterans continue to have access to the full \n     range of workforce services available through existing State \n     and local one-stop employment-service delivery systems; (6) \n     the manner in which the Department of Veterans Affairs will \n     coordinate with the Department of Labor to ensure that \n     veterans continue to receive priority or other special \n     consideration in the provision of employment services through \n     existing State and local one-stop employment-service delivery \n     systems, as required by law or regulation; and (7) the entity \n     or organization within the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     that will administer the program. In developing the \n     implementing regulations, the Secretary would be required to \n     take into consideration the recommendations of a task force \n     that would be required to be established under this section.\n       Section 103 would also set forth specific performance-\n     measurement criteria and responsibilities, as well as \n     procedures for ensuring compliance with cost principles, and \n     further, would authorize the Secretary to spend portions of \n     available funding to finance national-level primary services \n     and create pilot programs and demonstration projects to \n     establish the effectiveness and viability of specific \n     proposed innovative program designs and service delivery \n     systems.\n       Section 104 of the draft bill would provide that, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, during the period \n     beginning on October 1, 2002, and ending on the later of \n     September 30, 2003, or the date upon which regulations \n     prescribed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs become \n     effective, the responsibilities assigned to the Secretary of \n     Labor under sections 4101 through 4102A (other than \n     responsibilities assigned under section 4102A regarding the \n     purposes of chapters 42 and 43 of title 38, United States \n     Code), sections 4103 through 4108, and section 4110 of title \n     38, United States Code, shall be assumed by the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs. The function of the Assistant Secretary of \n     Labor for Veterans' Employment and Training in the Department \n     of Labor, as well as such personnel of the Department of \n     Labor as may be deemed necessary to carry out such function, \n     would be transferred from the Department of Labor to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs. Further, during that period, \n     the two Secretaries would coordinate activities so as to \n     facilitate the transfer of functions associated with the \n     administration of employment services provided under chapter \n     41 of title 38, United States Code, that are conducted by \n     disabled veterans' outreach programs specialists and local \n     veterans' employment representatives. This would include \n     activities relating to the transition assistance program for \n     servicemembers nearing separation from the Armed Forces and \n     for homeless veterans in dire need of employment.\n       Section 105 of the draft bill would repeal, effective on \n     the later of September 30, 2003, or the date upon which \n     regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     under section 103(b) of this Act become effective, several \n     sections of title 38, United States Code, that currently \n     govern the provision of employment-related services under \n     chapter 41. In addition, section 105 would make several \n     amendments to section 4110 of title 38, under which an \n     Advisory Committee on Veterans Employment and Training is \n     established, to reflect the transfer of responsibilities for \n     employment-related services for veterans from the Department \n     of Labor to the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       Section 201 of the draft bill would amend section 1144 of \n     title 10, United States Code, to provide for the transfer of \n     responsibility for the administration of the transition \n     assistance program from the Secretary of Labor to the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs. It would further provide, as \n     the case may be, for the use of personnel of grant recipients \n     under section 103(b) of the Veterans' Employment, Business \n     Opportunity, and Training Act of 2002 or such other personnel \n     as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs may determine to be \n     appropriate, to the extent that the Secretary determines that \n     such use will not significantly interfere with the provision \n     of services or other benefits to eligible veterans and other \n     eligible recipients of services or benefits under programs \n     administered by the Secretary.\n       Section 301 of the draft bill would amend section 2021 of \n     title 38 to provide for the transfer of responsibility for \n     the administration of the Homeless Veterans Reintegration \n     Project from the Secretary of Labor to the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs. With respect to this program, we fully \n     expect to expand on what we believe have been highly \n     successful partnering efforts with States, local governments, \n     Native American Tribal governments, and faith-based and non-\n     profit organizations under the State Cemetery, State Home and \n     Homeless Service Providers Grant and Per Diem program.\n       Finally, section 401 of the draft bill would provide that, \n     except where otherwise provided, the provisions of the Act \n     would become effective on October 1, 2002.\n       The Administration's budget reflects the transfer of \n     funding ($197 million in FY 2003) to support the affected \n     employment services programs from the Department of Labor to \n     VA and the transfer to VA of 199 FTEE to implement the \n     programs. Accordingly, no cost is associated with the \n     Administration's proposal.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this legislation to the \n     Congress and that its enactment would be in accord with the \n     program of the President.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Anthony J. Principi.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 2562. A bill to expand research regarding inflammatory bowel \ndisease, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and Mr. Cochran to \nintroduce the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Act, which will advance our \nknowledge of this serious health condition and our ability to treat \npeople suffering from it.\n  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic disorders of the \ngastrointestinal tract which represent the major causes of morbidity \nand mortality from digestive illness. Because they behave similarly, \nthese disorders are collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease. \nIt can cause severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and rectal \nbleeding. Moreover, complications related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease \ncan include arthritis, osteoporosis, anemia, liver disease, and colon \ncancer. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are not fatal, but they \ncan be devastating. We do not know their cause, and we have no cure. \nThere\n\n[[Page S4852]]\n\nare an estimated 1 million people in the United States who suffer from \nInflammatory Bowel Disease. In 1990, total annual medical costs for \nCrohn's Disease patients was $1 to $1.2 million, and for patients with \ncolitis, $400 to $600 thousand.\n  A recent medical breakthrough, identification of the gene for Crohn's \nDisease--opens up exciting new pathways for research to understand \nunderlying disease mechanisms and to improve therapies for those who \nsuffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Our legislation establishes a \ndistinct research program within the National Institute of Diabetes and \nDigestive and Kidney Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. \nStudies that translate findings from basic genetic and animal model \nresearch are among the promising areas to be advanced. With a program \nof Inflammatory Bowel Disease prevention and epidemiology at the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, we can generate an accurate \nanalysis of the make-up of the population with Inflammatory Bowel \nDisease, thereby obtaining invaluable clues to the potential causes and \nrisks associated with the disease.\n  The bill also will inform public and private health coverage policy \nby providing for a study of the coverage standards of Medicare, \nMedicaid, and private health insurance for therapies for Inflammatory \nBowel Disease. It will be conducted by the Institute of Medicine of the \nNational Academies of Science. In addition, the bill calls for a \nGeneral Accounting Office study of the problems patients with \nInflammatory Bowel Disease encounter when applying for disability \ninsurance benefits.\n  This bill will benefit millions of Americans who suffer from or who \nare at risk of developing Inflammatory Bowel Disease. It promises to \nalleviate much suffering, to assist patients in accessing sound and \neffective medical treatment, and to benefit those who are debilitated \nby Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Inflammatory Bowel Disease \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious \n     inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's \n     disease may occur in any section of the gastrointestinal \n     tract but is predominately found in the lower part of the \n     small intestine and the large intestine. Ulcerative colitis \n     is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the \n     innermost lining of the colon. Because Crohn's disease and \n     ulcerative colitis behave similarly, they are collectively \n     known as inflammatory bowel disease.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 with respect to the \ninterest rate range for additional funding requirements, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill on behalf \nof myself and Senators Kerry and Torricelli, to accomplish two \nobjectives related to defined benefit pension plans.\n  First, my bill will permit defined benefit plans to use an \nappropriate adjusted interest rate for purposes of calculating \ncontributions to their plan due for plan year 2001. We made this change \nin the economic stimulus bill that passed earlier this year for the \nyears 2002 and 2003, but failed to pick up the 2001 plan year.\n  My colleagues may think that such a change should have been made a \nyear ago. Defined benefit pension plan contributions for 2001 are due \nin most cases, 8\\1/2\\ months after the close of the plan year. By that \nmeasure, this change is still timely. I would also draw the attention \nof my colleagues to the fact that this adjustment is necessary to \ncorrect for the very low 30-year Treasury bond rates that have resulted \nfrom the buy-back and discontinuation of these bonds.\n  It is also important to note that this change will not affect the way \nin which pension payouts are made to participants. It will simply \naffect contributions to plans and premiums paid to the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation by plan sponsors.\n  Second, the bill would make permanent a special rule for certain \ninterstate bus lines that was put in place in the 1997 tax bill. That \nrule allows interstate bus lines with frozen pension plans to use \ngenerally applicable\n\n[[Page S4853]]\n\nERISA funding rules for their plan, rather than those mandated by the \npension the GATT which were enacted in 1994.\n  The change we make for interstate bus lines with frozen defined \nbenefit plans is unique to this group. Generally the GATT made useful \nchanges to pension law that made plans more secure for participants. \nThe use of standardized interest rates and mortality tables has helped \nestablish a baseline so that plan sponsors understand our expectations \nof how they must fund their plans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill, along with a \nletter of support from the Amalgamated Transit Union, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2563\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INTEREST RATE RANGE FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subclause (III) of section 412(l)(7)(C)(i) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``2002 or 2003'' in the text and inserting \n     ``2001, 2002, or 2003'', and\n       (2) by striking ``2002 and 2003'' in the heading and \n     inserting ``2001, 2002, and 2003''.\n       (b) Special Rule.--Subclause (III) of section \n     302(d)(7)(C)(i) of the Employee Retirement Income Security \n     Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1082(d)(7)(C)(i)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``2002 or 2003'' in the text and inserting \n     ``2001, 2002, or 2003'', and\n       (2) by striking ``2002 and 2003'' in the heading and \n     inserting ``2001, 2002, and 2003''.\n       (c) PBGC.--Subclause (IV) of section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii) of \n     such Act (29 U.S.C. 1306(a)(3)(E)(iii)) is amended to read as \n     follows--\n       ``(IV) In the case of plan years beginning after December \n     31, 2001, and before January 1, 2004, subclause (II) shall be \n     applied by substituting `100 percent' for `85 percent' and by \n     substituting `115 percent' for `100 percent'. Subclause (III) \n     shall be applied for such years without regard to the \n     preceding sentence. Any reference to this clause or this \n     subparagraph by any other sections or subsections (other than \n     sections 4005, 4010, 4011 and 4043) shall be treated as a \n     reference to this clause or this subparagraph without regard \n     to this subclause.''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect as if included in the amendments made by \n     section 405 of the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of \n     2002.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO RETIREMENT PROTECTION ACT OF 1994.\n\n       (a) Transition Rule Made Permanent.--Paragraph (1) of \n     section 769(c) of the Retirement Protection Act of 1994 is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``transition'' each place it appears in the \n     heading and the text, and\n       (2) by striking ``for any plan year beginning after 1996 \n     and before 2010''.\n       (b) Special Rules.--Paragraph (2) of section 769(c) of the \n     Retirement Protection Act of 1994 is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(2) Special rules.--The rules described in this paragraph \n     are as follows:\n       ``(A) For purposes of section 412(l)(9)(A) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 and section 302(d)(9)(A) of the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the funded current \n     liability percentage for any plan year shall be treated as \n     not less than 90 percent.\n       ``(B) For purposes of section 412(m) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 and section 302(e) of the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the funded current \n     liability percentage for any plan year shall be treated as \n     not less than 100 percent.\n       ``(C) For purposes of determining unfunded vested benefits \n     under section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii) of the Employee Retirement \n     Income Security Act of 1974, the mortality table shall be the \n     mortality table used by the plan.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to plan years beginning after December 31, 2001.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Amalgamated Transit Union,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2002.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: On behalf of the Amalgamated Transit \n     Union (ATU), I write to express our support for your proposed \n     Senate bill to apply recent changes made to the Tax Code to \n     the year 2001 and to make permanent the relief for certain \n     interstate bus company pension plans from GATT-mandated \n     funding requirements. (Reference #FRA02.196)\n       We believe the relief provided in this bill for interstate \n     bus companies with frozen pension plans, such as Greyhound, \n     is crucial to protect the affected employees' pension rights \n     and ensure the continued vitality of this nationwide \n     transportation system. With respect to the provisions \n     extending the thirty-year Treasury fix to 2001, we certainly \n     understand the need for and also support this provision.\n       As you know, ATU represents over 5,000 current Greyhound \n     employees, as well as 13,000 retirees. Greyhound and its \n     drivers serve over 4,000 communities nationwide, most of \n     which have no other form of intercity public transportation. \n     The continuance of these essential public transportation \n     services provided by Greyhound and its drivers, however, is \n     being threatened by federal pension funding requirements that \n     fail to recognize the uniqueness of the ATU-Greyhound pension \n     plan.\n       The jointly-administered defined benefit pension plan for \n     Greyhound bus drivers has been frozen to new participants \n     since 1983. The plan has 14,000 participants, all but 1,000 \n     of which are retired. As a result, the average age of plan \n     participants is over 70 years, and their mortality rate is \n     far higher than that predicted by the mortality table that \n     current law requires the plan administrator to use in \n     determining funding requirements. Without legislative change, \n     this requirement will force Greyhound to make unnecessary \n     pension contributions with capita that is needed to operate \n     and maintain its vital nationwide transportation system and \n     to address new security threats facing the industry. These \n     changes will benefit our retirees and our active members as \n     well.\n       We applaud your leadership in the effort to provide this \n     necessary relief. As this is a top-priority for the ATU, I \n     want to personally thank you for all your efforts in this \n     matter. Please let us know how we can help you as this bill \n     moves forth.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jim LaSala,\n                                          International President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Bond, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Stevens \n        and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 2566. A bill to improve early learning opportunities and promote \nschool preparedness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my fellow \nSenators today to introduce the Early Care and Education Act. I commend \nmy colleagues for their commitment and leadership on this issue of \nnational priority, Senator Judd Gregg, the ranking member of the \nH.E.L.P. Committee with whom I am proud to share leadership with on \nthis issue; Senator Patty Murray, a former early educator herself who \nbrings to the H.E.L.P. Committee a depth of knowledge from the front \nlines of education in our country; Senator George Voinovich for his \nleadership through the Families and Children First initiative as \nGovernor of Ohio and his long-standing commitment to this issue; \nSenator Paul Wellstone, who continues to show support for parent and \nfamily education, and has demonstrated impressive results with the care \nof infants in Minnesota; Senator Ted Stevens, who has a long commitment \nto children and championed the Early Learning Opportunities Act; \nSenator John Edwards, whose dedication to the interests of children \nwith special needs is greatly appreciated; and Senator Chris Bond, for \nhis innovation with the Parents as Teachers program in Missouri.\n  Today, in America, there are over 19 million children under age 5, \nand over 11 million of these children have parents who work. Sixty-two \npercent of children from birth to age 5 spend time cared for by someone \nother than their parents, and too many are spending increasing hours in \na hodge-podge of programs, in a variety of settings, cared for and \ntaught by sometimes unqualified and certainly under-compensated \nproviders. As a result, almost half of our Nation's children start \nschool unprepared for the challenges before them. This result is costly \nfor our parents, our teachers and providers, and most importantly, for \nour children.\n  The Early Care and Education Act that we introduce today is based on \ndecades of science and research that show that what parents and \nproviders do for young children during their earliest years will impact \nschool performance and later success in life. This bill will build upon \ncurrent Federal, State, and local efforts to address the early care and \neducation needs of young children. And, it will promote school \nreadiness by creating a system of early care and early education that \nincludes quality services and programs staffed by an educated, \nmotivated, and stable workforce that is paid in accordance to their \nvery important responsibilities as the earliest educators of our \nchildren.\n  During the first five years of life, our children have a number of \nexperiences that have strong influence on their social, emotional, and \ncognitive development. Together, these early encounters set the stage \nfor later learning and performance. This has been confirmed by research \nand life experience. Based on this knowledge, we must give the same\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\nhigh priority and commitment to early education that we devote to the \nelementary, secondary, and college levels. Education is a continuum \nthat begins at birth, and we must invest in our children from the \nbeginning if we expect the best for them and from them. this means an \ninvestment in their parents, caregivers, and teachers as well.\n  To ensure that children enter school prepared to learn, we must \ncoordinate and improve the quality of services children and families \nreceive, eliminate duplication, and maximize the use of existing \nfederal and state resources. The Early Care and Education Act will \naccomplish this by providing incentive grants so that states may: Offer \neducation, training, and professional development opportunities to \nimprove the skills and compensation of the early care and education \nworkforce; conduct needs assessments and evaluations of State and local \nprograms and services for young children; provide training and \ntechnical assistance to help health care providers conduct analyses of \nchild development as a part of routine physical examinations; improve \nparent, provider and public awareness of the early childhood \ndevelopment activities that will help children reach social, emotional, \nand cognitive milestones, and; support voluntary parent and family \neducation programs that address early literacy, school preparedness, \nand overall development growth.\n\n  These activities I've just described have been demonstrated in \nresearch and practice to address the social, emotional, physical, and \ncognitive development needs that simultaneously influence a child's \nability and willingness to learn.\n  I bring the Early Education and Care Act to the floor today with a \nstrong voice. My fellow Americans, parents, and providers have placed \neducation, and specifically, early education, as a top national \npriority. Study after study has called for better access and quality \nfor early education. And, in the past few months alone, numerous \nreports have accurately described the shortcomings of early care and \neducation in our country, as well as the need to respond. We began to \nidentify solutions years ago with Perry Preschool and the Carolina \nAbecedarian Project. These proven solutions have been more recently \ndemonstrated in programs like the Chicago Child-Parent Center program \nand described in publications, such as Eager to Learn and From Neurons \nto Neighborhoods. After years of research articulating the need, and \nyears of intervention showing us what works, we can no longer afford to \nignore these calls to action.\n  I have long-been committed to the education and welfare of children \nin this country. They are who will keep the greatness and prosperity of \nthis nation going in the years to come. The first few months of 2002 \nhave already created some dynamic changes for our young citizens. In \nJanuary, I joined President Bush as he signed the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, ESEA, into law. This display of bipartisan \ncommitment paved the road for future collaboration on other areas much \nin need of attention and commitment, including quality early care and \neducation.\n  Since then, the President has stated his commitment to school \nreadiness with the Administration's announcement of the ``Good Start, \nGrow Smart'' initiative, and the First Lady has repeatedly expressed \nher dedication to this issue by testifying before the Senate Education \nCommittee, at White House events, and at engagements across the \ncountry, including the second annual early childhood education summit \nearlier this month in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n  Today, I sand with the President, the First Lady, and America's \nparents, providers, and teachers to call for quality early care and \neducation for our nation's youngest children. The public and policy \nmakers agree on its importance, and we now have the opportunity--and \nobligation--to act.\n  Investing in our children early is not an option. It is our \nresponsibility as a nation. With stronger K-12 student requirements \nthrough ESEA, we cannot fairly hold our children accountable for poor \nperformance later in school if we don't give them the best \nopportunities at success from the start. We must narrow the gap between \nwhat we know and what we do. The Early Care and Education Act will help \nus to narrow that gap.\n  As I close, I would like to recognize the many researchers, \npractitioners, and advocates who have contributed their expertise and \npractical insight as we crafted this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent a multitude of letters and other material we have received in \nsupport of this legislation be printed in the Record. The Nation is \nbehind this effort, and I hope that my colleagues will join us in \nsupporting and passing this very important legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Support for the Early Care and Education Act\n\n\n                                Experts\n\n       Jack Shonkoff, Brandeis University.\n       Craig Ramey, Georgetown University.\n       Ed Zigler, Yale University.\n       Dorothy Strickland, Rutgers University.\n       Barry Zuckerman, Boston Medical.\n\n\n                         National Organizations\n\n       American Academy of Pediatrics.\n       Child Care Action Campaign.\n       Child Care Consortium.\n       National Child Care Assocation.\n       Scholastic Inc.\n       National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral \n     Agencies.\n       I am Your Child Foundation.\n       Committee for Economic Development.\n       High Scope Foundation.\n       Reading is Fundamental.\n       United Way of America.\n       Fight Crime Invest in Kids.\n       Parents as Teachers.\n\n\n                   National Government Organizations\n\n       National Governors Association.\n       National League of Cities.\n       National Conference of Mayors.\n       National Conference of State Legislators.\n\n\n                         Massachusetts & States\n\n       Massachusetts Dept. of Education.\n       Massachusetts Early Education for All.\n       Massachusetts Association of Child Care Resource and \n     Referral Agencies.\n       North Carolina Smart Start.\n       First Steps South Carolina.\n       Washington State Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies.\n       Maryland Office for Children.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Academy of Pediatrics,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2002.\n     Hon.

Your \n     legislation recognizes the important nexus between quality \n     health care and quality education for children by ensuring \n     that all early care and education initiatives are grounded on \n     the best research, standards and teaching strategies \n     available. Moreover, by including pediatricians on the panel \n     of experts to provide guidance and assistance to states, your \n     legislation will ensure that all children can benefit from \n     the medical expertise of those most familiar with the health \n     and development of infants, children, adolescents and young \n     adults.\n       We applaud your continued commitment to the health, \n     development and education of children. We would welcome the \n     opportunity to work with you as this important legislation \n     moves forward this year.

Therefore, we are pleased that your legislation \n     encourages States to think and plan comprehensively how best \n     to improve the quality of early experiences for children by \n     addressing such systemic needs as professional development, \n     compensation, program guidelines, information and support for \n     parents, as well as public awareness.\n       We see the concept of a unified, seamless plan which \n     coordinates the State's various federal funding streams as an \n     important indicator that the activities in this Act are \n     intended to provide a robust complement to the quality-\n     enhancing activities currently\n\n[[Page S4855]]\n\n     funded by the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), \n     which we are hoping will also be increased significantly \n     during this year's reauthorization.\n       As coordinators of the fragile and fragmented local early \n     care and education configurations, child care resource and \n     referral programs applaud the intentionality and systemic \n     planning that the Act promotes. The ability of a State's \n     governor to designate an existing entity as the advisory \n     council and the intent to enhance the effectiveness of \n     existing delivery systems are both critical elements to us. \n     We heartily support leveraging new opportunities but strongly \n     oppose the waste created by the unnecessary creation of new, \n     parallel systems and duplication of functions.\n       In the section on State Plans, we appreciate the \n     recognition of community based training that is not provided \n     for course credit as an essential part of the professional \n     development continuum. These trainings are often the bridge \n     to educational success for countless caregivers. Without \n     these trainings, many would not have the confidence to enter \n     the higher education environment.\n       The language regarding the implementation of the public \n     awareness and parental information campaigns is particularly \n     intriguing, because this has been a core function of resource \n     and referral since long before any significant public \n     resources became available for this purpose.\n       We promise to continue working with you to ensure that the \n     bill is a success. Thank you for your unwavering commitment \n     to the children and their families all across our great \n     nation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Marta Rosa,\n       President, NACCRRA Board of Directors.\n     Yasmina Vinci,\n       Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      May 9, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, Senate Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \n         Senate Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy and Senator Gregg: Scholastic Inc. \n     writes in enthusiastic support of the Early Care and \n     Education Act, and we share your goal to ensure that our \n     youngest children reach school ready to learn. We first want \n     to applaud your tremendous recent efforts on elementary and \n     secondary education and the Leave No Child Behind Act. This \n     Act will have an enormous impact on the lives and education \n     of our children and the quality of teaching across the \n     country. We hope that bipartisanship in the Congress, and \n     with the Bush Administration, on funding for education and \n     children will continue with the same energy and focus on \n     preschool and early education. In this present effort \n     Scholastic extends its full support and resources to you and \n     your staff to help reach parents, children, and early \n     educators on the importance of early childhood issues.\n       Scholastic Inc., the global children's publishing and media \n     company, throughout its history has had a corporate mission \n     of instilling the love of reading and learning in all \n     children. Recognizing that literacy is the cornerstone of a \n     child's intellectual, personal, and cultural growth, \n     Scholastic has created quality products to educate, entertain \n     and motivate children. We have long understood the importance \n     of focusing on the needs of the whole child during early \n     childhood and we know that what we do for our children in \n     their earliest formative years, sets the foundation for \n     success or failure in school and in life. This legislation \n     has the potential to better prepare the next generation of \n     children to be ready to learn when they enter school.\n       We strongly agree that one of keys to promoting school \n     readiness is to develop and retain a well-educated and \n     trained early childhood workforce. Scholastic has focused on \n     the area of professional development for early childhood \n     teachers and caregivers and has been a pioneer in developing \n     scientifically based early childhood instructional materials, \n     including education technology.\n       Scholastic offers its services and resources to be part of \n     the legislation's public/private campaign for early childhood \n     and early literacy. Scholastic's magazines, Early Childhood \n     today and Parent & Child, book clubs, and web site reach \n     millions of teachers and parents across the country. \n     Additionally, Scholastic works with libraries and literacy \n     programs across the country. We would like to leverage these \n     unique relationships and communication channels to deliver \n     your message.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on issues of importance \n     to children and families.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Richard Robinson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        New York, NY, May 8, 2002.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor \n         and Pensions, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: We at Child Care Action Campaign \n     write to express our support for The Early Care and Education \n     Act that we understand you plan to introduce in the Senate \n     later this week.\n       We do so with unreserved support for the bill's three \n     stated purposes: to encourage States to improve the quality \n     and availability of early learning opportunities and \n     activities for young children; to develop and retain a well-\n     educated and trained early childhood workforce and to promote \n     school preparedness. All of these are necessary if we are to \n     assure that our nation's children will have the social, \n     emotional and behavioral skills necessary to enter and \n     succeed in school. And, that they will bring with them to the \n     schoolhouse door the appropriate level of early cognitive and \n     literacy development to support success in reading and other \n     academic requirements.\n       For the past nearly twenty years, Child Care Action \n     Campaign has had as its vision: quality, affordable child \n     care for every American family that needs it. In pursuing \n     this vision we have helped to build national public awareness \n     and support for improved early education. To take the next \n     giant steps, however, requires more than advocacy and public \n     education. It will require significant investment by the \n     Federal government and the States. It will also demand the \n     use of effective strategies to improve the training and \n     compensation of the early childhood workforce, the ultimate \n     source of quality in our nation's preschool classrooms.\n       The level of investment proposed in your bill, combined \n     with the strong signal it sends abut the importance of early \n     care and education for our nation's youngest citizens, is a \n     critical next step. We are particularly pleased that, under \n     Sec. 9, Use of Funds, the very first use listed is the one we \n     see as the key to the changes that must be made for our \n     children--that is, to encourage states to use funds under \n     this Act for education, training and professional development \n     for early childhood professionals, including training that is \n     linked to increased compensation.\n       We are also encouraged that you plan to establish an \n     independent panel of experts to provide guidance to the \n     States in the important task of assessing progress and that \n     this panel will identify for States' use the best science-\n     based methods and measures.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with your staff to \n     achieve effective implementation. Thank you for what you \n     personally have done to put your considerable passion and \n     credibility to the service of the nation's children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Faith Wohl,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         Smart Start and the North Carolina Partnership for \n           Children,\n                                                      May 9, 2002.\n     Senator Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the North Carolina \n     Partnership for children and Smart Start, thank you for your \n     exemplary support of young children as reflected in your \n     recently proposed legislation. We applaud your outstanding \n     leadership and believe that this legislation will \n     dramatically improve the early care and education system in \n     our state and throughout the nation.\n       Thank you for your willingness to listen and learn from the \n     pioneer work we have done since the Smart Start legislation \n     was passed in 1993 as reflected in your visit here and \n     ongoing communication with your staff. While North Carolina \n     has made unparalleled progress in building a high quality \n     early childhood system and getting results for young \n     children, we have much further to go. With your continued \n     leadership and support we will reach our goal that every \n     child in our state arrives at school healthy and prepared for \n     success in school and in life.\n       Thank you for your dedication and the commitment you made \n     in proposing this landmark legislation. We look forward to \n     working with you on behalf of children. Please continue to be \n     our nation's champion for young children.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  Karen W.

Judd Gregg, Ranking Member,\n     U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education and Pensions, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy and Gregg: Thank you for your work to \n     produce the ``Early Care and Education Act''. This letter is \n     to communicate the Parents as Teachers National Center's \n     (PATNC) support for the Act.\n       There is sound evidence that the first few years of life \n     are the most critical to the healthy social, cognitive, \n     language, and physical development which propels children to \n     success in school and in their lives as adults. Most children \n     spend those early years in the care of their parents, who are \n     their first and most influential teachers, but also with \n     other care providers. The Early Care and Education Act is a \n     realistic attempt to strengthen the capacity of both parents \n     and care providers to promote school readiness by a unified \n     approach of encouraging highly interactive, developmentally \n     appropriate opportunities for very young children to learn \n     and strengthening the quality of the early childhood \n     workplace.\n       Along with other positive provisions of the Early Care and \n     Education Act, we are particularly pleased that there is \n     recognition of the various systems and entities involved in \n     providing services to young children and\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\n     their families and the need to unite these players in common \n     goals and in transition to the school systems which will take \n     over as children grow older. The proposed Joint Office of \n     Early Care and Education at the federal level and similar \n     structures at the state level will model this recognition and \n     create a means to bring it to fruition.\n       Again, we are most grateful for the intent of the Early \n     Care and Education Act and the positive focus it will provide \n     on the needs of our youngest and most vulnerable citizens to \n     be ready to succeed in school and in life.\n           Most sincerely,\n                                               Susan S. Stepleton,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Committee for Economic\n\n\n                                                  Development,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n      U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the Committee for Economic \n     Development (CED), I would like to commend you on your \n     ``Early Care and Education Act.'' CED strongly supports the \n     goal of providing increased early learning opportunities to \n     all children.\n       As a nonprofit, non-partisan public policy organization \n     comprised of over 200 business and education leaders, CED has \n     long promoted the economic benefits of improving the \n     education of our nation's youth. CED identified early \n     childhood education as particularly crucial in our 1993 \n     study, Why Childcare Matters and our recent policy statement, \n     Preschool for All: Investing In a Productive and Just \n     Society. We wholeheartedly agree with your findings that the \n     pre-kindergarten period is a critical juncture when young \n     children develop cognitively and socially, and therefore \n     benefit substantially from mental stimulation and education. \n     CED supports the goal of the legislation to facilitate \n     cooperation between federal and state governments in creating \n     high-quality and childcare and education systems that ensure \n     that all children enter school ready to learn.\n       Promoting school preparedness among children is vital to \n     their future success and benefits society as a whole. In \n     order to accomplish this goal, a stable, well-educated, and \n     appropriately paid childcare and early education workforce is \n     necessary, with ample opportunities for professional \n     development and training. Increased research and \n     dissemination of best practices from among successful \n     programs is also essential. We are pleased that the \n     legislation includes provisions for addressing these \n     requirements.\n       CED believes that it is imperative that the current \n     haphazard, piecemeal, and under-funded approach to early care \n     and learning in this country be replaced by coherent state-\n     based systems linking programs and providers, with the goal \n     being universal access to high-quality prekindergarten \n     programs for all children whose parents want them to \n     participate. Your legislation represents a step in the right \n     direction and we support your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles E.M. Kolb,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         California Children and Families Commission and I Am Your \n           Child Foundation,\n                                  Beverly Hills, CA, May 14, 2002.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to express my support \n     for the Early Care and Education Act that you plan to \n     introduce this week. I commend you, the Bill's co-sponsors, \n     and your colleagues for taking this important step to benefit \n     our nation's youngest citizens and to help provide all \n     children with the support, care, and tools they need to enter \n     school ready to succeed.\n       Based on my experiences as Chairman of the California \n     Children and Families Commission, as President and Founder of \n     the I Am Your Child Foundation, and as a parent of three \n     young children, I can assure you that increased public \n     investment in early childhood development, parenting, and \n     child care pays off. Investments in the early years yield \n     dividends that last a lifetime: children who are nurtured and \n     taught by caring and capable caregivers, both inside and \n     outside the home, are more likely to enter school ready to \n     succeed, and are ultimately more likely to enter our \n     communities as productive, healthy, and engaged citizens.\n       Indeed, in recent years, developments in science and public \n     policy have confirmed what many of us as parents and \n     caregivers have long known instinctively; the experiences of \n     children in their earliest years have a profound effect on \n     the way children grow and develop, and they establish the \n     foundation for future success both in school and in life. We \n     now know, without doubt, that secure and loving attachments \n     with parents and other caregivers, coupled with the right \n     kind of developmental experiences, instill in children the \n     social, emotional and cognitive abilities they need to \n     thrive.\n       Quite simply, there is no more significant public \n     investment we can make in our nation's future than in early \n     childhood development, and that is the main focus of the new \n     Early Care and Education Act. Many facts of the Bill are \n     deserving of praise, but I would like to focus on those \n     features that I believe will make the largest difference in \n     the lives of our nation's youngest children:\n       First, the Bill recognizes that parents are our children's \n     first teachers, and offers ground-breaking support for \n     initiatives that promote parent education and provide \n     information to parents on child development and age-\n     appropriate activities that improve children's social, \n     emotional, cognitive and physical development. The Bill also \n     enables States to conduct public education campaigns to \n     increase public awareness of early childhood development and \n     specific activities that can help children reach social, \n     emotional, and cognitive milestones critical to school \n     readiness. From what I have seen in States across the \n     country, from California to Pennsylvania, parent education \n     and public awareness efforts can make a tremendous difference \n     in the lives of young children. The more reliable and \n     responsible child development information the public, \n     particularly parents, receive, the better caregivers parents \n     become.\n       Second, the Bill recognizes the need for significant \n     investment in workforce development that is linked to \n     increased compensation, improved recruitment and retention, \n     and stable career ladders for early childcare workers. If we \n     truly believe in investing in our children, we must make \n     meaningful investments in those entrusted with their care. We \n     must strengthen the knowledge and skills of those who teach \n     and care for our youngest children, and that can only happen \n     by increasing training, skills, and wages.\n       Third, the Bill recognizes that early childhood education \n     must be part of the overall K-12 education system. I am \n     extremely pleased to see that both the Departments of \n     Education and Health and Human Services will play a role in \n     administering the act, and that States' plans will include a \n     description of how States will create linkages between formal \n     early care and early education programs and elementary \n     education programs to ensure a smooth transition from \n     preschool to elementary school. In addition, I am delighted \n     that the State Advisory Councils, charged with conducting \n     local needs assessments and developing State plans, will \n     include a wide array of individuals involved in early, \n     elementary, and higher education--from parents to early \n     childhood education professionals, to kindergarten teachers, \n     to teachers in grades 1 through 4, to representatives from \n     institutions of higher learning. This linkage is critical to \n     creating a seamless system of education for our children from \n     birth through grade 12.\n       Fourth, the Bill recognizes that investments in early \n     childhood development should not focus on literally alone, \n     but must encompass the full developmental spectrum, including \n     cognitive, social, emotional and physical development \n     beginning at birth. This critical points is understood by the \n     multi-disciplinary approach the Bill embraces in composing \n     State Advisory Councils. In addition, the Bill highlights the \n     multi-dimensional development needs of our children who are \n     most at-risk, and bolsters investment in children living in \n     poverty, for whom early care, education, and intervention are \n     especially crucial.\n       Finally, the Bill goes a long way in addressing the problem \n     of linking public funding to assessments of children's school \n     readiness. While the bonus grant provisions of the Bill may \n     be controversial, they do not represent the type of \n     ``child testing'' that I believe is most problematic. As \n     the Bill provides, only 20 percent of funding may be used \n     as bonuses linked to assessment, the assessment tools will \n     be developed over time by independent experts, and the \n     assessments themselves will be limited to kindergarten \n     children (not preschoolers). Moreover, the assessment \n     results may not be used to identify or track children or \n     to determine kindergarten eligibility or retention. In \n     addition, under the Bill, no bonus grants are to be \n     awarded until the third year, which allows time for system \n     building and workforce development, and the third year \n     bonuses are based solely on evidence of increased \n     workforce capacity and retention.\n       In sum, I strongly believe the Early Care and Education Act \n     will make significant strides in the care and education of \n     our nation's youngest children. Increased public investment \n     in child development is critical for our children and for our \n     country. I commend you for your strong leadership on this \n     issue and your tireless work on behalf of the children of \n     America. I am proud to offer you my support.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rob Reiner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Yale University,\n\n\n                                     Department of Psychology,\n\n                                      New Haven, Ct, May 10, 2002.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I would like to voice my strong \n     support for the Early Care and Education Act. As the Sterling \n     Professor of Psychology at Yale University and head of the \n     Psychology Section of the Yale Child Study Center, I direct \n     the Bush Center in Child Development and Social Policy. As \n     someone who has studied the growth and development of \n     children for over 45 years, I believe this legislation will \n     further efforts to improve the lives and early experiences \n     for our nation's youngest children. As I noted in my \n     testimony before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions Committee earlier this spring, the quality of early \n     care and education provided to most children in this nation \n     is poor to mediocre. Millions of\n\n[[Page S4857]]\n\n     infants and toddlers--at the very ages when development is so \n     critical--are spending their days in the care of untrained \n     and poorly compensated teachers.\n       The Early Care and Education Act focuses on the two biggest \n     issues confronting the field of early education--the lack of \n     an organized and systematic approach to early care and \n     education, and the lack of trained and well compensated \n     teachers. We must address these issues to ensure that all \n     children arrive at our schools prepared to learn. If we want \n     sound educational programs, we simply must provide well-\n     trained teachers to implement them.\n       I compliment you on the comprehensive nature of the bill. \n     While I wholeheartedly agree that congnitive development and \n     literacy are important goals, I have repeatedly pointed out \n     that they are so interwined with the physical, social and \n     emotional systems that it is futile to dwell on the intellect \n     and exclude the other domains of development. Your bill \n     supports the whole child concept and I applaud you for this \n     approach. Decades of cumulative research shows that early \n     emotional risk factors that go unaddressed, will result in \n     later school failure, poor peer relationships, and later \n     costly interventions. Phonemic instruction by the most \n     competent teacher will do little for a child whose physical, \n     emotional and social needs have not been met. The best way to \n     promote the healthy development of children is to help the \n     adults in their lives be more effective in responding to \n     their needs.\n       I commend you for continuing to leadership on behalf of \n     children.

Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Reading Is Fundamental, Inc. (RIF) is \n     pleased to support the bipartisan Early Care and Education \n     Act, with its laudable emphasis on the creation of strong \n     support systems and educational resources to help ensure that \n     all children, especially those most at-risk for educational \n     failure, receive literacy services at the earliest possible \n     ages.\n       RIF shares with you the conviction that the social, \n     academic and cognitive development of America's children \n     depends in large measure on the degree to which they \n     experience nurturing environments during the first six years \n     of life. It is vitally important that families and caregivers \n     receive the resources, information and motivation necessary \n     to prepare children to be successful, life-long learners and \n     readers. RIF believes that this legislation can play an \n     important role in shaping a national approach to more \n     effective childcare and early childhood education.\n       One of the strengths of this legislation is its recognition \n     of the variety of settings in which our youngest children are \n     cared for. This comprehensive approach, acknowledging both \n     care in the home and outside the home, has long been a part \n     of RIF's programmatic activity. For example, RIF has \n     developed a training program for childcare providers called \n     Care To Read, which provides instruction on ways to integrate \n     emergent literacy development into a variety of childcare \n     settings. This program is based on research such as the \n     National Reading Panel's report on Preventing Reading \n     Difficulties In Young Children and Dr. Susan B. Neuman's \n     study, Access For All. The growing research regarding \n     emergent literacy support and reading readiness confirms the \n     need to accelerate and broaden efforts to include literacy \n     activities in all child care settings, including those that \n     have not traditionally offered it. The critical need to train \n     child care workers to offer literacy activities is reflected \n     in the legislation and is fully supported by RIF.\n       Also consistent with the legislation's goals, RIF, through \n     RIFNet, our distance learning initiative, is developing a \n     six-part video and online training program on emergent \n     literacy issues for early-childhood caregivers, teachers, \n     parents and other important adult influences in children's \n     lives. A companion series on developmentally appropriate \n     children's literature will support this effort to bolster \n     early-childhood literacy development nationwide.\n       Without doubt, this is a critical time in our nation's \n     history, when 38 percent of fourth-graders read below grade \n     level, including 58 percent of Hispanic and 63 percent of \n     African-American children. RIF looks forward to working \n     closely with the Department of Education, members of \n     Congress, and communities across the nation to ensure that \n     the youngest Americans have access to books and that \n     essential literacy services are available in all settings, \n     both formal and informal, where young children are cared for.\n       We support your efforts to enact this important legislation \n     and thank you for your steadfast support of children's \n     education and health issues. RIF, with its network of 400,000 \n     volunteers at 20,000 sites across the country, it prepared to \n     be an active resource in support of this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Carol H.

Kennedy: I am writing to you and to \n     Senator Judd Gregg to state my endorsement of the Early Care \n     and Education bill. It promises to be a significant step \n     forward in improving the coordination of early childhood \n     efforts at the state level and in strengthening curricula to \n     foster children's overall development with specific attention \n     to their cognitive and language growth. Perhaps most \n     important, it provides the momentum to assist states in their \n     efforts to improve the qualify of early childhood staff.\n       I am pleased to have had the opportunity to testify on \n     behalf of this legislation and to participate in the \n     preparation of its drafts. If I can be of further help, I can \n     be reached at the locations listed in the letterhead.\n     Dorothy S. Strickland.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Child Care Resource Center,\n\n                                       Cambridge, MA, May 9, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: As Executive Director of Child Care \n     Resource Center, Inc. (CCRC), one of 15 state contracted \n     child care resource and referral agencies in Massachusetts, I \n     would like to commend you on the goals and purposes of the \n     Early Care and Education Act.\n       The Child Care Resource Center has actively participated in \n     assisting many different system-building efforts in the \n     Commonwealth. Therefore, I am pleased that your legislation \n     encourages states to think and plan comprehensively about \n     improving the quality of early care and education by \n     addressing such systemic needs as: professional development, \n     compensation, program guidelines, information and support for \n     parents, and promoting public awareness campaigns. I am also \n     pleased about the fact that the Act offers a state's governor \n     the ability to designate an existing entity as the advisory \n     council and the focus on enhancing the effectiveness of \n     existing delivery systems--both are critical elements because \n     they will inhibit duplication of services.\n       By advancing the concept of a unified, seamless plan that \n     coordinates the federal funding that a state receives from \n     various sources, the Act is working to provide a robust \n     complement to the quality-enhancing activities currently \n     funded by the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), \n     which I and other child care advocates in Massachusetts are \n     working to ensure is increased significantly during this \n     year's reauthorization.\n       In the section on State Plans, I appreciate the recognition \n     of community-based training that is not provided for course \n     credit as an essential part of the professional development \n     continuum. Community-based trainings are often the bridge to \n     educational success for countless caregivers. Without these \n     trainings, many would not have the confidence to enter the \n     higher education environment. The language regarding the \n     implementation of the public awareness and parent-focused \n     information campaigns is particularly intriguing, because \n     this has been a core function of resource and referral since \n     long before any significant public resources became available \n     for this purpose.\n       I will continue working with you to ensure that the bill is \n     a success. Thank you for your commitment and dedication to \n     ensuring that quality services are available to the children \n     and their families all across our great nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Marta T.

Ted Kennedy and Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy and Gregg: On behalf of the licensed, \n     private providers of quality early childhood education, \n     members of the Child Care Consortium and the National Child \n     Care Association, I am writing to commend your efforts to \n     build a strong early childhood education system with the \n     development of the Early Care and Education Act. The Child \n     Care Consortium encourages you to continue seeking ways to \n     create a framework for a strong system of quality care and \n     education, one that leverages and complements the existing \n     child care delivery system.\n       The Early Care and Education Act recognizes that a \n     disciplined approach for building resources and quality goals \n     around a fully funded child care system is important. This \n     includes aligning the preschool learning experience with \n     kindergarten and elementary grade expectations, undertaking \n     meaningful needs assessments, which should include an \n     analysis of capacities and capabilities of existing system \n     resources, and a strong workforce development plan, which \n     must include both training, appropriate to the field, and \n     compensation, competitive in local markets. This also \n     includes providing quality guidelines for parents and \n     creating measurable goals for state efforts. The Child Care \n     Consortium also supports the establishment of a Joint Office \n     of Early Care and Education and full involvement of \n     stakeholders in state Advisory Councils to assist states with \n     identifying needs and developing state plans. Finally, we \n     strongly recommend that states be\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\n     encouraged to develop a single, unified Early Care and \n     Education/CCDBG plan.\n       A framework for driving quality will help ensure that \n     program expenditures in fact enhance quality. Many states \n     have used their quality dollars well and some initiatives \n     have served as models for other states. We think your \n     approach to creating a strong framework for quality is \n     particularly important to ensure that every dollar not used \n     for providing direct assistance to families or creating \n     deeper subsidies through meaningful levels of reimbursements, \n     show real results for quality early childhood education and \n     development.\n       Licensed private providers of early childhood education are \n     an essential part of the delivery of quality child care and \n     education opportunities for communities across the nation. \n     Important to our ability to offer quality programming are \n     resources for elements of quality such as professional \n     development and training, effective recruitment and \n     retention, and competitive teacher compensation. The system \n     elements authorized by the Early Care and Education Act will \n     help. Also important for driving quality are adequate funding \n     for child care assistance that will allow families to \n     purchase high quality care and education and reimbursement \n     rates that compensate providers for the full cost of \n     providing quality programming represent, allowing providers \n     to make greater investments in these elements of quality.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Frank Moore,\n     Government Relations Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  First Steps,\n\n                                        Columbia, SC, May 9, 2002.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing in strong support of the \n     Early Care and Education bill that you are proposing, which I \n     have had the opportunity to review this week. As the Director \n     of South Carolina's early childhood initiative, South \n     Carolina First Steps to School Readiness, I feel that this \n     bill directly complements our efforts to ensure that all \n     South Carolina children arrive at first grade ready to \n     succeed in school.\n       This bill, if enacted, would directly build on and support \n     the cross-agency collaboratives we have developed at both the \n     state and county levels. As you know, to achieve school \n     readiness requires a holistic approach to all the domains \n     that affect a child's readiness--cognitive, social and \n     developmental. This bill clearly recognizes the need to \n     support all of those domains.\n       I am also pleased with the bill's focus on training for \n     early childhood professionals and the inclusion of funding \n     for public awareness. We have undertaken both of those \n     initiatives in South Carolina, but limited funds have \n     restricted the scope of what we are able to do at present. We \n     would welcome the opportunity to expand our efforts if this \n     bill is enacted.\n       If you have any questions about our efforts in South \n     Carolina, please do not hestitate to contact me. I may be \n     reached at 803-734-0391. Thank you for your leadership in \n     developing this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Marie-Louise Ramsdale,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Statement of Support for the Early Care and Education Act\n\n                      (By Jack P. Shonkoff, M.D.)\n\n       I am happy to convey my strong support for the proposed \n     Early Care and Education Act. This support is based on the \n     extent to which the bill is informed by the science of early \n     childhood development, as well as on my 20 years of \n     experience as a pediatrician deeply engaged in the delivery \n     of a wide range of services for young children ``on the \n     ground.''\n       Among the many features of the proposed legislation, the \n     following are particularly important and worthy of broad and \n     enthusiastic endorsement:\n       First, the bill addresses the most pressing challenge \n     facing all early childhood programs--the need for significant \n     investment in staff education and training that is linked to \n     increased compensation, improved recruitment and retention, \n     and a career ladder. Stated simply, in order to close the gap \n     between what we know and what we do to support parents and \n     promote healthy child development, we must strengthen the \n     knowledge and skills of those who provide early care and \n     education.\n       Second, the bill recognizes that wise investments in early \n     learning must begin at birth.\n       Third, the bill acknowledges the importance of a \n     comprehensive, knowledge-based approach to early childhood \n     development, with comparable attention to its cognitive, \n     language, social, emotional, and physical dimensions, as well \n     as to the foundations of early literacy.\n       Fourth, the bill provides incentives for states to engage \n     in an integrated planning process designed to reduce the \n     universally criticized fragmentation that characterizes our \n     patchwork systems of early care and education programs, \n     including interventions for young children with special needs \n     and those at high risk for school difficulties.\n       Clearly, the most contentious issue that has arisen in the \n     formulation of this bill has been the concept of bonus grants \n     and its linkage to the assessment of school readiness in \n     children. Early in the negotiation process, I found myself in \n     strong agreement with the legitimate concerns of those who \n     warned about the potential adverse impacts of ``high stakes'' \n     child testing on the providers of early care and education, \n     the children themselves, and the entire early childhood \n     environment. Despite these caveats, which remain real, I \n     believe in the value of incentives, the importance of \n     accountability focused ultimately on whether children are \n     doing better as a result of our efforts, and the need to \n     make sure that both the concept and the implementation of \n     child performance assessment are guided primarily by \n     knowledge and not by politics.\n       In this context, it is my strong belief that the key issue \n     is not whether we should assess child outcomes, but how and \n     when they should be measured, and what protections can be \n     built into the process to prevent unintended, adverse \n     consequences. Thus, although the ultimate implementation of \n     any system of child evaluation must be undertaken with great \n     care and vigilance, I believe that the proposed legislation \n     has many important features that provide a strong framework \n     for a sound incentive model. The basis for my support is the \n     following:\n       No bonus grants are awarded until the third year, which \n     allows sufficient time for the actual interventions (i.e., \n     system building and investments in workforce development) to \n     be implemented before their impact is measured.\n       Initial bonus grants will be awarded in the third year \n     based on evidence of increased workforce capacity and \n     retention, which is the bill's most important strategy for \n     improving the quality of early care and education, as a \n     necessary vehicle for enhancing child outcomes.\n       The award of bonus grants based on improved child outcomes \n     does not begin until the fourth year, at which point it is \n     reasonable to expect that the investments of the first three \n     years will begin to show measurable impacts on children's \n     school readiness.\n       The indicators of school readiness are viewed \n     comprehensively and include cognitive, language, social, \n     emotional, and physical dimensions, and not just a focus on \n     early literacy.\n       The responsibility for identifying key indicators of school \n     readiness and a selection of scientifically reliable and \n     valid measurement options is assigned to an independent panel \n     of experts outside of the political process.\n       Multiple conditions are specified in the bill to minimize \n     potential abuse of the assessment process and to protect \n     children from the consequences of a high-stakes testing \n     environment (i.e., assessments restricted to kindergarten \n     children; no testing of preschoolers; prohibitions against \n     mandatory developmental screening against parental wishes; \n     and prohibitions against the use of assessment data to \n     identify or track individuals or to determine kindergarten \n     eligibility or retention)\n       The bill includes an innovative provision for bonus grants \n     to support demonstration projects in states that have not \n     documented improved child outcomes, guided by the lessons \n     learned in states that have achieved measurable gains, which \n     establishes the critically important precedent of recognizing \n     the value of using accountability processes to improve \n     policies and practices and not to stigmatize individual \n     programs.\n       In summary, I believe that the proposed legislation will \n     advance the health development and well-being of our nation's \n     young children, and I would be happy to provide any \n     additional input that could be helpful.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Boston University School\n\n\n                                                  of Medicine,\n\n                                          Boston, MA, May 8, 2002.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I enthusiastically welcome the \n     ``Early Care and Education Act'' that you and Senator Gregg \n     introduced before the U.S. Senate this week.\n       In my years as a pediatrician, I have witnessed the wide-\n     ranging impact of poverty on thousands of families, \n     particularly as it relates to the healthy development of \n     children. The most important lesson that I've learned is that \n     only a truly comprehensive strategy--comprised of a wide \n     variety of interventions, employing the energies, enthusiasm \n     and expertise of many professions--can provide the strong web \n     of support that the most vulnerable families need to support \n     the healthy development of their children.\n       The Early Care and Education Act puts this lesson into \n     practice. I am particularly excited and encouraged by the \n     role this bill envisions for healthcare providers, \n     pediatricians in particular, to support parents as their \n     children's first teacher. By allowing states to use funds \n     from this bill to both train healthcare professionals to \n     conduct developmental assessments, and support of voluntary \n     programs such as Reach Out and Read, the Early Care and \n     Education Act brings enlists the participation of an \n     important ally.\n       As pediatricians, we have faith and confidence that much of \n     the guidance and advice that we give to parents helps parents \n     help their children. But Reach Out and Read, a program that \n     we are now successfully implementing in a wide variety of \n     healthcare settings across the country, is the only primary \n     care-based intervention that has been shown by scientific \n     evidence, to improve a child's\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\n     development outcome. ROR's inclusion in statewide efforts \n     will be a wonderful, and proven, complement to existing \n     infrastructure of early care and education.\n       I thank you for the leadership you continue to show in \n     supporting parents in their efforts to help their children \n     grow up healthy. We look forward to helping in any way we \n     can.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Barry Zuckerman, MD,\n\n                                    Chief and Chairman, Department\n     of Pediatrics.\n                                  ____\n\n\nThe Following People Will Respond to Questions About the Early Care and \n                             Education Bill\n\n       Dr. Jack Shonkoff MD, Dean of the Heller School of Social \n     Policy at Brandeis University and Chair of the National \n     Academy of Sciences Panel on Integrating The Science of Early \n     Childhood Development, Waltham, MA 02454.\n       Ed Zigler, PhD, Sterling Professor of Psychology, Yale \n     University, New Haven, CT 06520.\n       Art Steller, PhD, President/CEO, High Scope Educational \n     Research Foundation, Ypsilanti, MI 48198.\n       Dorothy Strickland, PhD, Professor of Reading, Rutgers \n     University, New Brunswick, NJ.\n       Craig Ramey, PhD, Professor, Georgetown University, \n     Washington, DC.\n       Faith Wohl, President, Child Care Action Campaign, New \n     York, New York 10001.\n       Rob Reiner, President, I AM Your Child Foundation, Beverly \n     Hills, CA 90210.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in 1989, President Bush challenged our \nNation and our Nation's governors to do two things: first, to develop a \nstrategy to improve our educational system and thereby the academic \nperformance of our Nation's students and second, to work toward the \ngoals that all children would enter school ready to learn.\n  Well, the first part of the challenge was realized with the landmark \nreforms made earlier this year in the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. With its passage, we have taken significant, if not \nmonumental, steps to improve the education of our K-12 students.\n  The second part of the challenge, that all children would enter \nschool ready to learn remains, and has now become, the focus of our \nattention.\n  The President has taken the first step by launching his ``Good start, \nGrow Smart'' Early Childhood Initiative. Following the President's \nlead, Senator Kennedy and I are today introducing the Early Care and \nEducation Act.\n  This legislation will hopefully bring together many of the Federal, \nState and local efforts already underway in the area of early \neducation. The United States currently invests more than $18 billion \nper year in early childhood care and education through a variety of \nFederal, State, and local programs. Unfortunately, we are seeing very \nmixed results. Many children continue to enter school unprepared to \nlearn, despite our best efforts. And despite this significant current \ninvestment of resources, 85 percent of child care is of poor to \nmediocre quality.\n  This says to me that we need to spend our funds more wisely, and to \ntarget them more effectively at what works. That is what the Early Care \nand Education bill will do.\n  Under ECEA, we will ask states to do seven basic things as a \ncondition for receiving an incentive grant:\n  One, blend and coordinate existing early learning resources; two, \nidentify barriers which prevent them from fully utilizing Federal, \nState, an local public and private funds for early care and early \neducation; three, promulgate voluntary program guidelines for early \ncare and early education programs in the State; four, develop general \ngoals for school preparedness for children entering kindergarten; five, \nprovide a list of suggested activities for parents and care-givers to \noffer young children that can improve children's school preparedness; \nsix, establish a workforce development plan that ensures comprehensive \ntraining for early childhood education professionals that is linked to \na compensation package; and seven, ensure that this training uses \ncurricula that will prepare early childhood professionals to \neffectively implement curricula identified as scientifically based and \neffective to prepare young children to succeed in school.\n  Then, to make sure States are actually making measured improvement in \nattaining their goals and performance measures, we set aside 20 percent \nof the funds appropriated for bonus grants to high performing states. \nStates that are making measured improvement in improving the \ncompetencies of early learning professionals in the state and in the \noverall school readiness of their kindergartners will be eligible for \nthis bonus, which becomes effective when appropriation levels reach \n$500 million.\n  This is significant and is somewhat of a departure form what \nWashington is used to. But we must no longer settle for programs that \nare untested and unaccountable to the American taxpayer for results. \nOur children, especially our disadvantaged children deserve better.\n  Under the ECEA, States will have the flexibility to identify, target \nand fund the most significant needs in their own states. They will be \nrequired to recognize and include parents as equal partners in the \neducation of young children and respect the choices parents make to use \nor not use out-of-home child care or preschool settings.\n  They will be asked to set specific goals for school readiness and \nworkforce improvement and then will be held accountable for reaching \nthem. They will have the assistance of a National Panel of Experts in \ndeveloping these goals and measures and the resources of the \nDepartments of Education and Health and Human Services who will be \nrequired to work together, jointly, to administer this program. The \nlargest investments in child care and early education are scattered \nthroughout these two agencies and it is absolutely essential that they \nwork together to effectively meet the needs of working families and \nyoung children. This is unprecedented but it must happen.\n  Let me conclude my saying that I am very excited about this \nlegislation and encouraged by the willingness of members of both sides \nof the isle to work together for the good of the children to create a \nsystem where No Child Will be Left Behind. I am hope that by working \ntogether in partnership with parents, and States we will make great \nstrides in preparing our young children for school. I look forward to \nour continued dialogue on this issue and to moving this legislation \nthrough the Congress and to the President.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Early Care \nand Education Act of 2002 which was introduced today by Chairman \nKennedy. I am proud to have been invited by him to work on this \nlegislation, together with the ranking member of the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Gregg, and the other \ndistinguished cosponsors.\n  Early childhood development is a true passion of mine. In fact, one \nof the first bills I introduced when I came to the Senate in 1999 was \nan early childhood development bill targeting children from prenatal \nthrough age three. And the following year I was pleased to work with \nSenators Stevens and Kennedy on the Early Learning Opportunities Act.\n  Leading researchers from the distinguished National Research Council \nand Institute of Medicine emphasize that the first years of a child's \nlife are the most important time in a child's development in terms of \nsocialization and brain synapses, both of which are necessary for \nlearning.\n  As a fiscal conservative, I believe that one of the best investments \nthe federal government can make is in 0-3. Providing comprehensive \nearly care that includes physical, social, emotional and cognitive \ndevelopment makes a real difference in a child's future because it not \nonly prepares them for preschool, but also carries through to provide \nsuccess from K through 12.\n  I am encouraged that both the President and First Lady are working \nactively to raise the profile of this important bipartisan initiative \nthat will provide high-quality, comprehensive care for young children.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, I prioritized early childhood \ndevelopment, drawing a line in the sand and determining that our State \nwould not allow another generation of children to fall by the wayside. \nWe committed to meeting the health, education and social service needs \nof the disadvantaged from prenatal through kindergarten.\n  Ohio became the nation's leader in Head Start by fully-funding it--in \ncombination with other State programs, so that every eligible child had \na space if their parents choose it. Then we began local partnerships \nbetween government agencies and community organizations in every \ncounty, with the goal of having all children in Ohio starting school \nready to learn. I should also mention something we seem to forget, that \nthe\n\n[[Page S4860]]\n\nfirst goal of the national initiative launched in 1989, Goals 200, was \nthat by the year 2000, all children in America would start school ready \nto learn.\n  Ohio also launched Help Me Grow, an information campaign for parents \nof every income level regarding prenatal and well-baby care, child \ndevelopment, child safety, preventing child abuse and identifying local \nresources to help with all those issues that are so essential to \nraising a healthy child.\n  I was so impressed with the results we saw in Ohio that I agreed as \nvice-chairman of the National Governors Association to join with \nGovernor Miller of Nevada to make early childhood development a two-\nyear priority. This was the first time two consecutive chairmen of the \nNational Governors Association joined in having the same priority, \nencouraging States to focus on child development from 0-3. I also \nworked with Rob Reiner, who created and developed the I am Your Child \nFoundation, and who has done so much to raise awareness and provide \nassistance to parents for early child care.\n  The bill that Senators Kennedy, Gregg, Murray, and I are introducing \nwill build on what States such as Ohio have already done, coordinate \nefforts and target dollars to make a real difference for those young \nchildren who are the most vulnerable in our society.\n  The incentive grants in the bill will help states that have already \nstarted down this path provide higher quality services, but more \nimportantly, this bill will provide the catalyst for those States that \nhave not yet made early childhood development a priority. I'm amazed \ntoday that only 13 states have actually put State money into the Head \nStart program.\n  Unfortunately, for families in some states, there is no coordinated \nsystem that connects parents of young children to a network of \ninformation and resources for assistance with the comprehensive early \ncare a child needs to start school ready to learn.\n  By providing Federal dollars to help states coordinate their efforts, \nwe are drawing a line in the sand for the Nation and saying, ``This is \nthe generation that will have every child starting school ready to \nlearn.''\n  As a federalist, I believe states can and should have a big role in \nhelping make our Nation a better place to live. This bill provides the \nFederal-State partnership which is appropriate, avoids federally \nimposed one-size-fits-all solutions, and gives States the flexibility \nto find solutions that best fit their citizens' needs. I think the best \nevidence of how important that is, is the successful reform of this \ncountry's welfare system.\n  I've seen what works and I've seen what doesn't. I'm glad to be a \npart of the team to get this bill passed and I pray that my fellow \nSenators are inspired to understand how important this is to the future \nof America.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I join with Senators Kennedy, Gregg, \nMurray, and others in introducing the Early Care and Education Act. I \nam pleased to have worked on this legislation because I believe it is \nabsolutely critical that we do more on the Federal level to enhance \nearly childhood education throughout the country. Seventy four percent \nof children in out of home care had care that was classified as \nmediocre--meeting health and safety requirements but offering no \neducation or developmental benefits. Twelve percent were in places that \nwere considered unsafe and only 14 percent were considered good. this \nsituation is totally unacceptable.\n  The Early Care and Education Act would start to address this severe \nsituation by providing much needed funds for states to support a more \ncomprehensive, more high quality infrastructure for early care. It \nwould fund professional development for early care providers and \nprovide for wage incentive programs to ensure that providers get the \nsalaries they deserve. It would provide incentives to States to \nintegrate and coordinate services for your children. I am particularly \npleased that this legislation would also provide funding for parent \neducation programs such as the Early Childhood and Family Education \nprogram in Minnesota.\n  The ECFE program has been extraordinarily successful in my state. It \nis the largest early childhood program in Minnesota and is now offered \nin districts that together encompass 99 percent of the population of \ninfants and toddlers in the State. Forty four percent of all young \nchildren and their families participate in the program.\n  Four different studies of outcomes of the ECFE program have all \nconcluded that ECFE is effective with all types of families. Benefits \nfor children include improved social interactions and relationships, \nimproved social skills, increased self confidence and self-esteem, and \nimprovement in language and communication skills. For parents, ECFE \nincreases the ability to know what is important for children's healthy \ngrowth and development over time, improves their confidence and leads \nto far higher participation in parental involvement activities in \nelementary school.\n  A recent study by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement \nat the United States Department of Education has described the \nMinnesota ECFE program as an example of the type of program that can \nprovide children and families with ``continuity and [can] ease the \ncritical transition to school.'' That is the goal of the important \nlegislation we are introducing today.\n  Forty percent of all American children enter kindergarten unprepared \nfor school. This is unacceptable. We know that children need to be in a \nstimulating environment to spur the brain development that is critical \nto intelligence. This bill will move us in the direction of ensuring \nthat every child has access to better quality care by helping States \ndevelop an improved and integrated system of care. The academic \nachievement gap is greatest when children start school, so if we are \nserious about closing the achievement gap between poor and more \naffluent students, we must do more to intervene early. This bill is a \nstrong move in the right direction. I thank my colleagues for their \nexcellent work on this important issue.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators \nKennedy, Gregg, and Voinovich, to introduce the ``Early Education and \nCare Act,'' a bill to help improve the quality of early childhood \neducation.\n  We all know that our children are the most vulnerable and valuable \nmembers of our population. As the parents of eight and grandparents of \nseven, my wife, Fran and I know the responsibility, time, and \ndedication it takes to ensure that children B especially very young \nchildren, live in a stimulating environment that will enhance their \ndevelopment.\n  The first five years of a child's life are a time of momentous \nchange. Research shows that a child's brain size doubles between birth \nand age three. I remember my own children during this time, and it \nseemed like everyday they were learning and doing something for the \nfirst time--walking, crawling, or learning another new word. Kids are \nlike sponges, particularly at this early stage of life.\n  That's why education is such an important part of our children's \nlives, not just when they reach kindergarten, but really from the day \nthey are born. The bill we are introducing today would help reshape how \nstates and American families view child development. I have worked with \nthe other sponsors to ensure that information about the importance of \nchild development, age-appropriate activities, and activities that \nincrease a child's language and literacy development are all targeted \nat every home in Ohio and across the country. This information needs to \ngo to our childcare centers, libraries, and pediatrician offices.\n  Now, not every child less than five years of age goes to a formal \npre-school or childcare setting. But, they all go to the doctor and our \nmessage needs to be incorporated into well-baby visits and ordinary \ncheck ups. Our legislation would enable states to provide training to \nhealth care providers on conducting child development analyses as part \nof a routine physical examination.\n  Programs, such as ``Reach Out and Read,'' already have been \nsuccessful in using the health care profession to spread literacy. \n``Reach Out and Read'' gives books to parents to take home and share \nwith their children. Doctors that participate in this program have \nincorporated literacy and language development into questions during \nphysical evaluations, and they have emphasized the importance of \nliteracy to the parents.\n  Early learning programs play a pivotal role in preparing our children \nfor\n\n[[Page S4861]]\n\nkindergarten and beyond. First Lady Laura Bush has taken an important \nleadership role in this issue with her ``Ready to Read, Ready to \nLearn'' initiative, which has helped put early learning into the \nnational spotlight. For example, when she testified before the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, she described a great \ndiscrepancy that exists in our country. She explained that when \nchildren enter their kindergarten classrooms on the first day of \nschool, they are not all starting from the same point. Some children \nare much more advanced than others. Kindergarten teachers could tell \nyou on day one, which students received quality pre-primary education \nand which ones hadn't gone to a quality program or had ever been in an \neducational setting before.\n  Research shows that children who attend quality early childcare \nprograms when they were three or four years-old score better in math, \nlanguage, and on social skills development in early elementary school \nthan children who attend poor quality childcare programs. Furthermore, \nchildren in early learning programs with high quality teachers--\nteachers with associate degrees or bachelor degrees--do substantially \nbetter. Our legislation would create incentives for states to enable \nthose caring for our children to get the training and education they \nneed to best teach our very young children. I'm very pleased with what \nmy own home state of Ohio did in 1999, when we passed a law requiring \nthat every Head Start teacher by the year 2007, have at least an \nassociates degree in early childhood education. Currently, federal law \nmandates that only 50 percent of Head Start teachers have an associate \ndegree.\n  These are all very complex issues, Mr. President. We need to find a \nbalance between quality pre-primary education programs and ensuring \nthat we reach as many children and families as possible. The time has \ncome for a more comprehensive program B one that reaches all children \nright from the start. I believe our legislation accomplishes this task, \nand I encourage my colleagues to support this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2567. A bill to provide for equitable compensation of the Spokane \nTribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation in settlement of claims of \nthe Tribe concerning the contribution of the Tribe to the production of \nhydropower by the Grand Coulee Dam, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2567\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Spokane Tribe of Indians of \n     the Spokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable \n     Compensation Settlement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) from 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the \n     Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its \n     tributaries to determine sites at which power could be \n     produced at low cost;\n       (2) the Corps of Engineers--\n       (A) identified a number of sites, including the site at \n     which the Grand Coulee Dam is located; and\n       (B) recommended that power development at those sites be \n     performed by local governmental authorities or private \n     utilities under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et \n     seq.);\n       (3) under section 10(e) of that Act (16 U.S.C. 803(e)), a \n     licensee is required to compensate an Indian tribe for the \n     use of land under the jurisdiction of the Indian tribe;\n       (4) in August 1933, the Columbia Basin Commission, an \n     agency of the State of Washington, received a preliminary \n     permit from the Federal Power Commission for water power \n     development at the Grand Coulee site;\n       (5) in the mid-1930's, the Federal Government, which is not \n     subject to the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.)--\n       (A) federalized the Grand Coulee Dam project; and\n       (B) began construction of the Grand Coulee Dam;\n       (6) at the time at which the Grand Coulee Dam project was \n     federalized, the Federal Government recognized that the \n     Spokane Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n     Reservation had compensable interests in the Grand Coulee Dam \n     project, including compensation for--\n       (A) the development of hydropower;\n       (B) the extinguishment of a salmon fishery on which the \n     Spokane Tribe was almost completely financially dependent; \n     and\n       (C) the inundation of land with loss of potential power \n     sites previously identified by the Spokane Tribe;\n       (7) in the Act of June 29, 1940, Congress--\n       (A) in the first section (16 U.S.C. 835d) granted to the \n     United States--\n       (i) all rights of Indian tribes in land of the Spokane \n     Tribe and Colville Indian Reservations that were required for \n     the Grand Coulee Dam project; and\n       (ii) various rights-of-way over other land under the \n     jurisdiction of Indian tribes that were required in \n     connection with the project; and\n       (B) in section 2 (16 U.S.C. 835e) provided that \n     compensation for the land and rights-of-way was to be \n     determined by the Secretary of the Interior in such amounts \n     as the Secretary determined to be just and equitable;\n       (8) in furtherance of that Act, the Secretary of the \n     Interior paid--\n       (A) to the Spokane Tribe, $4,700; and\n       (B) to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, \n     $63,000;\n       (9) in 1994, following 43 years of litigation before the \n     Indian Claims Commission, the United States Court of Federal \n     Claims, and the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Federal Circuit, Congress ratified an agreement between the \n     Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and the \n     United States that provided for damages and annual payments \n     of $15,250,000 in perpetuity, adjusted annually, based on \n     revenues from the sale of electric power from the Grand \n     Coulee Dam project and transmission of that power by the \n     Bonneville Power Administration;\n       (10) in legal opinions issued by the Office of the \n     Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, a Task Force \n     Study conducted from 1976 to 1980 ordered by the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate, and hearings before Congress at \n     the time at which the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n     Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Settlement Act (Public Law 103-\n     436; 108 Stat. 4577) was enacted, it has repeatedly been \n     recognized that--\n       (A) the Spokane Tribe suffered damages similar to those \n     suffered by, and had a case legally comparable to that of, \n     the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation; but\n       (B) the 5-year statute of limitations under the Act of \n     August 13, 1946 (25 U.S.C. 70 et seq.) precluded the Spokane \n     Tribe from bringing a civil action for damages under that \n     Act;\n       (11) the inability of the Spokane Tribe to bring a civil \n     action before the Indian Claims Commission can be attributed \n     to a combination of factors, including--\n       (A) the failure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to carry \n     out its advisory responsibilities in accordance with that \n     Act; and\n       (B) an attempt by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to \n     impose improper requirements on claims attorneys retained by \n     Indian tribes, which caused delays in retention of counsel \n     and full investigation of the potential claims of the Spokane \n     Tribe;\n       (12) as a consequence of construction of the Grand Coulee \n     Dam project, the Spokane Tribe--\n       (A) has suffered the loss of--\n       (i) the salmon fishery on which the Spokane Tribe was \n     dependent;\n       (ii) identified hydropower sites that the Spokane Tribe \n     could have developed; and\n       (iii) hydropower revenues that the Spokane Tribe would have \n     received under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.) \n     had the project not been federalized; and\n       (B) continues to lose hydropower revenues that the Federal \n     Government recognized were owed to the Spokane Tribe at the \n     time at which the project was constructed; and\n       (13) more than 39 percent of the land owned by Indian \n     tribes or members of Indian tribes that was used for the \n     Grand Coulee Dam project was land of the Spokane Tribe.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to provide fair and equitable \n     compensation to the Spokane Tribe, using the same \n     proportional basis as was used in providing compensation to \n     the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, for the \n     losses suffered as a result of the construction and operation \n     of the Grand Coulee Dam project.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the provision of items and services provided to medicare \nbeneficiaries residing in rural areas; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2568\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``MediFair Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement has \n     created barriers to care for seniors and the disabled.\n       (2) The regional inequities in medicare reimbursement \n     penalize States that have cost-effective health care delivery \n     systems and rewards those States with high utilization rates \n     and that provide inefficient care.\n       (3) Over a lifetime, those inequities can mean as much as a \n     $50,000 difference in the cost of care provided per \n     beneficiary.\n       (4) Regional inequities have resulted in creating very \n     different medicare programs for seniors and the disabled \n     based on where they live.\n       (5) Because the Medicare+Choice rate is based on the fee-\n     for-service reimbursement rate, regional inequities have \n     allowed some medicare beneficiaries access to plans with \n     significantly more benefits including prescription drugs. \n     Beneficiaries in States with lower reimbursement rates have \n     not benefited to the same degree as beneficiaries in other \n     parts of the country.\n       (6) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement have \n     created an unfair competitive advantage for hospitals and \n     other health care providers in States that receive above \n     average payments. Higher payments mean that those providers \n     can pay higher salaries in a tight, competitive market.\n       (7) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement can limit \n     timely access to new technology for beneficiaries in States \n     with lower reimbursement rates.\n       (8) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement, if left \n     unchecked, will reduce access to medicare services and impact \n     healthy outcomes for beneficiaries.\n       (9) Regional inequities in medicare reimbursement are not \n     just a rural versus urban problem. Many States with large \n     urban centers are at the bottom of the national average for \n     per beneficiary costs.\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to temporarily increase the Federal medical \nassistance percentage for the medicaid program, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend, Senator \nBen Nelson, to introduce a bill that would assist States through a \nperiod when most are experiencing fiscal crises. I am particularly \npleased to team with Senator Nelson on this effort, as we have teamed \non so many efforts in the past, because he has such a solid grasp of \nthe fiscal issues now facing our States, and the ways we can most \neffectively help.\n  We are pleased to be joined today by Senators Hutchinson, Lincoln, \nClinton and Gordon Smith, making this, truly, a bipartisan effort.\n  The recession may have ended earlier this year, but its effects \nlinger, and they are being felt acutely by States from Maine to \nNebraska, from New York to California. Though the recession has ended \nand economic growth picked up in the first quarter of the year, \nunemployment continues to rise, and now, standing at 6 percent, the \nU.S. unemployment rate is at an eight-year high.\n  The recession, the resulting rise in unemployment, and the tragic \nevents of September 11 have placed tremendous demands on government \nservices and resources. At the same time, these factors have \ncontributed to a dramatic and unexpected decrease in government \nrevenues, at precisely the time when more revenues are needed to \nrespond to the confluence of challenges that confront us.\n  The result of increasing demands for services and resources and \ndeclining revenues is that States across the Nation are in crisis. The \nNational Governors Association and National Association of State Budget \nOfficers this month found that over 40 States are facing an aggregate \nbudget shortfall of between $40 and $50 billion. Most States have seen \ntheir estimates of tax collections for the current year decrease, often \ndramatically. And while State governments are scrambling to respond, \nthey are constrained in their ability to do so by one key factor, they \ncannot run deficits. Forty-nine States are required by law or \nconstitution to balance their budgets.\n  As a result, thirty-nine States have been forced to reduce their \nalready-enacted budgets for fiscal year 2002 by cutting programs \nacross-the-board, tapping rainy day funds, laying off employees, and \nimplementing a variety of other cost-cutting measures. According to a \nNational Conference of State Legislators report in April, States have \nbeen forced to cut a number of critical programs. Twenty-nine States \nhave attempted to balance their budgets by cutting spending on higher \neducation. Twenty-five States have cut corrections programs. Twenty-two \nhave cut Medicaid. Seventeen States have cut K-12 education. And ten \nStates have reduced aid to local governments. In addition, a number of \nStates have raised taxes and fees by a total of $2.4 billion in 2003.\n  We believe that the Federal Government can and should help States, \nand that it should do so in a responsible way. Therefore, today we are \nintroducing legislation that would provide a temporary increase in the \nFederal Medicaid matching rate. It would increase the Federal \nGovernment's share of each State's Medicaid costs by 1.0 percent and \nhold the Federal matching rate for each State harmless for the \nremainder of this fiscal year and next. In addition, the bill includes \na temporary block grant to States that would help them pay for the \nrising demand in social services resulting from the economic downturn. \nOur bill would provide approximately $8.9 billion in total fiscal \nrelief to States which would allow them to expand, not contract, \nMedicaid and other health and social services.\n  Our approach to fiscal relief has been endorsed by the National \nGovernors Association, which supports our bill because it represents a \nsound and reasonable, bipartisan approach to State fiscal relief, and \none that could be enacted expeditiously. It is also endorsed by the \nAmerican Hospital Association,\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\nwhich understands the importance of providing assistance to States at a \ntime when many are looking toward health programs to help balance their \nbudgets.\n\n  Our bill targets most of its assistance on Medicaid, which is the \nfastest growing component of State budgets. While State revenues were \nstagnant or declined in many states last year, Medicaid costs increased \n11 percent. This year, Medicaid costs are increasing at an even greater \nrate, 13.4 percent. My home State of Maine is only one of a number of \nStates that has been forced to consider cuts in their Medicaid programs \nto make up for their budget shortfalls.\n  Earlier this year, Maine was facing a $248 million revenue shortfall. \nFaced with nothing but tough choices, our Governor proposed $58 million \nin Medicaid cuts, including reductions in payments to hospitals, \nnursing homes, group homes, and physicians. He was also forced to \npropose a delay in the enactment of legislation passed by the State \nLegislature last year to expand Medicaid to provide health coverage to \nan estimated 16,000 low-income uninsured Mainers.\n  While subsequent revisions in the State's revenue forecasts enabled \nthe Governor to restore most of these Medicaid cuts, the respite was \nonly temporary. Earlier this month, Maine's budget estimators \ndetermined that the State's revenues would come in some $90 million \nunder budget this year, and would experience another $90 million \nshortfall in the year to come. Suddenly, the State again must consider \ncutting critical programs and raising taxes. This is no small matter \nas, by some measures, Maine already imposes the highest tax burden in \nthe Nation on its residents.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will help to bridge Maine's \nfunding gap by bringing an additional $56 million to my State's \nMedicaid and social services programs over the next eighteen months \nThese funds would help forestall the need for any further cuts, and, \nhopefully, allow Maine to proceed with its plans to expand its Medicaid \nprogram to provide health care coverage for more of our low-income \nuninsured.\n  The order facing Governor King in Maine and other governors across \nthe country is a tall one indeed. The decisions they may be forced to \nmake could affect the access of millions of Americans to health care \nand social services. I think we need to help, and the bill Senator \nNelson and I introduce today does precisely that. We urge our \ncolleagues to join us in this effort.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I introduce, with my \ngood friend Senator Susan Collins, a new proposal to provide temporary \nfiscal relief to the states to help them address their severe budget \ncrises.\n  A few months ago, this body passed and the President signed into law, \na bill to stimulate the economy and help workers. It was not a perfect \nbill, but few are. But the economy was hurting and it was time to act. \nHowever, there were unintended consequences of that bill. Not only did \nthe economic stimulus bill fail to provide State fiscal relief, but by \nmaking some changes to federal tax law, the bill unintentionally added \nto revenue shortfalls that most States are experiencing. This, in turn, \nhas put programs such as medical assistance to the most vulnerable \nindividuals in this country at risk.\n  While the national economy is recovering from the recession, States' \nbudgets will take another 12-18 months to recover. The National \nGovernors Association and National Association of State Budget Officers \nthis month found that over 40 States are facing an aggregate budget \nshortfall of $40 to $50 billion. Thirty-eight States have seen their \nrevenues fall below previous estimates, some by dramatic amounts.\n  Every State but one has to balance its budget, even in the midst of a \nrecession. As a result, 41 States have been forced to reduce their \nfiscal 2002 enacted budgets by cutting programs across-the-board, \ntapping rainy day funds, laying off employees, and employing a variety \nof other cost-cutting measures. Some States have even had to raise \ntaxes.\n  According to the National Governors Association, Medicaid spending \nhas been a particular struggle for States, since expenditures have \nrisen by an average of 12 percent over the last 2 years, while State \nrevenues rose a total of 5 percent. Medicaid spending has been driven \nhigher by increases in health care costs nationwide, particularly the \ncosts of prescription drugs, which has increased by 18 percent annually \nover the past 3 years, and by recession-related increases in the number \nof people eligible for Medicaid.\n  States' Medicaid budget problems are exacerbated by scheduled \nreductions in Federal Medicaid payments to States. Between fiscal years \n2001 and 2002, 29 States had their Medicaid matching rates drop and 17 \nStates will have matching rate reductions between fiscal years 2002 and \n2003.\n  To date, most States have been able to reduce Medicaid spending \nwithout cutting back eligibility significantly. As fiscal pressures \nmount, however, many States are likely to consider substantial \nreductions in eligibility that could leave hundreds of thousands more \nchildren, families, people with disabilities, and seniors uninsured.\n  In other words, States have largely exhausted the usual ways of \nbalancing their budgets. Given the projection of continued deficits, \nthis means States will have to continue to reduce critical spending for \nhealth care, social services as well as other important priorities such \nas education. Most States' fiscal year begins in July, underscoring the \nneed for the Congress to act expeditiously on this critical matter.\n\n  Our proposal would provide a temporary 1.0-percent increase in the \nfederal Medicaid matching rate. In addition, we hold the Federal \nmatching rate for each State harmless for the remainder of this fiscal \nyear and next. the bill also includes a temporary block grant to States \nthat would help them pay for the rising demand in social services \nresulting from the economic downturn. Our bill would provide \napproximately $8.9 billion in total fiscal relief to States which would \nallow them to expand, not contract, Medicaid and other health and \nsocial services.\n  The National Governors Association has endorsed our approach to \nfiscal relief because it represents a sound and reasonable, bipartisan \napproach to State fiscal relief, one that could be enacted \nexpeditiously. Our bill blends several fiscal relief approaches \npreviously supported in the Senate and in the House. As such, I believe \nthis proposal can gain the widespread bipartisan support necessary to \nmove forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins and me in this effort \nand show the States that Congress is not indifferent to their budget \nproblems and that we will step in and provide meaningful assistance at \na time when governors need it most.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Collins \nand Senator Nelson in introducing legislation today that will provide a \ntemporary increase in the Federal Medicaid matching rate through fiscal \nyear 2003.\n  The National Governors Association and National Association of State \nBudget Officers recently reported that over 40 states are facing an \naggregate shortfall of $40 to $50 billion. One of the primary reasons \nfor these shortfalls is the rising cost of health care. Medicaid costs, \nwhich increased by 11 percent last year, are the fastest growing \ncomponent of State budgets.\n  Our legislation is critical to addressing these State budget \ndeficits, especially in Arkansas, where a $12.8 million Medicaid \nshortfall was announced last November. Specifically, our bill would \nincrease the Federal Government's share of each State's Medicaid costs \nby 1.0 percent and hold harmless the Federal matching rate for each \nstate for the remainder of this fiscal year and next. Additionally, a \ntemporary block grant program would be established in order to help \nmeet the rising demand for social services resulting from the recent \neconomic downturn.\n  In total, this legislation will provide $8.9 billion in relief to \nStates for the provision of Medicaid and social services. For Arkansas, \nthis legislation will provide $71 million in relief over the next two \nyears. Endorsed by the National Governors Association, this bipartisan \nlegislation is worthy of Senate support, and I urge my colleagues to \nbecome cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\n  S. 2571. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nspecial resources study to evaluate the suitability and feasibility of \nestablishing the Rim of the Valley Corridor as a unit of the Santa \nMonica Mountains National Recreation Area; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this bill \ntoday to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to \nevaluate the suitability and feasibility of expanding the Santa Monica \nNational Recreation Area to include the Rim of the Valley Corridor. \nThis bill was introduced in the House by Congressman Adam Schiff last \nyear.\n  The Rim of the Valley Corridor, as designated by California law, \nencircles the San Fernando Valley, La Crescenta, Simi, Santa Clarita, \nConejo Valleys, consisting of parts of the Santa Monica Mountains, \nSanta Susanna Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains, Verdugo Mountains, San \nRafael Hills and adjacent connector area to the Los Padres and San \nBernardino National Forests.\n  With the population growth forecast for the next several decades, the \nneed for parks to balance out the expected population growth has become \ncritical in California. Federal, State, and local authorities have \nworked together successfully to create the highly successful Santa \nMonica Mountains National Recreation Area, the world's largest urban \npark, hemmed in on all sides by development. Park and recreational \nlands provide people with a vital refuge from urban life while \npreserving valuable habitat and wildlife. This bill enjoys strong \nsupport from local and state officials and I believe it will have \nstrong bipartisan support as well.\n  After the study called for in this bill is completed, the Secretary \nof Interior and Congress will be in a key position to determine whether \nthe Rim of the Valley warrants national park status.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Smith \n        of Oregon, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Brownback, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Hutchinson):\n  S. 2572. A bill to amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to \nestablish provisions with respect to religious accommodation in \nemployment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join with my \ncolleague Senator Santorum today to introduce the Workplace Religious \nFreedom Act of 2002. Senators Lieberman, Gordon Smith, Murray, \nBrownback, Mikulski, and Hutchinson have all joined us as original \ncosponsors of this important legislation.\n  The Workplace Religious Freedom Act would protect workers from on-\nthe-job discrimination related to religious beliefs and practices. It \nrepresents a milestone in the protection of the religious liberties of \nall workers.\n  In 1972, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require \nemployers to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious practice or \nobservance unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the \nemployer. This 1972 amendment, although completely appropriate, has \nbeen interpreted by the courts so narrowly as to place little restraint \non an employer's refusal to provide religious accommodation. The \nWorkplace Religious Freedom Act will restore to the religious \naccommodation provision the weight that Congress originally intended \nand help assure that employers have a meaningful obligation to \nreasonably accommodate their employees' religious practices.\n  The restoration of this protection is no small matter. For many \nreligiously observant Americans the greatest peril to their ability to \ncarry out their religious faiths on a day-to-day basis may come from \nemployers. I have heard accounts from around the country about a small \nminority of employers who will not make reasonable accommodation for \nemployees to observe the Sabbath and other holy days or for employees \nwho must wear religiously-required garb, such as a yarmulke, or for \nemployees to wear clothing that meets religion-based modesty \nrequirements.\n  The refusal of an employer, absent undue hardship, to provide \nreasonable accommodation of a religious practice should be seen as a \nform of religious discrimination, as originally intended by Congress in \n1972. And religious discrimination should be treated fully as seriously \nas any other form of discrimination that stands between Americans and \nequal employment opportunities. Enactment of the Workplace Religious \nFreedom Act will constitute an important step toward ensuring that all \nmembers of society, whatever their religious beliefs and practices, \nwill be protected from an invidious form of discrimination.\n  Even after September 11, with a heightened sense of religious \nsensitivity among the American people, securing greater protections for \nthe religious needs of employees is a major issue. In October 2001, the \nU.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from a Muslim woman who \nwas pressured by her employer to stop wearing her head scarf. We must \ncome together now to pass this bipartisan legislation, which is \nsupported by a wide spectrum of religious organizations.\n  It is important to recognize that, in addition to protecting the \nreligious freedom of employees, this legislation protects employers \nfrom an undue burden. Employees would be allowed to take time off only \nif their doing so does not pose a significant difficulty or expense for \nthe employer. This common sense definition of undue hardship is used in \nthe ``Americans with Disabilities Act'' and has worked well in that \ncontext.\n  We have little doubt that this bill is constitutional because it \nsimply clarifies existing law on discrimination by private employers, \nstrengthening the required standard for employers. This bill does not \ndeal with behavior by State or Federal Governments or substantively \nexpand 14th amendment rights.\n  This bill is endorsed by a wide range of organizations including the \nAgudath Israel of America, American Jewish Committee, American Jewish \nCongress, Americans for Democratic Action, Anti-Defamation League, \nBaptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, B'nai B'rith International, \nCentral Conference of American Rabbis, Christian Legal Society, Church \nof Scientology, Council on Religious Freedom, Family Research Council, \nFriends Committee on National Legislation, General Board, United \nMethodist Church, General Conf. of Seventh Day Adventists, Guru Gobind \nSingh Foundation, Hadassah, International Assocition of Jewish Lawyers, \nInternational Commission on Freedom of Conscience, Jewish Council for \nPublic Affairs, Na'amat USA, National Assoc. of Evangelicals, National \nCouncil of Churches of Christ, National Council of Jewish Women, \nNational Jewish Democratic Council, National Sikh Center, North \nAmerican Council for Muslim Women, Presbyterian Church, USA, Rabbinical \nCouncil of America, Republican Jewish Coalition, Southern Baptist \nConvention, Traditional Values Coalition, Union of American Hebrew \nCongregations, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, United Church of \nChrist, and the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism.\n  I want to thank Senator Santorum for joining me to lead this effort. \nI look forward to working with him to pass this legislation so that all \nAmerican workers can be assured of both equal employment opportunities \nand the ability to practice their religion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Chafee, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Carper, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 2573. A bill to amend the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act \nto reauthorize the Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues, \nSenators Collins, Sarbanes, Chafee, Schumer, Akaka, Carper, Dodd, and \nCorzine to introduce a piece of legislation we believe establishes a \nframework for ending long-term homelessness in the United States. There \nis a growing consensus around the country that fifteen years after the \npassage of the McKinney-Vento Act, we now know how to help communities \nbreak the cycle of repeated and prolonged homelessness. Federal \ndollars, combined with local efforts, can help bring an end to this \nproblem. The Community\n\n[[Page S4866]]\n\nPartnership to End Homelessness Act of 2002 is intended to realign the \nincentives in the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act so that \ncommunities are rewarded for initiatives that will prevent and end \nhomelessness, instead of receiving Federal funding for programs that \nmaintain the status quo.\n  During the past year, the Urban Institute estimates that at least 2.3 \nmillion, and perhaps as many as 3.5 million people, have been homeless. \nOn any given day in the United States, at least 800,000 people are \nhomeless, including about 200,000 children. Homelessness has an \nespecially devastating impact on these children. If they are able to go \nto school, it is well documented that homeless children face increased \nchallenges, such as learning disabilities and emotional and behavioral \nproblems.\n  This year's U.S. Conference of Mayors report on ``Hunger and \nHomelessness in America's Cities'' finds that requests for emergency \nshelter by families increased by 22 percent. Unfortunately, over half \nof all these requests for housing assistance went unmet. In my State, \nthe Rhode Island shelter system provided more nights of shelter this \npast year than at any point in its history.\n  Locally and nationally, several trends seem clear. First, despite the \neconomic boom in the 1990s, homelessness has increased. Second, \nincreasing numbers of families with children are being forced into our \nemergency shelter system. In March of this year, the Washington Post, \nreported that there had been a 25 percent rise in homelessness in \nFairfax County, Virginia during the past four years, and most of that \nincrease consisted of homeless families. Third, a relatively small \nnumber of long-term homeless persons continue to utilize a \ndisproportionate number of the bed nights in our Nation's shelters.\n  When it was created in 1987, the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance \nAct was intended to be an emergency federal response to the ``crisis'' \nof homelessness. Instead, it has become a safety net for low-income \nhouseholds who are inadequately served by mainstream programs such as \nSection 8 and Medicaid. Too often, mainstream programs are shifting the \ncost and responsibility for housing and a variety of support services \nto emergency homeless assistance programs.\n  To reverse this trend, the Community Partnership to End Homelessness \nAct of 2002 would focus federal funds on projects and programs that are \nhelping to prevent and end homelessness. This legislation also would \nallow maximum local creativity in addressing homelessness by \nconsolidating multiple HUD McKinney-Vento programs into one program \nwith a list of eligible activities.\n  Our bill would also provide incentives for communities to build \npermanent housing for the disabled and for non-disabled families. It \nwould encourage the creation of homelessness prevention programs, and \nit would promote comprehensive and inclusive local planning. Finally, \nit would require greater program accountability through the use of \noutcome-based performance evaluations.\n  The Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act of 2002 is endorsed \nby the National Alliance to End Homelessness, the Corporation for \nSupportive Housing, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Local Initiatives \nSupport Corporation, the National Equity Fund, Inc., the National \nAlliance for the Mentally Ill, the McAuley Institute and the Enterprise \nFoundation.\n  We need to find the will and the resources to eradicate homelessness \nin this country. The Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act is \nonly the beginning. The needs of homeless individuals and families fall \nwithin the jurisdiction of many federal departments and congressional \ncommittees. Thus, I believe additional legislation is going to be \nnecessary in order to require Federal agencies such as HHS and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to work with HUD in a more coordinated \nmanner towards achieving this goal. I am committed to addressing this \ncrisis, and I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this bill \nand other homeless prevention efforts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Community Partnership to \nEnd Homelessness Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2573\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 275\n\n       Whereas 10 years ago at the World Summit for Children, the \n     United States joined with 159 other governments to commit the \n     world to supporting efforts that reduce infant and maternal \n     mortality, child malnutrition, and illiteracy;\n       Whereas more than 11,000,000 children die before the age of \n     5 (30,500 children every day) due to preventable infectious \n     diseases, including pneumonia, diarrhea, measles, malaria, \n     and malnutrition;\n       Whereas more than a quarter of the world's children are \n     malnourished, which hinders their ability to learn and \n     thrive;\n       Whereas over 500,000 women who die every year during \n     pregnancy and childbirth could be saved by low-tech, low-cost \n     interventions;\n       Whereas research has found that the health of a child and \n     his or her mother is closely intertwined and good maternal \n     health is essential for the survival of both mothers and \n     children;\n       Whereas studies have shown that high maternal and child \n     mortality are directly correlated with social and political \n     instability;\n       Whereas the number of women of reproductive age in less \n     developed countries will grow by 34 percent in the next 20 \n     years, making the need to improve health care services for \n     women and their children even more important;\n       Whereas past evidence has shown that programs to improve \n     child survival do work, for instance, in the past 8 years, \n     the United States Agency for International Development child \n     survival programs have significantly contributed to a 10 \n     percent reduction in infant mortality rates worldwide;\n       Whereas while research has shown that maternal deaths \n     during pregnancy and childbirth could be easily prevented, \n     the number of women who die as mothers has not decreased in \n     10 years due to the lack of additional resources to address \n     the problem;\n       Whereas the world has been able to reduce maternal \n     mortality in the developed world, the disparity between \n     developed and developing countries continues to grow;\n       Whereas, according to the World Health Organization, the \n     lifetime risk of dying from pregnancy-related complications \n     or during childbirth in developing countries is 1 in 48, in \n     developed countries the ratio is 1 in 1,800, and the risk is \n     even greater in some sub-Saharan African countries where 1 in \n     every 14 girls entering adolescence will die from maternal \n     causes before completing her child-bearing years; and\n       Whereas according to a World Health Organization report, \n     between $27,000,000,000 and $38,000,000,000 will be needed in \n     2007 and 2015, respectively, to provide the necessary health \n     interventions to those living in low-income countries: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) child survival and maternal health programs supported \n     by the United States Agency for International Development \n     have and will make a difference in the lives of mothers and \n     children in the developing world;\n       (2) an increased commitment to improving the health of the \n     world's mothers and children will have a long-term impact on \n     the political, economic, and social stability of developing \n     countries;\n       (3) the United States should take a lead in improving the \n     lives of millions of people in the developing world through \n     targeted, effective, and multi-faceted health and development \n     programs; and\n       (4) the United States should renew its commitment to the \n     world's mothers and children by increasing funding for basic \n     child survival and maternal health programs of the United \n     States Agency for International Development by at least \n     $500,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a \nresolution regarding the Senate's commitment to improving the health of \nmothers and children around the world. I am proud to be joined by \nSenators Feinstein, Murray, Landrieu, Corzine, and Durbin in \nintroducing this important legislation and we hope, by introducing this \nresolution, we will illustrate an increased commitment to improving the \nhealth of the world's mothers and children and show that this \ncommitment will have a long-term impact on the political, economic, and \nsocial stability of developing countries.\n  Earlier this month, representatives from over 179 countries met at \nthe United Nations Special Session on Children. During this meeting, \nthey reviewed the progress made since the 1990 World Summit for \nChildren and renewed their pledge to improve the lives of the world's \nchildren over the next decade.\n  The Bush Administration knows that investing in better health \nincreased a country's ability to prosper. President Bush proposed \nincreased funding for global HIV/AIDS programs at USAID. And I applaud \nthese efforts and am pleased to support them in the Senate. But I am \nhoping that this resolution will also break ground for an increase for \nmaternal and child health programs. Difficult choices must be made,\n\n[[Page S4874]]\n\nunderstandably, but funds should not be shifted from one essential \nhealth program to another. We must find new funding overall for health \nprograms, especially maternal health.\n  Every year, over 500,000 women die during pregnancy and childbirth. \nThese lives can be saved by low-tech, low-cost interventions. The \nhealth of a child and her mother are closely intertwined, and good \nmaternal health is essential for the survival of both mother and child. \nIn developing countries, a mother's death in childbirth due to \nmalnutrition, or inadequate prenatal and delivery care, means almost \ncertain death for her newly born child.\n  I also know that we must invest in programs that improve the health \nof young children. Every year, nearly 11 million die needlessly before \ntheir fifth birthday, almost all from diseases easily prevented or \nreadily treated. Pennies worth of antibiotics could save three million \nchildren who will die this year of pneumonia alone.\n  This resolution calls for increased funding for basic child survival \nand maternal health programs of at least $500 million dollars. This \nfigure is just a small investment when the dividends would be political \nstability, international security, and a renewed hope for the future of \nmothers and children around the world. I call on all my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this important resolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Gordon \nSmith, Durbin, Murray, Landrieu, and Corzine to submit a resolution \nvoicing the Senate's commitment to improving the health of mothers and \nchildren around the world.\n  This resolution illustrates that an increased commitment to improving \nthe health of the world's mothers and children will have a long-term \nimpact on the political, economic, and social stability of developing \ncountries. The stability of our own nation depends significantly on the \neconomic and political stability of developing nations. And their \neconomic and political stability cannot be realized unless the health \nof their people is improved.\n  The resolution we are introducing today calls for increased funding \nfor basic child survival and maternal health programs of at least $500 \nmillion dollars. This figure is a small investment when the dividends \ncould be political stability, international security, and a renewed \nhope for the future of mothers and children around the world.\n  A few weeks ago, representatives from over 179 countries met at the \nUnited Nations Special Session on Children. During this meeting, they \nreviewed the progress made since the 1990 World Summit for Children and \nrenewed their pledge to improve the lives of the world's children over \nthe next decade. Overall, the funding for global health, which includes \nHIV/AIDS programs, has increased significantly. Child survival and \nmaternal health programs was funded at $345 million in fiscal year \n2001. Funding was cut by $26 million in fiscal year 2002. The Bush \nadministration also acknowledges that investing in health care \nincreases a country's ability to prosper.\n  President Bush made a wise decision when he proposed increased \nfunding for global HIV/AIDS programs at USAID for fiscal year 2003. \nHowever, his budget also recommends a $25 million decrease in support \nfor maternal and child health programs. The funding situation is \ngetting worse rather than better for child survival and maternal health \nprograms. Difficult choices must be made, understandably, but funds \nshould not be shifted from one essential health program to pay for \nanother. Especially when funding for maternal and child health programs \nhave been decreased in previous years.\n  At this precarious time in our world, we cannot lose sight of the \nhealth of women, the primary caregivers who instill values and provide \nhope for their children; the future of every society. Women in \ndeveloping countries put their lives at risk when they become pregnant, \nover 500,000 women die every year during pregnancy and childbirth. The \nhealth of a child and his or her mother are closely intertwined, and \ngood maternal health is essential for the survival of both mother and \nchild. In developing countries, a mother's death in childbirth due to \nmalnutrition, or inadequate prenatal and delivery care, means almost \ncertain death for her newly born child. We must also invest \nsubstantially more in programs that improve the health of young \nchildren.\n  Every day around the world, over 30,000 children die preventable \ndeaths from diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, measles, and \nmalnutrition.\n  Additionally, every year, nearly 11 million children die needlessly \nbefore their fifth birthday--almost all from diseases easily prevented \nor readily treated. Pennies worth of antibiotics, for example, could \nsave three million children who will die this year of pneumonia. The \ntrue tragedy is that we know how to prevent these 11.5 million deaths \nthat occur each year. Low-tech, low-cost interventions exist, and with \nadditional resources to fund these interventions, could save lives. \nChildren must be nourished so that they can thrive and disparities \nbetween developed and developing countries can be reduced.\n  As studies continue to show that high maternal and child mortality \nare directly correlated with social and political instability, we must \ntake action to ensure the growth and development of the countries who \nneed it most and their people who are dying needlessly.\n  The World Health Organization has reported that $27 billion will be \nneeded in 2007 to provide necessary health interventions to those \nliving in low-income countries. I believe we must do all we can to \nprovide funds to improve the health of the world's mothers and \nchildren. The resolution being introduced proposes an increase in \nfunding by at least $500 million for child survival and maternal health \nprograms.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nproclaiming the week of June 10 to June 14, 2002 as National Work Safe \nWeek. There is no more important goal than having every employee go \nhome safely at the end of their work day.\n  In my home State of Missouri, a program has been developed that helps \nemployers work together with their employees to make sure everyone is \nfocused on working safely. Once a year we set aside a week in June to \nrecognize and promote this concept. This\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\nyear the week of June 10-14 is designated in Missouri as Work Safe \nWeek.\n  The goal of an injury free work place definitely is achievable. Too \nmany times we assume that accidents are an inevitable part of the job. \nThis just is not true. Accidents are preventable, largely through \nconstant vigilance and common sense, as well as compliance with \nrelevant safety standards.\n  Missouri is especially attached to the goal of workplace safety since \none of its native sons is currently the Assistant Secretary of Labor \nfor the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. John Hewnshaw \nbuilt his career on implementing safety plans for such companies as \nMonsanto and Solutia. These plans were widely praised by safety \nprofessionals and have resulted in thousands of employees avoiding \ninjuries and illnesses. I know that John is using the same reasonable \nstyle and practical approach in addressing the Nation's safety issues \nthat he used in developing the safety plans for his private sector \nemployers.\n  These same common sense principles are at the heart of the Work Safe \nWeek program in Missouri. The WorkSAFE program was started by Missouri \nEmployers Mutual Insurance in 1997 to teach employers and employees how \nto Work Smart in an Accident-Free Environment.\n  The WorkSAFE program is based on the premise that 20 percent of all \nworkplace injuries are the result of unsafe working conditions, while \nthe remaining 80 percent are caused by unsafe acts. The program is \nbased on the belief that 100 percent of injuries are preventable when \nemployers and employees work together. The program focuses on employer \nand employee attitudes and awareness in an effort to maintain an \ninjury-free workplace.\n  Prior employer and employee working attitudes can significantly \ncorrelate into costly workplace injuries which. For instance: Total \n1998 accident costs nationwide: $122.6 billion; and national average: \n$28,000 per disabling injury/$940,000 per work-related death.\n  As tremendous as the direct costs are, there are costs you can not \ncalculate. There are indirect or hidden costs such as property damage, \nlost production an modified duty. Parents who will not ever come home, \nbodies that are permanently damaged, and the trauma of witnessing an \ninjury or fatality--these are emotional costs that the numbers do not \nreflect.\n  By the end of Work Safe Week, I hope that employers and employees \nwill have the kind of attitude that will keep employees safe and health \nwhile on the job the whole year through.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4875-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4875-S4876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 227--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n  POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES AT THE 19TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE NORTH \n               ATLANTIC SALMON CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION\n\n  Ms. SNOWE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                              S. Res. 277\n\n       Whereas wild Atlantic salmon of both European stocks and \n     those originating in North American rivers have experienced a \n     sharp decline in numbers in recent years;\n       Whereas the return of these wild Atlantic salmon to the \n     rivers of United States and Canada to spawn is necessary to \n     continue the species' survival;\n       Whereas the United States is deeply concerned about the \n     status of the last remaining stocks of wild Atlantic salmon \n     returning to United States rivers and is committed to their \n     protection and recovery;\n       Whereas this situation is so serious that the United States \n     has closed all its Atlantic salmon fisheries and taken the \n     critical step of listing populations of Atlantic salmon as \n     endangered under the United States Endangered Species Act;\n       Whereas salmon originating in the State of Maine and in \n     other New England salmon rivers migrate to the waters west of \n     Greenland to feed where they can be subject to commercial \n     harvest;\n       Whereas Atlantic salmon migrate throughout the Northern \n     Atlantic and international cooperation is required to \n     successfully conserve and protect these stocks;\n       Whereas scientific research and sampling programs to \n     determine the origin of harvested Atlantic salmon are \n     critical and necessary to better understanding and protecting \n     the stocks;\n       Whereas in 1982 seven nations of the world adopted the \n     Convention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North \n     Atlantic which created the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation \n     Organization to promote conservation, restoration, \n     enhancement, and rational management of salmon stocks in the \n     North Atlantic through international cooperation;\n       Whereas the United States cannot solve the difficulties \n     facing United States origin salmon alone and the assistance \n     of all Convention member nations is needed: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) at the 19th Annual Meeting of the North Atlantic Salmon \n     Conservation Organization the United States should--\n       (A) advocate the use of science in making Atlantic salmon \n     resource decisions and ensure that any quota setting formula \n     provides adequate protection to those stocks originating in \n     the United States, Canada, and southern Europe that are now \n     at considerable risk of extinction;\n       (B) remain firmly opposed to commercial intercept fishing \n     which takes wild Atlantic Salmon of North American origin;\n       (C) support opportunities to create long-term conservation \n     agreements with other Convention member nations;\n       (D) support adoption of a long-term rebuilding goal and \n     develop a plan for the recovery of North American salmon;\n       (E) advocate the use of sampling programs by all nations to \n     determine the origin of harvested salmon; and\n       (2) the United States should make full use of all \n     appropriate diplomatic mechanisms, relevant international \n     laws and agreements, and other appropriate mechanisms to \n     implement the goals set forth in subparagraph (A) through (E) \n     of paragraph (1).\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate regarding the policy of the United \nStates at the 19th Annual Meeting of the North Atlantic Salmon \nConservation Organization, NASCO.\n  I am introducing this resolution today as our delegates prepare for \nthe upcoming NASCO meeting in Torshvn, Faroe Islands which begins on \nJune 3, 2002. At this meeting NASCO will set the annual allocation of \ncommercial Atlantic salmon quotas and debate numerous issues related to \nprotecting Atlantic salmon. NASCO is the international body which \nmanages Atlantic salmon stocks and sets the annual allocation of \ncommercial Atlantic salmon quotas. As such, the effective management of \nAtlantic salmon requires the cooperation of the member nations in this \nvoluntary regime. Unfortunately, several member nations routinely take \nactions that undermine these efforts.\n  Salmon originating in the rivers of Maine and the other New England \nstates migrate to feed in the waters west of Greenland where they are \nsubject to harvest in the West Greenland salmon fishery. Scientific \nanalysis indicates that 66 percent of the fish caught in West \nGreenland's fishery comes from North American stocks. A significant \namount of these fish are believed to be of U.S. origin. These harvested \nfish directly affect the rebuilding programs in Maine and the rest of \nNew England.\n  Protecting the stocks of Atlantic salmon is an ongoing issue which \nhas state, national, and international components. The situation is so \nserious in the United States that we have closed all U.S. Atlantic \nsalmon fisheries and have taken the critical step of listing \npopulations of Atlantic salmon as endangered under the U S. Endangered \nSpecies Act. At the state and national level, Maine and the other New \nEngland states have taken significant steps at great cost to protect \nthe spawning habitats of Atlantic salmon, but these efforts alone will \nnot protect the Atlantic salmon. The biggest threat to the success of \nthe salmon recovery plans is not having fish available to return to \nthese improved habitats. The U.S. should continue to support a zero \ncommercial mortality limit until these stocks can be rebuilt. This is a \nnecessary step toward rebuilding the salmon population in our rivers.\n  This resolution expresses the Senate's belief that the United States \nremain firmly opposed to commercial intercept fishing which takes wild \nAtlantic salmon, advocate the use of science in making international \nAtlantic salmon resource decisions, support adoption of a long-term \nrebuilding goal, develop a plan for the recovery of North American \nsalmon, and advocate the use of sampling programs by all nations to \ndetermine the origin of harvested salmon.\n\n[[Page S4876]]\n\n  As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, and \nFisheries, I am dedicated to protecting Atlantic salmon. This \nresolution is a critical step in ensuring that the international \nmanagement plan approved by NASCO will compliment the efforts that we \nhave made at the state and national level to protect critical Atlantic \nsalmon habitats. I urge my colleagues to join me and support this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4876-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 278--CALLING UPON ALL AMERICANS TO RECOGNIZE ON THIS \n MEMORIAL DAY, 2002, THE SACRIFICE AND DEDICATION OF OUR ARMED FORCES \n                AND CIVILIAN NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCIES\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Warner, Mr. Nickles, Mr. \nAllard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bond, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, \nMr. Burns, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. \nCraig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \nFitzgerald, Mr. Frist, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, \nMr. Hatch, Mr. Hutchinson, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \nLugar, Mr. McCain, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \nSantorum, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. \nSmith of Oregon, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \nThompson, Mr. Thurmond, and Mr. Voinovich) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 278\n\n       Whereas, in Afghanistan and elsewhere, members of our Armed \n     Forces and civilian national security agencies are today \n     fighting and dying to keep Americans safe and free from \n     terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas, the American defenders of democracy who have given \n     their lives in Afghanistan and elsewhere, joined in eternal \n     life those who were murdered by terrorists in New York, \n     Pennsylvania, and Virginia on September 11, 2001, on the USS \n     COLE, at the Khobar Towers, at the American Embassies in \n     Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, and in other unprovoked sneak \n     attacks;\n       Whereas it is fitting and essential on this Memorial Day, \n     2002, to remember the sacrifices made by these defenders who \n     now lie in hallowed ground throughout the world;\n       Whereas, living under the threat of further terrorist \n     attacks on this day, Americans everywhere are called upon to \n     realize that the members of our Armed Forces and civilian \n     national security agencies live with this threat every day \n     that they serve and answer the call to duty;\n       Whereas, like all important conflicts, the war against \n     terrorism is prosecuted daily in small engagements by \n     courageous volunteers, far from home, against a deadly and \n     elusive enemy;\n       Whereas the members of our Armed Forces and civilian \n     national security agencies have displayed capability, \n     determination, and valor that has shocked and surprised \n     America's terrorist enemies; and\n       Whereas the continuing success of our forces has resulted \n     in the steady, inexorable eradication of terrorists whose \n     inveterate hostility to our liberty and way of life continues \n     unabated: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Americans everywhere should, on Memorial Day, 2002, \n     observe a National Moment of Remembrance at 3 p.m. local time \n     and raise a hand in salute to those members of our Armed \n     Forces and civilian national security agencies, near and far, \n     who have answered the call of duty and willingly placed \n     themselves in harm's way on our behalf; and\n       (2) this should be done as an expression of the respect, \n     pride, and admiration felt by every American and by every \n     person liberated through the courageous sacrifice and valiant \n     toil of the forces of the United States and its allies in \n     this noble struggle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4881-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               JACOB K.

Mr. President, the Senate has been able to accomplish a \ngreat\n\n\n[[Page S4882]]\n\ndeal this week. The two managers of the trade bill worked very hard. \nThis has been a complicated bill with very technical issues.\n  The Presiding Officer, of course, is a member of the Finance \nCommittee and has better knowledge of that than most of us, but for \nmost Members of the Senate this is a difficult issue because it does \ndeal with matters under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee. In spite of that, we were able to move through this quite \nwell. There were some procedural problems that we always have \npostcloture, but I think we were able to do a good job.\n  While the Presiding Officer is in the Chamber, I express the \nappreciation of the entire Senate for the work that he does that goes \nunnoticed and is so important. The Presiding Officer is chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee. Again, there are a very select number of people \nwho serve on that very small committee. Most of the work that is done \nis in total secrecy. There is not a lot of press around. Evidence is \nbeing taken and testimony is being given.\n\n  So we rely on you very heavily, and on the Intelligence Committee. \nOne member of the Intelligence Committee tonight indicated to me he was \ntraveling to South America for obvious reasons. There are a lot of \nproblems in South America in which members of the Intelligence \nCommittee are involved. While many members are entitled to the same \ninformation that the chairman of the committee gets all the time, we \ndon't do that. That is not within our scope of duties. So we have to \ndepend on the chairman. It is a rare occasion when we get a briefing \nfrom the intelligence community. It does happen. But for the Presiding \nOfficer, it happens all the time, every day.\n  For example, I tried--because we had matters going on here on the \nSenate floor yesterday on an important issue--to get ahold of a member \nof the Intelligence Committee and could not do that because once in the \ncommittee you do not take your telephones, your beepers, your \nblackberries. You take none of that. You are away from your staff, \nexcept those members of the Intelligence Committee, and you are out of \ntouch with what is going on here.\n  On behalf of the entire Senate, I appreciate the inordinate amount of \ntime spent on these matters for these people of Nevada, the people of \nFlorida and the whole country. I want that appreciation spread over the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/23/senate-section/article/S4882-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. REID.
