Dr. Fritz Pfotenhauer has given me permission to refer to \nhim personally as Fritz, but he is a most distinguished pastor and \nminister of the gospel. He is the pastor of the Hilltop Lutheran Church \nin South Bend, IN. He is descended from a long line of Lutheran \nministers in an unbroken father-son succession dating back to the time \nof the great reformer, Martin Luther.\n  Dr. Pfotenhauer completed his Ph.D. in pastoral theology at the \nUniversity of Notre Dame where he also taught for 20 years until his \nretirement recently.\n  He will also retire at the end of this year as the pastor of Hilltop \nLutheran after 36 years of service to that community and 46 years as an \nordained minister.\n\n[[Page S7324]]\n\n  I think it is significant that this good brother is not just trained \nfor the ministry and knows the ivory tower and knows the depths of \ntheology, but he knows how it is to minister, how it is to change the \nhuman heart and help lift people from the wrong path. This is a man, as \nyou meet with him, who can talk deep in terms of gospel principles but \nalso knows personally what it is like to change the human heart and to \nset it on the course of righteousness.\n  Pastor Pfotenhauer is the father of Kurt Pfotenhauer, who is my \nfriend and my former chief of staff for nearly 6 years.

The Republican leader has designated the Senator from \nNew Mexico to control the time. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, a week ago the Federal Reserve \nChairman, Alan Greenspan, testified before the Senate Banking \nCommittee. It is important to take note of what he said at that hearing \nand where he thinks our economy is headed. Despite the obvious bear \nmarket which prevailed until yesterday, when we had a rather \nsignificant bull market for the day, our economy's fundamentals are \nstrong.\n  Despite this bear market, our economy is not headed for another \nrecession in the near future. Productivity growth is rapid. Inflation \nis low. Mortgage rates are also low, as everyone knows. That has kept \nthe housing market very strong.\n  Families have been taking advantage of these low-income rates by \nbuying homes at a record pace and refinancing old ones, thus yielding \neither lower payments or cash at hand which they are using to acquire \nwhat they believe they need.\n  Notice that those who claimed that the tax cut would lead to higher \ninterest rates have been very quiet of late, at least on that point. \nThe Federal Reserve sees the economy as growing at about a 3-percent \nrate in the second half of this year and even faster next year. The \nunemployment rate will probably end the year at about 5.9 percent. That \nis about right where it is now.\n  Next year, the jobless rate could drop to about 5.4 percent. This \ndoes not mean the outlook lacks uncertainty. The recent weakness in the \nstock market is important. The American people are worried, concerned. \nLower equity prices create a negative wealth effect that will be a drag \non consumer spending, as I have just indicated. Lower stock prices also \nmake it tougher for businesses to acquire the capital they need to \ninvest. Slow business investment continues to be our economy's weakest \npoint. And, of course, we still face the risk of further terrorist \nattacks or other conflicts that could disrupt the energy market.\n  Chairman Greenspan also observed:\n\n       To a degree, the return to budget deficits has been the \n     result of temporary factors, especially the falloff of \n     revenue, of tax take, and the increase in outlays associated \n     with the economic downturn.\n\n  But the chairman also observed that unfortunately, despite these \ntemporary factors impacting the deficit, he also saw signs that the \nunderlying disciplinary mechanisms that form the framework for Federal \nbudgets over the last 15 years have eroded.\n  I would say one of the most obvious ``disciplinary mechanisms,'' to \nborrow his words, is the adoption of a congressional budget. I have \nspoken in the past here on the floor about the failure to adopt a \nbudget resolution this year. Clearly, this is the one thing we can do \nin the Congress to send a message to the American public and to the \nmarkets that we understand the importance of having a budget in these \ndifficult economic times. So far we have failed as elected officials to \ndo the most essential of our responsibilities--adopt a budget.\n  Clearly, the other side of the aisle, the Democrats and their \nleadership, bear that responsibility, the responsibility to have \ncontinued on with the budget process and to have produced a budget \nresolution. We know that even on this most serious of debates, with \nreference to prescription drugs for our seniors, the absence of a \nbudget resolution has found its way here to the floor.\n  Because there is not a budget resolution that impacts for the \nremainder of this year, we then look to the previous year for the \nimpacts, plus or minus impacts, on adopting a prescription drug bill. \nLo and behold, we find the previous year's budget, the budget that this \nSenator, as chairman, helped put together, is now impacting and will \nthrough the remainder of this fiscal year be impacting on what we can \ndo in Medicare. Clearly, it is saying we can only spend $300 billion \nover the next decade. That was the judgment of the Senate when it last \nvoted in a budget resolution.\n  Things have not gotten better but perhaps have gotten somewhat worse \nduring that intervening year. We are here on the floor discussing a \nMedicare bill that is much larger than what we talked about the year \nprevious when we had a rather positive economy, not one that was in the \nred but one that was in the black.\n  Now the question is, What shall we do for the remainder of this year, \nup until October 1, when all the appropriations bills are subject to \nadoption in both Houses, to go to conference, come back, and then go to \nthe President--when all the other measures on which we have been going \nslow, or are in conference, have to come up? Are we going to have no \nbudget resolution nor budget statement impacts on any of those \nactivities, the sum total of which are the budget, and determine, \nstarting October 1, what we shall do?\n\n  It makes it difficult. Even the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, the President pro tempore, responding to a \nquestion about how not having a budget would affect the ability to work \non appropriations bills, said--and I quote from The Hill magazine:\n\n       It makes it difficult because we don't have the \n     disciplinary mechanisms at our fingertips that would \n     otherwise be the case if we had a budget.\n\n  The Appropriations Committee, under his leadership and that of \nSenator Stevens as ranking member, is fully aware their appropriations \nbills, one by one, when added together are the sum total of the budget \nfor the year starting October 1. They have recommended on one of the \nbills that there be a sense of the Senate that they will engage in \nattempting, with the Senate, to bind themselves to the numbers in the \nappropriations bills, saying we will be bound by those even though we \ndo not have a budget resolution that would normally give the numbers, \nprescribe them to the committee.\n  I gather that means the Budget Committee chairman and ranking \nmember--with that language, that sense of the Senate, saying that we \nwill be bound by the sum total of the allocations to the \nsubcommittees--I gather they clearly are concerned that if we do not \nhave something, the bills eventually will be subject to whatever the \nSenate would vote in and have no overlying power that says you can't go \nover this or you suffer some kind of penalty.\n  Senator Byrd and Dr. Greenspan have spoken. I tried on two or three \noccasions on the floor to remind us, as Senator Judd Gregg has, and \nsome\n\n[[Page S7325]]\n\nDemocrats have taken to the floor concerned about the fact that we \ndon't have any discipline. It makes it difficult because we don't have \nthe disciplinary mechanisms at our fingertips. That is what the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee said a few days \nago.\n  A couple of weeks ago, absent a real budget resolution, we came close \nto adopting at least a poor version of a budget by trying to set \nspending caps for the appropriations process, enforceable only here in \nthe Senate next year, and extending with Senate enforcement tools some \nexpiring Budget Enforcement Act provisions.\n  But let it be clear, this is not a budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator may continue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let it be clear this was not a Senate budget resolution \non which we voted. It was an attempt to address just a small portion of \nthe Federal spending that indeed will take place between now and the \nend of next year. Let it be clear that this is not a budget resolution \nbecause it only applied to appropriations, and budget resolutions go \nwell beyond the appropriations bills which constitute about one-third \nof the spending of our Nation. Two-thirds are subject to other \napproaches to spending, mandatory approaches--they are automatic, like \nSocial Security, like Medicare. And the sum total of all those--Federal \npensions, military pensions and on and on--the sum total of all of \nthose mandatory, obligatory ones is two-thirds of the spending. A real \nbudget would address the other two-thirds, that which we call generally \nentitlement spending.\n  I think we are now beginning to see firsthand what it means not to \nhave a budget resolution as we are here on the floor debating adding \nnew spending to one of the largest Federal entitlement programs, the \nMedicare Program. The process does matter. An updated budget resolution \nwould have updated our spending estimates and we would now be debating \nthese prescription drug amendments to the current Medicare Program in a \nmore honest and transparent manner.\n  I think it is important that we listen up and we pay attention. This \nis a very serious situation. If in fact spending were to get out of \nhand, we hear Alan Greenspan warning us that one of the most \nsignificant qualities, characteristics of this American economy--one of \nthe most serious ones would be for those who understand budgets to \nconclude that the fiscal policy is out of hand, that we don't know \nwhere it is going, and we don't know how much we are going to spend. I \ndon't think that is the case.\n\n  But some who would look at what we have done and not done might \nconclude that we are not as committed as we were a couple of years ago \nwhen we had budgets, reserve funds, and all the kinds of things we have \ngrown to use around here.\n  It is obvious we just have projections and estimates of costs based \non the Congressional Budget Office and their most current projections. \nBut because we don't have a budget resolution that is based on current \nestimates, the procedural points of order that lie against all of these \namendments result from the fact that last year's budget resolution is \nthe only one we have, and it was estimated using an entirely different \nset of projections.\n  What this says is we are using enforcement tools that were in last \nyear's budget based upon where we are going to be with reference to \nexpenditures, tax intake, and, thus, deficits, or being in the black \nand with a surplus.\n  Regardless of whose amendment one supports, not having a current \nbudget resolution penalizes all proposals. This is not the way to \nconsider one of the most important and probably most expensive \nlegislative proposals to come before the Congress in years; that is, \nprescription drug provisions that we are debating.\n  We therefore see the failure to adopt a budget resolution, we see it \nimpacting on the way the Senate can conduct business here on the floor. \nWe are tied up in trying to consider a prescription drug bill while \nbypassing the Senate Finance Committee. If the majority leader chooses \nto proceed without waiting for, or without expecting and relying upon a \nbill that the Finance Committee and committee debate produces and sends \nto the Senate, that is his prerogative.\n  I believe in these particular times, with all of the facts I have \njust described, that it is not the best way to do it. But there are \neven other reasons beyond budgetary that cry out for it not being the \nbest way to conduct business--be it an energy bill, which we did \ndirectly on the floor and didn't have language from a committee as a \nformal bill with the appropriate documents attendant thereto, to many \nothers that we are taking up out of the majority leader's office and \nputting up here on the floor without the committee authentication which \ncomes from the committee debate, which is a very heralded and important \npart of the Senate process.\n  Chairman Greenspan also spoke specifically about the other rules that \nwere incorporated into the Budget Act and, thus, are in the budget. \nThey came into being when our country had another bad time. We went out \nand met at Andrews Air Force Base. We came back with a series of \nproposals, one of which was called a pay-go, and spending caps. These \nare devices that helped at least provide some tools for statutory and \ncongressional fiscal policy deliberations. These were enforced by \npoints of order. The point of order lied. These provisions were \noperative--or any one of them. Then we were penalized and had to have \n60 votes rather than 51.\n  That is wherein the drug bill lies in terms of the process. This is \nsomething we can do.\n  I have introduced legislation to extend the budget enforcement \nprovisions, including the spending caps, establishing firewalls that go \nbetween the nondefense and defense, pay-go rules impacting the \nmandatory spending programs and tax revenues, limitations on the \nadvanced appropriations, and other provisions that I believe are the \nminimum needed to maintain some semblance of statutory and \ncongressional budget authority.\n\n  Let it be clear that this legislation is not a budget resolution, it \nis strictly enforcement provisions. But it is the heart and soul of \nbudget enforcement mechanisms that would be here if we were adopting a \nbudget under the existing budget law. It is essential that we do at \nleast this much, and we ought to give serious consideration to doing it \nbefore this year ends.\n  I once again borrow the language of Dr. Greenspan when he calls all \nthese things disciplinary mechanisms. We need to reassert them--\nsomething Chairman Greenspan and Chairman Byrd reminded us that we \nneed. This is important to the way we conduct business and the signal \nit sends to the markets and the economy.\n  Also, my colleagues joined in other legislation that I hope we can \nfind some way to have adopted before the new fiscal year begins on \nOctober 1. I have heretofore introduced a summary of this proposal. \nAfter getting closer and talking to more people, I put some more flesh \non it. I don't want to formally introduce it, but I want to send \nattendant to this speech, following it, a proposal that will be called \na bill. It indeed would be the proposal I have summarized that, as a \nminimal, we would need. I hope Senators will pay attention to it.\n  Perhaps by the end of the day today we can find out whether there is \na genuine interest. If there is not, then obviously I believe I have \ndone my best to call attention to it and to provide how it might be \ndone. I submit that there is indeed a possibility that if this were to \npass and the Senate were to adopt it, and since it applies only to us--\nthe House offers it through its Rules Committee--if we were to adopt \nit, I have every reason to believe it would have a positive impact on \nthose who are wondering what is our fiscal policy after this October \nand into a year with new so-called disciplinary functions available.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S7326]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7324-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7324-S7326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Clearly, this is the one thing we can do \nin the Congress to send a message to the American public and to the \nmarkets that we understand the importance of having a budget in these \ndifficult economic times. So far we have failed as elected officials to \ndo the most essential of our responsibilities--adopt a budget.\n  Clearly, the other side of the aisle, the Democrats and their \nleadership, bear that responsibility, the responsibility to have \ncontinued on with the budget process and to have produced a budget \nresolution. We know that even on this most serious of debates, with \nreference to prescription drugs for our seniors, the absence of a \nbudget resolution has found its way here to the floor.\n  Because there is not a budget resolution that impacts for the \nremainder of this year, we then look to the previous year for the \nimpacts, plus or minus impacts, on adopting a prescription drug bill. \nLo and behold, we find the previous year's budget, the budget that this \nSenator, as chairman, helped put together, is now impacting and will \nthrough the remainder of this fiscal year be impacting on what we can \ndo in Medicare. Clearly, it is saying we can only spend $300 billion \nover the next decade. That was the judgment of the Senate when it last \nvoted in a budget resolution.\n  Things have not gotten better but perhaps have gotten somewhat worse \nduring that intervening year. We are here on the floor discussing a \nMedicare bill that is much larger than what we talked about the year \nprevious when we had a rather positive economy, not one that was in the \nred but one that was in the black.\n  Now the question is, What shall we do for the remainder of this year, \nup until October 1, when all the appropriations bills are subject to \nadoption in both Houses, to go to conference, come back, and then go to \nthe President--when all the other measures on which we have been going \nslow, or are in conference, have to come up? Are we going to have no \nbudget resolution nor budget statement impacts on any of those \nactivities, the sum total of which are the budget, and determine, \nstarting October 1, what we shall do?\n\n  It makes it difficult. Even the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, the President pro tempore, responding to a \nquestion about how not having a budget would affect the ability to work \non appropriations bills, said--and I quote from The Hill magazine:\n\n       It makes it difficult because we don't have the \n     disciplinary mechanisms at our fingertips that would \n     otherwise be the case if we had a budget.\n\n  The Appropriations Committee, under his leadership and that of \nSenator Stevens as ranking member, is fully aware their appropriations \nbills, one by one, when added together are the sum total of the budget \nfor the year starting October 1. They have recommended on one of the \nbills that there be a sense of the Senate that they will engage in \nattempting, with the Senate, to bind themselves to the numbers in the \nappropriations bills, saying we will be bound by those even though we \ndo not have a budget resolution that would normally give the numbers, \nprescribe them to the committee.\n  I gather that means the Budget Committee chairman and ranking \nmember--with that language, that sense of the Senate, saying that we \nwill be bound by the sum total of the allocations to the \nsubcommittees--I gather they clearly are concerned that if we do not \nhave something, the bills eventually will be subject to whatever the \nSenate would vote in and have no overlying power that says you can't go \nover this or you suffer some kind of penalty.\n  Senator Byrd and Dr. Greenspan have spoken. I tried on two or three \noccasions on the floor to remind us, as Senator Judd Gregg has, and \nsome\n\n[[Page S7325]]\n\nDemocrats have taken to the floor concerned about the fact that we \ndon't have any discipline. It makes it difficult because we don't have \nthe disciplinary mechanisms at our fingertips. That is what the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee said a few days \nago.\n  A couple of weeks ago, absent a real budget resolution, we came close \nto adopting at least a poor version of a budget by trying to set \nspending caps for the appropriations process, enforceable only here in \nthe Senate next year, and extending with Senate enforcement tools some \nexpiring Budget Enforcement Act provisions.\n  But let it be clear, this is not a budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator may continue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let it be clear this was not a Senate budget resolution \non which we voted. It was an attempt to address just a small portion of \nthe Federal spending that indeed will take place between now and the \nend of next year. Let it be clear that this is not a budget resolution \nbecause it only applied to appropriations, and budget resolutions go \nwell beyond the appropriations bills which constitute about one-third \nof the spending of our Nation. Two-thirds are subject to other \napproaches to spending, mandatory approaches--they are automatic, like \nSocial Security, like Medicare. And the sum total of all those--Federal \npensions, military pensions and on and on--the sum total of all of \nthose mandatory, obligatory ones is two-thirds of the spending. A real \nbudget would address the other two-thirds, that which we call generally \nentitlement spending.\n  I think we are now beginning to see firsthand what it means not to \nhave a budget resolution as we are here on the floor debating adding \nnew spending to one of the largest Federal entitlement programs, the \nMedicare Program. The process does matter. An updated budget resolution \nwould have updated our spending estimates and we would now be debating \nthese prescription drug amendments to the current Medicare Program in a \nmore honest and transparent manner.\n  I think it is important that we listen up and we pay attention. This \nis a very serious situation. If in fact spending were to get out of \nhand, we hear Alan Greenspan warning us that one of the most \nsignificant qualities, characteristics of this American economy--one of \nthe most serious ones would be for those who understand budgets to \nconclude that the fiscal policy is out of hand, that we don't know \nwhere it is going, and we don't know how much we are going to spend. I \ndon't think that is the case.\n\n  But some who would look at what we have done and not done might \nconclude that we are not as committed as we were a couple of years ago \nwhen we had budgets, reserve funds, and all the kinds of things we have \ngrown to use around here.\n  It is obvious we just have projections and estimates of costs based \non the Congressional Budget Office and their most current projections. \nBut because we don't have a budget resolution that is based on current \nestimates, the procedural points of order that lie against all of these \namendments result from the fact that last year's budget resolution is \nthe only one we have, and it was estimated using an entirely different \nset of projections.\n  What this says is we are using enforcement tools that were in last \nyear's budget based upon where we are going to be with reference to \nexpenditures, tax intake, and, thus, deficits, or being in the black \nand with a surplus.\n  Regardless of whose amendment one supports, not having a current \nbudget resolution penalizes all proposals. This is not the way to \nconsider one of the most important and probably most expensive \nlegislative proposals to come before the Congress in years; that is, \nprescription drug provisions that we are debating.\n  We therefore see the failure to adopt a budget resolution, we see it \nimpacting on the way the Senate can conduct business here on the floor. \nWe are tied up in trying to consider a prescription drug bill while \nbypassing the Senate Finance Committee. If the majority leader chooses \nto proceed without waiting for, or without expecting and relying upon a \nbill that the Finance Committee and committee debate produces and sends \nto the Senate, that is his prerogative.\n  I believe in these particular times, with all of the facts I have \njust described, that it is not the best way to do it. But there are \neven other reasons beyond budgetary that cry out for it not being the \nbest way to conduct business--be it an energy bill, which we did \ndirectly on the floor and didn't have language from a committee as a \nformal bill with the appropriate documents attendant thereto, to many \nothers that we are taking up out of the majority leader's office and \nputting up here on the floor without the committee authentication which \ncomes from the committee debate, which is a very heralded and important \npart of the Senate process.\n  Chairman Greenspan also spoke specifically about the other rules that \nwere incorporated into the Budget Act and, thus, are in the budget. \nThey came into being when our country had another bad time. We went out \nand met at Andrews Air Force Base. We came back with a series of \nproposals, one of which was called a pay-go, and spending caps. These \nare devices that helped at least provide some tools for statutory and \ncongressional fiscal policy deliberations. These were enforced by \npoints of order. The point of order lied. These provisions were \noperative--or any one of them. Then we were penalized and had to have \n60 votes rather than 51.\n  That is wherein the drug bill lies in terms of the process. This is \nsomething we can do.\n  I have introduced legislation to extend the budget enforcement \nprovisions, including the spending caps, establishing firewalls that go \nbetween the nondefense and defense, pay-go rules impacting the \nmandatory spending programs and tax revenues, limitations on the \nadvanced appropriations, and other provisions that I believe are the \nminimum needed to maintain some semblance of statutory and \ncongressional budget authority.\n\n  Let it be clear that this legislation is not a budget resolution, it \nis strictly enforcement provisions. But it is the heart and soul of \nbudget enforcement mechanisms that would be here if we were adopting a \nbudget under the existing budget law. It is essential that we do at \nleast this much, and we ought to give serious consideration to doing it \nbefore this year ends.\n  I once again borrow the language of Dr. Greenspan when he calls all \nthese things disciplinary mechanisms. We need to reassert them--\nsomething Chairman Greenspan and Chairman Byrd reminded us that we \nneed. This is important to the way we conduct business and the signal \nit sends to the markets and the economy.\n  Also, my colleagues joined in other legislation that I hope we can \nfind some way to have adopted before the new fiscal year begins on \nOctober 1. I have heretofore introduced a summary of this proposal. \nAfter getting closer and talking to more people, I put some more flesh \non it. I don't want to formally introduce it, but I want to send \nattendant to this speech, following it, a proposal that will be called \na bill. It indeed would be the proposal I have summarized that, as a \nminimal, we would need. I hope Senators will pay attention to it.\n  Perhaps by the end of the day today we can find out whether there is \na genuine interest. If there is not, then obviously I believe I have \ndone my best to call attention to it and to provide how it might be \ndone. I submit that there is indeed a possibility that if this were to \npass and the Senate were to adopt it, and since it applies only to us--\nthe House offers it through its Rules Committee--if we were to adopt \nit, I have every reason to believe it would have a positive impact on \nthose who are wondering what is our fiscal policy after this October \nand into a year with new so-called disciplinary functions available.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow).

Madam President, I rise today to recognize the 12-year \nanniversary of an incredibly important step in America's continuing \neffort to expand the circle of opportunity and to realize a more \nperfect union.\n  Twelve years ago today, the Americans with Disabilities Act became \nlaw. When we think about that remarkable day in history, we remember \nthe relentless efforts of some of our colleagues who took such \nleadership in this important expansion of civil rights protections. \nSenators Harkin and Kennedy used their positions of power to fight for \nthose with little or no power. Their work opened the doors to people \nwith disabilities in much the same way as the Civil Rights Act had done \nthree decades earlier for other Americans.\n  We also remember the people who fought behind the scenes, those who \ntenaciously and selflessly advocated for equal access because they knew \nthat people with disabilities were being excluded from schools, from \njobs, from the most fundamental participation in our American way of \nlife.\n  One such person--someone whom I was very proud to call my friend--was \ntruly the heart and soul of the disabilities civil rights movement. \nThat person was Justin Dart. We lost a great American and a great \nleader with Justin's death on June 22. But because of his lifelong \ncommitment to ensuring the rights and dignity of every single American, \nwe will never forget him. He was not only a great and tireless leader, \nhe was an extraordinary human being. Anyone who ever saw him, with his \ncowboy hat and his infectious grin, would never forget him.\n  Justin Dart's passionate advocacy led many to refer to him as the \nMartin Luther King of the disabilities movement. So on Martin Luther \nKing's birthday, January 15, 1998, my husband, President Bill Clinton, \nawarded Justin the Medal of Freedom, our Nation's highest civilian \naward. We also invited Justin back to the White House when we honored \nthe 10th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. And \nthroughout my tenure as First Lady, and since becoming a Senator from \nNew York, I often sought his guidance on health and disabilities \nissues.\n  Justin Dart's leadership changed the way we, as a society, think \nabout people with disabilities. We all know--those of us who have lived \nlong enough--that at one time we presumed a disability meant a lifetime \nof dependence. Now we know better. We know that we have countless \nAmericans, of all ages, with disabilities who not only want to but can \nlead independent lives to contribute to the quality of our lives and \nour Nation's prosperity. That is why, in 1998, the Clinton-Gore \nadministration formed the Presidential Task Force on Employment of \nAdults with Disabilities, and then in the year 2000 expanded its \nmission to include young people.\n  This task force has been instrumental in helping us understand the \nchallenges that still confront Americans with disabilities and in \nunderstanding, despite the extraordinary progress we have made since \nthe ADA was passed, we still have a very long way to go.\n  According to a recent survey of Americans with disabilities conducted \nin 2000, 56 percent of 18- to 64-year-olds with disabilities who were \nable to go to work were employed in 2000. That is up from 47 percent in \n1994.\n\n  That is progress, but we also have to recognize that 44 percent of \nAmericans with disabilities are still not working. Justin himself \neloquently expressed the status of Americans with disabilities on the \n7th anniversary of the ADA when he said:\n  The job of democracy is far from finished. Millions and millions of \npeople with disabilities, in America and other lands, are still outcast \nfrom the good life.\n  In Justin's honor, we simply have to do better.\n  One of the ways I will keep honoring Justin Dart's legacy is to \ncontinue the fight for equal access and full funding under the \nextraordinarily important legislation passed 25 years ago to provide \neducation for children with disabilities. The Individuals with \nDisabilities in Education Act, known as IDEA, has literally transformed \nthe lives of countless American children.\n  I have a particular connection with that law because, as a young \nlawyer just out of law school in 1973, I went to work for the \nChildren's Defense Fund. We could not understand why, if you looked at \ncensus tracks and saw how many children were living in a particular \narea between the ages of 5 and 18 and compared that with the number of \nchildren enrolled in school, there was a discrepancy. There were \nchildren we knew living in an area but they were not in school. Where \nwere they?\n  We could not understand it by just looking at the statistics so we \nliterally went door to door to door. I was knocking on doors in New \nBedford, MA, asking people did they have a child who was not currently \nenrolled in school. I found blind children, deaf children, children in \nwheelchairs, children who were kept out of school because there were no \naccommodations for their education.\n  I remember going into a small apartment that opened out on to a tiny \nterrace where the family had constructed a grape arbor, and it was a \nbeautiful apartment with a small garden. A little girl was sitting in a \nwheelchair out on this little terrace on a summer afternoon. She had \nnever been to school.\n  We then, working with many other advocates for children and people \nwith disabilities, wrote a report and engaged in the debate which led \nto the passage of the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act in \n1975.\n  This year the HELP Committee, on which I serve, is beginning the hard \nwork of reauthorizing this important legislation. When it was passed in \nthe Congress in 1975, we made a promise that the Federal Government \nwould pay 40 percent of the cost of educating children with \ndisabilities. I thought that was a fair bargain because, clearly, \neducating a child who is blind or deaf or in a wheelchair and needs \nmore help, therefore, requires more resources which is going to raise \nthe costs for local communities. But it was another example of America \ndoing the right thing.\n  It has made such a difference. Anyone who goes into schools today and \nsees bright young children raising their hand from their wheelchair or \nwalking down the hallway on braces with their friends or having someone \nhelp with the reading because they are blind knows what a difference it \nhas made, not only for the children with disabilities but for all \nchildren and for the kind of society we are.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Government has never paid its fair share. \nThat is something that has to change. That is something about which I \noften talked to my friend Justin Dart. He would have wanted us to keep \ngoing with the fight to ensure that all Americans are treated with \ndignity.\n\n  He had a very astute way of looking at life and actions in \nWashington. He once said:\n\n       The legitimate purpose of society and its government is not \n     to govern people and to promote the good life for them, but \n     to empower them to govern themselves and to provide the good \n     life for themselves and their fellow humans.\n\n  As usual, Justin Dart summed it up. The Americans with Disabilities \nAct provided a firm foundation on which to build that empowerment, to \nensure that every boy and girl, no matter what their physical or mental \nstatus might be, is viewed with the same respect and caring that every \nother human being deserves as well.\n  Justin Dart lived it. He advocated. He harassed. He reminded. He \nprodded and promoted all of us to do better. He himself was confined to \na wheelchair. He lived with a great deal of pain, but that smile never \nleft his face. With his beloved wife and family, he showed up whenever \nthe call was sounded for his championship on behalf of people who he \nnever forgot and for whom he never stopped fighting.\n  We will miss Justin Dart, but it is up to us to continue his legacy \nand to ensure that the work to which he gave his life continues in his \nhonor and on behalf of the countless young Americans who might never \nknow his name but who are given a chance to chart their own destinies \nbecause he came before.\n  I thank my friend Justin Dart and wish him and his wonderful family \nGodspeed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7327]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

I thank the Senator from New York for stepping into the \nChair for a moment this morning so I might share a few comments. I also \ncongratulate her on a very eloquent statement about an extremely \nimportant gentleman, Justin Dart, whom I knew not as well as the \nSenator from New York but for whom I had tremendous admiration. I align \nmyself with the comments concerning special education and what needs to \nbe done.

Madam President, I rise this morning to comment on \nanother very important topic that is before us and to urge my \ncolleagues to come together to get something done. We have been talking \na lot about Medicare and the fact it is outdated, that it needs to be \nmodernized to cover prescription drugs.\n  We had a very significant vote 2 days ago. It was historic. It was \nthe first time the Senate, since 1965, has come together to vote to \nmodernize Medicare. A majority of us, 52 Members, voted yes. I commend \nmy Republican colleague--which was the one Republican vote joining us--\nthe Senator from Illinois, for joining us in that effort.\n  A statement was made by a majority of the Senate, and I believe it \nreflects the will of the majority of Americans. We have a health care \nsystem for older Americans, a promise of comprehensive health care for \nolder Americans and the disabled that was put into place in 1965. It \nhas worked. The only problem is that the health care system has \nchanged. We all know that. We have all talked about it many times.\n  What I find disturbing at this moment, in light of the fact that we \nneed 60 votes--we need 8 more people; we need 8 of our Republican \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle to join us to actually make \nthis happen--in light of the success of Medicare, too many times I am \nhearing words such as ``big Government program'' from my Republican \ncolleagues in the House. They refer to Medicare as a ``big Government \nprogram,'' and there are times I have heard that in this debate from \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  I am here to say I think Medicare is a big American success story. It \nis a big American success story, just as Social Security is a big \nAmerican success story and one that we should celebrate.\n\n  I worry, as I hear comments from our President about moving in the \ndirection of wanting to privatize Social Security, wanting to move \nMedicare to the private sector and privatize it, that we are moving \naway from not only a commitment made but a great American success \nstory. It has worked, and I think often now of those people such as \nEnron employees or WorldCom employees who have lost their life savings \nwho have said to me: Thank God for Social Security and Medicare or I \nwould have nothing. If Medicare was not there, they would have no \nhealth care.\n  These are great American success stories. At this time in 2002, at \nthis moment in July, we have an opportunity to make history so that \nwhen others read the history books and look back, they will find we \ntook the next step to modernize a system that provided health care for \nolder Americans and the disabled for over 35 years.\n  I want to read a couple of stories from Michigan. I have set up a \nprescription drug people's lobby in Michigan and asked people to share \ntheir stories and to get involved because we know there is such a large \nlobby on the other side.\n  As we all know and have said so many times, there are six drug \ncompany lobbyists for every one Member of the Senate. Their voice is \nheard every day. It is also heard on TV. It is heard on the radio. \nThere is a full-page ad in Congress Daily from the drug company lobby \nthat was brought to my attention urging us to oppose the amendment we \npassed to open the border to Canada.\n  Heaven forbid that we add more competition. Heaven forbid that \nAmerican citizens be able to buy American-made drugs that they helped \ncreate through taxpayer dollars, but they are sold in Canada for half \nthe price they are sold in the United States. Heaven forbid that \nAmerican consumers would have the chance to do that. So they have an \nad, and I am sure there are many more. I am not sure how much it costs. \nI prefer the money that is being spent on this ad and other ads on \ntelevision and the $10 million being spent on ads supporting the drug \ncompany version would be put into a Medicare benefit or lowering \nprices. That would be certainly much more constructive in the long run.\n  The reality is that something has to be done because the system is \njust out of control, and it will not change unless we act because there \nis too much money at stake. Just as we have debated corporate \nresponsibility in other settings--and I applaud colleagues who have \ncome together to agree on a final plan related to legislation for \ncorporate responsibility and accountability--this, too, is an issue of \ncorporate responsibility, corporate ethics, as it relates to pricing \nlifesaving medicine. And how far is too far?\n  Let me share stories that have come to me from various individuals in \nMichigan. This is one from Christopher Hermann in Dearborn Heights, MI. \nHe writes:\n\n       I am a nurse practitioner providing primary care to \n     veterans. I am receiving many new patients seeking \n     prescription assistance after they have been dropped by \n     traditional plans and can no longer afford medications. Many \n     of them have more than $1,000 a month in prescription drug \n     costs.\n       The vets are lucky. We can provide the needed service. \n     Their spouses and neighbors are not so lucky.\n       I also have such a neighbor. Al is 72, self-employed all \n     his life with hypertension. When he runs out of his meds \n     due to lack of money, his blood pressure goes so high he \n     has to go to the emergency room and be admitted to prevent \n     a stroke. I provide assistance through pharmaceutical \n     programs, but this is not guaranteed each month. We either \n     pay the $125 per month for his medications, or Medicare \n     pays $5,000-plus each time he is admitted. It is pretty \n     simple math to me. It is pretty simple math.\n\n  We can either help people with their blood pressure medicine or \nmedicine for their heart or medicine for sugar and all the other issues \nthat need to be dealt with or we can pick up the pieces with \nhospitalization or worse that ultimately costs more to the system.\n  I very much appreciate Christopher Hermann sharing this story. I will \nnot share more this morning. I thank those who have been sharing their \nstories with me.\n  I will close with one other story that was shared with me that has \nstuck with me since I read it a few weeks ago, and that was a little \ngirl from Ypsilanti, MI. I have talked about this before, but I think \nthis is important to remind us of what this legislation is about. She \nwrote a letter to me telling me that her grandma stopped taking her \nmedicine at Christmas in order to buy Christmas presents for the \ngrandkids. She later had health problems and passed away.\n  There is something wrong with the United States of America when \ngrandmas are not taking lifesaving medicine to buy Christmas presents \nfor their grandchildren. Ultimately, that is what this debate is about. \nIt is about taking a great American success story, called Medicare, and \nsimply updating it for the times. Let's say no to the drug companies \nand yes to all the grandmas and the grandpas across the country and to \neveryone who is counting on us to do the right thing.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7327-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7327-S7332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        GREATER ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE PHARMACEUTICALS ACT OF 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate on the motion to waive the Budget Act to be equally divided \nand controlled by the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, and \nthe Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, this is an extremely important \nvote. It is very important because in the Congress we worry not only \nabout the Nation as a whole, but as a nation of its individual parts, \nthat is made up of 50 different States, all of whom are getting \nclobbered by something called a loss of Medicaid money.\n  We have a chance with the amendment before us to adjust that \nsituation. We felt so strongly about the situation and the loss of \nMedicaid money for our most vulnerable citizens, and also the damage it \ndoes in the aggregate to our hospitals, nursing homes, and every part \nof our health infrastructure. Whether you are in an urban or rural \narea--and the Presiding Officer's State includes both urban and rural--\nyou are faced with hospitals and other facilities that depend \noverwhelmingly on Medicaid.\n  The States now have an enormous shortfall in their budgets. In fact, \nthere are deficits of $40 billion to $50 billion. No State, with the \nexception of Vermont, can go into deficit financing like we do in the \nFederal Government. They have to balance their budgets. So what happens \nif they get to a situation where they don't have money? I was a \nGovernor for 8 years, and I was in that situation for a full 5 years, \nwhere we actually had to lower moneys because the revenue was less than \nthe previous year. We had to lay off people and the other things \nGovernors have to do.\n  We are in a position to help now. We have done nothing on health \ncare, basically, except the children's health insurance program, which \naffects 2 million children, but it needs to affect many more. We have \ndone nothing about universal health care, prescription drugs, or this \nMedicaid problem, and about virtually all of the areas of health care \nthat we talk about all the time and simply do not perform on.\n  So this is a real test for the 100 people who will come here to vote \non whether they want to see their States drown in debt and have to cut \nMedicaid and hurt not only children but families and hospitals and \nnursing homes and home health--all the aspects of where Medicaid makes \na difference.\n  We felt so strongly about this after September 11, which was an \nenormous day in the history of the world, that we included this in the \nstimulus package. We did that prior to last Christmas, which was a long \ntime ago. We did it and we decided it was so important to do, even at \nthat time, it being a worse situation now, that we would treat it in an \nemergency fashion and not require it to be offset. Some people say you \nneed to offset that. When you get into economic times like we have \nnow--much worse than they were then--the underpinnings are weaker in \ngeneral, and now we really do have to act.\n  So what I am going to do is not use up all of our time, but wait for \nsome colleagues to come down to speak on this amendment and why it is \nimportant that we waive the Budget Act and that we do the right thing \nby States and Medicare. This is an extremely important vote; it is a \ntest vote about whether the Senate is really willing to do anything for \nthe States and for health care. So far, we have failed on all fronts. \nNow we have a chance to reverse ourselves on a small, but important, \naspect of it.\n  We have, as I say, so many cosponsors that I will not even take the \ntime to read them. But it is very bipartisan, with 35 cosponsors, \nincluding 8 Republicans. We should, in fact, prevail on this and get \nthe 60 votes that we want because it is good. This is an emergency, I \nsay to the Presiding Officer. This is important now even more so \nbecause Medicaid bears all of the brunt of the rising cost of \nprescription drugs because it is only Medicaid and the Veterans' \nAdministration that pays for prescription drugs. This is not Medicare, \nthis is Medicaid, and it is suffering terribly. This is an emergency. \nWe deemed it such after 9/11. The situation is worse now. We have a \nchance to do something about it.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, one of the reasons I love this job is \nthat you never reach a situation where you are able to say I have heard \nit all before. In much of life, as you live longer and longer, you get \nto the point where there is nothing new under the sun, where any new \nevent had so many precedents for it that you understand it and you know \nit and you expect it. The wonderful thing about this job is that there \nis always a new proposal, always a new approach, always a new way of \ndoing things that you would have never, ever thought of, and that you \nwould have never believed that anyone else would have thought of.\n  I have spent 18 years in the Senate trying to deal with deficit \nspending. It has been a long, sometimes fruitful, sometimes not so \nfruitful, battle. I would have to say in the last year and a half, it \nhas been a very unfruitful battle from my point of view because we \nstarted out with a surplus which literally burned a great big hole in \nour pocket. We literally could not spend the money fast enough.\n  Now, interestingly enough, we have a deficit. The last projection by \nthe Congressional Budget Office is that we are going to spend, this \nyear, $165 billion more than we take in. That deficit seems to grow \nevery time there is a new projection. Yet our behavior is totally \nunchanged. In fact, I can say that in almost 25 years of service in the \nHouse and in the Senate, I have never seen the urge to spend money more \nunchecked in Congress than it is today. To me, it is a very frightening \nprospect as to what this is going to mean when all these bills come \ndue.\n  Let me try to respond to the proposal before us because in so many \nways, it is extraordinary. The logic of it is pretty straightforward. \nThe States are in a position that, because of the state of the economy, \nmany States are beginning to have deficits that used to have surpluses. \nIn fact, it is projected now that unless something happens very \npositive and very dramatic in the next few months, that as many as 40 \nStates will run deficits next year, or at least will face the prospects \nof deficits because many States, like my own, have to balance their \nbudget. They will have to come into session in January, and they will \nhave to make hard choices.\n  We don't make hard choices in Congress, but they will have to make \nhard choices in the legislature. When you add up the cumulative \nprojected deficits for all 40 States that are looking at potentially \nbeing in the red, that accumulated aggregate deficit projection is \nabout $40 billion.\n  Now, the proposal before us extraordinarily says let's declare an \nemergency so that we can spend another $9 billion that we don't have, \nevery penny of which will come out of the Social Security trust fund; \nbut let's go ahead and borrow that money now. Let's take it out of the \nSocial Security trust fund and spend it so that States will not be \nrequired to make tough choices. The only problem is, our projected \ndeficit is four times as great as the aggregate sum of all the deficits \nof all the States in the Union combined.\n  In fact, it would have made more sense--I would not have supported it \nbut it would have made more sense had our dear colleagues proposed that \nwe reduce Medicaid reimbursement because the States have a better \nfinancial situation than we do and, therefore, they are in a better \nposition to deal with this problem.\n  I would not have supported that proposal because I do not think we \nwant to beggar our neighbor in terms of imposing our problems on the \nStates, but at least it could have been argued, with a deficit \nprojected to be four times as big as all the State deficits combined, \nthat we cannot be as generous as we wanted to be. That argument would \nmake sense at Dicky Flatt's Print Shop in Mexia, TX. People would \nunderstand that argument in Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S7329]]\n\nThey might not like it. They might oppose it, but they would understand \nit. They would say it made sense, but I do not believe people at Hesser \nDrug Coffee Bar in Ennis, TX, or people anywhere in any State in the \nUnion, would find logic in the Federal Government borrowing another $9 \nbillion we do not have, taking the money out of the Social Security \ntrust fund because every penny of this surplus is Social Security \nsurplus. I do not think they would understand us declaring an emergency \nto spend this $9 billion to give it to States, that if we added up \ntheir total deficit is not one-fourth of the deficit that we are \nrunning right now.\n  So we basically are down to a question that we have to ask ourselves: \nAre we willing to declare an emergency to run a new deficit of $9 \nbillion--spend $9 billion today, and in doing so, take $9 billion out \nof the Social Security trust fund? Are we willing to do that because \nStates are running a cumulative deficit that is one-fourth as big as \nthe deficit we are running? That basically is the question that is \nbefore us. It is easy for one to say this is a compassionate decision \nbecause they do not want their State to have to make a tough decision, \nbut compassion is what one does with one's own money, not what one does \nwith somebody else's money. This money is coming out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund. This money is coming from, ultimately, the \ntaxpayer who is going to have to pay it back, plus interest.\n  If the proponents of this amendment were anteing up out of their own \npockets, we could say they are compassionate about their States; they \nare worried about what will happen in States that have deficits. But it \nis not compassion when it is somebody else's money. The idea that we \nwould run a $9 billion deficit today, that we would take $9 billion out \nof Social Security today to give to States that are running a deficit, \nthat when added up among all the States in the Union is not one-fourth \nas big as the deficit we are running, it makes absolutely no sense.\n  I think, at least where I am from, and maybe where I am from is \ndifferent than where other people are from, but in my State that would \nmake absolutely no sense.\n  Finally, every time we talk about letting people keep more of what \nthey earn, every time we have a debate about letting working families \nkeep more of what they earn, many of our colleagues stand up and say we \ncannot afford it. We would like not to force families to sell their \nbusiness or sell their farm when pappa dies so the Government can get \n55 cents out of every dollar they have accumulated in their whole \nlifetime, even though they have paid taxes on every penny of it. Our \ncolleagues tell us we do not like doing that but we do not have any \nchoice because we do not have the money; we are running a deficit now.\n  When we talk about making the repeal of the marriage penalty \npermanent so we do not penalize people for the simple act of falling in \nlove and getting married, both of them good things it seems to me, we \nare told that we would like to do that but we do not have enough money \nbecause we are now running a deficit.\n  Why is it we never, ever have enough money to let people keep more of \nwhat they earn but we always have enough money to spend? Why is there \nthis huge difference? I would assert basically because deep down many \nMembers of the Senate believe they can spend money better than families \ncan spend money.\n  I have raised a point of order against this amendment, and I want to \nbe sure my colleagues understand what the point of order is about. This \namendment will force the Government to take $9 billion out of the \nSocial Security trust fund and give it to the States at a time when all \nthe States combined have a deficit that is not one-quarter the deficit \nof the U.S. Government. This is a very bad decision. I can see how it \nwould be popular in the legislatures, but it cannot be good public \npolicy to do this. So I urge my colleagues to sustain this budget point \nof order.\n  If our colleagues want to come back and say, look, this is important, \nwe want to do this, and we are willing to take $9 billion away from \nsomething else that is not as important, then depending on what they \ntake it away from I might be willing to support it. To simply say we \nwant to give this money away, even though we do not have it, I do not \nbelieve that is a responsible position. As a result, I have raised the \nbudget point of order.\n  I hope my colleagues who constantly talk about protecting the Social \nSecurity trust fund, I hope my colleagues who constantly talk about the \nfiscal irresponsibility of letting working people keep more of what \nthey earn through tax cuts, will apply that standard today when we are \ngratuitously taking $9 billion out of the Social Security trust fund, \nborrowing it knowing we are going to have to pay it back plus interest. \nThis is irresponsible policy. It should be stopped, and I urge my \ncolleagues to sustain this budget point of order.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my colleague from West Virginia. He \nhas done such an able job in this challenge of finding a way to make \nthe partnership between the States and the Federal Government on the \nMedicaid Program work in difficult times.\n  I respect a great deal my friend and colleague from Texas, who makes \na very important point about spending in the Senate. If we were only \ntalking about spending, then I think that argument might stand, but \nwhat we are really looking at is a partnership that was created between \nthe Federal Government and the States and it is called the Medicaid \nProgram, a joint partnership. The Federal Government underfunded it \nbecause it said we will have a match and our match will vary based on \nour particular situation as well as the situation of the States.\n  I remember as Governor of Nebraska when the Federal budget was being \nbalanced and the Federal match was reduced. At the State level, my \nparticular portion had to increase. So the Federal Government balanced \nits budget on the basis of my budget and at the expense at times of my \nbudget.\n  Now we are looking at a situation in reverse. We have the States \nbeing challenged by growing red ink, and the Senator's comment about a \nbudget of 40 States with deficits of somewhere around $40 billion, in a \nnews article in the Chicago Tribune this morning, it was pointed out \nthat the gap in those States may be about $58 billion rather than $40 \nbillion.\n  The point is, this is a partnership, a federally mandated program \npartially funded under the idea that the State would have a \nresponsibility and the Federal Government would have a responsibility. \nThis is not about giving away money, this is about stopping the \nreduction in the Federal match for a period of 18 months and increasing \nit for a period of 18 months. It is not giving away money, it is \nassisting our partners in the process they are going through as they \nmake difficult choices.\n  It has been suggested that this will keep them from making difficult \nchoices. They have already cut education funding. They have already cut \nfunding in many other programs. The cutting has only begun. We are \nhopeful that the cutting in the area of Medicaid and/or in social \nservices will not cause the gains that have been made in having people \ngo from welfare reform to work reverse themselves and start a spiral \ndownward where the gains made can be lost.\n  All we are saying to the Federal Government is, do not reduce our \nportion right now and require, then, the States to make that choice \nabout increasing theirs, which they cannot do; or cutting eligibility \nfor Medicaid and causing, most likely, a downward spiral as they face \nthe Medicaid uncertainties.\n  In addition to recognizing this is a responsibility we created--I was \nnot here, but collectively the Federal Government created this under \nthis Federal program--I think we have a responsibility. We are facing \nthat responsibility. Yes, we are having some difficult times, but we \nneed to share the difficult times together rather than stand on the \nsideline and say it is up to the States to make the difficult choices \nand see them make choices that will have adverse, and maybe in some \ncases draconian, results at the State level.\n  I understand the importance of trying to develop offsets. How can \nanyone\n\n[[Page S7330]]\n\never be against offsets? Let me state a few things that have flown in \nthe face of asking for offsets--except where maybe you are not \ninterested in seeing the program move forward. We passed yesterday the \nsupplemental at a $28.9 billion total cost, $2 billion offset. A few of \nthe things included $14.4 billion for defense--no one argues with \nthat--or $6.7 billion for homeland security. How can anyone argue with \nthat? Or $5.5 billion for New York, how can anyone argue with that? No \nrequest for specific offset for New York, no specific offset for \nhomeland security, for defense. Or $1 billion for Pell grants, $417 \nmillion for veterans medical care, and $400 million for improvements to \nState and local election procedures, we all know how important those \nare. Or $205 million for Amtrak, we also know how important that is. \nBut $2 billion worth of offset to $28.9 billion worth of budget.\n  I am not saying these are not important any more than anyone else is. \nI am suggesting that while they are important, so is this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I happily yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, let's put the budget point of order of \nthe Senator from Texas against our fiscal relief amendment into some \ncontext. The Senator's point of order, in essence, claims that the \nfiscal relief provided by our bipartisan amendment is somehow not \nemergency spending.\n  Let's look at the facts. Let's look at the situation. The Budget \nEnforcement Act of 1990 established statutory limits on discretionary \nspending and a pay-as-you-go requirement for new direct spending and \ntax legislation. But it also exempted from the caps all discretionary \nspending designated by the President and the Congress as an emergency \nrequirement.\n  The law does not further define what is an emergency requirement. \nThat is up to us. One place we can look for guidance, however, is to \nthe criteria developed by the Office of Management and Budget for the \nPresident to use when determining whether or not a spending provision \nqualifies for emergency treatment. The Office of Management and Budget \ndetermined that an emergency spending provision is ``sudden, urgent, \nnecessary, unforeseen, and not permanent.'' The funds that the \namendment allocates to the States is all of those things. They meet the \ncriteria precisely for emergency spending.\n  First, our amendment addresses a sudden and unforeseen problem. That \nis the unexpected drop in revenues States have experienced. Indeed, 39 \nStates were forced to reduce their already enacted budgets for fiscal \nyear 2002 by reducing essential programs, tapping rainy day funds, \nfurloughing employees, and cutting important services. In short, the \nbudget crisis was clearly a sudden and unexpected development for our \npartners as States.\n  The second relief our amendment provides is needed to address an \nurgent situation, another criterion. The latest figures show that 46 \nStates are facing an aggregate budget shortfall exceeding $50 billion. \nMany have already cut or are considering cutting their Medicaid and \nsocial service programs.\n  Finally, the relief provided by our amendment is not permanent, it is \nshort-term relief, narrowly tailored to address a fiscal crisis that \nthe States are experiencing now.\n  In short, our amendment is a textbook example of the definition of \n``emergency'' spending. It addresses a sudden, unforeseen, urgent \ncrisis, and provides temporary but much needed relief.\n  Finally, we should not forget as we debate this issue what this is \nreally all about. It is about protecting health care and other \nessential social services for the neediest and most vulnerable citizens \nin this country. Medicaid provides health insurance to approximately 40 \nmillion low-income Americans, including 21 million children and young \nadults, 11 million elderly and disabled individuals, and 8.6 million \nadults in families, most of whom are single women. Without this \ncritical safety net, millions of low-income men and women and their \nfamilies would be left with no health insurance.\n  That is the bottom line in this debate. We need to help the States so \nthey can continue to provide essential health care to the most \nvulnerable citizens in our society. We are not taking the States off \nthe hook. They are still going to have to make many tough choices in \norder to balance their budgets. But we can provide this meaningful \nrelief. We must do so now in order to preserve that critical safety net \nfor the most vulnerable in our society.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. How much time is remaining to this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 14 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield to the Senator from Nebraska 4 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, how much time was yielded?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes was yielded.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. We have 14 minutes left; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes was yielded to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Thank you, Madam President, and I thank my \ncolleague from West Virginia.\n  I have never been to Dicky Flatt's and I hope my good friend from \nTexas will take me to Dicky Flatt's one of these days because it is, \nobviously, quite a place.\n  I imagine the folks in Dicky Flatt's, though, will be interested in \nwhat came from the supplemental--$22.9 million to upgrade port \nsurveillance and vessel tracking capability in the ports in Port \nArthur, TX, Houston, and New York City, NY, and $12.6 million to the \nPantex Plant in Texas for increased safeguards and security needs.\n  The point is, folks in Dicky Flatt's or Elm Creek, NB, or other small \ncommunities and/or locations around the country, understand why some \nspending is necessary. They understand also that when you have a \nFederal program that is put together, as the Medicaid Program has been, \nthat both parties have some responsibility to make sure it is viable so \nwhen times get difficult, one partner doesn't say to the other partner: \nGood luck, I hope you are able to make it.\n  Because now we have an opportunity to say this is our program \ntogether, at the Federal level and at the State level; we have an \ninterest in seeing that the people who are the most vulnerable in our \nsociety are appropriately served; that the nursing homes do not cease \nto be able to provide services or that childcare provisions are not \neliminated, which are transitional benefits to get, in many cases, \nsingle parents off welfare and into the workforce.\n  So as we think about offsets, I think it is important that we \nrecognize that one person's offset is another person's idea of \neliminating or destroying or in some way obstructing getting something \naccomplished.\n  What we have to do is make sure offsets are, in fact, included \nwherever we can possibly include them. But one of the reasons emergency \nspending issues and funding issues have not generally required offsets \nis because it is very difficult to be able to match it at the time. We \ncannot wait on this and we cannot fight out every offset people would \nlike to talk about. That is why emergency disaster relief, in this case \nemergency spending--to go to our States for our share of the program \nfor a period of time--just simply provides the opportunity to continue \nsomething and it has to be done immediately and the process then, I \ntake it, is there for them.\n  We only seem to talk about offsets when it is convenient, or where we \ndo talk about it and they are appropriate, it is when there is enough \ntime to be able to put them together and get them accomplished.\n  The economic stimulus plan, when this was a part of it last year, did \nnot have an offset. There was not a lot of discussion about offsets at \nthat time. Unfortunately, this particular provision did not get \nincluded in the stimulus package that was passed earlier this year, \nalthough it should have been. If it had been, it would not have \ninvolved an offset.\n  It seems to me we have the opportunity to move forward as a partner \nwith our States and to be able to assist them in very important policy \nmatters and programs that I think will benefit the people of our \ncountry and will benefit our economy. That is why this was\n\n[[Page S7331]]\n\nincluded earlier in the economic stimulus package. There was a \nrecognition it was part of the economic stimulus. I hope we will today \nrecognize it, not only as the right thing and fair thing to do with our \npartners, the States, but also recognize that this has been considered \npart of the economic stimulus package.\n  I ask unanimous consent an article by Judith Graham entitled \n``States' Budgetary Shortfalls Deepen'' be printed in the Record, and I \nyield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, July 25, 2002]\n\n                  States' Budgetary Shortfalls Deepen\n\n                           (By Judith Graham)\n\n       Denver.--Concerned state legislators gathered here for \n     their yearly meeting received sobering news Wednesday: State \n     budget deficits have widened dramatically over the last \n     several months, and the worst may be yet to come. Budget gaps \n     are projected to reach $57.9 billion for the fiscal year that \n     began July 1, up from the $35.9 billion deficit recorded \n     during the previous 12-month period, according to a report by \n     the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n       While states have plugged these holes by reducing spending \n     and, in some cases, raising taxes, these solutions may not be \n     enough. With turnoil roiling Wall Street, investors in a \n     state of shock and costs for health-care programs such as \n     Medicaid escalating sharply, ``We've anticipating deficits \n     are going to grow even larger in the months ahead,'' said \n     Corina Eckl, the group's fiscal affairs director. Consumers \n     are feeling the bite of the states' financial woes in the \n     form of higher tuition for public colleges, fewer services \n     for at-risk kids, less help for elderly people trying to live \n     independently in their homes, larger elementary school class \n     sizes, as well as higher taxes.\n       States including Illinois are being hit particularly hard \n     by the stock market's troubles, which have taken a big bite \n     out of personal incomes and shaken consumer confidence. On \n     average, more than one-third of state tax revenues comes from \n     personal income taxes, with another sizable chunk coming from \n     sales taxes. The falloff has been widespread: 26 states \n     collected less money during their just-ended fiscal years \n     than they did the year before, according to the conference's \n     new study. ``For many states, this is the first time this has \n     ever happened,'' said Arturo Perez, a budget analyst with the \n     legislative group.\n       Reflecting a sense of pessimism, 46 percent of legislators \n     polled at a Wednesday morning meeting said they thought \n     revenues would remain flat or decline in the year ahead. \n     Virtually all states are legally required to balance budgets. \n     If so, hard choices may become even more difficult.\n       This past year, 19 states tapped into rainy day funds and \n     12 turned to tobacco settlement funds to make up for lower-\n     than-expected revenues and keep spending cuts in check. But \n     those reserves are now substantially smaller, leaving states \n     with fewer options and more pressure to cut programs, said \n     William Pound, the executive director of the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures. One state facing acute \n     pressure is Iowa, where revenues slid nearly 9 percent last \n     year and spending was slashed nearly 6 percent below the \n     previous year's levels. ``If you're a parent and you walk \n     into the human services department and ask for help, you'll \n     be told no services are available,'' said state Rep. Dave \n     Heaton, co-chairman of the Iowa House's human services \n     appropriations subcommittee. ``The most we can do is try to \n     help existing clients.''\n       Among other budget-saving measures, Iowa has raised tuition \n     at public colleges by nearly 20 percent, and instituted a \n     hiring freeze for child protection services. With the number \n     of workers down because of attrition and retirements, \n     ``caseloads continue to rise and, to be honest, the attitude \n     out there in the field is very stressful,'' said Heaton, a \n     Republican from Mt. Pleaasant. ``I can tell you staffing at \n     our boys' school and juvenile home, as well as our mental \n     health facilities, is critical because of the cuts we've had \n     to make,'' he said. ``No matter how small you want government \n     to be, there are still things government has to do. And the \n     problem I see now is we're getting to the point where we \n     can't afford to do them.''\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, a particular problem facing not only the \nAmerican people but also the States themselves--and that certainly \nincludes my home State of Maine--is the rising cost of health care.\n  Today, Medicaid is the fastest growing component of State budgets, \naccounting for up to 20 percent of the average State budget, as costs \nincreased by 11 percent last year and are expected to increase by \nanother 13.4 percent this year. One of the components of this increase \nhas been a corresponding increase in prescription drug costs as many \nstates have discount prescription drug programs through Medicaid.\n  In addition, the economic downturn has left many families out of a \njob and without their health insurance, forcing them to turn to \nMedicaid. This put an enormous strain on the States, which were already \nfacing tough budget decisions. In an effort to address their budgetary \nobligations, 22 States have cut Medicaid spending and 16 have cut \nprograms that help low-income people.\n  The situation strained further by the fact that the Fiscal Year 02 \nFMAP allocations did not reflect the economic downturn and the \nresulting upswing in people needing assistance. In fact, due to the \nformula used to determine the match, 29 States found themselves with a \nsmaller Federal match than in Fiscal Year 01.\n  As a result, many states have scaled back eligibility, reduced \nbenefits, increased beneficiary cost-sharing, and cut or delayed \npayments to providers. Additional reductions in health care assistance, \nas well as cuts in other State-funded programs that serve many of those \naffected by the economic downturn, are expected. At this point in \nMaine's financial crisis, savings have been found elsewhere in the \nbudget. However, my Governor has already made a call for a special \nsession of the State legislature, which adjourned back on April 25 of \nthis year, so that they can hammer out a solution to the ballooning \ndeficit.\n  I am particularly concerned about the impact the State budget crunch \nwill have on the Medicaid Program and the low-income children and \nfamilies who rely on this program for essential health coverage. Last \nyear, the House passed the Senate Centrists Economic Stimulus bill that \nI developed along with Senator Breaux and others, and that proposal \ncontained about $4.5 billion in emergency Medicaid funding to the \nStates. Unfortunately, we could not get a vote on the proposal in the \nSenate.\n  In January, I voted to support an amendment by Senator Harkin to the \ncompromise economic stimulus bill that would have increased the FMAP by \n3 percent for all States and 1.5 percent for States with higher than \naverage unemployment rates, but the amendment was defeated.\n  Passage of this Rockefeller-Collins amendment would mean the infusion \nof about $54 million into my State of Maine--$36 million under the FMAP \nprovisions alone. Maine is currently staring down the barrel of a $180 \nmillion budget shortfall. Many States face similar circumstances and \nstill others face a figure many times that amount.\n  We do not want, and we certainly do not need, our States to reduce \nessential health care and social services to people in need in order to \nbalance their budgets. The low-income families and seniors of this \nNation should be able to rely on the continuation of these programs on \nwhich they have come to depend. The states should receive the help they \nneed to continue their programs offering prescription drugs to seniors \nand low-income individuals and families. During these difficult fiscal \ntimes, our States need more federal assistance in providing health care \nservices through Medicaid, not less.\n  I want to thank the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, and \nmy colleague, Ms. Collins, for offering this amendment and I urge my \ncolleagues to support our States and this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask to retain 5 minutes to close \ndebate on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 2 minutes or so to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. It has been a \npleasure to work with him and the Senator from Nebraska, as well as the \nSenator from Oregon, on this important amendment.\n  The Senator from Nebraska raised a very good point. This amendment \nhas implications for all of our health care providers and that is why \nit enjoys such strong support of our nursing homes, of our hospitals--\nour rural hospitals are struggling with inadequate reimbursements--from \ndisability advocates and the Visiting Nurse Associations.\n  But let's talk about what this means. We have talked about it being \nnecessary to protect the most vulnerable\n\n[[Page S7332]]\n\nin our society. Let's talk about what it means for some individual \nStates.\n  I mentioned yesterday that this amendment would provide $54 million \nin much needed relief to my home State of Maine. That would help avoid \nthe necessity for draconian cuts in essential social service programs \nsuch as our Medicaid Program. But let's look at a few other States.\n  For Alabama, for example, this would mean $92.6 million; for Alaska, \nit would be $32.2 million; for Arizona, $144 million; for Arkansas, $80 \nmillion.\n  Let me skip down a bit. For Florida, $359 million; for Georgia, $208 \nmillion; for Hawaii, $28 million; for Idaho, $28.6 million. Indeed, the \nGovernor of Idaho, our former colleague, Governor Kempthorne, has \nworked very hard as an advocate for this important legislation.\n  In other words, every single State in the Nation would be by this \namendment provided with much needed relief. That is why we need to act. \nOtherwise, States are going to have no choice but to slash essential \nprograms.\n  We have new figures coming out today that show the fiscal crisis \naffecting our partners, the States, has widened still further. \nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislators, States have \nused up two-thirds of their cash on hand. The gap between revenues and \nspending has hit $36 billion and is expected to be $58 billion, \naffecting 46 States. We must act. I urge my colleagues to reject the \npoint of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 2 minutes.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Would my colleague from West Virginia withhold for a \nmoment? If the Senator from West Virginia will yield, I appreciate my \ncolleague's courtesy.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7332-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TERRORISM RISK PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as all of our colleagues know, over the \nlast many weeks we have been attempting to work out an arrangement \nwhereby we can go to conference on terrorism insurance. I am very \npleased to be able to report this morning that we are now in a position \nto be able to do so. I have been in consultation with the Republican \nleader, and I am prepared now to present a unanimous consent request in \nthat regard.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 252, H.R. 3210, the House-passed \nterrorism insurance bill, that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken, the text of S. 2600 as passed by the Senate be inserted in \nlieu thereof, the bill as thus amended be read the third time, passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the Senate insist \nupon its amendment, request a conference with the House upon the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be authorized \nto appoint conferees on the part of the Senate with the ratio of 4 to \n3, all without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Almost 17 minutes on the Republican side and 7 \nminutes on the Democrat's side.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield me 8 minutes?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would yield him 10 minutes. He deserves to be heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the budget point of \norder that was raised by my colleague from Texas. I am a little \ndisappointed that the chairman of the Budget Committee didn't raise it. \nIt is the responsibility of the Budget Committee. I have had the \npleasure of serving with my colleague from Texas on the Budget \nCommittee. That is the reason why we have a Budget Committee and the \nreason why we tried to pass a budget. We didn't pass a budget this year \nfor the first time since 1974. Shame on this Congress. Shame on this \nSenate. Shame on, frankly, the leadership in this Senate for not \ngetting it done.\n  It is maybe the most fiscally irresponsible thing we have not done \nand, as a result, there is no limit to how much money we can spend.\n  A budget point of order still lies on an amendment such as this, or \nany amendment, until the end of September, so we are raising a budget \npoint of order for good reason. My colleague from Texas and the \nsponsors of the amendment, say this is a $9 billion amendment. This \nwill increase Federal spending. You can come up with a list to show \nthat every State is going to benefit. I know my State is going to \nbenefit $93 million. I am sure my Governor would send me a letter \nsaying please vote for this; we need help. And they do.\n  I agree with my colleague and very good friend from Maine. A lot of \nStates are in very difficult times.\n  If you have an amendment on the floor that says here is $9 billion, \nand cut it up, every State is going to benefit. You could have every \nState Governor saying pass this amendment. What is wrong with it? Yes, \nstates are having a difficult time. The Federal Government is having a \ndifficult time, too. The Senator from Texas pointed out that the \nFederal deficit is much larger than the States' deficits. The Federal \ndeficit, if you include Social Security, is $322 billion. Things may \nhave deteriorated for State revenues, but they have deteriorated \nsignificantly for Federal revenues.\n  It is not just borrowing against Social Security. It is borrowing \nagainst the American people. The American people are going to have to \nborrow this $9 billion. They will have to pay interest on it. My \nbiggest concern is that it is not a $9 billion amendment. I know the \namendment is temporary. I know it is retroactive.\n  It is kind of interesting how we are going to spend retroactive \nmoney. This goes back and says we are going to increase spending going \nback to April of this year. And then presumably, we are going to do it \nthrough this September, and then next year.\n  It is an amendment that is for about 1 \\1/2\\ years. My concern is it \nwon't be a year and a half. If you increase these formulas, States are \ngoing to still be in difficult times next year. They are going to say: \nLet's make this permanent. These formulas, in many respects, are good. \nWe don't want them to ever go down. We never want the States to get \nless.\n  If it is temporary, and here is a 1.35 percent increase in Federal \nmatch, what makes anybody think this won't be extended? This amendment \nis a $100 billion amendment. If it is extended, I can tell you if we \npass this--and it may well be that my good friend from West Virginia \nhas the votes. The administration is very opposed to it, illustrated in \na letter from them that I have here. But if it becomes law, I have no \ndoubt whatsoever that a year from now colleagues will say: Let's make \nthis permanent. States are still in trouble. Governors will say: Let's \nmake this permanent. Let's just increase the Federal share. It is free. \nIt came from the Federal Government.\n  I just happen to disagree with that. If this is made permanent, we \nare talking about spending $100 billion--$9 billion basically for the \nfirst year--$100 billion. We are just going to do that? Next year we \nmay not be able to make a budget point of order if we don't figure out \nsome way to get fiscal discipline. We are just going to pass $100 \nbillion, and have colleagues stand up and say: I can't believe these \ndeficits are so high.\n  This amendment increases the Federal share. It increases FMAP. Times \nare tough, and we are going to increase the Federal share on Medicare.\n  Wait a minute. Times were good in the last several years when we had \nthe largest surplus in the country. Did we see an increase in the \nFederal share when States were doing very well?\n  We have never said this should be based on the economy or on States' \nability to pay. The formula for the FMAP is based on the States' income \nrelative to the Federal income. The States' income was much higher than \nthe norm with Federal income. They\n\n[[Page S7333]]\n\npaid a greater percentage, or they weren't subsidized to get as much. \nAnother way to say this is that the poorer States were being subsidized \nmore.\n  This just kind of inverts and says the States that had the \nsignificant growth last year are going to get the biggest benefit out \nof this proposal.\n  It doesn't do anything to fix some of the biggest fraud that is being \nperpetrated in this system right now--the upper payment limit. I wish \nmy colleagues new something about it. Maybe some do. Maybe former \nGovernors do. But there is a fraud, an accounting scheme and scam that \nis going on today called upper payment limit. It is being done by about \n30 States that are ripping off the Medicaid Program and the Federal \nGovernment that is having difficulty. They devised a clever little \ngimmick to have the Federal Government--not pay 50 percent, not pay 60 \npercent, not pay 70 percent--pay 100 percent of Medicaid costs.\n  Are we fixing that? No. If we are going to deal with Medicaid, I tell \nmy colleague from West Virginia and others that we are going to deal \nwith the upper payment limit.\n  It is sickening to me to think we are telling people we are going to \nhold private America to a strict accountability standard; we are going \nto have you sign truth-in-accounting statements, fiscal statements and \nfinancial statements; and, we have Governors who are ripping off the \ntaxpayers of this country with an upper payment scheme and scam to \nwhere they get the Federal Government to pay 100 percent of their \nMedicaid costs.\n  It is happening in State, after State, after State, after State.\n  Have we fixed that? No. Should we fix it? Yes. Let us deal with that.\n  If we are going to get into Medicaid reimbursements, let us wrestle \nwith that. Have we had a markup in the Finance Committee? No. Have we \nrequested it? Yes. Did we mark up this FMAP proposal? No.\n  Some said: We will deal with the upper payment limits. This didn't go \nthrough the Finance Committee. Maybe it is just a continual stream. \nMaybe the Finance Committee, which used to be an important committee, \ndoesn't matter whatsoever. Maybe we don't need hearings anymore. Maybe \nwe don't need markups in committee. Maybe we will do everything on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I disagree with that. I disagree with the abuse that is being put on \nsome States by the upper payment limit; and, then to come up with this \namendment and say let us increase the Federal share on Medicaid--a \nFederal-State program--and have the Federal Government take more and \nmore of the program. It used to be a Federal-State combination. Now \nthere is this idea to let us make the Federal Government pay more.\n  If you are going to do a 1.35 percent increase, why not make it all \nFederal? Make it 70 percent in every State, or make it 80 percent. \nThere has to be some kind of limit. The Federal Government happens to \nhave deficit problems, too.\n  Just to increase this entitlement and really kind of turn the formula \nupside down--this goes all the way back to the creation of Medicaid, a \nsuccessful program to help low-income States; a program designed to \nbenefit the poorer States, to assist them. Medicaid is a good program, \nbut this amendment says, well, we want the Federal Government to make \nup more, and when some States are abusing it, we don't stop that abuse. \nWe are just going to have the Federal Government pick up more. We can \nhand out cards. Your State is going to get so many billion dollars. \nWe'll just borrow some Federal money.\n  The Senator from Texas said it is Social Security money. It is Social \nSecurity, plus we are going into debt $165 billion.\n  We will borrow every penny that we are talking about. We will pay \ninterest on that debt and write a check for that interest. It is not \njust an accounting gimmick. It is not just crediting some fictitious \ntrust fund. We will write a check for every dime that is spent in this \nprogram.\n  I question the wisdom of doing that. The administration is opposed.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, dated \nJuly 18 that says:\n\n       The Administration is opposed to this amendment. A \n     temporary change in the FMAP rate would be an unprecedented \n     disruption of the longstanding shared fiscal responsibility \n     for the Medicaid program. FMAP rates are not designed to \n     change according to short-term economic developments. Such \n     cyclical movements are contrary to the intent of the Medicaid \n     statute, and in the long term, would serve the interest of \n     neither the States nor the Federal Government.\n\n  I believe that is exactly right.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                       The Secretary of Health\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Minority Leader Lott: We understand that Senators Jay \n     Rockefeller, Susan Collins, Ben Nelson, and Gordon Smith will \n     offer an amendment to S. 812, the ``Greater Access to \n     Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act.'' The amendment would provide \n     temporary increases in the Federal Medical Assistance \n     Percentage (FMAP) under the Medicaid program under Title XIX \n     of the Social Security Act. It would also provide grants to \n     States through Title XX to be used for a variety of social \n     services programs.\n       The Administration is opposed to this amendment. A \n     temporary change in the FMAP rate would be an unprecedented \n     disruption of the longstanding shared fiscal responsibility \n     for the Medicaid program. FMAP rates are not designed to \n     change according to short-term economic developments. \n     Although FMAPs are based on State per capita income levels \n     and other economic indicators, they have not typically risen \n     and fallen with short-term economic trends. If State logic \n     suggests raising FMAPs now, then it would also imply lowering \n     them in times of economic boom. If we had followed such a \n     course, after nine years of economic recovery, current FMAP \n     rates would be much lower than they are today. Such cyclical \n     movements are contrary to the intent of the Medicaid statute, \n     and in the long term, would serve the interest of neither the \n     State nor the Federal government.\n       An FMAP increase is unlikely to increase health insurance \n     coverage. Instead of using increased funds to provide more \n     health services, States would likely use the increase in \n     Federal dollars to lower their spending on health care. \n     Increasing the FMAP would not lead to more coverage; it \n     simply shifts additional health care costs onto the Federal \n     government.\n       The President has introduced a nunber of initiatives to \n     help alleviate State fiscal pressures and to increase access \n     to health care coverage for millions of uninsured Americans, \n     including:\n       $89 billion over 10 years for health credits for the \n     uninsured;\n       A Medicaid drug rebate proposal that would save States \n     billions of dollars over the next ten years;\n       A proposal to provide Federal funding for prescription drug \n     coverage to low-income seniors prior to implementation of \n     comprehensive improvements in Medicare. Such a proposal has \n     already passed the House and would provide quick fiscal \n     relief to States, which have had to take responsibility for \n     prescription drug coverage in the absence of Senate action;\n       Medicaid coverage for families transitioning from welfare \n     to work through FY 2003;\n       A proposal to make available State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (SCHIP) funds that under current law would \n     return to the Treasury at the end of FY 2002 and 2003; and\n       The Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability \n     Demonstration Initiative that gives States more flexibility \n     using Medicaid and SCHIP funds to expand health insurance \n     coverage to low-income Americans.\n       All of these proposals would provide both temporary and \n     long-term fiscal relief for States, which is the right policy \n     response given that State' health care obligations are \n     expected to continue to increase rapidly. In addition, these \n     proposals would help provide more secure and affordable \n     health care assistance for low-income Americans right away. \n     These are far more effective approaches than an increase in \n     the FMAP.\n       The Administration also opposes the temporary increase in \n     funding for the Social Service Block Grant under Title XX of \n     the Social Security Act. We believe that States already have \n     sufficient access to other Federal block grant funds to \n     supplement the Social Services Block Grant and other social \n     services-related programs.\n       We understand that some States continue to have financial \n     difficulties and that Medicaid constitutes a large share of \n     State spending. However, we do not feel that this temporary \n     increase in FMAP is an effective or proper way to address \n     these final difficulties. We will continue to work with the \n     Senate to implement effective approaches of providing relief \n     to states while improving health care coverage and \n     affordability.\n\n[[Page S7334]]\n\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the submission of this report from the \n     standpoint of the President's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Tommy G. Thompson.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Seven minutes remain on both sides.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from West \nVirginia if I might have 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield to the Senator from Nebraska 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator \nRockefeller.\n  Back in the early nineties when I tried to balance our budget as \nGovernor and had a difficult time doing it, the Federal Government \nreduced its share and increased ours.\n  Today, the Federal Government is not having the same difficulty the \nState of Nebraska is having in terms of revenue. For only the second \ntime in history, Nebraska's revenues are less this year than they were \nlast year.\n  If we are trying to talk about who is going to do what during \ndifficult times and how this partnership is going to work, I think it \nis a little inconsistent to say the Federal Government doesn't reduce \nits share. It does. If it reduces it, it can increase it; and it does \nin the ordinary course of events.\n\n  What we are saying is, this is an unusual set of events--not a \ntemporary downturn, although we think it is but it is an unusual set of \nevents where the Federal Government continues to have growing income \nand the States are having a reduction in their income.\n  It is a recognition that this partnership, which was created by the \nFederal Government with the States, is one that needs to work as a \npartnership where the two partners can work together to make this \nprogram work. That is what it is.\n  Certainly, I am not suggesting the Federal Government take over the \nentire partnership, take it over as a stand-alone program at the \nFederal Government level. But I think it is interesting to say that \nsomehow the Federal Government's share should not increase when, in \nfact, from time to time it has increased, as well as from time to time \nit has decreased.\n  I think it is important to recognize that the program is about \npeople. It is not about giving money to the States, it is about \nrecognizing the importance of the program to the people--the faces of \npeople who are elderly, working parents, usually single parents who are \nstruggling to get out of the welfare system, who currently have \ntransitional benefits in Medicaid, who could in fact lose those \nbenefits and lose their capacity to be able to work.\n  It seems to me we have to be able to look beyond what is being \nsuggested here.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining for the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes, and there are 7 \nminutes for the other side.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I failed to hear the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining for the Senator \nfrom West Virginia and 7 minutes remaining for the Senator from Texas. \nAnd the Chair understands that the final 5 minutes to close belong to \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the Presiding Officer, I am not going to \nuse all my time at the present time. I will just make a couple very \nquick points.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma--it is very important my colleagues and \ntheir staffs, who may be listening to this debate, understand this--\nused two arguments, and only two arguments.\n  One, he said, we may extend this. In other words, that is a classic \nargument. If you do not want to do something, you say, we may extend \nthis. That is why, just like when the tax cut was written into law, it \nwill not be extended. We have written into law that will not be \nextended.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is saying we do not want it extended \nbecause he does not want this to happen. And I understand that. It is a \ngood debating technique. But it isn't going to be extended. It is \ntemporary. It is a year and a half for a very specific reason.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will when I am finished.\n  Mr. NICKLES. It is a very friendly question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The other is the upper payment limit, which in fact \nis understood by some of us. And I do not know whether the Senator is \naware that the Bush administration, which writes a letter against \nthis--which maybe is not surprising, I don't know, but it is \ndisappointing--has already promulgated a new regulation, which took \neffect in April, which solves most of the problem about which the \nSenator is talking. The problem he is taking about is real, but it has \nno place in this debate. First, the administration has moved to solve \nit. Secondly, it has no part in this debate.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 14 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a very brief question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. On my time.\n  Is the Senator saying that should his amendment become law, there \nwill not be a request to extend this next year?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. No, I think there probably will not be, No. 1. And, \nNo. 2, I would probably oppose that because this is an emergency \nmeasure. That is what the Senator understood right after September 11. \nThat is why it was in the emergency package. It is an emergency \nmeasure, not a permanent measure. It is a way of helping people.\n  It is interesting, the Senator from Texas talked about the budget \ndeficit. He never talked about people. This is about 40 million people \nwho are suffering.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Do I have the commitment of my colleague to oppose an \nextension of this next year?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I have no instinct to extend this program because \nthe States----\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am going to yield time--3 minutes--to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, if he can arrive at his distinguished point of \noratory.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the Senator from West Virginia needs \na little more time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator, approximately how much time do you need \non your side?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. REID. So 5 minutes on each side. Is that OK with the Senator from \nOklahoma, an additional 5 minutes on each side?\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the Senator from West \nVirginia be given 5 additional minutes and the Senator from Texas 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first, I thank our friend from West \nVirginia for his excellent presentation and strong support.\n  I welcome the opportunity to be a cosponsor of this legislation. I \nknow there has been a good deal of debate and discussion about the \ntechnicalities of this amendment, but what we are really talking about \nare real people being hurt in the most egregious way if we fail to \nrespond.\n  We know that our States are facing economic challenges, and those \neconomic exigencies have required cutbacks in some of the very \nimportant programs that reach out to the neediest people in these \nStates.\n  We are talking about real people who are being hurt. Pregnant women \nin\n\n[[Page S7335]]\n\nFlorida will lose their current Medicaid coverage if their income just \nhappens to fall between 150 and 185 percent of poverty.\n  A North Carolina family of four, with a child suffering from juvenile \ndiabetes, could see their drug coverage shrink, potentially limiting \ntheir access to vital medicines.\n  Some 45,000 children could be cut from the Medicaid rolls in New \nMexico because of the proposed cuts to deal with the $47 million \nshortfall.\n  Some 50,000 children, pregnant women, disabled, and elderly could \nlose their Medicaid coverage in Oklahoma because of the $21 million \nshortfall.\n  It may be expressed in dollars, but it is really being expressed in \nreal people's lives: real suffering, real sacrifice, and real pain.\n  We have a chance to do something about that. This can be an \nexpression of our values as a society and our concern about our fellow \nhuman beings. These are the neediest of the needy in our society, and \nthis amendment will help them.\n  I commend the Senator for bringing this matter to the attention of \nthe Senate. I am very hopeful it will be accepted and that the point of \norder will be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I just want to make a couple points.\n  First of all, an increase in the Federal match under Medicaid was \npart of the Centrist Coalition's economic recovery package we \nconsidered. It was part of virtually every version. It had widespread \nsupport. It was supported by the administration. It did not make it \ninto the final package. But this is not a new idea. This is an idea \nwith widespread bipartisan support.\n  The second point I want to make is in response to an argument made by \nmy friend and colleague from Oklahoma. My friend from Oklahoma said \nMedicaid spending does not get cut in economically good times. In fact, \nit is countercyclical. In good times, far fewer people qualify for \nMedicaid. In fact, Federal and State spending on Medicaid declined \ndramatically during the 1990s, when the economic times were good.\n  So there is a countercyclical aspect of Medicaid. It does go down \nwhen times are good and the program is less needed.\n  Now times are not good. There are more people in need of assistance \nfrom the Medicaid Program. We know 40 million Americans rely on this \nprogram.\n  What we are trying to do is preserve this essential, vital health \ncare program that provides services and care to the most vulnerable and \nneedy in our society. That is the motivation behind our proposal. It is \nnot to bail out the States, it is to help the States, our partners, \nprovide essential services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we are coming to the end of this debate. I \nwould like to make note of how deficits occur.\n  If anybody wants to understand why the Federal Government, which is \nthe summation of all of the taxpayers in the country, owes trillions of \ndollars, this is a classic example of how that comes about. We are \ntalking about spending $9 billion. There are 140 million taxpayers. \nThat is $64 per taxpayer.\n  The problem is, taxpayers are at work. It is 11:30 on a Thursday. \nThey don't know this debate is occurring. But all the special interest \ngroups that want this $9 million, members of the State legislatures who \nran for office to make decisions in the States, all the people who want \nthis money are looking over their Senator's right shoulder trying to \ntell them that they ought to care about people on Medicaid or about the \nState legislature or about the State's deficit.\n  That would be insignificant if the 140 million taxpayers were looking \nover the left shoulder. The problem is, it is 11:31 on a Thursday \nmorning and all those 140 million taxpayers are at work. They don't \neven know this debate is occurring. So as a result, what tends to \nhappen over and over and over again is that spending interests \ndominate.\n  Our colleagues tell us: States have difficulty. I remind my \ncolleagues, the Federal Government has difficulty. A year ago we had a \n$283 billion surplus. We were spending madly. Today we have a $165 \nbillion deficit, and we are still spending like drunken sailors, as \nRonald Reagan would say. Only drunken sailors are spending their own \nmoney, and in all fairness, we are spending somebody else's money.\n  We hear that the States in total could run as much as a $40 billion \ndeficit this year. I certainly am unhappy about it. My State faces \ntough decisions. But we are running a $165 billion deficit. We are \nrunning a deficit over four times as big as all the States combined.\n  Our colleagues say: This fits an emergency. This is unforeseen, \nunpredicted, unanticipated. Well, it is created by a formula that has \nonly existed for 37 years. So for 37 years we have known what the \nformula was. What is unanticipated, what is unpredicted about this?\n  Finally, as if the argument to waive this budget point of order and \nbar this $9 billion and take it away from Social Security could be any \nweaker, the argument basically comes down to: There are some States \nthat in the last few years have been doing better than other States, \nbetter than the country as a whole, and unless we give them more money \nnow, they may be adversely affected by the formula.\n  The way the formula works is, the higher the State's income relative \nto national income, the more of the Medicare share they pay. Should it \nbe the other way around? Should poorer States pay a higher share?\n  There is not one substantive argument in favor of borrowing this $9 \nbillion. If the American people knew this debate was occurring at 11:35 \nthis morning, if all 120 million taxpayers were following this debate, \nthis amendment would never have been offered and probably would not \nhave gotten 20 votes.\n  The problem is, those 120 million taxpayers are at work, and all the \npeople who want this money are looking over their Senator's right \nshoulder, sending letters back home, telling people whether he cares \nabout State finances or she cares about Medicaid beneficiaries.\n  That is the dilemma we are in. I urge my colleagues to look at the \nfact that in 12 short months, we have gone from $283 billion in the \nblack to $165 billion in the red. When does it stop? We are broke, and \nwe don't act like it. When do we stop spending this money that we do \nnot have?\n\n  I urge my colleagues to sustain this budget point of order. I urge \neverybody who has ever lamented the spending of the Social Security \nsurplus to put their vote where their mouth is. I urge everyone who has \never lamented the deficit, who has ever gone back to their State and \nsaid, I am for fiscal responsibility, to put your vote where your mouth \nis. I want to urge everybody who has ever said, we can't let working \npeople keep more of what they earn because we have a deficit, we need \nthe money, we can't afford it; I urge them to vote against this \nspending.\n  I don't know how you can have any possibility of being consistent in \ntaking the position that we ought to borrow this money. This is totally \nunjustified. I know some people want it. If you spend $9 billion, you \nare going to benefit somebody even if by mistake. I am not in any way \ndenigrating that this $9 billion will help people. I am not saying it \nwon't. But the point is, we have a budget process. We have seen the \nsurplus go from $283 billion in the black to $165 billion in the red. \nLet us stop that process here.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to sustain the budget point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 30 seconds or such time as he might need to \nthe distinguished Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                        Appointment of Conferees\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sorry I was not here when the unanimous\n\n[[Page S7336]]\n\nconsent agreement was entered assigning conferees to the antiterrorism \nlegislation. It is very important legislation. It is going to help all \nover the country.\n  I compliment and applaud Senator Lott and others who allowed us to go \nforward. It is an important day. Construction will be able to go \nforward as soon as we complete this conference in Nevada, Delaware, all \nover the country. It is important legislation. I compliment and applaud \nthe Republican leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, let me make a couple comments.\n  No. 1, my friend from Texas speaks with enormous passion about the \noverriding power of the budget, and at the very last moment of his last \nstatement, for the first time he used the word ``people.'' I sat in the \nsame Finance Committee with him for a long time when we were debating \ntax cuts--and I am not here to argue whether it was a good or bad \nthing, but there was no question that we went from a $5.6 trillion \nsurplus to a $165 billion annual deficit probably for the next 10 \nyears, if nothing gets worse--and I never heard him make the argument--\nfor some reason, maybe I missed it, maybe I wasn't there at the \nmoment--that we shouldn't do that tax cut which was the largest tax cut \nthat this particular Senator from West Virginia, who does not need it, \nhas ever received from the Federal Government--I never heard him talk \nabout the possibility of budget deficits.\n  So it does become a matter of priorities. It is fair, as the Senators \nfrom Nebraska, Massachusetts, and Maine have mentioned, to talk about \n40 million people. And to say we are doing this to bail out the States, \ngood grief, it is quite the opposite. The States are not powerful in \nthe same sense that the Federal Government is. The States cannot go \ninto deficit financing--with the exception of Vermont--as can the \nFederal Government. They have to balance their budgets.\n  I was a Governor; I know that. The Senator from Nebraska was a \nGovernor; he knows that. The States are not being bailed out. If the \nStates cut their Medicaid eligibility, they cannot receive any of this \nmoney, unless they restore their portion through legislative action to \nthe proper eligibility rate and, only then, on a temporary basis, for 1 \nand a half years, written into law, do they get this money.\n\n  I want to close on the concept of people. Sometimes it appears to me \non this floor that helping people is sort of a bad thing to do because \nif you help people, it implies that it might cost some money. It almost \nalways does. It also costs an awful lot more money if you don't, on \nsome occasions. This is one of those occasions. If we do not support \nthe motion to waive, then health infrastructure all across this country \nis going to be hurt because of its dependency upon Medicaid. Forty \nmillion people are going to be hurt, including disabled people, \nchildren, seniors, and others, because of this motion.\n  I need to tell you that this is not a bailout. This is temporary. \nThis was in the original emergency stimulus package. Nobody argued \nthen. Now, all of a sudden, they argue. It is very important for the \nStates to be healthy and for the States to be able to balance their \nbudgets, and therefore I strongly urge colleagues to support the motion \nto waive the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 51 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, anybody who has not heard me talk about the \ndeficit has not been listening in the last days, weeks, and years.\n  Secondly, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \naccounting of the Office of Management and Budget on where this deficit \nhas come from. We have gone from $283 billion in the black to $165 \nbillion in the red, and only 9 percent of that change had anything to \ndo with the tax cut.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                CHANGE IN SURPLUS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               FY2002             FY2003         FY2002-FY2011\n                                                        --------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         Billions  Percent  Billions  Percent  Billions  Percent\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal surplus (OMB February 2001)......................    $283    .......    $334    .......    $5,637  .......\n                                                        ========================================================\nEconomic and technical changes.........................     278        64      194        49      1,669      43\nBush tax cut...........................................      41         9       94        24      1,491      38\nAppropriations.........................................      45        10       40        10        409      10\nFarm bill..............................................       2         0       13         3         81       2\nStimulus...............................................      59        14       39        10         42       1\nOther..................................................       9         2       15         4        228       6\n                                                        --------------------------------------------------------\n      Total change in surplus..........................     434       100      395       100      3,920     100\n                                                        ========================================================\n      Total deficit/surplus (OMB July 2002)............     150    .......

Mr. President, I will conclude by saying that we have come \ndown to a decision about whether or not we are going to borrow $9 \nbillion, which we don't have. Given the state of the American economy \nand budget, given that our deficit is four times as big as the \ncumulative deficit of the States, I urge my colleagues not to bust the \nbudget, not to waive this budget point of order, but instead to be \nfiscally responsible.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Madam President, under the authority granted to me and \nafter consulting with the Republican leader, I now call up Calendar No. \n504, H.R. 5121, the legislative branch appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has that right. The clerk will \nreport the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7337]]\n\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5121) making appropriations for the \n     Legislative Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30th, \n     2003, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the text of S. 2720, \nthe Senate committee-reported bill, is inserted in the appropriate \nplace in the measure.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4319\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to make a \ntechnical correction to the bill relating to a House matter. This \namendment simply strikes a requirement that the GAO report to the House \nAdministration Committee regarding its work on the Architect of the \nCapitol. We have been informed the committee does not have oversight \nfor the Architect and therefore have been requested to delete this \nreference. I have consulted with my colleague and the ranking member, \nSenator Bennett, and I ask unanimous consent this technical correction \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself and Mr. \n     Bennett, proposes an amendment numbered 4319.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment was (No. 4319) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 33, lines 19 and 20, strike ``, the Committee on \n     House Administration of the House of Representatives,''.\n       On page 34, line 24, through page 35, line 1, strike ``, \n     the Committee on House Administration of the House of \n     Representatives,''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague and chairman of the \ncommittee, the Senator from West Virginia, for his help in bringing \nthis matter to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to present to the Senate the fiscal year \n2003 legislative branch appropriations bill as reported by the \nAppropriations Committee. I thank the chairman and ranking member of \nthe full committee, Senate Byrd and Senator Stevens, and of course my \nranking member Senator Bennett who has been a real partner in crafting \nthis legislation.\n  The bill is within its budget authority and outlay allocation, with \ntotal funding of $2.417 billion. This excludes House amounts which is \nthe normal protocol.\n  This is only $8 million--0.35 percent--over the request level and \n$164 million or 7 percent over the fiscal year 2002 enacted level. \nVirtually all significant increases are focused on enhancing security \nfor the Capitol complex.\n  Highlights of the bill include--$675 million for the Senate, $31 \nmillion over the enacted level and $11 million below the request. \nSignificant increases are provided for the Sergeant-at-Arms, directed \nat increasing the security of the Capitol complex, including new mail \nhandling protocols and a new Office of Emergency Preparedness.\n  For the Architect of the Capitol, funding would total approximately \n$396 million compared to the request level of $363 million. The largest \nproject in the Architect's budget that we are recommending is the \nexpansion of the Capitol power plant's west refrigeration plant, which \nis critically needed due to aging equipment and increased capacity \nrequirements, at a cost of $82 million. In addition, a number of \ncritical security-related projects have been included such as an \nalternate computing facility for the legislative branch.\n  The bill includes language aimed at helping the Architect of the \nCapitol improve his operations by creating a new deputy Architect of \nthe Capitol who will also serve as the chief operating officer.\n  We have worked closely with the General Accounting Office in these \nefforts to upgrade AOC operations, including a greater focus on worker \nsafety, and I might add significant progress has been made in the last \nyear due to the efforts of this committee and the cooperation of the \nArchitect's office, project management, accountability for performance, \nand coordination of roles and responsibilities.\n  The Architect of the Capitol operation has been making some \nimprovements over the past year and the employees worked very hard to \ndo their part in addressing the anthrax cleanup, an historic challenge \nto all who worked on Capitol Hill. But there is much more to be done in \nmaking AOC a best-practices organization.\n  They have been given tremendous additional responsibilities for \nexecuting a myriad of security projects, particularly the Capitol \nVisitor Center--which we want to ensure remains on schedule and on \nbudget as it is today. Any visitor to Capitol Hill in the last 6 months \nor a year has noted the extensive construction underway. The \nauthorities included in this bill should provide new tools with the \ngoal of making the AOC a model for facilities management and \nconstruction management.\n  Funding for the Capitol Police totals roughly $210 million which \nreflects their latest payroll and expense estimates. Funding has been \nprovided to accommodate at 9.1 percent pay raise--which includes \ncomparability pay--to help the Capitol Police recruit and retain new \nofficers as they attempt to increase significantly the force size over \nthe next few years to about 2,000 officers. Also included is authority \nfor increasing pay for specialty assignments and providing authority \nand funding for full premium pay earned during the September 11th and \nOctober 15th incidents.\n  I can say that the hundreds of thousands of visitors to Capitol Hill \nunderstand the important responsibility of the Capitol Police which was \nenhanced and challenged by September 11. We want to make certain that \nwe have the very best men and women to protect this great national \nasset, all the people who work here, and our visitors whom we treasure \nvery much.\n  This bill will require that within 3 years the Library of Congress, \njust across the street, and Capitol Police officers be merged in order \nto improve security. This has been an initiative urged and encouraged \nby my colleague, Senator Bennett. The 3-year implementation period will \nallow time to work out the details, differences in retirement, training \nand equipment.\n  The Government Printing Office, $122 million is included with the \ndirective to the administration not to implement the recently announced \npolicy directing agencies to violate our law and bypass the Government \nPrinting Office for their printing needs. If such a directive were \nimplemented, not only would the law be broken, but the process by which \n1,300 Federal depository libraries receive Government publications \nwould be decimated.\n  For the Library of Congress, including the Congressional Research \nService, funding would total $497 million, an increase of $15 million \nover the enacted level, but $15 million below the request, reflecting a \nmore realistic projection of the cost of new positions. New positions \nare provided for preserving the access of the Library's collections, \nincluding digital initiatives.\n  The General Accounting Office will receive $455 million. This covers \nall mandatory and price level increases, and includes $1 million to \ncontinue their important technology assessment work which was initiated \nby Congress last year.\n  The recommendation includes $13 million for the Center for Foreign \nLeadership Development. We have expanded what was originally the center \nfor Russian Leadership Development to include newly independent states \nof the former Soviet Union including the Baltics. This program has \nproven successful in bringing emerging political leaders in Russia to \nthe United States to learn democracy firsthand and to make certain they \ntake those lessons home. Expanding this program to include these \nadditional countries will continue to promote that critical goal.\n  Before I turn it over to my colleague and friend Senator Bennett, I \nwant to particularly thank all the staff on the Appropriations \nCommittee for their work, and especially Carrie Apostolou, who has done \na tremendous amount of work to make this bill ready for floor \nconsideration, and Pat Souders of my own staff, who has worked closely \nwith her.\n  I thank Senator Bennett for his cooperation, and I yield the floor to \nmy colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I am grateful for the generous remarks\n\n[[Page S7338]]\n\nof my friend and chairman, the Senator from Illinois. I am grateful for \nthe cooperative way in which we have been able to work through this \nbill.\n  The Senator from Illinois had the challenge of taking over this \nsubcommittee in the middle of the session, and he had just come to the \nsubcommittee by virtue of his assignment to the Appropriations \nCommittee. He has demonstrated that he is a very quick study. He has \nmoved quickly to get on top of these issues.\n  I do not want to repeat the various elements of the bill he has \ndescribed, but it is a good bill and it is one that I am happy to join \nin recommending to the Senate.\n  As the Senator from Illinois has indicated, I have been advocating \nfor some time a merger of the Capitol Police, at least with the Library \nof Congress Police, and looking at the other police agencies that are \nunder our jurisdiction. We are now moving ahead with this. I think it \nonly makes sense, in the new security environment in which we find \nourselves. To have an area as small as the Capitol campus be divided up \ninto jurisdictions under, not necessarily competing but certainly \ndifferent police departments, does not make a whole lot of sense.\n  I have made reference to this before, but I think it is appropriate \nhere. One of the things that was particularly significant for the \nsuccess of the Olympics in Utah was the coordination that occurred \nbetween competing law enforcement agencies. Of course, we were involved \nin a much bigger venue there, a much larger geographic area, but it was \nimportant that everybody got together and was able to communicate.\n  Given the small nature but highly visible nature of the Capitol \ncampus, it makes sense to have the police come together. I am grateful \nto my friend from Illinois for his support and leadership on this \nparticular issue.\n\n  We all know about the Visitor Center. We can't come into the Capitol \nwithout having it in our face every day. But the demands of the \nArchitect of the Capitol to bring that project through are significant. \nSo I think the decision of the committee to fund a Deputy Architect of \nthe Capitol, creating a full-time manager for the day-to-day activities \nof the Architect of the Capitol, is the right decision.\n  Senator Durbin has been particularly aggressive in trying to solve \nsome of the management challenges the Architect of the Capitol has had \nover the past years. The decision to move toward a Deputy Architect, \ntoward an operating officer to run the office of the Architect of the \nCapitol, is a good decision, and I think we need to highlight that in \nthis bill.\n  Finally, I want to make a personal comment about a very small but \nmaybe high-profile aspect of this bill, which is the Russian Leadership \nConference that now has been expanded, as Chairman Durbin has \nindicated, to include other countries.\n  During the Fourth of July break, I was in Russia. This was the fourth \ntime I had been there. I was very pleasantly surprised at the high \ndegree of pro-American atmosphere we ran into. I was in Russia before \nwhen there was, frankly, an underlying current of suspicion--I wouldn't \ngo so far as to say anti-American attitude in Russia, but suspicion of \nAmerica and America's motives. We got that over the issue of the \nexpansion of NATO, for which I voted and which I supported.\n  The first time I met with members of the Russian Duma, they were \nautomatically anti-expansion of NATO. And no matter what we tried to \ntalk about, they would always bring it back to NATO and, what are you \nAmericans doing?\n  On this occasion, we met with officers of the National Council. They \ntold us they were going to rename it the Senate because they indicated \nthey did not get appropriate respect in their own country, when \neverybody thought of the parliament being the Duma and they thought of \nthemselves as the upper house. We are very careful in this Congress \nthat we never use that term. And they thought, if they renamed \nthemselves the Russian Senate, they would get appropriate respect.\n  One of the members of that council told me this story. He said: My \ngrandmother told me that all her life she has been taught to mistrust, \nindeed fear, NATO. However, she said, in the present atmosphere, if \nPresident Putin tells me that NATO is no longer a threat, I guess I am \ngoing to have to change my point of view.\n  He told me that story to illustrate President Putin's popularity in \nRussia, but I took that story to indicate a significant change in \nRussian attitudes toward Americans, and it has been the Russian \nleadership group that has been participating in this function, that we \nhave been funding out of this subcommittee, that has helped plant the \nseeds of that kind of circumstance.\n  So even though it is a relatively small amount and has been a \ncontroversial program with Members of the House of Representatives, I \ncan give personal testimony, if you will, that it has borne fruit, that \nthe fruit has been significant, and I congratulate Senator Durbin on \nhis continued support of this program and its expansion into other \ncountries as well.\n  So, Madam President, I am happy to join with Senator Durbin in \nrecommending this bill to the other Members of the Senate and urging \nits passage.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for S. 2720, the Legislative Branch \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003.\n  The Senate bill provides $2.417 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority. Per tradition, that amount does not include funding for \nexclusive House items, which will be added in conference. The \ndiscretionary budget authority will result in new outlays in 2003 of \n$1.935 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken \ninto account, discretionary outlays for the Senate bill total l$2.547 \nbillion in 2002.\n  The Appropriations Committee voted 29-0 on June 27 to adopt a set of \nnon-binding sub-allocations for its 13 subcommittees totaling $768.1 \nbillion in budget authority and $793.1 billion in outlays. While the \ncommittee's subcommittee allocations are consistent with both the \namendment supported by 59 Senators last month and with the President's \nrequest for total discretionary budget authority for fiscal year 2003, \nthey are not enforceable under either Senate budget rules or the \nBalanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. While I applaud the \ncommittee for adopting its own set of sub-allocations, I urge the \nSenate to take up and pass the bipartisan resolution, which would make \nthe committee's sub-allocations enforceable under Senate rules and \nprovide for other important budgetary disciplines.\n  For the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, the full committee allocated \n$3.413 billion in budget authority and $3.467 billion in total outlays \nfor 2003. The bill reported by the full committee on July 11 is fully \nconsistent with that allocation. In addition, S. 2720 does not include \nany emergency designations or advance appropriations.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget \ncommittee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    S. 2720, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH, 2003\n  [Spending comparisions--Senate-Reported Bill (in million of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          General\n                                          purpose   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\\1\\\n    Budget Authority...................      2,417        102      2,519\n    Outlays............................      2,547        101      2,648\nSenate committee allocation:\\2\\\n    Budget Authority...................      3,413        102      3,515\n    Outlays............................      3,467        101      3,568\nHouse-reported bill:\n    Budget Authority...................      2,674        102      2,776\n    Outlays............................      2,856        101      2,957\nPresident's request:\\3\\\n    Budget Authority...................      3,404        102      3,506\n    Outlays............................      3,451        101      3,552\n \n   SENATE--REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate committee allocatin:\n    Budget Authority...................       -996          0       -996\n    Outlays............................       -920          0       -920\nHouse-reported bill:\n    Budget Authority...................       -257          0       -257\n    Outlays............................       -309          0       -309\nPresident's request:\n    Budget Authority...................       -987          0       -987\n    Outlays............................       -904          0       -904\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Per tradition, the Senate bill does not include funding for\n  exclusive House items, which will be added in conference.\n\\2\\ The Senate has not adopted a 302(a) allocation for the\n  Appropriations Committee.

Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for \ntheir hard work in putting forth this legislation\n\n[[Page S7339]]\n\nwhich provides Federal funding for the legislative branch.\n  In reviewing this bill to determine whether it contains items that \nare low-priority, unnecessary, wasteful, or have not been appropriately \nreviewed in the normal, merit-based prioritization process, I applaud \nthe Appropriations Committee for their fiscal restraint in including a \nminimal number of such items.\n  For this legislation, only two locality-specific earmarks appear to \nbe included. The bill itself includes $200,000 for Southern Illinois \nUniversity for the purpose of developing a permanent commemoration of \nthe Lewis and Clark Expedition. And an amendment to this bill that was \nadopted on the Senate floor provides $500,000 for the Alexandria Museum \nof Art and the New Orleans Museum of Art for activities relating to the \nLouisiana Purchase Bicentennial Celebration.\n  How refreshing it would be if the Appropriations Committee would \ndemonstrate the same fiscal responsibility they showed in preparing \nthis legislation in every one of the remaining appropriations bills. \nUnfortunately, this bill is the exception to the rule, because, as \nevidenced by the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, the \nrunaway pork-barrel gravy train shows no signs of slowing down on \nCapitol Hill.\n  We must remember that while the amounts associated with each \nindividual earmark may not seem extravagant, taken together they \nrepresent a serious diversion of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars at the \nexpense of numerous programs that have undergone the appropriate merit-\nbased selection process. During this time of mounting deficits, we must \nbe more prudent about where we devote limited fiscal resources. I urge \nall my colleagues to curb the habit of directing hard-earned taxpayer \ndollars to locality-specific special interests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4320\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I send to the desk an amendment on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Bennett and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), for himself and Mr. \n     Bennett, proposes an amendment numbered 4320.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. This amendment relates to the Capitol Police. It will \nenhance their ability to recruit and retain officers as they struggle \nto increase their strength while losing officers to other law \nenforcement agencies. All these changes in the amendment have been \nrequested by the new Chief of Capitol Police, Terry Gainer, and the \nCapitol Police Board.\n  Let me say briefly how proud we are that Terry Gainer is the new \nChief of Police. Those of us from Illinois and Chicago know Terry \nGainer well. He is a former member of the Chicago Police, legal counsel \nfor the Chicago Police Department, and superintendent of the Illinois \nState Police. He came to Washington, DC, was second in command in this \nthe Capital City, and was then recruited to undertake this important \nresponsibility. I am certain he is going to do an excellent, \nprofessional job considering the new challenges facing this department.\n  The new authorities in the amendment authorize them to hire new \nofficers without regard to age. There are technical corrections to \nexisting authorities regarding recruitment and relocation bonuses and \npremium pay for unscheduled overtime. It also includes technical \ncorrections to the committee bill regarding the consolidated disbursing \nfunction for the Capitol Police, salaries, appropriations. All of those \nare technical in nature, and I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, as indicated by my cosponsorship of the \namendment, I endorse what Chairman Durbin has said and urge the Senate \nto adopt the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4320) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4321\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for Ms. Landrieu, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4321.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To set aside funds for activities relating to the Louisiana \n                   Purchase Bicentennial Celebration)\n\n       On page 44, line 24, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That, of the total amount \n     appropriated, $500,000 shall remain available until expended \n     and shall be equally divided and transferred to the \n     Alexandria Museum of Arts and the New Orleans Museum of Art \n     for activities relating to the Louisiana Purchase \n     Bicentennial Celebration''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the amendment would provide $500,000 \nwithin the Library of Congress appropriations for activities related to \nthe Louisiana Purchase Bicentennial Celebration. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I have no objection to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4321) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4322\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Cochran, and Mr. Bennett, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4322.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: Provide funding for the Congressional Award Act)\n\n       On page 28, line 11, strike ``$108,743,000'' and insert \n     ``$108,243,000''.\n       On page 63, insert between lines 10 and 11 the following:\n\n     SEC. 312. TITLE II OF THE CONGRESSIONAL AWARD ACT.\n\n       There are appropriated, out of any funds in the Treasury \n     not otherwise appropriated, $500,000, to remain available \n     until expended, to carry out title II of the Congressional \n     Award Act 92 U.S.C. 811 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this amendment which we are currently \nconsidering provides $500,000 for the recently reauthorized \nCongressional Award Act offset by the reduction in the budget of the \nArchitect of the Capitol. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I have no objection to this amendment \nas illustrated by my cosponsorship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4322) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4323\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself and Mr. \n     Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 4323.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7340]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a pilot program for mailings to town meetings)\n\n       On page 5, line 26, insert before the period ``, of which \n     up to $500,000 shall be made available for a pilot program \n     for mailings of postal patron postcards by Senators for the \n     purpose of providing notice of a town meeting by a Senator in \n     a county (or equivalent unit of local government) with a \n     population of less than 250,000 and at which the Senator will \n     personally attend: Provided, That any amount allocated to a \n     Senator for such mailing shall not exceed 50 percent of the \n     cost of the mailing and the remaining cost shall be paid by \n     the Senator from other funds available to the Senator: \n     Provided further, That not later than October 31, 2003, the \n     Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate shall submit a \n     report to the Committee on Rules and Administration and \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate on the results of \n     the program''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this amendment, on behalf of Senator \nSpecter, provides up to $500,000 in the miscellaneous items account of \nthe Senate for a pilot program and additional funds for town meeting \nnotices, an issue which Senator Specter has pursued for quite some \ntime.\n  In the fiscal year 2002 appropriations, we provided separate funds \nfor town meeting notices subject to a Rules Committee authorization, \nwhich has not yet occurred.\n  I would like to point out that Senators, on average, spend less than \nhalf the amount budgeted for franked mail--less than $3 million out of \nthe $7.6 million budget. In addition, last year only a small number of \nSenators used town meeting notices. No Member, other than the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, has indicated the budget is inadequate. It doesn't \nappear that we have a significant problem, but in order to determine \nwhether or not there is an interest in promoting town meetings with \nnotices attendant thereto, and how widespread that problem might be, we \nhave agreed to this pilot program for 1 year.\n  We have requested that by the end of the next fiscal year the \nSergeant at Arms and the Doorkeeper of the Senate shall submit a report \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration and the Committee on \nAppropriations.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I may take a few minutes, I will be \nvery brief.\n  I wish to say a few things while the two managers of this bill are \nhere. I had the opportunity in several Congresses to chair the \nAppropriations Legislative Branch Subcommittee. I can truly say that it \nwas one of the most rewarding experiences I have had as a Member of \nCongress.\n  I understand how important the Library of Congress is to our country. \nWe have certainly learned that with this bill. We were going through \nthe years and there were cuts. No one wants to cut the Library of \nCongress. It is so important to the people of our States and of our \nNation. Of the 13 appropriations bills, this one gets a lot of \nattention. It is as important as any of the appropriations bills.\n  I want to take a brief period of time to tell the two managers of \nthis bill how impressed I am and how grateful I am for their \nrecognition of the Capitol Police. There has never been a time, in my \nopinion, where we have recognized the dedication of the Capitol Police \nas it is recognized in this bill.\n  We went through a ceremony yesterday where we placed roses on the \ntable in front of the pictures of the two fallen police officers--\nGibson and Chestnut. When we walk in this building every day, these \ndedicated men and women are standing there, a lot of times not doing a \nlot, but every day they are there waiting to take bullets for us or for \nanyone who comes into this building which they are protecting. They do \nsuch good work.\n  The Capitol Police Force is well trained. They are as well trained as \nany police force in the country. As a result of this legislation, they \nwill be better trained, better paid, and better recognized for the work \nthey do.\n\n  I want this Record spread with the appreciation of the Senate and the \npeople of Nevada and every other State where people come here and feel \nso safe as a result of the Capitol Police. As I said, I want the Record \nspread with the appreciation of the American people for the work the \nSenator from Illinois and the Senator from Utah have done on this \nlegislation. It is landmark. It is so appreciated by me and every \nCapitol policeman. And anyone who knows anything about this \nlegislation--or could learn--would also feel the same as I do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from the State of \nNevada for those kind words on behalf of myself and Senator Bennett. I \nam glad he made reference to the memorial service yesterday for \nOfficers Gibson and Chestnut, because it is a sad reminder of the \nimportant responsibility that the Capitol Police have undertaken on \nbehalf not only those of us who are privileged to work in this building \nbut the thousands and thousands of visitors who come here for the \nthrill of a lifetime to see this seat of democracy. Those two men gave \ntheir lives in service to our country. We should be reminded at all \ntimes that all the members of the Capitol Police Force are prepared to \ndo the same.\n  There is no stronger advocate for the Capitol Police than Senator \nHarry Reid of Nevada. He speaks to me annually when this issue comes up \nto make certain we have not overlooked any element in terms of \nmodernizing and professionalizing the Capitol Police. He is simply \ntheir strongest voice on the Senate floor.\n  I might also add that a close second is Senator Wellstone of \nMinnesota, who has a close, personal friendship with so many of the \nmembers of the Capitol Police. He comes to me regularly with \nobservations that really come from the heart. I thank him for his \ninspiration as well.\n  I think this bill meets the needs of the Capitol Police. And as long \nas I am in this position or in any capacity, I will continue to strive \nfor that goal.\n  I believe pending before us now is the amendment relative to the \naccount for mailing of town meeting notices, which Senator Specter of \nPennsylvania has asked us to include.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, at the outset, I thank my distinguished \ncolleagues, the Senators from Illinois and Utah, for holding this \nmatter until my arrival. I came as soon as I finished my round of \nquestioning of the Attorney General, who is currently before the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  This amendment provides for $500,000 to be made available for a pilot \nproject for mailings of postal patron postcards by Senators for the \npurpose of providing notice of town meetings in counties with \npopulations of less than 250,000.\n  The reason for this amendment is to stimulate town meetings by \nSenators and to make us more aware as a body, individually and \ncollectively, of what our constituents are thinking.\n  Until fairly recently, there was no limitation on mail and notices \ncould be sent out to the largest of counties at a very considerable \nexpense as a matter of record, so that the public knew how much a \nSenator was spending. Those figures were published with some frequency \nas to the mail expense accounts.\n  My own thinking is that there is no better use of our expense \naccounts than to communicate with our citizens about where we go \npersonally to hear what is on their minds. Within the beltway, we are \nvery insulated. In fact, people beyond the beltway do not even know \nwhat the ``beltway'' expression means. However, when we talk to each \nother, and do not communicate with our constituents, we do not have a \nfeel for what is going on. The basis of representative democracy is \nthat we are reflecting the will of our constituents. In order to do \nthat, we have to know what it is.\n\n  When I say reflecting the will of the constituents, I do not mean \ntaking a public opinion poll, or even if there is an enormous \npreponderance of the constituents, to follow that without question. I \nthink Edmond Burke, centuries ago, laid down the proper standard, that \nan elected official in a representative democracy owes to his \nconstituents his independent judgment. One of the factors Edmond Burke \nenumerated was the concerns, sensibilities, and views of the \nconstituent.\n  These town meetings are very difficult affairs, perhaps even \ncategorized as rough affairs. I have done 19 of them during the month \nof July, mostly during the Fourth of July recess.\n  My practice, which I know is standard for many of my colleagues who \nundertake these meetings, is to make a very short introductory \nstatement, limiting it to five, six, or seven minutes, and then to \nrespond to questions.\n\n[[Page S7341]]\n\nThe questioning segment is the hot spot. I know the Presiding Officer \nand the other Senators in the Chamber, and any who may be watching on \nC-SPAN, know that because we have all had the experience.\n  This is not puff mail which you send out, where the effort has been \nmade to limit what a Senator can do, sending pieces extolling the \nvirtues of the individual Senator. This is an occasion where you are \nreally on the line and have to identify and justify your votes and your \npositions.\n  Beyond the votes and existing positions, the town meetings acquaint a \nSenator with many issues the Senator does not know about, and that is \nthe educational process. So it is not only a matter of responding to \nconstituents, rather it is learning from constituents what the new \nissues are.\n  Since I completed the town meetings in July, I can say to my \ncolleagues that there is great interest out there in Pennsylvania--and \nI believe Pennsylvania is a very representative State with more than 12 \nmillion people--about the need for a prescription drug program. The \nseniors are really hurting. Many instances were called to my attention \nby individuals who have low income with very high pharmaceutical bills. \nThis is something that is really at the very top of the agenda. Enron \nand corporate scandals, prescription drugs, and terrorism were the \nthree major subjects I heard about in the town meetings.\n  I am hopeful--and I have talked to authors of the bills on both \nsides--we will come to an agreement here and we will legislate on this \nsubject and let it go to conference with the House of Representatives. \nI believe our job is to reconcile the differences. While we are talking \nabout substantial sums of money, in the overall picture, an \naccommodation is better than having Senators adhere strictly to some \ntop-dollar figure and not go beyond that. I believe there is a majority \nin the Senate to reach an accommodation somewhere between what the \nproposed bills have specified. My soundings are that a prescription \ndrug program is something the American people not only want, but really \nneed.\n  Along the same line, I sense overwhelming anger about what is \nhappening in corporate America and what is happening with Enron and \nWorldCom, which were the subjects during the Fourth of July recess. \nThis is not some theoretical matter about fraud and criminal conduct \nthat ought to be prosecuted, this is a matter which is reaching Mr. \nAverage American, Mr. Lower Income American, regarding retirement \nfunds, which have been fractionalized. I am glad to see the conferees \nagreed on a program yesterday, with the Senate bill taking dominance.\n\n  Even with the work I have had as a prosecutor on fraud cases and \nbusiness fraud, I am surprised at what has happened here. Every day \nthere is a new revelation. For the major banks to be complicit, at \nleast according to public reports on Enron, is beyond shocking.\n  We really rely, in our society, on the accountants, the attorneys, \nand the bankers, who are really in a quasi-fiduciary, if not strictly \nfiduciary capacity, to catch these matters, and especially where it is \nso lucrative. For them to yield to the pressure to cut corners and to \nsanction fraud in order to keep a customer or to please a customer is \njust really beyond the pale.\n  We have had a lot of problems in the long history of this country, \nhowever, I think this is one of the most extraordinary. The day before \nyesterday, we found out about the bankers being complicit, or allegedly \ncomplicit, with Enron. We see the SEC investigation disclosed \nyesterday, as stated in this morning's press, about AOL having \nfraudulent transactions and boosting their profits fraudulently. It is \na surprise to me that an entity as sophisticated as Time Warner would \nbe taken in by corporate chicanery.\n  So these are matters which are very much on the minds of the American \npeople. You have to go to a town meeting and take the temperature of \nthe people to really see how very serious it is.\n  This amendment provides that $500,000 will be used to send out postal \npatron notices, providing that the Senator pays 50 percent. So we have \na good co-pay provision here. Senators are not going to be inclined to \nsend these postal patron notices out without having to pay for one-half \nof the cost themselves, with the critical requirement that the Senator \nhas to appear. The limitation is put on counties with fewer than \n250,000 people because if you send it to a county such as Allegheny \nCounty, which has Pittsburgh, or Philadelphia County, it is an enormous \nexpense. We can communicate with our constituents in those major \nmetropolitan areas in ways other than by coming to the county.\n  However, if you talk about Potter County, in north central \nPennsylvania, on the northern tier abutting New York State, or you talk \nabout Fulton County, on the Maryland border, those folks really like to \nsee you. You send out a notice, and you get 35 people, and you sit and \ntalk to them. I was in Forest County, and we did not get 35 people, \nhowever, I learned a lot from being in Forest County. I think the \npeople in Forest County learned something, too.\n  So I thank my colleagues for accepting this amendment. We had it in \nlast year at a higher figure, subject to authorization. We could not \nget the hearing worked out. However, I know that this is a test case. I \nam going to be encouraging my colleagues to do these town meetings, so \nwhen the audit comes up, my name is not the only name listed as a \nrecipient. We will await the results of the audit on the pilot program \nto see just how effective and important this program is.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues and thank the Chair, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  If there is no further debate on this amendment, I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4323) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the pending legislation, \nS. 812, the Greater Access to Pharmaceuticals Act. Even if I had major \ndifferences of opinion on the substance of this legislation, I commend \nSenators McCain and Schumer, Kennedy and Edwards for their efforts in \nthis area.\n  I especially wish to recognize the efforts of Senators Kennedy, \nEdwards, and Collins for their work, which was almost a complete \nrewriting of the McCain-Schumer bill. Let me also hasten to commend \nSenators Gregg and Frist for working to improve the bill that emerged \nfrom the HELP Committee and for their leadership during the debate.\n  Mr. President, last week, I provided a brief summary of the existing \nstatute that S. 812 seeks to amend, the Drug Competition and Patent \nTerm Restoration Act of 1984. I happen to know something about this \nlaw, which is commonly referred to as the Waxman-Hatch Act, or \nalternatively, the Hatch-Waxman Act.\n  Last week, I gave an overview of my concerns with the HELP Committee \nlegislation. With those comments in mind, today, I want to delve \nfurther into the details of the HELP Committee re-write of S. 812 the \nbill originally introduced by Senators McCain and Schumer.\n  The central components of S.812 are aimed at rectifying concerns \nraised in recent years over two features of the 1984 law: first, the \nstatutory 30-month stay granted to a pioneer firm's facing legal \nchallenges to its patents by generic competitors; and, second the 180-\nday period of marketing exclusivity awarded to generic drug firms that \nsuccessfully challenge a pioneer firm's patents.\n  During debate on S. 812, there have been a number of comments \nindicating that there is a substantial problem with these two \nprovisions. That may or may not be the case. One great disadvantage of \nholding the floor debate at this time is that we do not have the \nbenefit of an extensive Federal Trade Commission survey of the \npharmaceutical industry that focuses on precisely these two issues that \ngo to the heart of S. 812 and the substitute adopted by the HELP \nCommittee. The results of this long-awaited, extensive, industry-wide \nFTC survey are expected in a few weeks.\n  I have stated on numerous occasions that before this body undertakes \na substantial rewrite of provisions central to the Hatch-Waxman Act, we \nshould have the benefit of the FTC study and its implications.\n  The Senate could have taken a more prudent course. The Senate could \nhave waited for the FTC report. We--and by we I specifically include \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee--could have held hearings on the FTC \nstudy, evaluated the data, and then discussed, debated, and refined the \nactual, now barely two-week old, legislative language that is pending \non the floor today.\n  But this was not possible due to the tactical decision of the \nMajority to dispense with the regular order so as to minimize the \npolitically-inconvenient fact that the Senate Finance Committee would \nhave most likely have rejected any Democratic Medicare drug proposal in \nfavor of the Tripartisan approach.\n  To my great disappointment, although not anyone's great surprise, we \nfailed to arrive at the 60-vote consensus required to enact a Medicare \ndrug bill in the Senate. Make no mistake about it. This is a great \nfailure for the American people because for two years now we have set \naside $300 billion in the federal budget to be spent over 10 years to \nprovide prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  We have all heard from elderly constituents many of whom live on \nlimited, fixed-incomes--who have had substantial difficulties in paying \nfor prescription drugs. Rather than rise to the occasion and make good \non our promise to rectify that situation, and we are letting this \nabundant opportunity slip between our fingers.\n  I am very disappointed with the outcome of the votes Tuesday. It is \nmy hope that we can find a way to come together on the important issue \nof a Medicare drug benefit for our seniors.\n  At a minimum, we should use the $300 billion already in the budget to \nexpand drug coverage for those seniors who need the most help. What \nwe should not do is enact an expensive, government-run scheme that \ncould bankrupt our country and plunge our economy further into the \nabyss when the government usurps what should legitimately be a private-\nsector-run benefit.\n\n  The collapse of any 60-vote consensus on the Medicare drug benefit \ndoes not show the public the type of bipartisan spirit that voters \nacross the country say they prefer, in poll after poll after poll.\n  And so, we move back to the important, if more mundane, matters in S. \n812.\n  One of the real marvels of this debate is that we have finally found \nout who the bad guys are in this debate.\n  It is not the government that has failed to make good on the promise \nto provide needy seniors with pharmaceutical coverage.\n  No, it's the pharmaceutical industry, an industry that is working day \nand night to bring us the medicines, the miracle cures that seniors \nseek.\n  I just had no idea that is who was going to be blamed.\n  This game plan comes right out of the Clintoncare play-book. As you \nhear attack after attack on the drug companies, I just want all of you \nlistening to this debate to know that a similar tactic was employed by \nthe Democrats when they tried to foist Clintoncare on a very \nunreceptive public back in 1993 and 1994.\n  Here is how David Broder and Haynes Johnson, two highly respected \njournalists, described the tactics of the Clinton White House in trying \nto pass its too grand health care reform plan:\n  This quote is from ``The System,'' a book by Haynes Johnson and David\n\n[[Page S7343]]\n\nBroder, two leading political writers in this town, both of whom write \nfor the Washington Post. Neither of them would be considered, by any \nstretch of the imagination, conservative. This is what they had to say \nin this book called ``The System,'' talking about the American way of \npolitics and how health care policy is formed:\n\n       In the campaign period, Clinton's political advisors \n     focused mainly on the message that, for ``the plain folks, \n     it's greed--greedy hospitals, greedy doctors, greedy \n     insurance companies. It was an us versus them issue, which \n     Clinton was extremely good at exploiting.\n\n  This is the second quote:\n\n       Clinton's political consultants--Carville, Begala, \n     Grunwald, Greenberg--all thought ``there had to be \n     villains.'' At that point, the insurance companies and the \n     pharmaceutical companies became the enemy.\n\n  As you can see, here are two liberal political writers who summarized \nthe Clinton health plan.\n  Villains . . . enemies all this sounds familiar in this debate. So, I \nwill stipulate for the purpose of this debate that the pharmaceutical \nindustry is the designated villain.\n  It strikes me as curious at least that the sector of the economy that \nplows back the highest portion of its revenues back into research--and \nresearch on life-threatening diseases no less--is treated with such \ndisdain, at times even contempt, on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, from what has been said on the floor of the Senate you \nwould think that this industry is trying to cause cancer, not trying to \nfind cures.\n  I note that Senator Kennedy has suggested our nation's biomedical \nresearch establishment has not really made much progress over the past \nfew decades in terms of developing new drugs. I think the facts speak \notherwise.\n  For example, consider the array of medicines that have been developed \nto treat HIV infection and the complications of AIDS. Through the \nunique public/private sector partnership that comprises the U.S. \nbiomedical research enterprise, AIDS is being transformed from an \ninvariably fatal disease into a chronic condition that we are so \nhopeful one day will have a cure.\n  These advances do not come easily or on the cheap. I would note the \nexciting reports from the recent International AIDS meeting in \nBarcelona concerning the new class of AIDS medications represented by \nthe new drug, T-20. Unlike many of the current anti-retroviral \nmedications like AZT that seek to inhibit the replication of the HIV \nvirus, T-20 attempts to block entry of the virus into healthy cells.\n  Here is what one press account has said about this still unapproved, \nbut highly promising drug:\n\n       But it takes 106 steps more than 10 times the usual number \n     of chemical reactions to make the lengthy peptide, making \n     production a serious factor in its price. Roche refurbished a \n     plant in Boulder, Colorado, just to make T-20. Almost 100,000 \n     pounds of specialized raw materials are needed to make a \n     little more than 2,200 pounds of the drug. In all, Roche has \n     invested $490 million in T-20's development and \n     manufacturing.\n\n  Let us not be too quick to characterize as villains and enemies those \nscientists and companies who are working every day to overcome dread \ndiseases like AIDS. Think of the imagination and expertise required to \ndesign all 106 chemical reaction required to make T-20. How many times \nmust they have failed to come up with the correct chemical pathway?\n  I might add, as Senator Frist pointed out on the floor last week, \nthat infectious disease experts like Dr. Tony Fauci at NIH have said \nthat despite the substantial promise of T-20, there is still more work \nto be done on this drug. Specifically, it is imperative to develop a \ntablet form of this currently intravenous preparation if we will be \nable to effectively use the product in the Third World.\n  Some in this debate have minimized the importance of product \nformulation patents and have suggested that such patents should not be \neligible for the 30-month stay. But public health experts such as Dr. \nAnthony Fauci one of the leading experts in the world, are telling us \nthat the formulation of drugs like T-20 is critical. Who is to say that \nthe steps in addition to the 106 steps already painstakingly identified \nto make the IV preparation necessary to make a tablet form of the drug \nare not worthy of the same protection afforded other pharmaceutical \npatents since 1984?\n  And if it turns out that such a formulation patent issues more than \n30-days after FDA can one-day approve a new drug application for a \ntablet form of T-20, why should this patent be given less procedural \nprotection than other related patents? But this differential treatment \nof patents is exactly what could occur if we adopt the pending \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, the Hatch-Waxman Act has been called one of the most \nimportant consumer bills in history. It has helped save consumers, by \nthe Congressional Budget Office reckoning, $8 billion to $10 billion \nevery year since 1984. It created the modern generic drug industry by \ncreating this delicate balance between the pioneer research companies, \nand the generic companies that could readily copy drugs under Hatch-\nWaxman. The scientific work that had taken R & D firms up to 15 years, \n$800 million and at least 5,000 to 6,000 failed drug companies for each \nsuccessful new drug could be used by general firms under the 1984 law.\n  I might add, the Hatch-Waxman Act has brought the generic industry \nfrom little over 15 percent of the marketplace to 47 percent as we \nspeak, and it is going up all the time. That is what we thought should \nhappen.\n  We are at $490 million and still counting for this still unapproved \npromising new AIDS drug, T-20.\n  Remarkable progress in the field of drug development has been made \nover the past 18 years since Waxman-Hatch was adopted. We have seen \nenormous strides in the treatment of heart disease, diabetes, \narthritis, Alzheimer's and many others, including the 200 new drugs \nthat have been approved to treat lower prevalence, so-called orphan \ndiseases another bill that I helped author. I am proud to have been an \nauthor of the Orphan Drug Act that has given hope to so many American \nfamilies.\n  If our Nation is going to develop diagnostic tests, treatments, and \nvaccines to prevent and counter attacks of bioterrorism and potential \nchemical or even nuclear terrorism, just whom do you think is going to \ndevelop these products? I will tell you who. It will be those \n``villains'' in the pharmaceutical industry, in partnership with \ngovernment and academic researchers, unless we hamper their ability to \ndo so, if we do not watch ourselves carefully on this Legislation.\n  At some point we must put aside this one-dimensional, simplistic \nvilification of the pharmaceutical industry and examine more closely \nthe actual substance of the pending legislation.\n  Are the PhRMA companies always right? No, they are not, and neither \nare the generic companies always right. Hatch-Waxman created a delicate \nbalance so they were competitive against each other, and it has worked \nvery well.\n  It is my strong preference to conduct the debate over amending the \nHatch-Waxman Act with our eyes focused on the policies, not the \npolitics.\n  As I said last week, the pending legislation, S. 812, addresses \nimportant and complex issues of patent law, civil justice reform and \nantitrust policy. A strong case could be made that Senate consideration \nof this bill would be improved if the Judiciary Committee were given \nthe opportunity to study the legislation, review the Federal Trade \nCommission report, and make its voice heard in this debate. It seems \nunlikely that anything resembling this process will unfold given the \ndecision to rush the HELP Committee patent, antitrust, civil justice \nreform bill to the floor of the Senate.\n  As a threshold matter, it seems to me that before we adopt S. 812, we \nshould be certain that this bill is consistent with the longstanding \ngoals of the statute S. 812 seeks to amend, the Drug Price Competition \nand Patent Term Restoration Act.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, the goals of this law, passed in 1984, \nare twofold:\n  First, to create a regulatory pathway that allows the American public \nto gain access to more affordable generic drugs; and,\n  Second, to create incentives for manufacturers of pioneer drug \nproducts to see that the American public has access to the latest, \ncutting-edge medicines.\n  As I described last week, the 1984 law is a carefully balanced \nstatute and contains features designed to accomplish\n\n[[Page S7344]]\n\nthese two somewhat conflicting goals. This tension is inherent because \nof the competing nature of the desire, on one hand, to develop \nbreakthrough drugs and, on the other hand, to make available generic \ncopies of these pioneer products.\n  As legislation is crafted to address the problems that have arisen up \nin recent years with respect to the Waxman-Hatch law, we must be \ncareful not to devise a remedy that upsets the delicate balance of the \nlaw.\n  I am concerned that the manner in which the HELP Committee substitute \ntries to fix the two most widely cited shortcomings of the 1984 law \nmay, in fact, disturb the balance of the statute by, in some areas, \novercorrecting and, in other areas, undercorrecting for the observed \nproblems.\n  Specifically, while the manner in which the Edwards-Collins HELP \nCommittee substitute addresses the 30-month stay issue represents a \nmajor improvement over McCain-Schumer bill, I am afraid though, the 30-\nmonth stay language represents a case of overcorrection.\n  Last Thursday, I gave a short summary of the key provisions of the \nHatch-Waxman Act. It only took me 1 hour and 32 minutes. After \nproviding this background and context, I explained why I thought that \nthe provisions of the pending legislation relating to patent rights and \nthe 30-month stay went too far. Let me reiterate my concerns with the \n30-month stay.\n  As has been stated by many during this debate, a pioneer drug patent \nholder, whose patents are under challenge by a generic drug \nmanufacturer, is accorded an automatic 30-month stay. This was not some \ngiveaway to the innovator pharmaceutical industry. We inserted this \nmechanism to protect the intellectual property of companies that \ndevelop patented medications, companies, I might add, that were going \nto be afforded less intellectual property protections than any other \nindustry as part of the 1984 law. We knowingly added this provision \nbecause we wanted to give them a fair opportunity to defend their \npatents. We know that patent litigation is itself a risky endeavor with \nthe federal circuit court overturning about 40 percent of the trial \ncourt decisions in some areas of patent law.\n  The public policy purpose for this stay is to allow time for the \ncourts to determine the status of validity of drug patents and/or to \ndecide whether valid patents are, or are not, infringed by a generic \ndrug challenger.\n  That was the intent of the law. Many believe--and I share that view--\nthat the 30-month stay provision has come to present problems in two \nareas: First, later issued patents that trigger last minute 30-month \nstays; and, second, multiple uses of the 30-month stay provision in a \nconsecutive, over-lapping manner that work to bar generic competition \nfor as long as the litigation can be made to drag on by lawyers who are \npaid by the hour.\n  Some in this debate have characterized that both of these problems \nare at epidemic proportions. While I think there is evidence that \nproblems have occurred and it is important that we work to modify the \nlaw so that the 30-month stay can not be misused in the next few years \nwhen so many blockbuster drugs come off-patent we should all take a \nclose look at the FTC report before we conclude that as a general \nmatter the entire research-based pharmaceutical industry has \nsystematically abused the 30-month stay. That is just a speculation at \nthis point until we see all the data.\n  I will be very interested in what the FTC reports on a number of \nissues--the frequency of use of multiple 30-month stays; stays stemming \nfrom late issued patents; the outcome of litigation on the merits when \nsuch multiple stays have been employed; and 11th-hour stays exercised \ndue to late-issued patents.\n  It seems to me that we should be highly skeptical whenever a patent \nis listed in the official FDA records, called the Orange Book, years \nafter the FDA approved the drug. One would have to think that all key \npatents would have been at least applied for prior to the end of the \nlengthy FDA review.\n  We all know of the now infamous case of the drug, Buspar. An attempt \nwas made to take advantage of the 30-month stay by listing in the \nOrange Book a new patent of the metabolite form of the active \ningredient of the drug literally in the last day before the original \npatents were set to expire. A Federal district court stepped in to \nlimit the stay to four months, not 30-months. The appellate court \nfound, however, that this forced de-listing of the patent was improper.\n  My opinion is that Congress, after getting the better understanding \nof the facts that the FTC report can provide, should address the \nconsecutive stay and last-minute stay problems.\n  From what I know today, I am not prepared to conclude that the \nEdwards-Collins substitute is a measured solution to the cited \nproblems. The bill that passed the HELP Committee and is pending on the \nfloor would limit the 30-month stay to those patents issued within 30-\ndays of FDA approval of the drug. The pending legislation contains \nmajor improvements over substantial elements of the McCain-Schumer \nbill, such as the language that would have completely eliminated the \n30-month stay in favor of a system that required case-by-case \napplication of injunctive relief. It is also better than the language \nthe HELP Committee Chairman Kennedy circulated briefly before the mark-\nup that would have limited to 30-month stay to certain types of \npatents.\n  As I laid out in detail last Thursday, given the facts available at \nthis time, I think a better policy may be to permit one, and only one, \n30-month stay to apply to all patents issued and listed with FDA prior \nto the time a particular generic drug application is filed with the \nagency, which cannot occur under the law until at least four years have \nelapsed in the case of new chemical entities. At a minimum, I do not \nsee what justification exists to differentiate, for the purpose of the \n30-month stay, patents issued prior to four years after the FDA first \napproves a drug.\n  I would also add that in most European nations and in Japan, it is my \nunderstanding that the law provides a 10-year period of data \nexclusivity--independent of patent term before a generic copy may be \napproved for marketing. The public policy behind these periods of data \nexclusivity is to recognize the fact that in approving generic drugs, \nthe government regulatory agency is relying upon the extensive, \nexpensive--and prior to enactment of Hatch-Waxman, generally \nproprietary, trade secret--safety and efficacy data supplied by the \npioneer firm.\n  At any rate, as I explained last week, current U.S. law does not even \nallow a generic drug applicant to challenge a pioneer firm's patents \nuntil four years have elapsed. Why shouldn't, for example, a \nformulation patent issued one year after a drug is approved not be \nprotected by the 30-month stay if the challenge cannot be made for 3 \nmore years?\n  The 30-month stay must be understood in the context of the \ncomplexities of the 1984 Waxman-Hatch law that generally provides 5 \nyears of marketing exclusivity to pioneer drug products as part of the \nrecognition for allowing the generic firms to rely on the pioneer's \nexpensive safety and efficacy data. Moreover, I think that any \ndiscussion of the 30-month stay is incomplete if it does not include \nthe fact that, under Hatch-Waxman, generic drug firms are given a \nunique advantage under the patent code that allows them to get a head \nstart toward the market by allowing them to make and use the patented \ndrug product for the commercial and ordinarily patent infringing \npurpose of securing FDA approval and scaling up production.\n  Let me quickly review the general rule against patent infringement \nthat is set forth in Title 35 of the United States Code, section \n271(a). It says:\n\n     . . . whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, \n     or sells any patented invention . . . during the term of the \n     patent . . . infringes the patent.\n\n  This is a clear, unambiguous protection of property rights, as it \nshould be to protect the creative genius of America's inventors.\n  Section 271(e) of title 35 contains the so-called Bolar amendment \nthat was added to the patent code by the Hatch-Waxman Act to create a \nspecial exception for generic drug manufacturers. Section 271(e)(1) \nstates:\n\n       It shall not be an act of infringement to make [or] use . . \n     . a patented invention . . . solely for uses reasonably \n     related to the development and submission of information \n     under a federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or \n     sale of drugs or veterinary biological products.\n\n\n[[Page S7345]]\n\n\n  Essentially, this particular provision I have just read gives generic \ndrug manufacturers a head start over virtually all other producers of \ngeneric products. In other words, it gives the generic industry a \ntremendous advantage. Normally, making and using a patented product for \nthe purpose of securing regulatory approval would be a clear case of \npatent infringement under section 271(a), but the Bolar Amendment--\nwhich overrode a 1984 Federal Circuit Court of Appeals decision that \nprecluded generic drug firms from using on-patent drugs to secure FDA \napproval or gear up production, in other words, the case overruled that \nright--allows the generic firms to violate customary patent rights \nbecause we put it in Hatch-Waxman. Section 271(e) is the Hatch-Waxman \nlanguage.\n  The public policy purpose of the Bolar Amendment meaning the Bolar \namendment provided by the Hatch-Waxman Act is to allow generic drug \nmakers to secure FDA approval and come onto the market the day after \nthe patent on the pioneer drug expires. As I explained last week, there \nis a balance between the head start that the Bolar Amendment gives to \ngeneric manufacturers and the protection that the 30-month stay gives \npioneer firms to litigate the validity of their patents.\n  Given the unique head start that the Bolar Amendment grants generic \ndrug manufacturers over virtually all other generic product \nmanufacturer and the other factors I have discussed, I question whether \nrestricting the 30-month stay to only those patents issued within 30-\ndays of FDA approval is either necessary, fair, or wise.\n  Moreover, the HELP Committee bill contains file-it-or-lose-it and \nsue-on-it-or-lose-it provisions as well as a new private right of \naction which also act to further diminish the value of pharmaceutical \npatents, or should say pharmaceutical patents, to be more accurate.\n  Let me first address my concerns regarding the creation of a private \nright of action, and then move on to the serious and detrimental \neffects that the file-it-or-lose-it and sue-on-it-or-lose-it provisions \nwould have on pharmaceutical patent holders.\n  I have two fundamental concerns with authorizing a private cause of \naction that would allow applicants to bring declaratory actions to \ncorrect or delete patent information contained in the FDA ``Orange \nBook.''\n  First, over the past 30 years, the courts have explicitly held that \nno private right of action is authorized under the Federal Food, Drug, \nand Cosmetic Act or ``FDCA'' e.g., ``It is well settled . . . that the \nFDCA creates no private right of action.'' In re: Orthopedic Bone Screw \nProducts Liability Litigation, 193 F.3d 781, 788 (3d Cir. 1999).\n  Moreover, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit specifically \naddressed whether the Waxman-Hatch amendments to the FDCA did not \nindicate any congressional intent to create a private right of action, \nstating that the court could ``see nothing in the Hatch-Waxman \nAmendments to alter'' the conclusion that private parties are not \nauthorized to bring suit to enforce the FDCA.\n  By seeking to create a private right of action, this provision \nrepresents a truly unprecedented step that runs contrary to 30 years of \njudicial interpretation. I believe that this would create an unwise, \nand potentially dangerous precedent that could be used to justify \nfuture legislation authorizing private suits to enforce the numerous \nand varied provisions of the FDCA. Although I understand--and am \nsympathetic to--the underlying rationale for this provision, I simply \ndo not think that creating a private right of action is an appropriate \nanswer to the problems cited by the advocates of this provision.\n  Second, as the Administration has succinctly stated: ``this new cause \nof action is not necessary to address patent abuses,'' and may \n``unnecessarily encourage litigation'' surrounding the approval of new \ndrugs. I certainly agree. Authorizing this new cause of action will not \neffectively address the alleged patent abuses.\n  Now, I want to emphasize here that I strongly support efforts to halt \nanti-competitive abuses of the patent laws and the laws and regulations \ninvolving the listing of patent information in the FDA ``Orange Book.'' \nI am willing to work with members from either side of the aisle on this \nissue. However, I am convinced that creating a private right of action \nwill not only fail to stop the patent abuses at issue, but will likely \nhave substantial unintended detrimental effects on the drug approval \nprocess.\n  The file-it-or-lose-it provision that says patent rights are waived \nif each new patent is not promptly filed with FDA and the sue-on-it-or-\nlose-it provision that would result in the forfeiture of patent rights \nif a pioneer drug firm does not sue within 45 days of being notified of \na patent challenge should be contrasted with current law for all other \ntypes of patents. Section 286 of the federal patent code establishes a \nsix-year statute of limitations on seeking damages for patent \ninfringement. Why should this usual six-year period be decreased to 45-\ndays for pharmaceutical patents?\n  I should also note the section 284 of the patent code explicitly \nauthorizes the courts to award treble damages in patent infringement \nactions. This is a strong signal that Congress wants to protect \nintellectual property. We should think twice when we are considering \nadopting measures, such as the Edwards-Collins language, that act to \nundermine longstanding patent rights such as the six-year statute of \nlimitation on patent damage actions.\n  As I said last week, I am mindful that the treble damage provision \nplaces a generic firm patent challenger in a difficult decision if the \nfirm were forced to go to market upon a district court decision in a \npatent challenge situation. That is why I am generally sympathetic to \nthe argument of generic manufacturers that current law should be \noverturned and any marketing exclusivity a generic firm might earn by \nbeating a pioneer firm's patents should toll from an appellate court \ndecision. In the case of multiple patents and multiple challengers, the \npolicy might have to be refined if the result is that no generic \nproduct can reach the market within a reasonable period of time.\n  As I pointed out, HELP Committee Edwards-Collins language is barely \ntwo weeks old, I am not alone in raising concerns about this new \nlanguage. The Administration opposes this language. The Statement of \nAdministration Policy states, in part, that:\n\n       S. 812 would unnecessarily encourage litigation around the \n     initial approval of new drugs and would complicate the \n     process of filing and protecting patents on new drugs. The \n     resulting higher costs and delays in making new drugs \n     available will reduce access to new breakthrough drugs.\n\n  That is important.\n  I look forward in the next weeks to hearing the detailed comments \nfrom Administration experts on these matters as we get the FTC report.\n  We are also starting to hear from others on this new, substantially \nchanged, language. Senator Frist placed in the Record last week a \nletter from the Biotechnology Industry Organization that complains \nabout the manner in which the bill undermines existing patent \nprotection.\n  I would just note that the organization representing our nation's \ncutting edge biotechnology companies, BIO, expressed great \ndissatisfaction with this new bill language. The July 15th BIO letter \nsays in part:\n\n       If enacted, these proposals would significantly erode the \n     measures in Hatch-Waxman to ensure an effective patent \n     incentive for new drug development, and would create \n     undesirable precedents for sound science-based regulations of \n     drug products in the United States.\n\n  BIO also has some sharp criticism of the patent forfeiture provisions \nset forth in the file-it-or-lose-it and sue-on-it-or-lose-it clauses in \nthe bill. BIO says:\n\n       This forfeiture will occur without compensation, without a \n     right of appeal and without any recourse. This provision is \n     probably unconstitutional, and in any event is totally \n     unconscionable.\n\n  Also adding its voice to the debate over this new, unvetted language \nis the American Intellectual Property Law Association. The AIPLA is a \nnational bar association representing a diverse group of more than \n14,000 individuals from private, corporate, academic and governmental \npractice of intellectual property law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of a July 22, 2002 letter from the AIPLA.\n\n[[Page S7346]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         American Intellectual Property Law Association\n                                               Arlington, Virginia\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing on behalf of the American \n     Intellectual Property Law Association to express our concerns \n     about provisions in S. 812 that would undercut long standing \n     principles of patent law and would set an unfortunate example \n     for other nations to emulate.\n       The AIPLA is a national bar association of more than 14,000 \n     members engaged in private and corporate practice, in \n     government service, and in the academic community. The AIPLA \n     represents a wide and diverse spectrum of individuals, \n     companies and institutions involved directly or indirectly in \n     the practice of patent, trademark, copyright, and unfair \n     competition law, as well as other fields of law affecting \n     intellectual property. Our members represent both owners and \n     users of intellectual property.\n       While we take no position on the need for revisions in the \n     practice of ``patent listings'' in applications for drug \n     approvals before the FDA, AIPLA believes that providing a new \n     civil action to delist patents is ill advised. Such actions \n     would involve the issues of (a) whether the innovator's \n     product is actually covered by the patent-at-issue and (b) \n     potentially, the validity of the patent. Irrespective of the \n     merits of allowing challenges to the listing on the basis of \n     its accuracy, vesting courts with jurisdiction over patent \n     issues in this circumstance where there is no case or \n     controversy is inappropriate. Such proposed new civil actions \n     would be invitations to increased litigation and threats of \n     litigation over such issues without corresponding public \n     benefit.\n       If a generic drug company wished to challenge the validity \n     of a listed patent, we would suggest that a far better \n     alternative would be to require that it be through the normal \n     procedure of a request for patent reexamination. To the \n     extent that the existing proceedings might not be considered \n     adequate for such challenges, not only are there bills to \n     strengthen them (H.R. 1866, H.R. 1886, and S. 1754), but \n     there is currently a proposal being developed by the U.S. \n     Patent and Trademark Office to establish a post-grant \n     opposition proceeding that would provide a more robust \n     challenge procedure. Such proceedings are not only handled by \n     the experts in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in the \n     first instance, but all appeals would go to the Court of \n     Appeals for the Federal Circuit which handles almost all \n     patent appeals from normal infringement litigation.\n       Another aspect of S. 812 which we find troubling is the \n     proposed prohibition against a patentee bringing a patent \n     infringement action against a generic drug company for a \n     patent not listed (and/or not properly listed) in an \n     application for FDA approval. Under current provisions in the \n     law, a patent owner loses the right to file a patent \n     infringement law suit which has the effect of staying the \n     FDA's approval of a generic drug for 30 months to allow \n     resolution of the law suit if (a) the patent is not listed \n     with the FDA or (b) the suit is not brought against the \n     generic drug company within 45 days of receiving an \n     appropriate certification notice that is listed patent is \n     either invalid or not infringed. They do, however, retain the \n     right to bring an infringement suit at a later date. The \n     effect of the present amendments would be to take that right \n     away from the patent holder. This would be an arbitrary \n     denial of a remedy guaranteed to patent holders in all fields \n     of technology.\n       We also point out that the denials of relief noted in the \n     preceding paragraph would be limitations on pharmaceutical \n     patents which could implicate certain non-discriminatory \n     obligations of the United States under the Agreement on the \n     Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights \n     (TRIPs), part of the Uruguay Round Agreements. At a time when \n     the Agreement is under challenge from many quarters following \n     the Doha Ministerial Conference, certainly these provisions \n     of S. 812 should be vetted with the Office of the U.S. Trade \n     Representative for their consistency with TRIPs.\n       In summary, while we take no position on the need for \n     legislation to change the provisions of the 1984 Hatch-Waxman \n     Act or on the merits of the respective positions of innovator \n     drug companies and generic drug companies, we are concerned \n     that these provisions of S. 812 are contrary to good patent \n     law policy and enforcement. Indeed, they would establish \n     principles that would do great harm to the ability of \n     innovators to realize adequate and effective patent \n     protection and set bad examples by the United States when \n     viewed by other nations that are seeking ways to avoid \n     providing such protection. If reform is needed, it should \n     take other forms and directions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Michael K. Kirk,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. While taking no position on the need for changing the \npatent listing provisions of Hatch-Waxman, the AIPLA said that it \nbelieves that:\n\n       Providing a new civil action to delist patents is ill \n     advised . . . Irrespective of the merits of allowing \n     challenges to the listing on the basis of its accuracy, \n     vesting courts with jurisdiction over patent issues in this \n     circumstance where there is no case or controversy is \n     inappropriate.\n\n  The AIPLA also red flags the file-it-or-lose-it patent forfeiture \nprovisions of the pending legislation by pointing out that these, and I \nquote,\n\n       . . . would be limitations on pharmaceutical patents which \n     could implicate certain nondiscriminatory obligations of the \n     United States under the Agreement on the Trade Related \n     Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). At a time \n     when the Agreement is under challenge from many quarters \n     following the Doha Ministerial Conference, certainly these \n     provisions of S. 812 should be vetted with the Office of the \n     U.S. Trade Representative for their consistency with TRIPS.\n\n  I agree we should hear from United States Trade Representative on \nthis matter. I also agree with the American Intellectual Property Law \nAssociation when it closed its letter with the following statement: \n``If reform is needed, it should take other forms and directions.''\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to make my colleagues aware of, \nand ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, a statement \nfrom the law offices of David Beier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Innovation in Health Care and the Resulting Improvements in Mortality \nand Health Outcomes Will Suffer From the Retroactive Taking of Property \n Rights Posed by the Senate H.E.L.P. Committee Passage of the Edwards \n                          Substitute to S. 812\n\n       In the last 50 years there have been dramatic improvements \n     in life expectancy and better health care outcomes, in \n     pertinent part, because of new drugs and therapies. These \n     advances have occurred because the United States, unlike some \n     other nations, has used a strong patent system to help create \n     a balanced set of incentives. That system of incentives for \n     innovation is at risk, if as proposed in the pending bill, \n     the investment backed and settled property rights in patents \n     are retroactively taken away.\n       The substitute amendment to the Schumer-McCain bill adopted \n     July 11 proposes to deprive property owners--in this case \n     patent holders--of the most fundamental of property rights, \n     the right to exclude others from using their property without \n     just compensation. The bill works this result by taking away \n     the right to sue. As explained in greater detail, the bill \n     proposes to prevent holders of valid patents from suing \n     generic drug companies. This proposal is not only bad policy \n     but poses at least three serious legal problems.\n       First, the proposed bill takes away an essential attribute \n     of a patent--the right to enforce it against copiers. This \n     deprivation is either a per se taking of property under the \n     relevant Supreme Court case law, or works a taking in light \n     of the case by case constitutional test outlined by the same \n     court. The pending bill would work a per se taking if a Court \n     determined that the loss of a fundamental right--like the \n     right to sue--was the equivalent of a total physical \n     occupation of a piece of real property. There is a good case \n     that a court would so find. But regardless of whether this \n     proposal would meet that test, the courts would most surely \n     find that the loss of the right to sue would be a taking of \n     property that required just compensation under the other \n     applicable constitutional test.\n       Under current Supreme Court precedent, if enacted, these \n     amendments would be evaluated under a taking analysis that \n     would measure the nature of the property involved, the nature \n     of the economic right and the degree of governmental \n     interference. In this case, it is well settled law that a \n     patent is a property right. It would be absurd to uphold that \n     right and then claim that barring access to the courthouse \n     does not violate that right. Because this amendment would \n     work a fundamental and retroactive deprivation of those \n     economic rights courts would likely hold that these changes \n     are a taking. Such a finding triggers a requirement of \n     government compensation of the property owners. At the \n     President's Council of Economic Advisers recognized in \n     their report to the President earlier this year, the kinds \n     of inventions at risk here--both breakthroughs and \n     incremental improvements in existing products--are \n     critical to improved health outcomes. That same report \n     also recognized that these products require the free \n     market possibility of substantial profits to sustain the \n     magnitude of the R+D necessary to overcome the risk of \n     research failures, and competition from others also racing \n     to be first on the market with new medical innovations. \n     This reality would mean that a successful taking suit \n     would implicate many claims of significant economic loss. \n     Thus, it is likely that any finding would have very \n     serious implications for the Federal budget.\n       Second, there is a strong argument that this amendment \n     interferes with the right of\n\n[[Page S7347]]\n\n     patent holders to petition their government through the \n     judicial system for a redress of their grievances. In this \n     case, much like the efforts of others in an earlier time, \n     seeks to prevent courts from enforcing rights guaranteed by \n     the Constitution. This approach can not be justified in light \n     of the compelling constitutional right to have full and fair \n     access to redress grievances.\n       Third, and finally, this amendment makes artificial and \n     illegal distinctions between types of patents in violation of \n     the United States' obligations under international law. One \n     of the important advances in law, secured at the request of \n     the United States, in the World Trade Organization's Trade \n     Related Intellectual Property system was a bar on \n     discrimination between different technologies. In this case, \n     the amendment proposes to withdraw significant patent rights \n     from the holders of certain innovative drug patents that \n     continue to be guaranteed to all other patent holders. \n     Imagine if another nation proposed to cut off the right to \n     sue for infringement for the violation of an aerospace, \n     computer or computer software patent, we certainly would \n     assert that it violated our Nation's rights under TRIPS. The \n     pending amendment offers the same kind of flawed and illegal \n     approach. In the case of a TRIPS violation the penalty could, \n     after adjudication in the WTO, result in the imposition of \n     retaliatory tariffs on American exports.\n       In sum, the pending amendment is a bad idea on policy \n     grounds, procedurally suspect and legally subject to \n     challenge. Congress should carefully consider the risks to \n     the Federal Treasury that could result if this bill were \n     enacted and the courts uphold a strong ``taking'' of property \n     claim. Moreover, legislators should also be cognizant of the \n     bad precedent they would be creating by barring access to \n     judicial remedies. Finally, Congress should recognize that if \n     approaches to international obligations like this are \n     adopted, other countries will be more likely to punish \n     American inventions in other sectors, including information \n     technology and aerospace.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. Beier was a member of the staff of the House Judiciary \nCommittee when Hatch-Waxman was adopted in 1984. After that, for many \nyears he headed the Washington office of the biotechnology company, \nGenentech. Mr. Beier then spent four years serving as the chief \ndomestic policy advisor for Vice President Gore. He is recognized as an \nexpert in high technology issues and is now a partner in highly \nrespected Washington law firm. David is certainly not a conservative \nRepublican although I still have my hopes for him!\n  In Mr. Beier's view, ``the pending amendment is a bad idea on policy \ngrounds, procedurally suspect and legally subject to challenge.'' Mr. \nBeier lays out the Takings Clause problems, the procedural due process \nconcerns, and the TRIPS considerations.\n  With respect to the potential for negative impact on foreign trade \nMr. Beier warns:\n\n       Imagine if another nation proposed to cut off the right to \n     sue for infringement for the violation of an aerospace, \n     computer or computer software patent. We would certainly \n     assert that it violated our Nation's rights under TRIPS. The \n     pending Amendment offers the same kind of flawed and illegal \n     approach. In the case of a TRIPS violation the penalty could, \n     after adjudication in the WHO, result in the imposition of \n     retaliatory tariffs on American exports.\n\n  Mr. President, I share these concerns. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider the views of BIO, the AIPLA, and David Beier, as well as the \nother organizations cited by Senator Frist last week, before we rush to \nadopt this virtually unvetted, far-reaching language that has not been \nthe subject of a hearing in any committee of Congress. Not the HELP \nCommittee, not the Judiciary Committee, not the Commerce Committee, and \nnot the Finance Committee which has jurisdiction over matters of \ninternational trade.\n  But more important than any payments that the Treasury might be \ncompelled to pay due to judgments related to the Takings Clause or than \nany retaliatory trade sanctions that the WHO may impose on the United \nStates down the road, we need to consider what the public health \nconsequences might be if we unjustifiably lower protections on \npharmaceutical patents.\n  Don't get me wrong. I am in favor of fierce price competition in the \npharmaceutical marketplace. I favor not just less expensive general \ndrugs today, but also better breakthrough drugs tomorrow. We need to \nkeep in mind the relationship between public health and intellectual \nproperty. As David Beier has observed with respect to this linkage and \nthe threat of this bill:\n\n       In the last 50 years there have been dramatic improvements \n     in life expectancy and better health care outcomes, in \n     pertinent part, because of new drugs and therapies. These \n     advances have occurred because the United States, unlike \n     other nations, has used a strong patent system to help create \n     a balanced set of incentives. That system of incentives for \n     innovation is at risk, if as proposed in the pending \n     legislation, the investment backed and settled property \n     rights in patents are retroactively taken away.\n\n  In short, while better in some key respects than McCain-Schumer, I am \nafraid that the HELP Committee-reported bill goes too far with respect \nto the 30-month stay. As I testified before the HELP Committee in May, \nif the problems we are trying to solve are the multiple use of 30-month \nstays and 11th hour-issued patents that unfairly trigger the stay, it \nseems to me that a more appropriate--and more narrowly-tailored--\nlegislative response might be a rule that allows one stay, and one stay \nonly.\n  Further, it might be appropriate to restrict the use of the sole stay \nonly with respect to those patents listed in the FDA Orange Book at the \ntime when a particular generic drug application is submitted. I will be \ninterested if such a rule satisfies the problems that the FTC finds \nwith respect to abuses of the 30-month stay and how the FTC, FDA, DOJ \nand other experts and interested parties think about this perspective.\n  I am open to other alternatives as more information becomes available \nand more discussion takes place among interested parties.\n  For now at least, I am forced to conclude that this new NDA-plus 30-\nday rule coupled with the file-it-or-lose-it and sue-on-it-or-lose-it \nprovisions and the new private right of action amounts to legislative \noverkill that creates a host of new problems.\n  In contrast to this over-correction with regard to the 30-month stay, \nI am concerned that the Edwards-Collins HELP Committee Substitute \nunder-corrects in fixing the 180-day marketing exclusivity issue.\n  Perhaps no single provision of the 1984 law has caused so much \ncontroversy as the 180-day marketing exclusivity rule.\n  As I explained last week, the statute contains this incentive to \nencourage challenges that help test the validity of pioneer drug \npatents and to encourage the development of non-patent infringing ways \nto produce generic drugs. The policy motivation behind the 180-day rule \nis to benefit consumers by earlier entry of cost-saving generic \nproducts onto the market in situations where patents were invalid or \ncould be legally circumnavigated.\n  For many years as we intended and envisioned FDA awarded this 180-day \nexclusivity only to a generic drug applicant that was successful in \npatent litigation against the pioneer firm. In 1997, FDA's longstanding \nsuccessful defense requirement was struck down by the D.C. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals in the case of Mova Pharma v. Shalala.\n  The next year, the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion in Purepac Pharm \nv. Shalala which upheld FDA's new system of granting the 180-day \nexclusivity to the first filer of a generic drug application even if \nthe pioneer firm did not sue for patent infringement. Also in 1998, the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals held in Granutec v. Shalala that a \ncourt decision with respect to a second or third filer could trigger \nthe exclusivity period of a first filer.\n  Taken together, these decisions, which strictly construed the \nstatutory language, awarded the exclusivity to the first filer of a \ngeneric drug application. As a co-author of the legislation, I will be \nthe first to concede that we drafters of the 1984 law came up short in \nthis area because we were attempting to reward the first successful \nchallenger, not the first to file papers with the FDA.\n  Once the successful defense requirement was struck down, the mismatch \nbetween first filers of generic drug applications and the generic drug \nfirms actually litigating the patents resulted in a number of \ncontroversial contractual arrangements in which generic firms in the \nfirst-to-file blocking position were paid by pioneer firms not to go to \nmarket. These agreements prevented the 180-day marketing exclusivity \nclock from ever starting, and the statute prevented FDA from approving \nsecond and subsequent filers from going to market.\n  Here is how my good friend, Bill Haddad, an astute political analyst, \ngeneric drug manufacturer, gifted writer, incorrigible liberal, and \nparticipant in\n\n[[Page S7348]]\n\nthe 1984 negotiations recalled the intent of the 180-day marketing \nexclusivity provision:\n\n       There was never any doubt that the goal .. was to bring \n     generics to the market earlier using the route of legal \n     challenge with a reward to be paid to the entrepreneur with \n     the courage and facts to successfully challenge.\n  It was and is very clear that the law was not designed to allow deals \nbetween brand and generic companies to delay competition.\n\n  Unfortunately, the string of court decisions that interpreted these \nimprecisely drafted statutory clauses has resulted in a wholly \nunintended result.\n  As David Balto, a former senior official at the FTC, has described \nthe problem:\n\n       The 180-day exclusivity provision appears to have led to \n     strategic conduct that has delayed and not fostered the \n     competitive process.\n\n  Mr. Balto assessed:\n\n       The competitive concern is that the 180-day exclusivity \n     provision can be used strategically by a patent holder to \n     prolong its market power in ways that go beyond the intent of \n     the patent laws and the Hatch-Waxman Act by delaying generic \n     entry for a substantial period.\n\n  He is right. He is absolutely right.\n  This wholly unintended dynamic has properly brought intense antitrust \nscrutiny. As a matter of fact, in May of 2001, the Judiciary Committee \nexamined the antitrust implications of pharmaceutical patent \nsettlements inspired by the 180-day rule.\n  The Federal Trade Commission has been very active in this area. The \nFTC has brought and settled three of these cases in which brand name \ncompanies pay generic firms not to compete. At this point I will not go \ninto the details of the consent decrees in the Abbott--Geneva case, the \nHoescht--Andrx agreement, and the FTC's settlement with American Home \nProducts. FTC Chairman Tim Muris provided a great deal of information \nin his testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee in April.\n  The FTC is doing the right thing in taking enforcement actions \nagainst those who enter into anti-competitive agreements that violate \nour Nation's antitrust laws. Probably in no small part due to the FTC's \nvigorous enforcement under the existing antitrust laws and the \ndevelopment of Senator Leahy's Bill, The Drug Competition Act, S. 754, \nI understand that no more of these type of anti-competitive agreements \nhave been initiated for over two years. The FTC report will no doubt \nshed light on this area In a post-Enron, post-WorldCom environment, who \nwould be so reckless as to enter into such an agreement? Nevertheless, \nI must also point out that the agency recently suffered a set back when \nthe FTC administrative law judge issued a ruling in the on-going K-Dur \nlitigation that reminds us that not all pharmaceutical patent \nsettlements are per se violations of federal antitrust law.\n  In any event, the McCain-Schumer bill addressed the 180-day collusive \nreverse payments situation by adopting a so-called rolling exclusivity \npolicy. If the eligible generic drug filer does not go to market within \na specified time period, the 180-day exclusivity rolls to the next \nfiler.\n  As I testified before the HELP Committee, I do not favor rolling \nexclusivity. Here's what Gary Buehler, then Acting Director of FDA's \nOffice of Generic Drugs, said before the Judiciary Committee last year:\n\n       We believe that rolling exclusivity would actually be an \n     impediment to generic competition in that the exclusivity \n     would continue to bounce from the first to the second to the \n     third if, somehow or other, the first was disqualified.\n\n  In 1999, FDA proposed a rule which embraced a use it or lose it \npolicy whereby if the first eligible generic drug applicant did not \npromptly go to market, all other approved applicants could commence \nsales. Molly Boast, Director of the FTC Bureau of Competition, \ntestified last May that, at the staff level, FTC supported FDA's use it \nor lose it proposal. If our goal is to maximize consumer savings after \na patent has been defeated, I find it difficult to see how rolling \nexclusivity achieves this goal. I certainly prefer FDA's use it or lose \nit policy over the McCain-Schumer brand of rolling exclusivity.\n  In that regard, I must again commend the sponsors of the Edwards-\nCollins Substitute for rejecting the McCain-Schumer rolling exclusivity \npolicy in favor of what Senator Edwards calls modified use-it-or-lose-\nit. Having said that, I was alarmed to learn that during mark-up \nSenator Edwards responded to a question by stating it was conceivable \nthat his modified use-it-or-lose-it language might actually roll \nindefinitely. This disturbs me. Every time the exclusivity would roll \nto another drug firm, consumers will be further away from the day when \nmulti-firm generic price competition can begin in the marketplace.\n  Frankly, I am not certain that I completely understand how the \nforfeiture language in Section 5 of the bill works. I do not think I am \nalone in this confusion. At some point, I would like to engage in a \ncolloquy with the bill managers to ask some questions designed to \nclarify precisely how this provision works.\n  Let me say that if the bill reinstates the successful defense \nrequirement and gives awards to the successful challenger so long as \nthe firm goes to market in a timely fashion, I am supportive of the \ngeneral concept. But I must say that I think that there are some real \nadvantages to Senator Gregg's simple and straight-forward policy of \nmore closely following FDA's old-fashioned use-it-or-lose-it proposal.\n  As I stated earlier, I am generally sympathetic to the concerns of \ngeneric drug firms that any exclusivity awarded should be measured from \nthe time of an appellate court decision. But this principle may not \nhold up if any form of rolling exclusivity is adopted or if we have \nmultiple patents and multiple challengers, some of whom are attacking \non invalidity and some of whom or attacking on non-infringement.\n  I must say I am troubled by the provision of the bill that appears to \ngrant each generic firm that qualifies for the benefit of the 18-month \nmarketing exclusivity incentive a 30-month period to secure FDA \napproval, measured from the from the time of the filing of the generic \ndrug application.\n  Let's say that the first firm eligible to take advantage of the 180-\nday benefit drops out for some reason. Assume also that the next firm \neligible under the terms of Section 5 is in the midst of, for example, \na negative good manufacturing inspection and can't go to market, but \nhas say 14 months remaining on the 30-month clock. It would hardly seem \nlike an appropriate outcome if, for example, the next firm eligible on \nthe list already has satisfied all of the FDA requirements and has \nreceived tentative final approval, but must wait until the 30-month \nclock runs out.\n  I hope that the proponents of the substitute amendment will help us \nall understand just how Section 5 is intended to work. It is difficult \nfor me to see why we should adopt a policy whereby the balance of the \n30-month period described in Section 5(a)(2)``(D)(i)(III)(dd)'' on page \n44 of the bill, could conceivably be greater than the 180-days of \nmarketing exclusivity. Upon default of the first qualified applicant, \nwhy should we wait for a second eligible drug firm to obtain FDA \napproval when there may be a third, fourth, or fifth applicant in line \nwith FDA approval ready to go?\n  I hope the sponsors of the legislation are not locked into their so-\ncalled modified use it or lose it policy, because I think it would be \nwise for Congress to step back and reassess the wisdom of retaining the \n180-day marketing exclusivity provision in essentially the same form as \nenacted in 1984. Why not take this opportunity to re-think the 180-day \nrule?\n  At one extreme are those who have suggested that the 180-day \nmarketing exclusivity provision may not even be necessary at all. Liz \nDickinson, a top-notch career attorney at FDA, has asked: ``I suggest \nwe look at whether 180-day exclusivity is even necessary, and I know \nthat there is this idea that it is an incentive to take the risk. I say \nthe facts speak otherwise. If you have a second, third, fourth, fifth \ngeneric in line for the same blockbuster drug . . . undertaking the \nrisk of litigation without the hope of exclusivity, is that exclusivity \neven necessary?''\n  Ms. Dickinson went on to make the following observation with respect \nto the 180- day rule, ``We have got a provision that is supposed to \nencourage competition by delaying competition. It has got a built in \ncontradiction, and that contradiction . . . is bringing down part of \nthe statute.''\n\n[[Page S7349]]\n\n  At the Judiciary Committee hearing on May 24, 2001, Gary Buehler, \nFDA's top official in the Office of Generic Drugs agreed with his \ncolleague's assessment:\n\n       . . . we often have the second, third, fourth, fifth \n     challengers to the same patent, oftentimes when the \n     challengers actually realize that they are not the first and \n     there is no hope for them to get the 180-day exclusivity. So \n     with that in mind, I would agree with Liz's statement that \n     generic firms will continue to challenge patents. Whether the \n     180-day exclusivity is a necessary reward for that challenge \n     is unknown, but it does not appear that it is.\n\n  Keep in mind that both of these FDA officials are career civil \nservants with no political axe to grind. I personally favor retaining \nsome financial incentive to encourage patent challenges, but in light \nof this testimony and other factors, I do not think we need to be \nwedded to the current form of the 180-day exclusivity benefit.\n  Frankly, I am surprised that neither the McCain-Schumer bill, nor the \nKennedy mark, nor the Edwards-Collins amendment, proposed any changes \nin the current regime in light of the views of the FDA officials among \nother considerations. But, of course, neither the FDA nor FTC nor any \nrepresentatives from the Administration testified at the HELP Committee \nhearing on May 8th.\n  Senator Schumer argues that the task of this legislation is to curb \nexcesses in order to return to the original balance in the 1984 law. \nBut what if conditions have changed and the original balance of the \n1984 need to be reassessed? Or what if there was an area that we didn't \nget right the first time?\n  For example, consider how Paragraph IV litigation treats patent \ninvalidity and patent non-infringement challenges identically under the \n180-day marketing exclusivity rule. But invalidity and non-infringement \nare two very different theories of the case. Here is what Al Engelberg, \na smart and tenacious attorney who specialized in attacking drug \npatents on behalf of generic drug firm clients, has said about this \ndifference:\n\n       In cases involving an assertion of non-infringement, an \n     adjudication in favor of one challenger is of no immediate \n     benefit to any other challenger and does not lead to multi-\n     source competition. Each case involving non-infringement is \n     decided on the specific facts related to that challenger's \n     product and provides no direct benefit to any other \n     challenger. In contrast, a judgment of patent invalidity or \n     enforceability creates an estoppel against any subsequent \n     attempt to enforce the patent against any party. The drafters \n     of the 180-day exclusivity provision failed to consider this \n     important distinction.\n\n  As one of the drafters, I must accept my share of responsibility for \nnot fully appreciating the implications of this distinction. I think \nwhat Mr. Engelberg is pointing out that the 180-day rule acts as only a \nfloor in non-infringement cases. As long as any patents stand, a \nparticular non-infringer's marketing exclusivity can extend well beyond \n180 days until such time as another non-infringer comes along. \nConversely, doesn't the 180-day floor work to the detriment of \nconsumers whenever it acts to block market entry of a second non-\ninfringer during the 180-day period ? Why shouldn't a second or third \nnon-infringer be granted immediate access to the market as would occur \nin any other industry? Consumers would reap immediate benefits for \nprice competition.\n  I hope that my colleagues working on the bill will consider the \ndistinction between invalidity and non-infringement as this debate \ncontinues over the next week. While I am of the mind to retain a strong \nfinancial incentive to encourage vigorous patent challenges by generic \ndrug firms, we must ask why identical rewards are granted for \nsuccessful invalidity and non-infringement claims. I welcome the \ncomments and suggestions of my colleagues and other interested parties \non this matter\n  Frankly, I think we need more public discussion and debate about the \nwisdom of retaining--lock, stock, and barrel--the old 180-day \nexclusivity award.\n  For example, even if we adopt the modified use it or lose it approach \nof the HELP Committee bill and the first qualified generic manufacturer \ncannot, or will not, commence marketing and the exclusivity moves to \nthe next qualified applicant, why should the second manufacturer get \nthe full 180-days? Why not 90 days? Why not 60 days?\n\n  After all, once the exclusivity begins to roll and roll and we move \naway from granting the marketing exclusivity to the successful generic \nlitigant and Americans always prefer actual winners--we may end up with \na mere second filer--and since when does our society grant such \nlucrative rewards to someone who merely files some papers?\n  And what is so sacrosanct about 180-days in the first place? It is my \ninformation that in 1984 the number-one selling drug in the United \nStates was Tagamet, with domestic sales of about $500 million. I am \ntold that today the cholesterol-controlling medicine, Lipitor, has \ndomestic U.S. sales of over $5 billion. Lipitor sales are 10-times \nhigher in the U.S. than domestic Tagamet sales were in 1984. I \nunderstand that worldwide sales of Lipitor are about $7 billion.\n  Even adjusting for inflation, it seems clear that 180-days of \nmarketing exclusivity is worth more, and a lot more, today than it was \nworth in 1984.\n  What might 180-days of marketing exclusivity for today's blockbuster \ndrugs be worth in profits to the generic firm holding the 180-day \nmarketing exclusivity rights?\n  Let's be frank about what is going on here: Retention of the 180-day \nmarketing exclusivity provision is one of those areas in which both the \ngeneric sector and the R sector have something of a mutual interest. \nAnd when all is said and done, I think that the joint interest of the \ngenerics and the pioneer firms is not in perfect alignment with the \ninterests of consumers.\n  This is so because during the 180-day time frame, when there is only \none generic competitor, the pioneer firm does not take anywhere near \nthe hit on market share and profits that occurs when multiple generic \nfirms enter the market. Similarly, the first generic on the market is \nunder no pressure to cut the price anywhere near as much as when there \nis competition from multiple generic firms.\n  The report, Drug Trend: 2001, published by Express Scripts, notes \nthis dynamic:\n\n       The AWP [average wholesale price] for the first generic is \n     usually about 10 percent below the brand. After the six month \n     exclusivity granted to the first generic manufacturer, the \n     price paid . . . for the generic quickly falls, often by 40 \n     percent or more, as multiple manufacturers of the same \n     generic product compete for market share. It seems likely \n     that the value of the 180-day marketing exclusivity award \n     today may be worth much more that it was back in 1984--\n     perhaps several hundred million dollars more per blockbuster \n     drug.\n\n  Given the dramatic increase in drug sales for today's blockbuster \nproducts, it does not seem far-fetched to project that the 180-\nmarketing exclusivity reward can amount to hundreds of millions of \ndollars--and perhaps over one billion dollars--in profits to the \nfortunate generic drug manufacturer. I am all for assuring that there \nare sufficient incentives to ensure patent challenges, but isn't there \na limit beyond which we should direct these excess profits back to \nconsumers?\n  Would we rather see 25 percent to 40 percent of that money in the \nhands of the trial attorneys who brought the case? Or, would we rather \nsee at least some of those funds earmarked for attorneys' fees, be \nchanneled to help citizens lacking access to prescription drugs?\n  Shouldn't we get the facts concerning the change in value of the 180-\nday marketing exclusivity today compared to 1984 and make any \nappropriate adjustment to this incentive? We don't want to set the \nincentive so low as to discourage challenges to non-blockbuster \npatents.\n  My purpose in rasing these points is to get an indication from the \nsponsors of this legislation and other interested parties, such as \npatient advocacy organization, state Medicaid agencies, and insurers, \nwhether there is interest in discussing the advisability of passing on \nmore of the value associated with the marketing exclusivity to \nconsumers if it appears it is fair to do so.\n  If there is interest, I would be willing to help fashion an \nappropriate amendment. It seems to me that we need to provide enough of \nan incentive to assure vigorous patent challenges, but we should give \naway no more exclusivity than is necessary. Every day of marketing \nexclusivity awarded to a generic firm comes at the expense of \nconsumers.\n  I think we can and should explore this area further.\n  Let us not too quickly and too blindly retain the basic structure of \nreward\n\n[[Page S7350]]\n\nunder the 180-day marketing exclusivity provision. Before we change the \nlaw, let us have a serious re-examination of whether to retain the 180-\nday marketing exclusivity in its current form both in terms of the \nlength of the exclusivity period and whether the rewards for successful \ninvalidity and non-infringement challenges should be treated \nidentically.\n  I urge my colleagues, as well as consumer organizations and \npharmaceutical purchasers such as insurers and self-insured businesses \nto reflect upon what I have said on this subject today.\n  This is an area in which I think we would be wise to reject Senator \nSchumer's argument that all we are doing with this legislation is \nrestoring the integrity of the old Hatch-Waxman Act. But why should we \nbe governed by the world of 1984 when, for example, the best selling \ndrugs in this country have increased sales by a factor of 10? Why \nshould the value of the marketing exclusivity reward increase in direct \nproportion?\n  On a number of occasions, I have commended Senator Schumer and \nSenator McCain for moving their legislation forward, even if the bill \nthat came out of the HELP Committee does not resemble very closely \ntheir bill, and I still have problems with the floor vehicle as I have \nlaid out in some detail. I commend them again today.\n  I hope to return to the floor before this debate ends to offer a few \nsuggestions for a more comprehensive approach to reforming the Drug \nPrice Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act.\n  This in no way minimizes the importance of he matters that are the \nsubject of the pending legislation, because they are important areas. I \ndo not believe, however, that these are the most important issues we \ncan address.\n  Rather than focusing on how best to bring the law back to the old \ndays of 1984, as Senator Schumer suggests, I want to discuss ways to \nmodify the law to help usher in a new era of drug discovery while, at \nthe same time, increasing patient access to the latest medicines.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7350-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time not be charged against either manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry of the Chair: \nWhat is pending before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The debate on the conference report is limited \nto 2 hours equally divided.\n\n[[Page S7351]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. So there is 1 hour on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I am very pleased that we are now \nconsidering the conference report on the Public Company Accounting \nReform and Investor Protection Act of 2002. The Senate approved this \nlegislation on July 15 on a 97-0 vote. Conferees were named promptly \nboth here and in the House, and the conference committee immediately \nwent to work.\n  Agreement was reached yesterday in the early evening, about 7 \no'clock, by the conference committee, and the House took up the \nconference report this morning and acted on it earlier in the day. The \nvote, I believe, was 422--3.\n  The conference report has now come over to us, and obviously, under \nour procedures, it is our turn to proceed to consider it.\n  This legislation establishes a carefully constructed statutory \nframework to deal with the numerous conflicts of interest that in \nrecent years have undermined the integrity of our capital markets and \nbetrayed the trust of millions of investors.\n  I say to my colleagues that in every one of its central provisions, \nthe conference report closely tracks or parallels the provisions in the \nSenate bill for which, as I indicated earlier, all the Members present \nat the time, 97 of us, voted only a short time ago.\n  This legislation establishes a strong independent accounting \noversight board, thereby bringing to an end the system of self-\nregulation in the accounting profession which, regrettably, has not \nonly failed to protect investors, as we have seen in recent months, but \nwhich has in effect abused the confidence in the markets, whose \nintegrity investors have taken almost as an article of faith.\n  This legislation reflects the extraordinary efforts of \nmany colleagues on both sides of the Capitol. I want especially to \nrecognize and express my deep gratitude to Senators Dodd and Corzine \nwho early on introduced legislation that in many respects serves as the \nbasis for titles 1 and 2 of this legislation.\n\n  On the House side, Congressman LaFalce introduced comprehensive \nlegislation on which we drew.\n  I also wish to acknowledge the many important contributions that my \nRepublican colleague, Senator Enzi, made at every step in the process. \nSenator Enzi had legislation of his own, but in addition we worked very \nclosely in the course of developing this legislation. Again and again I \nwas struck by the thoughtfulness and reasonableness of his proposals \nfor improving in the legislation. While in the end not all of them were \nincluded in the legislation, a significant number are, and I thank him \nvery much for all his contributions.\n  Before addressing the major provisions of the legislation, let me \nmake very clear that it applies exclusively to public companies--that \nis, to companies registered with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. It is not applicable to provide companies, who make up the \nvast majority of companies across the country.\n  This legislation prohibits accounting firms from providing certain \nspecified consulting services if they are also the auditors of the \ncompany. In our considered judgment, there are certain consulting \nservices which inherently carry with them significant conflicts of \ninterest. Auditors, in effect, find themselves in the position of \nauditing their own work. They may be acting as management of the \ncompany, for instance, on personnel matters when, as the outside \nauditor, they were supposed to be standing one step removed from the \ncompany as the outside auditor. This is the reasoning behind the \nprohibition.\n  What has happened in recent years is that the fees earned from the \nconsulting work have dwarfed the fees earned from the auditors, which \ninevitably leads to concerns that punches may be pulled on the audit to \naccommodate the significant and remunerative involvement on the \nconsulting side. Certain enumerated consulting practices are therefore \nnot allowed, with the exception that a case-by-case exemption can be \nobtained from the oversight board that this legislation establishes.\n\n  The auditor can engage in the balance of consulting services with the \npre-approval of the audit committee of the corporation. And of course \nan auditor can engage in whatever consulting services the firm and the \ncorporation agree upon so long as the firm is not also acting as the \ncorporation's auditor.\n  The bill sets significantly higher standards for corporate \nresponsibility governance. It requires public companies to have \nindependent audit committees and also enhances the role of the audit \ncommittee, which will have responsibility for hiring and firing the \nauditors and setting their compensation.\n  The legislation requires full and prompt disclosure of stock sales by \ncompany executives. Senator Carnahan added an important provision to \nthe bill, requiring electronic filing with respect to such sales. That \nrequirement would take effect in a year's time, to allow time for the \nnecessary systems to be put in place; once in place it will assure \nprompt and accurate disclosure of these very significant transactions.\n  The legislation places limits on loans by corporations to their \nexecutive officers. It sets certain requirements for disclosure with \nrespect to special purpose entities, which were used by some \ncorporations that have run into such serious difficulty in recent \nmonths. It seeks to address the statement of pro forma earnings, in \norder to assure a more complete and accurate picture of a public \ncompany's financial position.\n  It also addresses the conflicts of interests that arise for stock \nanalysts to whom investors look for impartial research-based advice \nabout stocks. Unfortunately, many of these analysts are under pressure \nto promote stocks in which their broker-dealer firms may have an \ninvestment banking interest; on the one hand they are supposed to give \nunbiased advice to potential purchasers of stock, whether to buy or \nsell, but at the same time the firm of which they are a part is \ninterested in developing a business relationship with the company on \nwhich the analyst is passing judgment. It has been sobering to discover \nthat analysts have been formally recommending certain stocks to the \ninvesting public, while at the same time discussing them contemptuously \namong themselves. We have had too many demonstrations of this \noccurring.\n  The legislation includes provisions to protect analysts against \nretaliation, in cases where a negative recommendation may invite \nretaliation. Furthermore, the bill authorizes significant increases in \nfunding for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which for the first \ntime in many years will give it something close to the funding \nresources it needs.\n  There are also extensive criminal penalties contained in this \nlegislation. These were initially included in legislation reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee, which Senator Leahy offered as an amendment to \nthe bill. The House then passed its own bill with respect to criminal \npenalties, a separate standing bill, which in many instances doubled or \neven tripled the penalties in the Leahy proposal as it came to the \nfloor, and the Leahy proposals were further supplemented by an \namendment from Senators Biden and Hatch and another from Senator Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself 4 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. These provisions, among other things, require the CEOs \nand CFOs to certify their company's financial statements under penalty \nof potentially severe punishments.\n  We provide a $776 million authorization for the SEC. I want to spend \na minute on this point, because it is very important. The Senate \nAppropriations Committee is now working on an appropriation that would \ncontain $750 million for the SEC. It is urgent that we provide adequate \nfunding for the Commission, whose responsibilities have expanded as the \nvolume of market activity has grown, but whose funding has lagged. \nClearly, the Commission must have the resources necessary to ensure a \ndecisive and expeditious response to the scandals we have seen in\n\n[[Page S7352]]\n\nrecent months, and to minimize the likelihood that we will see others \nin the future.\n  I must underscore this point. The Commission has been underfunded, \nand the result has been understaffing, high staff turnover and low \nmorale as the Commission seeks to carry out its work. The SEC must be \nin a position to address immediately the problems of inadequate staff \nresources and inadequate pay.\n  At the moment, the SEC cannot offer its attorneys and accountants the \nsame level of salary and benefits that their counterparts receive at \nthe five Federal bank regulatory agencies. Talented and dedicated staff \nattorneys and accountants can increase their compensation by as much as \none-third simply by moving to another agency. This is an intolerable \nsituation. Pay parity has been authorized and now must be funded; this \nlegislation specifically provide the necessary funding.\n  In addition, the authorization provides funding that will enable the \nCommission to upgrade its technical capacities, its computer systems, \nand it provides significant resources so that the Commission can \naugment its staff of attorneys, accountants and examiners at a time \nwhen they are needed to address a very heavy workload burden.\n  As an aside, I mention that this morning the committee reported to \nthe Senate four nominees to bring the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to its full complement of five members. I very much hope we \nwill be able to approve them next week so that they will be able to \ntake their positions before the August recess. If we do, the Commission \nwill be at full strength. They will all be in place and ready to do the \njob, and I think that is highly desirable.\n  In closing, let me say that I believe this conference report reflects \nour best efforts to deal with issues which we know to be numerous and \ncomplex. Throughout the process, we have worked together carefully on \nthese issues. We have sought advice from the most distinguished and \nexperienced practitioners in the field. We held 10 hearings in March \nwith some of the very best experts in the country as our witnesses. We \nhave consulted extensively, and I hope my colleagues will agree in good \nfaith and across party lines. Our vision has been broad, our purpose \nsteady. I think our approach has been reasonable.\n  We will send to the President legislation establishing a solid \nstatutory framework for the reforms we know are urgently needed.\n  Our markets have benefited beyond measure from the statutory \nframework that created the SEC nearly 70 years ago. Indeed, I think we \nhave had a tendency to take that for granted. Those markets have been a \nvery significant economic asset for the United States, and an integral \npart of our economic strength. This legislation will serve to \ncomplement and reinforce that framework, which has served us well, and \nI believe it will stand the test of time.\n\n  Our markets, which have the reputation of being the fairest, the most \nefficient, the most transparent in the world, have suffered greatly in \nrecent times, so much so that they seem to have lost the confidence of \nour investors. It is our purpose, with this legislation and through \nother actions that will have to be taken by the regulatory agencies and \nby the private sector, to see that once again our capital markets \ndeserve the enviable reputation for fairness, efficiency, and \ntransparency that they have enjoyed through the years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to begin with some thank-yous and congratulations. First, I \nwant to congratulate Senator Sarbanes on this bill, and I want to make \nnote that in a very difficult period, where so many were trying to \npoint the finger of blame, when it seemed almost every day that people \nwere clamoring to make the strongest statement they could make to get \nthe sound bite on television, Senator Sarbanes could have taken that \nsame route in the Banking Committee. We are the committee that has \njurisdiction over the issues that had been at the very heart of our \nrecent concerns in the capital markets.\n\n  However, Senator Sarbanes did not take that route. I congratulate \nhim. He not only brought good reflection on himself, but he helped \nraise the esteem that the Banking Committee is held in and reflected \nwell on the Senate. We had hearings but we were focusing on what could \nbe done to fix the problem. As a result, those hearings were the most \nproductive that were held. They contributed to bringing us to where we \nare.\n  Now let me make it clear, from the very beginning there has been a \nbroad consensus, and a very deep consensus, on 90 percent of the issues \nin this bill. One of my frustrations in this debate--and when you are \ndebating something as high profile as this is, there are frustrations. \nI am not complaining--as my wife says whenever I complain about this \njob, not only did nobody force you to take it, but a lot of good people \nworked hard to keep you from getting it--I am not complaining, but part \nof our problem has been that the media has wanted to present this as a \ndebate that had to do with how tough people were being, to the \nexclusion, often, in my opinion, of how reasonable we need to be.\n  We have before the Senate a bill that is clearly an improvement over \nthe status quo. I don't care how disappointed you are in any one \nprovision--and on several provisions I am very disappointed. No matter \nhow disappointed a Member is, this is an improvement over the status \nquo, and for two reasons. One is obvious. That is, we needed stiffer \ncriminal penalties. And, second, we needed to create an independently \nfunded and an independently operating accounting oversight board so \nthat we could deal with ethics questions in a framework that will \npromote high ethical standards, in the framework of independence. In \naddition, we desperately needed to have an independently funded FASB.\n  I would just say as an aside, Madam President, over the years I have \nagreed with FASB in some of their decisions; I have disagreed with FASB \non some of their decisions. However, I am proud to be able to say today \nI have never taken the position that Congress ought to override FASB. \nAs incomprehensible as some of their rulings have been to my way of \nthinking, having Congress vote on accounting standards is a very \ndangerous thing.\n  Some of our colleagues want to vote on the whole issue of expensing \nstock options. Wherever you come down on that issue, having Congress \nvote on accounting standards is very dangerous, very counterproductive. \nI hope that will not happen. Certainly, I am not going to vote to \nimpose accounting standards on this board. We want FASB to set \naccounting standards. We want to be sure they have the independence \nthat is necessary to allow them to do it.\n  In those areas there has never been a disagreement on this bill. The \ndisagreements that have occurred have had to do with the perception of \nindividual Members as to what was practical, what was workable, what \nwas desirable. The one view I have always subscribed to, and I would \nhave to say given my period of service in public life I am more \nconvinced of it than ever, is that Thomas Jefferson was right when he \nsaid good men--he would say good people today, of course--good men with \nthe same information are prone to have different opinions.\n  There is a natural tendency in the human mind to think, if people \ndisagree with you, that either, A, they don't know what they are \ntalking about; or B, they don't have good intentions. I subscribe to \nthe Jefferson thesis.\n\n  The areas where I disagree with the bill are pretty straightforward. \nFirst of all, I believe there is a very real problem in auditor \nindependence. If I were a member of this new accounting oversight board \nthat we are going to put into place and I had to vote on the nine \nprohibited areas that are written into law in the bill, I would want to \nstudy them in detail. I might very well support all nine of them. I do \nnot believe they should be written into law.\n  The advantages of letting the board set these standards--it seems to \nme that there are three:\n  No. 1, the board is going to have more time and more expertise than \nwe have and is likely to do a better job.\n\n[[Page S7353]]\n\n  No. 2, if we make a mistake and we write it into law, it is hard to \nfix things that are written into law. As Alan Greenspan has said, if \nGlass-Steagall, Depression-era banking legislation, had been a \nregulation, it clearly would have been changed by the 1950s. We did not \nchange it until 1999. It took a long time to change it.\n  Finally, and probably of greatest importance, there is a natural \ntendency when we are talking about the problem in an era where we are \nall reading about Enron and WorldCom and the huge companies, to forget \nthis law will apply to 16,254 companies. Many of these companies are \nquite small. One of the advantages of allowing the accounting oversight \nboard to set out prohibitions on auditors performing other services in \nregulation, instead of prescribing them in law, is that the board can \nfind a system whereby they can recognize what is practical in dealing \nwith smaller companies and how that might differ from what is practical \nfor General Motors.\n  An example that has come to my mind is one where I am operating a \nsmall public company, stock traded on an exchange or on Nasdaq, and I \nemploy an accounting firm that has a CPA who basically does my \nauditing. He is in Houston. I am trying to hire a new bookkeeper in my \ncompany. I have three candidates. When my auditor is in town auditing \nmy books, I say: I have these three candidates. I majored in physics in \ncollege, and I don't know anything about accounting. Could you \ninterview these three bookkeepers and tell me who you think would be \nbest?\n  Under this bill, that would be illegal. That would be providing a \npersonnel service. It is prohibited for my auditor to provide that \nservice for me as well.\n  For General Motors, should your auditor be providing a personnel \nservice? My guess is they probably should not. But for this small \ncompany in College Station, Texas, what this prohibition ultimately \nwill do is force them to do one of three things: In all probability, \nthey will hire the bookkeeper without ever getting the advice of a CPA; \nNo. 2, they can hire another CPA to interview these three candidates \nfor a bookkeeper and pay them; No. 3, they can file for a waiver \nthrough the SEC and through the board. Each option is a worse choice \nfrom those available to such a small company today, and a worse choice \nfor its shareholders.\n  The bill allows a waiver on an individual company by company basis. I \nrejoice that is the case. I personally believe we should have given the \nboard, with the agreement of the SEC, the ability to grant blanket \nwaivers based on the circumstances of classes of individual companies.\n  For example, if you have already granted 1,000 waivers where \ncompanies have applied for a waiver for a certain requirement based on \ntheir size, their location, practicality, the cost, whatever, at that \npoint shouldn't the board be able to say: We have established this \nprinciple, and if your company meets these conditions, you are granted \nthe waiver? Then, all they have to do is prove they meet the \nconditions.\n\n  My concern--and who knows, maybe this will be true, maybe it will \nnot. The problem is we are legislating. We don't know. We can't look \ninto the future. My concern is that by not granting them the ability to \nprovide blanket waivers we are going to force a lot of smaller \ncompanies to hire lawyers and lobbyists to come to Washington to \npetition the SEC and the board. My concern is that this is going to use \nup their time and use up the resources of companies.\n  There is another side of this story and that is the concern that \nblanket waivers could be used to get around the intent of the law. How \ndo you deal with that? How do you find a happy balance? It is not an \neasy question. I would have to say I believe we have imposed a one-\nsize-fits-all regimentation that is going to be difficult to deal \nwith--not impossible to deal with, but I think it is going to be \ndifficult.\n  Another problem I have is that we have in this bill an accounting \noversight board. Its members are not elected officials. They are not \nappointed in the sense that they are not Government officials. They \nwill have the ability to make decisions that will affect the livelihood \nof Americans who are in the accounting profession. They will literally \nhave the ability to say to a CPA: We are taking your license away and \nyou can never practice again in providing accounting services to a \npublicly traded company.\n  Clearly, there are cases where that is justified. Clearly, there are \ncases where people ought to be fined and, clearly, there are cases \nwhere people ought to be put in prison. But I think when you are taking \npeople's livelihoods, they ought to have an opportunity to appeal to \nthe Federal district court where they live.\n  I think there ought to be a burden on them to make their case, and \nobviously the court is going to take into account that this board, that \nwas duly constituted, made a decision. But I think that is an \nopportunity that people ought to have that they do not have under this \nbill.\n  I am also concerned about litigation. During the whole Clinton \nadministration, there was only one bill where we overrode the \nPresident's veto, and that was a bill having to do with private \nsecurities litigation reform. We had a massive number of predatory \nstrike suits where people filed lawsuits against companies. They almost \nalways settled out of court. We had one law firm that filed the lion's \nshare of the lawsuits. And the chief lawyer in that company said, in \neffect, ``It is wonderful to practice law where you don't have \nclients.''\n  That was a mistake when he said that, but he said it.\n  We took action to try to eliminate or minimize this abuse. In doing \nso, we codified a 1991 Supreme Court decision that addressed what \nhappens if you think you have been wronged. We are not talking about \ncriminal activity. We are not talking about SEC enforcement. We are not \ntalking about the Justice Department. We are talking about civil \ndisputes that people have. Under that law, in codifying what the 1991 \nSupreme Court decision said, we said that within a year after you \nbelieve you have been wronged, you have to file your lawsuit, and \nwithin 3 years after the event happens, you have to file your lawsuit.\n  One of the things this bill does, which I oppose, is it raises that \nto 2 years and 5 years, respectively. I would say that if there were \nevidence that people were not getting these lawsuits filed because of a \nlack of time, that under the circumstances I think that increasing the \nstatute of limitations would have been justified. But as we have looked \nat the data, the mean average lawsuit is filed 11 days after the injury \nis discovered. Something like 90 percent of the lawsuits are filed in \nthe first 6 months. It seems to me that this provision and other \nprovisions of the bill that expand the ability of people to sue may \nhave a positive effect in making people pay attention to their \nbusiness, but we all know, based on our legal system, that it is going \nto be abused and that very heavy costs are going to be imposed on the \nprivate sector of the economy as litigation costs ultimately are added \nto the cost of the product that is produced and reduced from the stock \nvalue held by shareholders.\n\n  I could go on and on. There are other people who want to speak. We \nare under a time limit. But let me sum up.\n  I thought about this long and hard, and as I thought about this bill, \nI had to weigh, Does it do more good than harm? I have concluded that \nit does. It does less good than it could have done; it does more harm \nthan it should have done--we could have corrected these things--but, \nquite frankly, in the environment we were in it was impossible. In the \nenvironment we were in, where everything was judged on some concept of \nbeing tough rather than on practicality and workability, it was \nimpossible for us to come back and deal with these problems.\n  Finally, in the timeframe that we all faced in conference, we never \nreally got around to discussing the practical kinds of things that do \nnot seem important when you are writing law but seem very important 2 \nor 5 years later when you are implementing it.\n  Having said all that, I cannot stand up here and argue that this bill \nhas worsened the status quo. This bill is better than the status quo \nfor two reasons. No. 1, change needs to be made and criminal penalties \nneed to be raised. These independent boards need to be established, and \n90 percent of this bill, in my opinion, clearly represents a step in \nthe right direction.\n\n[[Page S7354]]\n\n  But, second--and this may sound like strange logic but I think it is \nimportant. I think to understand American government you have to \nunderstand it. The American people expect Congress to respond to a \nproblem. We may not know the answer. We may not have perfect knowledge. \nBut they expect us to try to do something about it. That in and of \nitself is an argument to which we should respond.\n  I would argue--being a conservative, as everyone engaged in this \ndebate knows--I would argue we need to be careful. But in the end this \nbill is an improvement on the status quo. It could have been better. \nThere are changes that could have been made that were not. But in the \nend, I cannot argue that this bill should not pass, should not become \nlaw. The President is going to sign the bill, and clearly he should.\n  I do believe we will have to come back after the fact and we will \nhave to correct some of these issues. I think as time goes on we will \nsee we may not have done enough in one area. Maybe we went overboard in \nanother area. But the Congress will meet again, people will be paid to \ndo this work, and I am confident that it will be done.\n  So let me conclude on this thought. I believe the marketplace has \ngone a long way toward solving this problem. I think the New York Stock \nExchange action was excellent. Once again, they are proving that they \nare a great institution. As I have often said about the New York Stock \nExchange, I feel as if I am standing on holy ground at the New York \nStock Exchange.\n  Every boardroom is different from what it was before this crisis \nstarted. No one sitting on a board, corporate board or an audit \ncommittee, will ever be the same. No auditors will ever look at their \ntask the way they did before all of this started, at least for a very \nlong time. or at least for a very long time.\n\n  One of the advantages of having structure is when they forget, the \nstructure won't forget. I totally agree with that. I think this \nrepresents a complement to it.\n  There is much in here I would have done differently. But in the end, \nI think this is a response that people can say the Government did hear, \nthe Government did care, and Congress did try to fix it. I don't doubt \nthat there are mistakes in here. I think I could name some, if asked \nto. But, on the whole, this is a response that was aimed at the \nproblem. People went about it in a reasonable manner.\n  Certainly, the authors of this bill intended to do as good a job as \nthey could do.\n  I again want to congratulate Senator Sarbanes. I also want to thank \nhim, looking back now at how quickly the conference went. I know people \nwere unhappy when we had this period when the floor was tied up, and \nthere were numerous amendments people wanted to add to the bill. But I \nthink, given how the whole thing played out, it worked out from that \npoint of view pretty much right.\n  If people on Wall Street are listening to the debate and trying to \nfigure out whether they should be concerned about this bill, I think \nthey can rightly feel that this bill could have been much worse. I \nthink if people had wanted to be irresponsible, this is a bill on which \nthey could have been irresponsible and almost anything would have \npassed on the floor of the Senate.\n  I think given where we are on this bill that it is a testament to the \nfact that our system works pretty well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am here today to speak in support of the conference report to the \naccounting reform bill. I will be encouraging all Senators to vote for \nthe conference report.\n  This is earthshaking legislation that has been done with tremendous \nspeed. It had to be earthshaking because we are trying to counteract \nthe tremors from the volcanic action of the mountaintop being blown off \nsuch companies as Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing, and others. Those \ncollapses have set up a series of tremors across this country.\n  Congress is not the one to solve all the problems. But as Senator \nGramm just mentioned, we are expected to work at solving all of the \nproblems. We have put in a huge effort on this bill, and it will make a \ndifference.\n  While we have been working, the stock market has been going through \nsome tremendous gyrations. I think some of those reactions in the stock \nmarket were to see how carefully we would consider and resolve this \nissue. I believe, the stock market was worried that we would overreact. \nThe market watched to see if Congress would keep adding and adding \nthings, until we destroyed the whole system. They can now see that did \nnot happen--Congress acted responsibly. We took a long and tough look \nat the problem and reacted, but we did not overreact. At the same time \ncorporations across the country have been making sure they did not have \nthe kinds of problems brought to light in a few of these companies.\n  ``Corporations'' should not be a bad word in this country. This \ncountry was built on business.\n\n  I always like to mention that it was primarily built on small \nbusiness--small businesses that grew up, in many cases, but \nnevertheless ideas that started out as a small business.\n  We have to keep our focus on those small businesses, and make sure \nthey are able to continue to operate in the climate that we have in the \nUnited States and under the laws that we pass.\n  I am pleased to say that the actions we took in this bill provide \nsome assurance to small businesses and small accounting firms that they \ncan continue to operate the way they have in the past.\n  We have given encouragement to the States not to run out and apply \nthe same types of laws. I hope the States are paying attention because \nthey will ruin a very good thing if they destroy small business. Keep \nthe eye on small business, and we will continue to have big business.\n  Corporations have been checking what has been going on in their firms \nto a greater extent than they have ever before. Boards, CEOs, CFOs, and \naudit committees have been checking to see if they have the kinds of \nproblems that brought down these other companies.\n  It is much like when there is a plane crash. Right after a plane \ncrash is probably the safest time in the world to fly because everybody \nchecks their equipment ever so much more carefully to make sure that \nthe kind of defects that may have caused other problems will not happen \nto them. And the effect lasts for a long time afterwards.\n  Corporations have been checking their books. They have begun changing \nprocedures. Some of the changes they have made have resulted in \nrestatements. They have paid a price for doing restatements. But they \nhave done the right thing by doing a restatement, and they should be \nrecognized for that. I mentioned speed before. The Senate is not \ndesigned for speed. We started out slow. We held 10 hearings. We looked \nat the issues very carefully, everybody resolved in writing their own \nideas.\n  One of the tough things about legislating is putting it down in \nwriting. The concepts are so easy, but the details are so tough.\n  There are a number of people who drafted bills on this--both in the \nHouse and in the Senate. On this side, Senator Gramm and I drafted a \nbill. Senator Corzine and Senator Dodd introduced a bill. Of course, \nSenator Sarbanes had the overreaching bill, and I believe his benefited \na little bit from having copies of both the House and Senate bills on \nwhich to build his bill. I compliment him for the way he took ideas \nfrom all of these different approaches.\n  Again, it shows the value of legislating by a wide variety of people. \nYou get a wide variety of viewpoints, which actually provides some \ninsights into areas that a person might not have thought about.\n  But, at any rate, we concluded the hearings, and we merged the bill. \nThis came to committee the week before the Fourth of July. It passed \nout of committee in one day. It came to the floor of this body just 2 \nweeks ago. And now, it has already been conferenced, and come back to \nus for final passage. Part of that is a result of the atmosphere we are \nin, and the need for action. Timing can be everything on a bill. But \npart of it is because of the concentration of people who worked on \nthis.\n\n[[Page S7355]]\n\n  This legislation is a response to problems highlighted by the recent \ncorporation failures of Enron, WorldCom, and others. It does send a \nclear signal to corporate America that executives can no longer abuse \nthe trust their shareholders place in them without severe consequences.\n\n  This legislation builds a strong and independent board to oversee the \naccounting industry. It will eliminate the climate of self-regulation \nthat has historically guided accounting.\n  However, I would like to make one point clear. I believe that, \noverall, accountants take their responsibilities very seriously. They \ndid before, and they do now. We have the best system in the world. What \nwe are doing with this is to maintain that we have the best system in \nthe world. Most accountants are honest and hard working. They work for \nthe benefit of the investors with probably the same percentage of \nexceptions as other professions.\n  This legislation will also provide for strong disciplinary action \nagainst executives who break the law. No longer will they be \ndisciplined with a slap on the wrist. The bill recognizes that \nexecutives who destroy the dreams of investors by irresponsible and \nunethical behavior will be given the severe punishment they deserve.\n  I also want to again thank Senator Sarbanes and Senator Gramm for \ntheir leadership on this issue. They both have worked tirelessly the \npast few months to get this bill finished in a timely manner. I \nparticularly appreciate some of the insights Senator Gramm gave me as \nhe worked on this bill in more detail than most people ever achieve. It \nis his standard, and he carried that out again this time, which did \nresolve a number of the problems. I want to congratulate Senator \nSarbanes, and thank him for the way he conducted the hearings. A lot of \npeople do not realize that the Chairman of a committee usually gets to \npick most of the witnesses, and the ranking member gets to pick a few \nof the witnesses.\n  As we went through these 10 hearings, I couldn't find any witnesses \nthat I wouldn't have picked were I given the selection. There were some \nvery qualified people who testified. Some of them were even \naccountants. I did appreciate that. I apologize for asking some \nquestions of them but it was such a great opportunity for me. My staff \nnoticed that when the camera focused in on the person giving the \nanswer, the wedge of people behind them were all asleep.\n\n  So what we dealt with is not the kind of thing that Americans get \nreally excited about. It is far too detailed for us to get too excited \nabout it. For accountants, these kinds of discussions are almost like \nwatching ESPN.\n  Senator Sarbanes did continue to meet with me and other Members and \ncontinued to make changes that improved the bill. There was a wide \nvariety of Senators who worked on this bill. I have mentioned Senators \nDodd and Corzine and Gramm. Senator Edwards worked with me on one \nprovision that is in this bill to make sure that not only accountants, \nanalysts, CEOs, CFOs, Boards and audit committees were addressed under \nthis bill, but lawyers have some responsibility, too.\n  I find it very exciting we are going to make lawyers have a code of \nethics when they are dealing with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, and that they are going to have an obligation to report \nthings when they find them. I know that causes some consternation among \nsome attorneys, but I think it will make, overall, the same kind of \nimprovements we are expecting from everybody else.\n  Senators Allen, Gregg, Baucus, Grassley, and Kennedy all worked on \nsome provisions that we don't talk about too much; again, it is in the \ndetail area, but it has to do with the blackout period when you are \ndealing with pension and other stock sales by executives. I know the \nintense hours it took to come up with a solution that would work. And \nif you have that many people agreeing on it, there is probably a good \nchance it will work.\n  Again, I congratulate all those people for their constraint in \nlimiting their ideas to what needed to be done for this bill. A lot of \nideas were floating around here on lots of things we can with \ncorporations and executives that people want to have fixed, but this \nbill did maintain some real constraint to stay on topic.\n  I do believe the conference report is an improved bill from the one \nthat passed the Senate. Again, I appreciate Senator Sarbanes working \nwith me to make some of the changes about which I spoke.\n  One change we made changes the implication that not all nonaudited \nservices should be presumed illegal. The bill has been changed to \nclearly allow the audit committee to make that determination without \nthe law implying that it is illegal.\n  In addition, he made some changes dealing with the testing of \ninternal compliance. I believe the new language more clearly represents \nthe true role of auditors. One of the problems we dealt with throughout \nthis process is educating Members on exactly what the role of an \nauditor is. I believe the new language represents that realization, and \nI thank the chairman for making the change.\n  There is another important change in the provision dealing with \ncorporate loans. The provision would still prohibit corporate \nexecutives from reaping millions of dollars in loans from their \ncompanies, but the new language also realizes that executives need to \nuse things such as credit cards to conduct their business. So this \nsection is a vast improvement.\n  Another item I would like to comment on is the understanding that \ninsurance companies, many times, have audits they must file with their \nState regulators. It would be burdensome and expensive to require these \ncompanies to hire a separate auditing firm to perform this \nresponsibility. That problem was also recognized, and the needed \nchanges were made.\n\n  However, I also understand that due to the time constraints, a report \nwill not be filed with the bill. I think this will pose a series of \nproblems because we will not be defining what the authors actually \nintended with certain sections of the bill and allowing the same \nwritten discourse that there would be on the bill. I think this may \nespecially cause problems with the extraordinary number of regulations \nthat are going to have to be written to implement the bill.\n  As the ranking member of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, I do intend to work closely with \nthe Commission to ensure that the new regulations are consistent with \nwhat I see as congressional intent. I will work with others to make \nsure these regulations conform.\n  I ask the ranking member, could I have an additional 3 minutes?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Sure.\n  Mr. President, I yield an additional 3 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, some of the issues that did not come up in this bill \ndealt with FASB. We did something marvelous for FASB. We made sure of \nits independence. One way we made sure of its independence, besides \nciting in the law, was to make sure FASB has independent funding. They \nwill not have to come to Congress with a budget. And they will not have \nto go to corporate America for funding. They will get independent \nfunding to be able to do the job they need to do. That will inhibit us \nfrom trying to change what they are doing in setting accounting \nstandards.\n  I am pleased to state that we have taken a look at the things they \nare working on right now. They are working on four issues that are \nextremely important to make sure what happened with other companies \nwill not happen again.\n  I have to tell you, in those four things they have listed as a \npriority, one of them is not stock options and what to do with them. \nThey do need to address that, but I certainly hope that Congress does \nnot decide that what we see as a problem does supersede other problems \nthat may have caused collapses such as Enron's.\n  So I hope we will not get in a position of dictating now to FASB what \nthey should be working on, and in what order, and to what degree, or, \nworse yet, just going ahead and passing accounting standards on our \nown.\n  With respect to section 302, the conference recognizes that results \npresented in financial statements often necessarily require \naccompanying disclosures in order to apprise investors of\n\n[[Page S7356]]\n\nthe company's true financial condition and results of operations. The \nsupplemental information contained in these additional disclosures \nincreases transparency for investors. Accordingly, the relevant \nofficers must certify that the financial statements together with the \ndisclosures contained in the periodic report, taken as a whole, are \nappropriate and fairly represent, in all material respects, the \noperations and financial condition of the issuer.\n  I also believe the conferees contemplate that the Board will have \ndiscretion to contract or outsource certain tasks to be undertaken \npursuant to this legislation and the regulations promulgated under the \nAct. The Board may outsource functions which can be done more \nefficiently by existing and established organization. An exercise of \ndiscretion in this manner does not absolve the Board of responsibility \nfor the proper execution of the contracted or outsourced tasks.\n  I also believe that the Conferees expect that the Board and the \nstandard setting body will deem investment companies registered under \nSection 8 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 to be a class of \nissuers for purposes of establishing the fees pursuant to this section, \nand that investment companies as a class will pay a fee rate that is \nconsistent with the reduced risk they pose to investors when compared \nto an individual company. Audits of investment companies are \nsubstantially less complex than audits of corporate entities. The \nfailure to treat investment companies as a separate class of issuers \nwould result in investment companies paying a disproportionate level of \nfees.\n  In addition, I believe we need to be clear with respect to the area \nof foreign issuers and their coverage under the bill's broad \ndefinitions. While foreign issuers can be listed and traded in the U.S. \nif they agree to conform to GAAP and New York Stock Exchange rules, the \nSEC historically has permitted the home country of the issuer to \nimplement corporate governance standards. Foreign issuers are not part \nof the current problems being seen in the U.S. capital markets, and I \ndo not believe it was the intent of the conferees to export U.S. \nstandards disregarding the sovereignty of other countries as well as \ntheir regulators.\n  I also realize inconsistencies appear in sections 302 and 906. The \nSEC is required to complete rulemaking within 30 days after the date of \nenactment with regard to CEO certification under section 302. However, \nsection 906 suggests that certification would be required upon \nenactment, thus the penalties would go into effect before the \ncertification requirement is completed through the rulemaking process. \nI believe it was the intent of the Conferees that the penalties under \nsection 906 should not become effective until the rulemaking process is \nfinalized.\n  Under the conference report, section 3(a) gives the SEC wide \nauthority to enact implementing regulations that are ``necessary or \nappropriate in the public interest.'' I believe it is the intent of the \nconferees to permit the Commission wide latitude in using their \nrulemaking authority to deal with technical matters such as the scope \nof the definitions and their applicability to foreign issuers. I would \nencourage the SEC to use its authority to make the act as workable as \npossible consistent with longstanding SEC interpretations.\n  Finally, I not only thank the Senators I have been able to work with \non this, but I also thank the staffs. I thank particularly Katherine \nMcGuire, my legislative director, and Mike Thompson, who handles my \nbanking issues. I also thank Kristi Sansonetti, who works on all of my \nlegal issues, and Ilyse Schuman, who played a very important role in \nthe blackout pension period.\n  I thank, on Senator Sarbanes's staff, Steve Harris, Marty Gruenberg, \nSteve Kroll, Dean Shahinian, Lynsey Graham, and Vince Meehan.\n  I thank, on Senator Gramm's staff, Wayne Abernathy, Linda Lord, who \nis probably one of the most knowledgeable lawyers in this area I have \never encountered, Michelle Jackson and Stacie Thomas.\n  And, on Senator Dodd's staff, I thank Alex Sternhell.\n  America will never know all the work these people have done on this \nbill, the hours they have spent on it, daytime and nighttime. I have \nseen them working in the early morning hours on this, and that is after \nspending the previous night working on it. They have just spent \nincredible time on this.\n  There is some incredible expertise among these people. Without their \nhelp, we would have never gotten to this point. So I thank all of them.\n  I thank the chairman and Senator Gramm and all the others who have \nhad a part in this. It is time we adopt this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, let me first say, I think Senator Enzi \nhas been extremely gracious in recognizing the extraordinary \ncontribution that has been made by the staff as we have formulated this \nlegislation. I appreciate him doing that. I certainly associate myself \nwith his remarks about the dedication and the perseverance and the \nextraordinarily high level of competence that is brought to this matter \nby staff on both sides of the aisle--committee staff and personal \nstaff.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am honored today to stand before the \nSenate to express my strong support and appreciation for the conference \nreport that I suspect, within an hour or so, we will adopt, and, \nhopefully, unanimously, as we did the original bill that came out of \nthe Senate.\n  I think it is historic. I think it is truly critical in bringing \nabout the kind of important reforms that will make a real difference to \nour financial system, not just today but I think as a standard it will \nbe very much an important part of the structure of our financial system \nfor decades to come.\n  I have said often, since we have talked about this legislation, that \nit really does, in my mind, fill a large gap that has been missing in \nour securities laws that were written 70 years ago. I think it very \nwell may be the most important step we will have taken in that interim \nperiod, to make sure we have a measured but strong securities and \nreporting structure in our Nation that makes for the depth and breadth \nand beauty and effectiveness of our financial markets.\n  This legislation, as has been noted, comprehensively deals with \nreform of our accounting profession, enhances corporate accountability, \nimproves transparency, moderates conflicts in a number of parts of our \nfinancial world, deals with the transparency of corporate financial \nstatements, strengthens the SEC, tightens penalties and more securely \nsets the law, and ultimately, I believe, will restore the trust, the \nneeded trust, and investor confidence in the integrity of America's \ncapital markets.\n  This was an absolutely necessary step at this time in our Nation's \nhistory. There has been an enormous betrayal of trust, demonstrated, \ncertainly, by the headlines and the litany of corporate abuses. Let me \nsay, it goes deeper than just the headlines. There have been 1,100 \ncorporate earnings restatements in the last 4 years. There is a basic \nloss of more than just the simple sense of trust that people get from \nthe headlines. It is hard for people to make investment decisions when \nthey don't have good facts, good numbers, and the ability to draw good \nconclusions about where the investor dollar should go.\n  It has led to a misallocation of capital. And there was a serious \nneed for people to have reform in this area because this betrayal \nreally went at the heart of why people were employees of various firms, \nwhy investors put their trust in investing in companies, and why the \nAmerican system, which so relies on trust, has been called into \nquestion with respect to the integrity of our financial markets in \nrecent days.\n  It is an extraordinary step. I am pleased to have been a part of it.\n  I see the chairman just left the Chamber. I want to take a few \nmoments to make sure he knows how strongly I feel about the leadership \nhe played. For those who were not a part of this measured process that \nChairman Sarbanes put forward--I have said this to him personally--the \n10 hearings we had were the moral equivalent of a graduate finance \nprogram. I\n\n[[Page S7357]]\n\nsuspect that very few times in congressional history have we seen the \nbreakdown in the detail and presentation of sophisticated information, \ncomplicated topics, presented with the security and integrity that were \npresented in our hearings that led to the creation of this legislation. \nHe did an incredible job of putting together a bill.\n  I get a little nervous when I hear people say this was a rush to \njustice, a rush to an answer. This was one of the most thoughtful and \nmeasured programs of review put in place before the legislation was \nwritten that absolutely could ever have been conceived. He deserves \nenormous credit for making sure we were thoughtful in the process.\n  Like Senator Enzi, I compliment all the staffs who were involved in \nthis. This was an incredible effort on all of their parts. From the \nbottom of my heart--and I am sure all those others who were involved in \nthis process--I truly appreciate the thoughtfulness and care they all \ngave to it.\n  I also would be remiss if I did not mention Senator Dodd for his \ngreat help in originally putting together our initiatives with regard \nto accounting reform, corporate oversight, and resourcing the SEC, \nwhich I think are fundamental parts of the legislation. We feel good \nabout that. I think Senator Dodd has taken an extraordinary step in \nleadership.\n  Once again, I say to the Senator from Wyoming, this is about making \nAmerica better. It is fundamentally about doing the right thing at the \nright time. His leadership on that, to make sure we stayed constrained, \nas he says, thoughtful, and measured about how we addressed the \nproblem, has been most appropriate, and I have appreciated the \nopportunity to work with him. I compliment him for that effort.\n\n  I would say the same about the Presiding Officer. The addition of a \nnumber of the amendments that have come, particularly with regard to \nbringing in the responsibility that is associated with lawyering in \nAmerica, as important as it is for accountants and CFOs and CEOs, I \nthink was an important step. There has been a lot of really great \neffort here.\n  Now that the chairman is back in the Chamber, I want to say again, \nthis is a classic example of quality leadership, of thoughtful \nleadership, and getting to a result that will make a difference in the \nlives of Americans in the years ahead.\n  This is a little more personal for me because for the 5 years before \nI came here, I was a CEO. Sometimes you want to hide from that moniker \nthese days since it is not so popular. I think these days about the \nwords of Andy Grove, who said that he was ashamed and embarrassed by \nsome of the actions and many of the actions that are associated with \nthe abuse we have seen. I stand with Andy Grove on that.\n  This is not one of our prouder moments in our financial system. But \nwhat does make me proud is that we could work together in a bipartisan \nway to come to a thoughtful, measured response that will make a \ndifference, that really will move our securities laws in a direction \nthat will give the American people confidence in how they read an \nincome statement, when they look at a balance sheet and when they judge \nwhere they want to work, that they will have the necessary information.\n  I am not going to go into detail on the bill. Senator Sarbanes and \nSenator Enzi did that. It is a great piece of legislation. I don't \nthink it went too far at all. In fact, I think it is about spot on. I \nam sure there will be things we will need to review in time, tweak \nwith, but this is a good set of initiatives which will make a \ndifference in America's financial system.\n  When we address these issues, it does beg to recognize that there are \nadditional tasks that need to be addressed. I heard the chairman talk \nabout it is not good enough to authorize; we have to appropriate the \nfunds to go with the necessary obligations we put on the SEC; we need \nto make sure our new advisory board actually has the resources. I think \nwe do. But their independence, their ability to function, will come \nbecause they have the resources. The same as the SEC; we have to do our \njob in the second part of this to make sure those resources are \navailable.\n  We do need to make sure the SEC Commissioners are in place so that we \ncan have a credible process of looking at enforcement and review of \nlaws and making sure that as we structure the SEC in the days going \nforward, we have the best of minds brought to bear there. I hope we can \nvote on these Commissioners very quickly.\n  For myself--I know there are differences of views about this--there \nare other unmet items on the agenda. Not necessarily do they apply to \nthis bill, but in my view we should, as a nation, deal with the stock \noptions issue. I don't think Congress should write the accounting \nrules, but I believe to recognize that stock options are an expense is \nrelatively self-evident to those who have operated in business. They \nare used as a substitute for compensation. Compensation is an expense. \nThat is why you see Chairman Greenspan and all of what I think is the \ncritical weight of those who have observed on this issue speaking out \nthat this is an issue that needs to be addressed. The Bermuda registry \nof companies, derivatives regulation are also issues.\n  Could I have 1 additional minute?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may continue.\n  Mr. CORZINE. We need to address these issues. There are missing gaps \nin other parts of our oversight of our securities markets and financial \nmarkets that need to be addressed.\n  Finally, I believe there is a gaping hole in our oversight of what \nour investors and employees and the public need to see addressed, and \nthat is pension reform. I know working their way through Congress right \nnow are a number of initiatives on it. Fewer than 50 percent of \nAmericans have pensions. We have a major need to address this. We \nshould pull it together in as thoughtful a way as Chairman Sarbanes has \nled our Senate to this conclusion, led this debate to a positive \nconclusion. I hope we will address that in the future. So, once again, \nI express my great gratitude to all those involved. I particularly \nthank Chairman Sarbanes for his strong leadership.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator from New Jersey \nfor his kind and gracious remarks about my efforts. I underscore the \nenormously valuable contribution that Senator Corzine made to the \ndevelopment not only of this legislation but all of the work that has \ncome before the committee. He brought a perspective and perception here \nthat were extremely important, enabling us to work through some \ndifficult issues. I appreciate that.\n  I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Vermont, chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. The Senator from \nCalifornia wishes 1 minute. I yield 1 minute to her.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I came to the floor to give my deepest \nthanks to Senator Sarbanes and Senator Leahy for leading us in just the \nway we needed to be led toward a tough, fair reform that would lead to \nconfidence in our financial system. I also thank Senator Enzi for his \nwork.\n  I was a stockbroker years ago, decades ago, and in those days the big \naccounting firms were known for their integrity, and CEOs were highly \nrespected. That check and balance was lost along the way and it must be \nrestored.\n  I believe this bill will do it and our people will, once again, have \ntrust and confidence in our financial system. They will know when they \nread an annual report and it is signed off on by an accounting firm \nthat it means what it says and says what it means. That will bring the \nstock market back into balance. It will not happen tomorrow. This isn't \nmagic legislation. But over time confidence will be restored and our \neconomy will be on solid footing once again. I thank my friends.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Sarbanes for his \nleadership on this impressive bill and on the conference agreement. The \nthen-Congressman Sarbanes was one of the first people I met when I came \nto Washington as an elected Member of this body. We have been friends \nfrom that time forward. I have been so pleased to work with him.\n  I am proud that the conference agreement includes and adopts the \nprovisions of the Leahy-McCain amendment,\n\n[[Page S7358]]\n\nwhich the Senate adopted by a 97-to-0 vote--again, with the strong help \nand support of the Senator from Maryland.\n  These provisions are nearly identical to the Corporate and Criminal \nFraud Accountability Act, which I introduced with Majority Leader \nDaschle and others in February. It was reported unanimously by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee in April.\n  The Presiding Officer helped get this through the Judiciary \nCommittee. The Leahy-McCain amendment provides new crimes with tough \ncriminal penalties to restore accountability and transparency in our \nmarkets. It accomplishes this in three ways: No. 1. It punishes \ncriminals who commit corporate fraud. No. 2. It preserves evidence that \ncan prove corporate fraud. No. 3. It protects victims of corporate \nfraud.\n  As a former prosecutor, I know nothing focuses one's attention on the \nquestion of morality like seeing steel bars closing on them for a \nnumber of years because of what they did.\n  The conference report includes a tough new crime of securities fraud \nwhich will cover any scheme or artifice to defraud investors. We added \nthe longer jail term of the other body.\n  There are three key provisions of the Senate-passed bill that were \nnot in the recently passed House bill but are now in the conference \nagreement. I think they are truly an essential part of a comprehensive \nreform measure. First, we extend the statute of limitations in \nsecurities fraud cases. In many of the State pension funds cases, the \ncurrent short statute has barred fraud victims from seeking recovery \nfor Enron's misdeeds in 1997 and 1998. For example, Washington State's \npolicemen, firefighters, and teachers were blocked from recovery of \nnearly $50 million in Enron investments by the short statute of \nlimitations. That is why the last two SEC Chairmen--one a Republican \nand the other a Democrat--endorsed a longer short statute of \nlimitations to provide victims with a fair chance to recoup their \nlosses.\n  Secondly, we include meaningful protections for corporate \nwhistleblowers, as passed by the Senate. We learned from Sherron \nWatkins of Enron that these corporate insiders are the key witnesses \nthat need to be encouraged to report fraud and help prove it in court. \nEnron wanted to silence her as a whistleblower because Texas law would \nallow them to do it. Look what they were doing on this chart. There is \nno way we could have known about this without that kind of a \nwhistleblower. Look at this. They had all these hidden corporations--\nJedi, Kenobi, Chewco, Big Doe--I guess they must have had ``little \ndoe''--Yosemite, Cactus, Ponderosa, Raptor, Braveheart. I think they \nwere probably watching too many old reruns when they put this together. \nThe fact is, they were hiding hundreds of millions of dollars of \nstockholders' money in their pension funds. The provisions Senator \nGrassley and I worked out in Judiciary Committee make sure \nwhistleblowers are protected.\n  Third, we include new anti-shredding crimes and the requirement that \ncorporate audit documents be preserved for 5 years with a 10 year \nmaximum penalty for willful violations. Prosecutors cannot prove their \ncases without evidence. As the Andersen case showed, instead of just \nincorporating the loopholes from existing crimes and raising the \npenalties, we need tough new provisions that will make sure key \ndocuments do not get shredded in the first place.\n  It only takes a minute to warm up the shredder, but it can take years \nfor prosecutors and victims to prove a case.\n  The conference report also maintains almost identical provisions to \nthose authored by Senator Biden and approved unanimously by the Senate. \nThese include enhanced criminal penalties for pension fraud, mail \nfraud, wire fraud, and a new crime for certifying false financial \nreports. As chairman of the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Crime and \nDrugs, Senator Biden deserves praise for his leadership of these \nissues.\n  It is time for action--decisive and comprehensive reforms that will \nrestore confidence and accountability in our public markets for the \nmillions of Americans whose economic security is threatened by \ncorporate greed.\n  We cannot stop greed, but we can keep greed from succeeding.\n  We have seized this moment to make a good beginning to fashion \nprotections for corporate fraud victims, preserve evidence of corporate \ncrimes and hold corporate wrongdoers accountable. We have much to do to \nhelp repair the breaches of trust that have so shattered confidence in \nour markets and market information. We have made a good start today \ntoward restoring that confidence but more will be needed. In addition \nwe will need swift and strong enforcement actions and good faith \nadministration of the reform set forth in our conference report. Our \nconference is concluding but our work is just beginning.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. I \nunderscore again how important his contributions were. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee reported out a bill without opposition in the \ncommittee. That is something which accompanied this legislation.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from South Dakota, and then it is my \nintention to go to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, most of all I thank him for his \nextraordinary leadership on the development of this landmark \nlegislation. I think it is fair to say this is the most critically \nimportant piece of investor protection legislation since the Securities \nAct of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n  This comes on the heels of the disclosure of corporate corruption \nthat has been endemic in recent months, where we have witnessed lost \njobs, lost savings, lost pensions, and ultimately lost confidence \nworldwide in America's capital markets.\n  There is an urgency that strong legislation be passed by this body \nand the Congress to restore confidence--restore both the perception and \nthe reality of integrity in our capital markets.\n  This legislation is strong legislation. That is why it has been \napplauded by editorial writers from the east coast to the west coast. \nSenator Sarbanes has been the subject of much congratulatory \nobservation on the part of so many. This comes on the heels of, \nfrankly, much weaker legislation that had been passed previously in the \nHouse of Representatives, the other body.\n  By passing a strong Senate bill, we were able to go to conference. I \nam proud to have served on that conference committee and to craft \nlegislation there that goes in the direction of the Senate rather than \nin the direction of the other body and gives this Nation strong \nsecurities legislation. It provides a stiff penalty for corporate \nwrongdoing, creates a strong oversight board to ensure that corporate \naudits are done properly, and that the books, in fact, are not cooked. \nIt imposes tough new corporate responsibility standards and implements \ncontrol over stock analysts' conflicts of interest, so they are not \nmaking a fortune while advising their clients to invest. It requires \npublic companies to quickly and accurately disclose financial \ninformation. It ensures that the Securities and Exchange Commission has \nthe resources to accomplish its mission of regulating the securities \nmarkets.\n  These important provisions will ensure that America's financial \nmarkets remain efficient and transparent and the envy of the world. It \nwill benefit average people who may not have had enough information to \nmake informed decisions in the past and certainly could not have \npossibly known that the books were cooked, that the audits were \nincorrect, and that corruption was running rife. They had no way of \nknowing that.\n  This will turn that around. This is not the last word, but this is a \ncritically important step in the right direction to returning integrity \nto our markets. We can observe, having come through this horrible \nexperience in recent months of disclosure after disclosure of \ncorruption having taken place, a recognition that free market economies \ncan only work when there is a cop on the beat. Free market economies \ncan only work when there are fair, well-enforced, and strictly enforced \nrules. A free market economy without rules, without a cop on the beat, \nis not an economy that will ever work at all.\n  This goes a long way, I believe, to reviving confidence in America's \neconomic future. It goes a long way to restoring the fairness and \ntransparency\n\n[[Page S7359]]\n\nso that people may make their investments--and investments may go up, \nand they may go down, but they can know when they make those \ninvestments, they are making those investments based on true and \naccurate analysis and not on bogus numbers that some audit firm on the \ntake has been willing to put forward as the truth when, in fact, they \nare not the truth.\n  Again, the whole Nation owes a great deal of gratitude to Chairman \nSarbanes and to the Senate, in this case, for what I am confident is \ngoing to be an overwhelming vote in favor of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I thank, along with all my colleagues, \nSenator Sarbanes for the extraordinary work he has done on this bill. \nWe are proud of him. America appreciates very much what he and others \nwho have worked with him have done.\n  I also thank Senator Enzi, who is in the Chamber, and Senator \nCorzine, who is presiding, for the work they have done with me on what \nI think is an important part of this legislation which, in addition to \ncorporate CEOs and accountants, is holding the lawyers involved in \nthese transactions responsible and accountable; that if they see \nsomething wrong occurring, they should do something about it--report it \nto their client, to the corporation, report it to the CEO, the chief \nlegal officer and, if necessary, report it to the board.\n  In Congress, we are doing what needs to be done and stepping to the \nplate with regard to corporate responsibility. That is in striking \ncontrast to what is going on in my home State right now.\n  At a time when Americans are demanding more corporate responsibility, \nwhen Congress is stepping up and doing what needs to be done, the \nPresident has gone to North Carolina today to ask for less corporate \nresponsibility, to make it easier on insurance companies and to make it \nharder on victims.\n  The President is in North Carolina today proposing some of the \nsmallest limits that have ever been proposed for families who have \nsuffered tragedies, serious problems, as a result of poor medical care \nat a time when medical malpractice insurance premiums constitute way \nless than 1 percent, substantially less than 1 percent, of medical care \ncosts in this country.\n  The President is holding a roundtable, as I speak, on this subject. I \nwould like to see how many victims of medical negligence, of medical \nmalpractice, people who have been devastated and their lives \ndevastated, are participating in this roundtable. I know these people. \nFor many years I have represented them. I have been in their homes. I \nhave been in homes and spent time with families whose child will never \nwalk, who have been blinded for life, who have been crippled for life, \nwho have suffered injuries from which they will never recover.\n  These children blinded for life, crippled for life, severely injured \nfor life--there is a description in the HHS report on which the \nPresident is relying which talks about when juries find they have been \nhurt and award money to them, they describe it as ``winning the lottery \nticket.'' The parents of a child who has been blinded for life, the \nparents of a child who will never walk, rest assured they do not \nbelieve they have the winning lottery ticket.\n  My question is: How many of those people are the President talking to \nwhen he is in North Carolina today? The next time he comes back to \nNorth Carolina, we invite him to talk to some of those people because \nthose are the ordinary Americans to whom he should be talking. Those \nare the people who are going to be impacted. The children who have \nsuffered serious injuries are the ones who are going to have the \ngreatest impact and have their rights taken away by what the President \nis proposing.\n  Unfortunately, listening to ordinary people is not what this \nadministration does. They have done it time and time again. It is \nstunning, but it is sad and consistent. When this administration has a \nchoice between protecting the rights of big companies, big insurance \ncompanies versus the rights of ordinary people, they choose the big \ninsurance company, the big companies every single time. They have been \ndragged kicking and screaming to do something about corporate \nresponsibility, which we are doing in the Congress.\n  On the Patients' Bill of Rights, on which Senator Kennedy, Senator \nMcCain, and I have worked so hard, they have consistently sided with \nthe big HMOs, which is why we do not have a Patients' Bill of Rights in \nthis country.\n  On prescription drugs, when we tried to do something about the cost \nof prescription drugs on the floor of the Senate, this administration \nconsistently sided with the big drug companies. When it comes to the \nenvironment, this administration has weakened clean air laws that \nprotect the air for our children and consistently sided with the big \nenergy companies that are polluting our air.\n  Today the President adds to that list, in going to the State of North \nCarolina, the big insurance companies. This President loves to talk \nabout compassion. My question to him is: Where is his compassion for \nthe victims?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the accounting \nreform and corporate responsibility conference agreement. I do so, \nbecause I believe very strongly that it is in the best interests of \nAmerica at this critical time in our history.\n  I believe it goes way beyond mere accounting issues. What we are \nagreeing to today deals with the financial security of millions of \nindividual investors across this country, the security of their \npensions, their 401(k) programs, and their other investments for the \nfuture of their children and their grandchildren.\n  What we are talking about today involves the very vitality of our \neconomy, the amount of investment that will take place in the economy, \nthe number of jobs that will be created, and the vitality of farms. It \ninvolves the standing of America in the international economy, whether \nwe will continue to be a safe haven for investments from those abroad, \nattracting the capital that helps us build a strong foundation for \nAmerica's economy.\n  More than anything else, this bill embodies the basic values upon \nwhich this has been based. It clearly answers the question: Will we \ncontinue to encourage those virtues that have always characterized \nAmerica and will our Nation continue to be the land of opportunity \nbased upon hard work, honesty, and playing by the rules or, will we be \nperceived as the land of opportunity based upon deceit. I believe that \nthe right answer, based upon traditional values and virtues, is \nembodied in the accounting reform and corporate responsibility bill.\n  I congratulate our colleagues, Senators Sarbanes, Dodd, Corzine and \nEnzi. They demonstrated leadership and foresight in this issue.\n  Since the tragedies of 9/11, our country has been involved in twin \nstruggles: One, the physical national security of this country; and, \nsecond, getting this economy moving again to ensure the economic \nsecurity of Americans across this country. There are parallels between \nthese two challenges. Both occurred as a result of unexpected tragedies \nbut have presented us with opportunities to make this an even better, \nstronger, more secure Nation. Both involve breaking the political \ngridlock and the bureaucratic inertia that all too often make progress \nin this Capitol difficult. And both involve striking the right balance \nbetween individual freedom and liberty on the one hand, that we \ncherish, and collective security, which makes individual liberty \nmeaningful, on the other.\n  Let me conclude where I began. This issue goes a long way beyond mere \naccounting issues. It goes a long way beyond economic policy. It goes \nto the very heart of who we are, what we stand for as a people, and the \nkind of values we cherish in the United States of America. This will \nprotect individual investors. It will help to ensure the integrity of \nour economy. But more than anything else, it will ensure that those \nAmericans who have embraced our tradition with virtues, who have worked \nhard and saved their money, who have played by the rules, and are \nhonest are able to get ahead in this society.\n\n[[Page S7360]]\n\n  It will send a loud and clear signal to those who practice corporate \nfraud that they do not have an avenue to success in this country. That \ndoes not embody the best values of America. I strongly support the \naccounting reform and corporate responsibility conference agreement. I \nurge my colleagues to enact this important legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Sarbanes-Oxley Act \nof 2002 because it will help end the corporate abuses that in recent \nmonths have plagued our economy and will help restore confidence in our \neconomy. I would like to take this opportunity to express my \nappreciation for the efforts that Senator Paul Sarbanes, Chairman of \nthe Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, has made to \ndevelop and enact this important legislation. As a former member of the \nBanking Committee, I know how difficult it is to respond quickly to \nrecent events that affected our capital markets. However, Senator \nSarbanes has put together a coalition which led to a unanimous vote in \nsupport of his bill in the Senate, and the provisions of which is the \nbase text for this conference report.\n  The United States must stand for the fairest, most transparent and \nefficient financial markets in the world. However, the trust and \nconfidence of the American people in their financial markets have been \ndangerously eroded by the emergence of serious accounting \nirregularities by some companies and possible fraudulent actions by \ncompanies like WorldCom, Inc., Enron, Arthur Andersen and others. Some \ninvestment banks have been charged with publicly recommending stocks \nfor public purchase that their own analysts regarded as junk.\n  The shocking malfeasance by these businesses and accounting firms has \nput a strain on the growth of our economy. The misconduct by a few \nsenior executives has cost the jobs of hard-working Americans, \nincluding 17,000 at WorldCom and thousands more at companies accused of \nsimilar wrongdoing. The lack of faith in our financial markets \ncontributed to an overall decline in stock values and has caused grave \nlosses to individual investors and pension funds. For example, the \nlosses to the California Public Employees Retirement System from the \nrecent WorldCom disclosures total more than $580 million.\n  The conference report creates a new Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board to oversee the auditing of companies that are subject \nto the federal securities laws. The Board will establish auditing, \nquality control, and ethical standards for accounting firms. The \nconference report restricts accounting firms from providing a number of \nnon-audit services to its audit clients to preserve the firm's \nindependence. It also requires accounting firms to change the lead or \ncoordinating partners for a company every five years.\n  The conference report requires CEOs to certify their financial \nstatements or face up to 20 years in prison for falsifying information \non reports. It keeps executives from obtaining corporate loans that are \nnot available to outsiders. It requires public companies to provide \nperiodic reports to the SEC on off-balance transactions, arrangements, \nobligations and other relationships that may have a material current or \nfuture effect on the company's financial condition. It requires \ndirectors, officers and 10 percent equity holders to report their \npurchases and sales of company securities within two days of the \ntransaction.\n  I am pleased that the conference report includes the Corporate Fraud \nand Criminal Fraud Accountability Act which will provide for criminal \nprosecution and enhanced penalties of persons who defraud investors in \npublicly traded securities or alter or destroy evidence in Federal \ninvestigations. It will also prohibit debts incurred in violation of \nsecurities fraud laws from being discharged in bankruptcy and protect \nwhistle blowers who report fraud against retaliation by their \nemployers.\n  The conference report requires the SEC to adopt rules to foster \ngreater public confidence in securities research including: protecting \nthe objectivity and independence of stock analysts who publish research \nintended for the public by prohibiting the pre-publication clearance of \nsuch research or recommendations by investment banking or other staff \nnot directly responsible for investment research; disclosing whether \nthe public company being analyzed has been a client of the analyst's \nfirm and what services the firm provided; limiting the supervision of \nresearch analysts to officials not engaged in investment banking \nactivities; protecting securities analysts from retaliation by \ninvestment banking staff.\n  The provisions included in this legislation will help restore \nconfidence in our capital markets and in turn will help provide for \nfuture economic growth. It is an important first step, not a last. Mr. \nPresident, I am pleased to support the Conference Report and will \ncontinue to look for ways to improve investor confidence in our \nfinancial markets.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, everyone knows that New York City is the \nfinancial capital of the world. Yet as we continue to rebuild our city \nin light of the tragic events of September 11, we are now faced with \nthe devastating effects of depressed markets and unsure investors, who \nare once again victims. With more than half of American households \ninvesting in the markets, we're all affected by a crisis in investor \nconfidence.\n  I can't think of a more appropriate time than the present for the \nSenate to debate legislation to restore dwindling investor confidence \nand bring sound footing back to our financial markets. Isn't it ironic? \nJust a few weeks ago, the headlines read ``Sarbanes bill dead'' or \n``Accounting Reform Fading.''\n  In the wake of recent revelations about WorldCom and just 2 days ago \nMerck, corporate corruption has reached an all-time high; we are now at \na new level of corporate corruption. We've reached a new low and the \nquestion every member of the Senate must be asking is: ``Where does it \nend?''\n  Buzzwords like ``accounting fraud,'' ``corporate corruption,'' \n``Restatements,'' ``Cooking the books,'' are being bandied about in the \npress, in the coffee shops, at the dinner tables across America. Just \nthis weekend at the Taste of Buffalo, people came up to me and said \n``Throw `em in jail, Chuck!'' They were talking about the Ken Lay's, \nBernard Ebers', the Andrew Fasdow's of the corporate world. White \ncollar criminals who ran giant corporations and used tricky gimmicks to \nrob investors of not only their hard money but also their confidence in \nthe strongest and fairest markets in the world. * * * They are the \ninvestment giants: Enron, Arthur Andersen, Adelphia, CMS Energy, \nReliant Resources, Dynergy, Tyco International, and now Xerox and \nWorldCom. A mere handful of our nations top companies who have gone \nunder as a result of misrepresented earnings and poor management. In \nless than a years time, these so-called investment giants through the \ngreat gift of deceit and tricky accounting practices have reduced \nthemselves to mere shells of their former existence.\n  As a result, their use of tricky gimmicks to hide the real picture \nand literally milk the system dry have caused investors around the \nglobe to question integrity of our nations markets, which are supposed \nto be the strongest and most resilient because they are perceived as \nthe most open, most transparent markets in the world. Up until now, the \nUnited States had been a magnet for foreign investment. Yet, the \nselfish, greedy actions of a small few have led to a steady and \nprecipitous drop in foreign investment in our financial markets.\n  It is no secret that greed played a major role in our markets rapid \ndecline and slow demise. The heads of these entities stole millions, \nsome billions of dollars from investors, and it is now time that we \nmake them pay for their actions.\n  I commend the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange for their \nannouncements of new, tough corporate governance standards. The New \nYork markets have taken the first steps to correct corporate \ncorruption, and now it is our turn to find the right balance in light \nof these unsteady markets and times.\n  So what is the right balance? The right balance is one that will not \nonly offer strict corporate governance laws, protect the average \ninvestor from being swindled out of his or her hard earned savings by a \nfast-talking, wheeling and dealing broker, but will\n\n[[Page S7361]]\n\nalso severely punish those individuals who intentionally mislead \ninvestors with faulty practices. That is why I am introducing the \nfollowing amendments to the Public Company Accounting Reform and \nInvestor Protection Act of 2002 to further limit the ability of company \nexecs from personally manipulating and rigging the system for their \npersonal benefit and interest.\n  The first amendment prohibits companies from issuing personal loans \nto company executives as seen with Worldcom, whose CEO received more \nthan $300,000 in loans from the technology giant. Instead, CEOs will \nhave to go to the bank, just like everyone else, to acquire a loan; \nwhich, will reduce the risk of CEOs ability to use company funds for \npersonal purposes.\n  The second amendment requires company execs to forfeit any and all \nbonuses and additional compensation if their restatements occur along \nwith criminal liability.\n  It is my hope that by revealing the few bad apples at the bottom of \nthe barrel, and punishing these individuals for their immoral behavior, \nwe can save the rest of the industry and restore confidence in our \nmarkets.\n  The legislation pending before us will make it harder for companies \nto lie about their assets. Thats the least we can do in re-establishing \npublic confidence in corporate America. Our common purpose today is to \nensure that the Enron's, the Tyco's, and the WorldCom's never happen \nagain.\n  Now is the time for us to act. It is the least we can do to shore up \nthe investing public's confidence in our markets.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, 2 years ago it was pretty lonely being \nin favor of the auditor independence reforms that then-SEC Chairman \nArthur Levitt said were necessary to guard against unprecedented \naccounting scandals. I am proud that I was one of the few who thought \nChairman Levitt was going in the right direction. Unfortunately it took \nthe implosion of several multi-billion dollar firms, and a loss of tens \nof thousands of jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars in investor \nequity, to prove that he was right. Now America's capital markets have \nbeen shaken by a dramatic loss in investor confidence, threatening the \neconomic recovery.\n  But today, Congress has acted. I rise today in strong support of the \nPublic Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act conference \nreport. I commend the Senator from Maryland, the Chairman of the \nBanking Committee for putting together significant, structural reform \nof corporate governance and auditor independence and for defending it \nin conference.\n  And I am heartened that the President and the House leadership have \nfinally agreed to comprehensive reform instead of mere half-measures \nand tough rhetoric.\n  This bill holds the bad actors accountable for their fraud and \ndeception. But the legislation goes much further, as it should, because \nthe problem goes much deeper. We are faced with more than the wrong \ndoing of individual executives, we are faced with a crisis in \nconfidence in American capital markets and American business.\n  This conference report retains the strong Senate reforms virtually \nintact. It bars an auditor from offering audit services and other \nconsulting services to the same client. It says publically traded \ncompanies must change the partner in charge of the audit every five \nyears. It strengthens oversight of accountants, by establishing an \nindependent board to set and enforce standards. And it enhances \ndisclosure. This alone is real reform. But the bill does more. It makes \ncorporate executives more accountable to their shareholders. It makes \ninvestment analysts more accountable to the public. And it's bill \ncontains strong penalties for corporate wrong-doers.\n  All and all, this legislation lets the sunshine back into the smoke-\nfilled corporate board rooms so that insiders have harder time cheating \nthe outsiders. It is structural reform that restores checks and \nbalances that will protect against fraud, deception, and reckless \ncarelessness.\n  We need to restore America's faith in corporate America. It has gone \nbeyond individual wrong doing. The system hides and encourages \ncorruption. Today the Congress passes strong reform. Now I call on the \nPresident to make enactment and enforcement of this new law a priority.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, last night, the conference committee \nreleased its final report on comprehensive accounting reform and \ncorporate governance legislation. The reaction of our financial markets \nconfirms that this legislation is absolutely necessary to help restore \nintegrity and confidence to our free market system and our investment \ncommunity.\n  However, in our rush to enact broad reforms, we may be damaging the \neconomic framework for small companies to reach our capital markets. In \nthe long term, the reforms will make our economy stronger. In the short \nterm, we will be creating complete chaos for small publicly traded \ncompanies and companies trying to gain the capital for growth through \nstock offerings.\n  I am extremely disappointed in the conferees' decision not to \nrecognize this fact and provide the Securities and Exchange Commission \nand the proposed Public Company Accounting Oversight Board with greater \nflexibility in dealing with small firms. Small business has been the \ndriving force of our economy for well over a decade. The high hurdles \nin the legislation are necessary for large, conglomerate companies but \nthey may be a trip wire for our small business entrepreneurial \ncommunity.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I note that the Congress, in the \nEnhanced Review of Periodic Disclosures section in the Sarbanes-Oxley \nAct, provides for regular and systematic reviews by the Securities and \nExchange Commission of the periodic reports filed by public companies \nthat are listed on a national securities exchange or on Nasdaq. The \nsection requires that there be some review of issuers' disclosures at \nleast once every three years. The bill identifies factors which the \nCommission should consider in scheduling reviews, including the \nissuer's capitalization, stock price volatility and restatements of \nearnings. We expect the Commission to exercise its discretion to \ndetermine the appropriate level and scope of review for each company's \nreports in the furtherance of the protection of investors and the \npublic interest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, may I ask what the time situation is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 15 minutes 10 \nseconds. The Senator from Wyoming has 21 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is an extremely important day for our capital \nmarkets, for our country, and for the future of our economy. As we all \nknow, capitalism has its ups and downs and works in ups and downs, and \nthere have been periods throughout our history--I can think of the S \ncrisis a decade ago--where things get off track, out of control. It is \nour job as Government not to interfere with entrepreneurial vigor, not \nto create such regulation that they become a straitjacketed company, \nbut at the time when the markets show that things have gotten off \ntrack, it is our job to help put them back on track.\n  There is a bottom line principle here: If investors, whether \nthroughout the United States or the rest of the world, do not believe \ncompanies are on the level, they will not invest. Unfortunately, the \nrevelations of the last year have given people the view that they are \nnot on the level. That it is not the same for them in terms of even \ninformation as it is for somebody at the top, that the information they \nmay be getting may be wrong or distorted far beyond what they normally \nwould in the world. So this bill puts that back.\n\n  I think it is a carefully balanced bill. There are some changes in \nit. There are some changes not in it that I would like to have seen, \nbut the perfect should not be the enemy of the good. It is a good bill, \na fine bill. In fact, when the agreement was reached, the Dow Jones \nwent up 400 points. I do not think it was coincidental. Whether it be \nCEOs of large companies or individual investors, the public is saying \nto us, make it right. Look at the abuses that occurred in the past and \nmake sure they cannot occur again, and do it\n\n[[Page S7362]]\n\nin a careful way that keeps our markets fluid, liquid, deep, and \nimportant. I think this bill does it.\n  I want to pay a great deal of tribute to our chairman, Senator \nSarbanes, and to so many others who made this bill a reality. With the \npassage of this bill, we can tell investors, while we have not cleared \nup every problem, and perhaps we will come back and address this \nlater--I think we will have to in a couple areas--we have certainly \nmade things better.\n  A few weeks ago, Washington looked as if it was dithering in the face \nof crisis, but today we proudly act in a bipartisan way to restore \nfaith in our markets, the deepest, strongest, and best markets in the \nworld.\n  I dare say, I know there are some who are against any change or any \nregulation, but our markets will be stronger tomorrow than they were \nthis morning when this bill passes the House, the Senate, and is signed \nby the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, we are down quite far in our time. \nSenator Dodd, who wishes to speak, is at a memorial service. I suggest \nif the other side could use some of its time, it would be helpful in \nbalancing this out. I ask unanimous consent that while we are trying to \nwork this out the time not be charged to either party, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, when we opened the conference on this \nlegislation a week or so ago, I said my hope was the passage of this \nbill would be quick, decisive, and unanimous. Two out of three is not \nbad. We got quick and decisive and almost unanimous. Our colleague from \nTexas, and our friend, was unable to support the final product for \nreasons he has already explained.\n  I thought we did an excellent job in moving as quickly as we did. I \nbelieve passage of the legislation and the quick and decisive manner \nand nearly unanimous way we achieved the result and overwhelming \nsupport of the Senate and the House fulfill a responsibility of \nCongress to protect investors. There is more work to be done, but we \nhave begun a significant part of the journey. In fact, we traveled a \ngreat distance down the road in fulfilling a congressional \nresponsibility in responding to the events that began to unfold, at \nleast to the public's awareness, last October. And the story is not yet \ncomplete. We do not know the final results.\n  I have a few minutes in which to share some thoughts. I am going to \nmove quickly to share comments. I begin by commending my colleague from \nMaryland, the chairman of the Banking Committee, for the tremendous job \nhe has done. I said yesterday, any students of the Congress of the \nUnited States who want to seek out good examples of how a legislative \nproduct can be developed, nurtured, analyzed, discussed, debated, and \nfinally passed, this is about as good an example as I have seen in \nrecent years of how one ought to proceed. Certainly the hearings we \nheld in the Banking Committee I don't recall attracting much attention. \nI don't recall a single one of the 12 hearings we held appearing on the \nnightly news or being lead stories on some of the 24-hour news \nstations.\n  I recall a great many hearings where people sat there, raised their \nright hand, and took the fifth amendment. That got a lot of attention. \nThe 12 hearings held in the Banking Committee of the Senate, where we \nwent through the deliberate, slow, ponderous process of actually \nlistening to people who had something to say about what ought to be \ndone to clean up this mess, never made it on the nightly news that I am \naware of.\n  I commend again my friend and colleague with whom I have enjoyed my \nservice in the Congress of the United States for more than a quarter of \na century. We have sat next to each other for a good part of that time \nin both the House and in this Chamber. I sit next to him on the Foreign \nAffairs Committee and on the Banking Committee. If I could make the \nchoice and it would not be determined by seniority, I would make him my \nchoice for seatmate. I have great respect for him and admire him \nimmensely. He has proven the value of having Paul Sarbanes as a Member \nof this body.\n  I also point out the Presiding Officer, one of the most junior \nMembers of this Chamber, who provided an incredible, invaluable support \nand source of ideas, guidance. Rarely does a new Member play such an \nimportant role on such an important piece of legislation. Of any Member \nwho was involved in this process, Mike Enzi of Wyoming and others all \nwould agree, in any history written of the development of the bill, the \nrole of a freshman Senator from the State of New Jersey named Jon \nCorzine needs to be talked about. He played a very important role. We \nwould not be here without him. I tip my hat to him and to Mike Enzi, \nthe only Member of this Chamber who actually knew something at a \npractical level about what it was to be an accountant and what life was \nlike in the trenches.\n\n  For the staff and others who worked on this legislation, this was not \nthe most popular idea in the world. Had it not been for unfolding \nevents, I am not sure we would have developed that kind of support. I \nwill love to one day tell my daughter, who is only an infant, that it \nwas the power of our persuasion which convinced a majority here to go \nalong.\n  Not many understood the value, the substantive value, of this bill. \nMike Enzi did, a number of others did, there were many in the House who \ndid, but an awful lot of people, even as late as a week ago, were \nsuggesting maybe this bill was a bad idea, and that it would not go \nanywhere, and it shouldn't go anywhere; we ought to spend another \ncouple of months thinking about it.\n  Those notices were not a month old, or 2 months old; that was 5 or 6 \nday ago. I understand it was the public's demand that we respond to \nthis that had an awful lot to do with the support we garnered. That is \nall right. I never argue about how you get support around here as long \nas you get it in the end. We got it in the end, and that is the \nimportant news.\n  The fact is, we are about to vote overwhelmingly to support a very \ncritical piece of legislation. I am confident, as he has already \nindicated, that the President will sign this bill into law. We are \nalready seeing markets respond, not entirely because of this, but \ncertainly in no small measure because of the events that have unfolded \nand the parts Congress played.\n  The chairman of the committee has talked about part of the bill. \nThere are very important pieces, including the auditor independence. \nThe board will be revolutionary in how it operates. Someone pointed out \ntoday, a lot of what the regulators do will determine the value of what \nwe have written legislatively. I am confident that will be the case.\n  Having FASB now be compensated for and paid for from public money and \nnot relying on the largess and generosity of the accounting industry to \nreceive compensation will make a significant difference in establishing \naccounting rules and procedures. Certainly having prohibitions against \nthose going from the industry, working for the clients for whom they \nhave done audits, will have a beneficial effect on slowing down this \nnot only appearance of conflict, but certainly the conflicts of \ninterest that have occurred too often.\n  There are many other parts of the bill, including corporate \npenalties, that were crafted by our colleague from Vermont and other \nMembers of the Judiciary Committee, that deserve a great deal of credit \nfor their contribution to this process. The leadership,\n\n[[Page S7363]]\n\nSenator Daschle, certainly for insisting we move as rapidly as we did \nto get the product done in committee and get it on the floor of the \nSenate, understanding how important this issue would be to the \nshareholder interests and pensioners and to others who depend upon a \nsolid, strong economy for their well-being--certainly their \ncontribution is extremely important as well.\n  We have seen the economy begin to do a bit better. I don't think our \nwork is done, despite the accomplishments in this legislation. My hope \nwould be that before this Senate adjourns in a week and a half from \nnow, we might deal with the pension issue. I don't know if that will be \npossible. I know there are a lot of other issues that need to be \nconsidered. My hope is if we are not able to do that in the next week \nand a half, we will come back soon after we reconvene in September.\n  I sit on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee with \nthe presiding officer who is interested in that committee. My hope is \nthat we can deal with the pension reform matters that are necessary, as \nwell, for adoption by this Congress before the 107th Congress adjourns.\n  Again, I commend all those involved. I thank Alex Sternhill of my \noffice, Steve Harris, Marty Gruenberg, all the Members who worked with \nthe chairman's committee and the full committee of the Senate Banking \nCommittee, and those on the minority side, as well, who played an \nextremely important role.\n  While he disagreed with the final outcome of the bill, the Senator \nfrom Texas and I have had a great relationship over these many years we \nhave served together. I have always enjoyed being on his side. He is a \ntough opponent, but when we worked together we have done some pretty \ngood work around here and passed some pretty good bills.\n\n  He is leaving and I believe the Senate will be less vibrant an \ninstitution because of his absence. It is important that this place be \na place of ideas for debate to occur, and the Senator from Texas has \nalways made that kind of contribution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Hang on. I am commending him. He is going to give me more \ntime.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator can have all the time he wants.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have learned after more than 20 years that \nif you want the minority to give you a little more time, start \ncomplementing them. It is amazing. Egos are alive and well in the \nSenate.\n  I am going to miss him. He is not done. We have more work, obviously, \nin the remaining weeks, but this may be one of the last major bills the \nBanking Committee considers. I don't know what life holds for him down \nthe road, but the good Lord is not done with him yet.\n  I look forward to your vibrancy, your ideas, and your passion in \nwhatever role you decide to assume in the next part of your life, and \nthank you for the tremendous work you have given to the committee and \nthis body through your service.\n  I thank again the chairman and other members of the committee for \ncontributing to what may be one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation this body will consider in the 107th Congress and one of \nthe most important in the area of financial services in many, many \ndecades.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We were going to shoot for about 4:30 so I may yield some \nof it back, depending on who comes over.\n  Let me, first, thank my dear colleague, Senator Dodd, for his kind \ncomments. I have enjoyed working with him over the years. I very much \nappreciate the comments he made.\n  I want to say something about my staff. A famous philosopher once \nsaid: In no way can you get a keener insight into the true nature of a \nleader than by looking at the people by whom he surrounds himself.\n  I would always be happy to have anybody judge me by Linda Lord and by \nWayne Abernathy. It is amazing how much impact staffers have on the \nSenate. I am blessed in this area to have two of the best staff people \nwho have ever served any Senator in the history of this country. On \nmost issues on which I worked with Linda Lord, she knows more about \nthis subject than anybody, and generally more than everybody else \ncombined. In working with her, I see that the Lord was a great \ndiscriminator; he gave some people incredible ability and most of us he \ngave relatively few, in the way of talents. I thank her for the great \njob she has done.\n  I thank Wayne Abernathy. In the years I was chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Wayne Abernathy was chairman of the Banking Committee. In \nthe day-to-day work, he has made an incredible contribution. If there \nis an unfairness to it, it is that I have gotten credit for all the \ngood work that they have done, and I am grateful for that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Maryland. I thank him forhis \ngreat leadership and the other Senators working on this. I can only say \nthis in 1 minute: I remember when Arthur Levitt came by several years \nago to talk with me about the need for audit independence. Senator \nSarbanes and others have made that possible. Many people took their \nsavings, converted it to stock, and thought it would be there for their \nchildren or grandchildren. Many people had 401(k)s they were counting \non. All of this has eroded in value. Investors do not have the \nconfidence in the economy. I think the key is to make the structural \nchange and make sure people can count on the independent audits, that \nno one is cooking their books. This is the best of government \noversight. I am very proud to support this legislation.\n  Once again, I thank the chair of the Banking Committee for \nexceptional leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as Senator Gramm was speaking earlier I \nwas thinking to myself that he really was exemplifying on the floor of \nthe Senate the sort of dialog we went through in the committee. As he \nwas making an argument about auditor independence, I was thinking that \nis really a very reasonable argument and one to which we really paid \nattention. I want to give the counterargument, and then make a \nconcluding comment about the terrific work of the staff on this bill.\n  Senator Gramm has suggested that the conference report should be \nchanged to give the SEC or the Oversight Board authority to grant broad \ncategorical exemptions from the list of non-audit services that Section \n201 of the bill prohibits registered public accounting firms to provide \nto public company audit clients.\n  Such a change, in my view, would weaken one of the fundamental \nobjectives of the conference report: to draw a bright line around a \nlimited list of non-audit services that accounting firms may not \nprovide to public company audit clients because their doing so creates \na fundamental conflict of interest for the accounting firms.\n  This limited list is based on a set of simple principles:\n  A public company auditor, in order to be independent, should not \naudit its own work (as it would if it provided internal audit \noutsourcing services, financial information systems design, appraisal \nor valuation services, actuarial services, or bookkeeping services to \nan audit client).\n  A public company auditor should not function as part of management or \nas an employee of the audit client (as it would if it provided human \nresources services such as recruiting, hiring, and designing \ncompensation packages for the officers, directors, and managers of an \naudit client).\n  A public company auditor, to be independent, should not act as an \nadvocate of its audit client (as it would if it provided legal and \nexpert services to an audit client in judicial or regulatory \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S7364]]\n\n  A public company auditor should not be a promoter of the company's \nstock or other financial interests (as it would be if it served as a \nbroker-dealer, investment adviser, or investment banker for the \ncompany).\n  I want to emphasize that Section 201 does not bar accounting firms \nfrom offering consulting services. It simply requires that they not \noffer certain consulting services to public companies for which they \nwish to serve as ``independent auditor.'' An accounting firm is free to \noffer any services it wants to any public companies it does not audit \n(or to any private companies). It also may engage in any non-audit \nservice, including tax services, that is not on the list for an audit \nclient if the activity is approved in advance by the audit committee of \nthe public company.\n  The conference report does authorize the new Oversight Board, on a \ncase-by-case basis, to exempt any person, issuer, public accounting \nfirm, or transaction from the prohibition on the provision of non-audit \nservices to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate \nin the public interest and is consistent with the protection of \ninvestors.\n  The exemptive authority provided the Board is intentionally narrow to \napply to individual cases where the application of the statutory \nrequirement would impose some extraordinary hardship or circumstance \nthat would merit an exemption consistent with the protection of the \npublic interest and the protection of investors.\n  But the fundamental presumption of the provision is that these non-\naudit services, by their very nature, present a conflict of interest \nfor an accounting firm if provided to a public company audit client.\n  Arthur Andersen was conflicted because it served Enron as both an \nauditor and a consultant, and for two years it also served as Enron's \ninternal auditor, essentially auditing its own work. Enron was \nAndersen's largest client, and in 2000 Andersen earned $27 million in \nconsulting fees from the company ($25 million in audit fees).\n  In its oversight hearing earlier this year on the failure of Superior \nBank in Hinsdale, Illinois, the Senate Banking Committee learned first-\nhand the risks associated with allowing accounting firms to audit their \nown work. In that case, the accounting firm audited and certified a \nvaluation of risky residual assets calculated according to a \nmethodology it had provided as a consultant. The valuation was \nexcessive and led to the failure of the institution.\n  The SEC's recent actions against one of the large public accounting \nfirms (KPMG) in an enforcement case illustrates the danger of allowing \nan accounting firm to serve as a broker dealer, investment advisor, or \ninvestment banker for a public company audit client (Porta Systems). In \nthat case, the accounting firm set up an affiliate and the affiliate \nprovided ``turn around'' services to the issuer, including functioning \nas the president of the company. There would have been no need for an \nSEC action if the non-audit service were simply prohibited.\n  The inherent conflict created by these consulting services has been \nexacerbated by their rapid growth in the last 15 years. According to \nthe SEC, 55 percent of the average revenue of the big five accounting \nfirms came from accounting and auditing services in 1988. Twenty-two \npercent of the average revenue came from management consulting \nservices. By 1999, those figures had fallen to 31 percent for \naccounting and auditing services, and risen to 50 percent for \nmanagement consulting services. Recent data reported to the SEC showed \non average public accounting firms' non-audit fees comprised 73 percent \nof their total fees, or $2.69 in non-audit fees for every $1.00 in \naudit fees.\n  A number of the most knowledgeable and thoughtful witnesses who \ntestified before the Senate Banking Committee in the hearings held in \npreparation for this legislation argued that the growth in the non-\naudit consulting business done by the large accounting firms for their \naudit clients has so compromised the independence of the audits that a \ncomplete prohibition on the provision of consulting services by \naccounting firms to their public audit clients is required. Perhaps the \nstrongest advocates of this view have been the managers of large \npension funds who are entrusted with people's retirement savings.\n  For example, the California Public Employees' Retirement System \n(CalPERS), manages pension and health benefits for more than 1.3 \nmillion members and has aggregate holdings totaling almost $150 \nbillion. According to CalPERS CEO, James E. Burton:\n\n       the inherent conflicts created when an external auditor is \n     simultaneously receiving fees from a company for non-audit \n     work cannot be remedied by anything less than a bright-line \n     ban. An accounting firm should be an auditor or a consultant, \n     but not both to the same client.\n  John Biggs is CEO of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association \nCollege Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA-CREF), the largest private \npension system in the world, which manages approximately $275 billion \nin pension assets for over 2 million participants in the education and \nresearch community. Mr. Biggs was also a member of the last Public \nOversight Board. He told the Committee that:\n\n       TIAA-CREF does not allow our public audit firm to provide \n     any consulting services to us, and our policy even bars our \n     auditor from providing tax services.\n\n  The conference report chose not to follow the approach of imposing a \ncomplete prohibition on the provision of non-audit services to audit \nclients. Instead it chose the approach of identifying the non-audit \nservices which by their very nature pose a conflict of interest and \nshould be prohibited. Among those supporting this approach are former \nComptroller General Charles Bowsher, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, \nand former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker.\n  The argument is made that small companies, in particular, may be \nburdened by this requirement and that the SEC should have broad \nauthority to grant categorical exemptions. It is even argued that so \nmany companies would seek case-by-case exemptions that the SEC would \nbecome overwhelmed and would be unable to process the exemptions in a \ntimely manner.\n  The point is that if the provision of a non-audit service to a public \ncompany audit client creates a conflict of interest for the accounting \nfirm that non-audit service should be prohibited, whether the public \ncompany is large or small. Investors rely on the audit in making their \ninvestment decisions, and the independence of the audit should not be \ncompromised by the provision of the non-audit service. If a legitimate \nexceptional hardship is imposed, then the Oversight Board would have \nthe authority to grant case-by-case exemptions.\n  The present Comptroller General, David Walker, issued a particularly \nstrong statement in support of the approach to auditor independence \ntaken in the bill conference report I would like to quote:\n\n       I believe that legislation that will provide a framework \n     and guidance for the SEC to use in setting independence \n     standards for public company audits is needed. History has \n     shown that the AICPA [American Institute of Certified Public \n     Accountants] and the SEC have failed to update their \n     independence standards in a timely fashion and that past \n     updates have not adequately protected the public's interests. \n     In addition, the accounting profession has placed too much \n     emphasis on growing non-audit fees and not enough emphasis on \n     modernizing the auditing profession for the 21st century \n     environment. Congress is the proper body to promulgate a \n     framework for the SEC to use in connection with independence \n     related regulatory and enforcement actions in order to help \n     ensure confidence in financial reporting and safeguard \n     investors and the public's interests. The independence \n     provision [of the bill] . . . strikes a reasoned and \n     reasonable balance that will enable auditors to perform a \n     range of non-audit services for their audit clients and an \n     unlimited range of non-audit services for their non-audit \n     clients. . . . In my opinion, the time to act on independence \n     legislation is now.\n\n  This auditor independence provision is at the very center of this \nlegislation. It goes to the public trust granted to public accounting \nfirms by our securities laws which require comprehensive financial \nstatements that must be prepared, in the words of the Securities Act of \n1933, by ``an independent public or certified accountant.''\n  The statutory independent audit requirement has two sides, a private \nfranchise and a public trust. It grants a franchise to the nation's \npublic accountants--their services, and only their services--must be \nsecured before an issuer of securities can go to market, have the \nsecurities listed on the nation's stock exchanges, or comply\n\n[[Page S7365]]\n\nwith the reporting requirements of the securities laws. This is a \nsource of significant private benefit.\n  But the franchise is conditional. It comes in return for the CPA's \nassumption of a public duty and obligation. As a unanimous Supreme \nCourt noted nearly 20 years ago:\n\n       In certifying the public reports that collectively depict a \n     corporation's financial status, the independent auditor \n     assumes a public responsibility. . . . [That auditor] owes \n     ultimate allegiance to the corporation's creditors and \n     stockholders, as well as to the investing public. This \n     ``public watchdog'' function demands that the accountant \n     maintain total independence from the client at all times and \n     requires complete fidelity to the public trust.\n\n  We must cut the chord between the audit and the consulting services \nwhich by their very nature undermine the independence of the audit. We \nmust break this culture that exists, and to do that we need a bright \nline. In my view granting broad exemption authority to the Oversight \nBoard or the SEC to permit these non-audit services would undermine the \nseparation the conference report is intended to establish.\n  I wanted to underscore the fact that there was a very reasoned, \nintense discussion of these issues. There is reason on both sides. I \nthought the Senator made a very strong statement. I wanted to give the \ncounterstatement here.\n  I share Senator Dodd's view about this exchange of ideas and its \nimportance to the functioning of this institution. The Senator from \nTexas has certainly made an important contribution in that regard.\n  I wish to take a moment to recognize the terrific work of the staff. \nSenator Gramm referred to Wayne Abernathy and Linda Lord, and of course \nMike Thompson and Katherine McGuire of Senator Enzi's staff; Laura \nAyoud of the legislative counsel who worked day and night to put this \nthing in legislative language; the staff of the Banking Committee led \nby Steve Harris, Dean Shahinian, Steve Kroll, Lynsey Graham, Vincent \nMeehan, Sarah Kline, Judy Keenan, Jesse Jacobs, Craig Davis, Marty \nGruenberg, Gary Gensler, and, as I said, all led so ably by Steve \nHarris.\n  We had the very able staff of the Senators on the committee: Alex \nSternhell, Naomi Camper, Jon Berger, Jimmy Williams, Catherine Cruz \nWojtasik, Leslie Wooley, Margaret Simmons, Matt Young, Roger \nHollingsworth, and Matt Pippin.\n  I thank again all my colleagues who participated. I think I \nrecognized most of them in the course of the day, and I want to say \njust a word about Chairman Oxley and Congressman LaFalce on the House \nside, who made it possible for us to work through this conference and \nwith whom we have worked so cooperatively on so many issues that have \ncome before our committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is without time. \nThere are 12 minutes for the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have reached the hour that we set for a \nvote. I am ready to yield back the 12 minutes and have the vote \nproceed.\n  I reiterate that this is a bill that was fraught with danger in the \nenvironment that we were in. Literally anything could have passed. I \nthink, by a combination of good work and some good fortune, that has \nnot been the case. We have a vehicle before us that I think will be \ncomplicated. It will be difficult to implement.\n  I think we will probably change it in the future. But I think in \nterms of our ability to prosper under the bill, and for the economy to \nsurvive not only the illness but the prescription of the doctor in this \ncase, I think it is doable.\n  I yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we have spent considerable time this \nevening in a quorum call, but in spite of that, we have had a very \nproductive legislative day. We have passed the conference report on \ncorporate governance; the Appropriations Committee this afternoon \nreported the final four bills out of the\n\n[[Page S7366]]\n\nAppropriations Committee; and we are finished with those and will bring \nthem to the floor. We have gotten permission to go to the conference \ncommittee on terrorism, which we have been trying to do for weeks. \nThere was significant progress made today with passage of the \nbankruptcy conference report, and there were other things.\n  But finally, what I want to say, we will shortly approve in a matter \nof a few minutes, four members to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. That goes hand and glove with the work we have done on \ncorporate governance. We are going to approve Cynthia Glassman to be a \nmember, Harvey Jerome Goldschmid to be a member, Roel C. Campos to be a \nmember of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Paul S. Atkins \nwill also be approved. We have had a very successful day.\n  For those watching, whether it is staff or people around the country, \nsometimes during the downtimes a lot of progress is made. Even as we \nspeak, there is work being done to see if we can come up with a \nbipartisan amendment to handle the prescription drug problems that \nsenior citizens have in America today.

Madam President, I rise to express my disappointment \nabout the outcome of the Senate's recent vote on Medicare prescription \ndrug coverage. The Senate missed an opportunity to provide one of the \nmost important expansions of Medicare benefits since the system was \ncreated in 1965. Senator Graham's proposal, of which I was proud to be \nan original cosponsor with a number of my Democratic colleagues, would \nhave provided comprehensive, voluntary, and affordable prescription \ndrug coverage for all Medicare beneficiaries. Though the majority of \nthe Senate supported this proposal, it lacked the votes necessary to \nproceed.\n  We know that more than 1 in 3 Medicare beneficiaries lack \nprescription drug coverage. We know, too, many seniors struggle to pay \nfor the medicine they need to keep them healthy and treat their \ndiseases and illnesses. We know that doctors are now put in the \nunthinkable position of considering a patient's financial situation \nwhen developing a course of treatment. Doctors are conflicted by this, \nbut know that it does not benefit the patient to prescribe a drug, even \nthough it may be the best method of treating or curing an illness, if \nthe patient cannot afford the medicine.\n  More importantly, I, like most of my colleagues, continually hear \nfrom constituents who face this dilemma directly. They are ill, they \nare frustrated, and too many times, they are embarrassed to have made \nit this far in life and have to ask for help after years of \nindependence. I have heard from those who may not have a direct need, \nbut who are desperately seeking assistance for a loved one who needs \nhelp. They are frustrated to learn that there is nowhere for them to \nturn because Medicare provides nothing for outpatient drugs, yet they \nhave too much income or too many assets to qualify for state offered \nassistance.\n  The Graham proposal would provide drug coverage for all Medicare \nbeneficiaries for a $25 monthly premium, no deductible, a $10 copayment \nfor generic drugs, and a $40 copayment for preferred brand name drugs. \nIn addition, Medicare beneficiaries would have all of their \nprescription costs covered after they spend $4,000 in out-of-pocket \ncosts. Assistance would begin with the very first prescription, and \nthere would be no gaps or limits on the coverage provided. Under \nSenator Graham's proposal, low-income seniors would not be required to \npay premiums or copayments for their coverage.\n  Regrettably, some of my colleagues did not support the Graham \namendment. They voted instead for an alternative that required seniors \nto pay a $250 deductible, while only covering 50 percent of their \nprescription costs up to $3450. After a Medicare beneficiary's costs \nexceed $3450, he or she would receive no assistance whatsoever until \nhis or her costs reach $3700. Above $3700, the government would then \nonly pay 90 percent of drug costs. Under this proposal, those who are \nthe sickest, with the highest drug costs, would be forced to pay more \nwhen they require assistance the most.\n  Many of those who opposed the Graham proposal complained about the \ncost of this proposal. I find it perplexing that we can find money for \nother things, but not for the mothers, fathers, grandparents and other \nAmericans that need our help in their older years. Opponents of the \nGraham bill found money to fund a large tax cut costing $1.35 trillion \nlast year a tax cut that primarily benefit the very wealthiest \nAmericans. Many of my fears about the decision to pass such a large and \nunreasonable tax cut have been realized raids on Social Security and \nMedicare, a return to budget deficits, instability in the financial \nmarkets. It has forced us unnecessarily to limit resources for those \nthings that should be national priorities. I remain astonished that \nsome believe tax cuts should be a priority over providing prescription \ndrug coverage to everyday Americans who have worked hard and paid their \ntaxes all their lives.\n  Yesterday, we had the chance to mark the 107th Congress with the \ngreatest overhaul of Medicare benefits since its inception 37 years \nago. I supported the Graham prescription drug plan along with 51 of my \ncolleagues because I believe it is the only proposal that would provide \nMedicare beneficiaries with real comprehensive prescription drug \ncoverage. I only hope that we can find a way to enact a meaningful \nMedicare prescription drug benefit this year. Our older Americans \ndeserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7366-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7366-S7367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DRUG COVERAGE AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I wish to speak to an amendment of mine \nand my friend and colleague, Senator DURBIN, to help organ transplant \npatients maintain access to the life-saving drugs necessary to prevent \ntheir immune systems from rejecting their new organs.\n  Every year, nearly 6,000 people die waiting for an organ transplant. \nCurrently, over 67,000 Americans are waiting for a donor organ. Those \nindividuals who are blessed to receive an organ transplant must take \nimmunosuppressive drugs every day for the life of their transplant. \nFailure to take these drugs significantly increases the risk of the \ntransplanted organ being rejected.\n  We need this amendment, because Federal law is compromising the \nsuccess of organ transplants. Let me explain. Right now, current \nMedicare policy denies certain transplant patients coverage for the \ndrugs needed to prevent rejection.\n  Medicare does not pay for anti-rejection drugs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, who received their transplants prior to becoming a \nMedicare beneficiary. So, for instance, if a person received a \ntransplant at age 64 through his or her health insurance plan, when \nthat person retires and relies on Medicare for health care coverage, he \nor she would no longer have immunosuppressive drug coverage.\n  Medicare only pays for anti-rejection drugs for transplants performed \nin a Medicare-approved transplant facility. However, many beneficiaries \nare completely unaware of this fact and how it can jeopardize their \nfuture coverage of\n\n[[Page S7367]]\n\nimmunosuppressive drugs. To receive an organ transplant, a person must \nbe very ill and many are far too ill at the time of transplantation to \nbe researching the complexities of Medicare coverage policy.\n  End Stage Renal Disease, ESRD, patients qualify for Medicare on the \nbasis of needing dialysis. If End Stage Renal Disease patients receive \na kidney transplant, they qualify for Medicare coverage for three years \nafter the transplant. After the three years are up, they lose not only \ntheir general Medicare coverage, but also their coverage for \nimmunosuppressive drugs.\n  The amendment that Senator Durbin and I are introducing today would \nremove the Medicare limitations and make clear that all Medicare \nbeneficiaries including End Stage Renal Disease patients who have had a \ntransplant and need immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of \ntheir transplant, will be covered as long as such anti-rejection drugs \nare needed.\n  In the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and \nProtection Act, Congress eliminated the 36-month time limitation for \ntransplant recipients who: 1. received a Medicare eligible transplant \nand 2. who are eligible for Medicare based on age or disability. Our \namendment would provide the same indefinite coverage to kidney \ntransplant recipients who are not Medicare aged or Medicare disabled.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help those who \nreceive Medicare-eligible transplants gain access to the \nimmunosuppressive drugs they need to live healthy productive lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7367-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          U.S. POLICY ON IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am pleased to cosponsor S.J. Res 41. \nAs the resolution makes clear, the time is ripe for an open debate on \nour plans for Iraq.\n  Some are concerned that an open debate on our policy toward Iraq \ncould expose sensitive intelligence information or that such a debate \nwould tip our hand too much. Others fear that a meaningful debate could \nback the administration into a corner, and in so doing encourage the \nadministration to adopt a tougher military response.\n  Ultimately, all of these arguments against an open and honest debate \non Iraq could be made with respect to nearly any military decision, and \nif taken to their extreme, these arguments would challenge the balance \nof powers in the Constitution by excluding Congress from future war-\nmaking decisions. Moreover, to answer some of these concerns more \ndirectly, I would also note that the almost daily leaks from the \nadministration on our Iraq policy have tipped our hand even more than \nresponsible congressional hearings and debate would. It is hardly a \nsecret that the United States is considering a range of policy options, \nincluding military operations, when it comes to Iraq. And the argument \nthat an open discussion of military action could, in effect, become \nself-fulfilling is too circular to be credible.\n  I am concerned with the dangers posed by Saddam Hussein, as well as \nwith the humanitarian situation in Iraq. But I am also very concerned \nabout the constitutional issues at stake here. This may well be one of \nour last opportunities to preserve the constitutionally mandated role \nof Congress in making decisions about war and peace.\n  On April 17, 2002, I chaired a hearing before the Constitution \nSubcommittee on the application of the War Powers Resolution to our \ncurrent antiterrorism operations. The focus of that hearing was to \nexplore the limits of the use of force authorization that Congress \npassed in response to the attacks of September 11. At the hearing, \nleading constitutional scholars concluded that the use of force \nresolution for September 11 would not authorize a future military \nstrike against Iraq, unless some additional evidence linking Saddam \nHussein directly to the attacks of Sept. 11 came to light. Many of the \nexperts also questioned the dubious assertion that congressional \nauthorization from more than 10 years ago for Desert Storm could \nsomehow lend ongoing authority for a new strike on Iraq.\n  On June 10, I delivered a speech on the floor of the Senate in which \nI outlined my findings from the April hearing. As I said then, I have \nconcluded that the Constitution requires the President to seek \nadditional authorization before he can embark on a major new military \nundertaking in Iraq. I am pleased that S.J. Resolution 41 makes that \npoint in forceful legislative terms.\n  So this is indeed an appropriate time to consider our policy toward \nIraq in more detail. I look forward to hearings that Senator Biden will \nchair before the Foreign Relations Committee. I also look forward to \nadditional debate and discussion on the floor of the Senate, and, when \nappropriate, in secure settings, where the administration can make its \ncase for a given policy response, and the Congress can ask questions, \nprobe assumptions, and generally exercise the oversight that the \nAmerican people expect of us.\n  Through these hearings and debates, it will be important to assess \nthe level of the threat that exists, along with the relative dangers \nthat would be posed by a massive assault on Iraq--dangers that include \nrisks to American soldiers and to our relations with some of our \nstrongest allies in our current anti-terror campaign. And it will be \ncrucially important to think through the aftermath of any military \nstrike.\n  We don't have to divulge secret information to begin to weigh the \nrisks and opportunities that confront us. But the American people must \nunderstand the general nature of the threats, and they must ultimately \nsupport any risks that we decide to take to secure a more peaceful \nfuture. I don't think the American public has an adequate sense yet of \nthe threats, dangers or options that exist in Iraq. I don't think \nCongress has an adequate grasp of the issues either. And that is why \nadditional hearings and debates are so necessary.\n  Finally, I have always said that another military campaign against \nIraq may eventually become unavoidable. As a result, I am pleased that \nS.J. Res 41 is neutral on the need for a military response, while \nrecognizing the intrinsic value of open and honest debate. Following a \nvigorous debate, if we decide that America's interests require a direct \nmilitary response to confront Iraqi aggression, such a response would \nbe taken from a constitutionally unified, and inherently stronger, \npolitical position. We must also remember that constitutional unity on \nthis question presents a stronger international image of the United \nStates to our friends and foes, and, at the same time, a more \ncomforting image of U.S. power to many of our close allies in the \ncampaign against terrorism.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor S.J. Res. 41, and I look forward to a \nvigorous debate on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7367-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7367-S7369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise today to discuss a very critical \nbill--S. 2590, the ``Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act.'' This \nbill, which Senators Jeffords, Breaux, Gregg, and I introduced in May, \nrepresents our next step in reducing the number of patients harmed each \nyear by medical errors. Although a variety of patient safety \ninitiatives are underway in the private sector as well as within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Congress has an important role \nto play in reinforcing and assisting these efforts.\n  Today, the House Ways and Means Committee is expected to report a \nbipartisan bill--a bill that is almost identical to its Senate \ncounterpart--that will help improve the safety of our health care \nsystem. Additionally, President Bush has highlighted the importance of \nthis issue by formally supporting this crucial legislation. Moreover, \nthis bill is supported by over thirty different health care \norganizations. Mr. President, I will ask that a list of those \nsupporting organizations be included in the Record.\n  As a physician and a scientist, I know the enormous complexities of \nmedicine today and the intricate system in which providers deliver \ncare. I also recognize the need to examine medical errors closely in \norder to determine where the system has filed the patient. One method \nused in hospitals is the Mortality and Morbidity Conferences, in which \nindividuals can\n\n[[Page S7368]]\n\nopenly discuss patients' cases and examine problems in detail. \nUnfortunately, because those conferences represent a single, internal \nhospital event, we cannot obtain valuable, systematic information about \nproblems or information that could be shared to allow providers to \nlearn from each other's mishaps. Therefore, there is a need to create a \nbroader, more inclusive learning system that encompasses all components \nof the health care system.\n  One impediment to that learning system is an inability to more \nclosely examine patient safety events without the threat of increased \nlitigation. The Institute of Medicine's report, To Err is Human, as \nwell as experts who testified for the past few years in a series of \nSenate and House hearings, strongly recommended that Congress provide \nlegal protections for information gathered to improve health care \nquality and increase patient safety. Without these protections, patient \nsafety improvements will continue to be hampered by fears of \nretribution and recrimination. If we are to change the health care \nculture from ``name, shame, and blame'' to a culture of safety and \ncontinuous quality improvement, we must provide these basic \nprotections.\n  However, we must be careful not to provide legal immunity for \ninformation that would normally be available for litigation, such as \nmedical records. Rather, we should protect information that would be \ngleaned from providers' investigations of patient safety events. This \ninformation is not currently being reported in a way that would allow \nus to learn from our errors and improve the safety and quality of care \nfor our patients.\n  Additionally, we must ensure that, in extreme circumstances, such as \na criminal or disciplinary proceeding, the patient safety data is not \nused as a shield. In those circumstances, it is imperative that the \ninformation be shared, as disclosing that information is material to \nthe proceeding, within the public interest, and not available for any \nother source. In this manner, we provide a balancing test--weighing the \npublic good in sharing the information and providing the appropriate \nlegal protections so that the system can be improved with the people \ngood in weeding out the ``bad apples.''\n  In crafting this legislation with Senators Jeffords, Breaux, and \nGregg, we were careful to concentrate on the learning system and \nprovide appropriate legal protections for that system. We view this as \nan essential first step in the ongoing, dynamic process of improving \npatient safety.\n  I also want to reassure my colleagues that this approach to improving \nmedical care--providing limited confidentiality protections to ensure \nthat we learn from the system--is not new to health care. Currently, \nthere are at least five health care examples which use Federal \nconfidentiality and peer review protections--the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention's National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance \nSystem, NNIS, the Food and Drug Administration's MedWatch, Veterans \nHealth Administration, VHA, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices Quality Improvement Organizations, QIOs. Each of these \nconfidentiality and peer review protections have improved the delivery \nof health care.\n  NNIS is a voluntary, hospital-based reporting system established to \nmonitor hospital-acquired infections and guide the prevention efforts \nthrough description of the epidemiology of nosocomial infections, \nantimicrobial resistance trends, and nosocomial infection rates to use \nfor comparison purposes. Since its inception in 1970, there has been a \n34 percent reduction in the number of nosocomial infections. This \ndramatic decrease can be attributed, in part, to the availability of \ndata for analysis and identification of system errors that were \ncontributing to high rates. By law, CDC assures participating hospitals \nthat any information that would permit identification of any individual \nor institution will be held in strict confidence. This allows hospitals \nto report accurately without fear of negative repercussions.\n  MedWatch is a voluntary Medical Products Reporting Program for \nquickly identifying unsafe medical products on the market. Through \nMedWatch, the Food and Drug Administration officials work to improve \nthe safety of drugs, biologics, medical devices, dietary supplements, \nmedical foods, infant formulas, and other regulated products by \nencouraging health professionals to report serious adverse events and \nproduct defects. Once an adverse event or product problem is \nidentified, FDA can take any of the following actions: labeling \nchanges, boxed warnings, product recalls and withdrawals, and medical \nand safety alerts. The aggregation of information through MedWatch has \nlead to drug recalls, such as Felbatol and Omniflox, and to label \nchanges on approximately 30 percent of the New Molecular Entities each \nyear.\n  To address the need for a non-punitive confidential reporting system, \nthe VHA developed and continues to implement an innovative systems \napproach to prevent harm to patients within Veterans Administration's \n163 medical centers. VHA has already implemented nationwide internal \nand external reporting systems that supplement the current \naccountability systems. Thus far, efforts have led to the \nimplementation of physician ordering systems and safety bulletins, such \nas the proper handling of MRI equipment.\n  QIOs monitor and improve the quality of care delivered to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. All information collected by QIOs for quality \nimprovement work is non-discoverable. QIOs work directly and \ncooperatively with hospitals and medical professionals across the \ncountry to implement quality improvement projects that address the root \ncauses of medical errors. QIOs use data to track progress towards \neliminating errors and improving treatment processes. For example, the \nlatest available national data, 1996-1998, show QIO projects resulted \nin 34 percent more patients getting medications to prevent a second \nheart attack; 23 percent more stroke patients receiving drugs that \nprevent subsequent strokes; 12 percent more heart failure patients \ngetting treatment needed to extend their active lives; and 20 percent \nmore patients hospitalized with pneumonia receiving rapid antibiotic \ntherapy.\n  I appreciate the efforts made by Senators Jeffords, Breaux, and Gregg \nthus far and look forward to working with them and others to pass this \nbipartisan legislation. I also value the leadership of the Bush \nAdministration and my House colleagues on this critical issue. I hope \nthat the Senate can also consider this important issue and come to a \nresolution in the near future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of supporting organizations be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Organizations Supporting the ``Patient Safety and Quality Improvement \n                           Act'' June 6, 2002\n\n       Alliance of Community Health Plans, Alliance of Medical \n     Societies, American Academy of Dermatology Association, \n     American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of \n     Neurology, American Academy of Pediatrics, American \n     Association of Health Plans, Association of American Medical \n     Colleges, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, \n     American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons, American \n     Association of Thoracic Surgery, American College of \n     Cardiology, American College of Emergency Physicians, \n     American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians, American \n     College of Osteopathic Surgeons, American College of \n     Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine.\n         American College of Radiology, American \n           Gastroenterological Association, American Geriatrics \n           Society, American Hospital Association, American \n           Medical Association, American Medical Group \n           Association, American Osteopathic Association, American \n           Pharmaceutical Association, American Psychiatric \n           Association, American Society for Clinical Pathology, \n           American Society for Quality, American Society of \n           Anesthesiologists, American Society of Cataract and \n           Refractive Surgery, Congress of Neurological Surgeons, \n           eHealth Initiative, Federation of American Hospitals.\n         General Motors, Healthcare Leadership Council, Institute \n           for Safe Medication Practices, Joint Commission on the \n           Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, Joseph H. \n           Kanter Family Foundation, Marshfield Clinic, Medical \n           Group Management Association, National Association of \n           Manufacturers, Premier, Society of Critical Care \n           Medicine, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, Tennessee \n           Hospital Association, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S. \n           Pharmacopeia, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, VHA \n           Inc.\n\n[[Page S7369]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7367-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7367-S7369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

The aggregation of information through MedWatch has \nlead to drug recalls, such as Felbatol and Omniflox, and to label \nchanges on approximately 30 percent of the New Molecular Entities each \nyear.\n  To address the need for a non-punitive confidential reporting system, \nthe VHA developed and continues to implement an innovative systems \napproach to prevent harm to patients within Veterans Administration's \n163 medical centers. VHA has already implemented nationwide internal \nand external reporting systems that supplement the current \naccountability systems. Thus far, efforts have led to the \nimplementation of physician ordering systems and safety bulletins, such \nas the proper handling of MRI equipment.\n  QIOs monitor and improve the quality of care delivered to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. All information collected by QIOs for quality \nimprovement work is non-discoverable. QIOs work directly and \ncooperatively with hospitals and medical professionals across the \ncountry to implement quality improvement projects that address the root \ncauses of medical errors. QIOs use data to track progress towards \neliminating errors and improving treatment processes. For example, the \nlatest available national data, 1996-1998, show QIO projects resulted \nin 34 percent more patients getting medications to prevent a second \nheart attack; 23 percent more stroke patients receiving drugs that \nprevent subsequent strokes; 12 percent more heart failure patients \ngetting treatment needed to extend their active lives; and 20 percent \nmore patients hospitalized with pneumonia receiving rapid antibiotic \ntherapy.\n  I appreciate the efforts made by Senators Jeffords, Breaux, and Gregg \nthus far and look forward to working with them and others to pass this \nbipartisan legislation. I also value the leadership of the Bush \nAdministration and my House colleagues on this critical issue. I hope \nthat the Senate can also consider this important issue and come to a \nresolution in the near future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of supporting organizations be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Organizations Supporting the ``Patient Safety and Quality Improvement \n                           Act'' June 6, 2002\n\n       Alliance of Community Health Plans, Alliance of Medical \n     Societies, American Academy of Dermatology Association, \n     American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of \n     Neurology, American Academy of Pediatrics, American \n     Association of Health Plans, Association of American Medical \n     Colleges, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, \n     American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons, American \n     Association of Thoracic Surgery, American College of \n     Cardiology, American College of Emergency Physicians, \n     American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians, American \n     College of Osteopathic Surgeons, American College of \n     Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine.\n         American College of Radiology, American \n           Gastroenterological Association, American Geriatrics \n           Society, American Hospital Association, American \n           Medical Association, American Medical Group \n           Association, American Osteopathic Association, American \n           Pharmaceutical Association, American Psychiatric \n           Association, American Society for Clinical Pathology, \n           American Society for Quality, American Society of \n           Anesthesiologists, American Society of Cataract and \n           Refractive Surgery, Congress of Neurological Surgeons, \n           eHealth Initiative, Federation of American Hospitals.\n         General Motors, Healthcare Leadership Council, Institute \n           for Safe Medication Practices, Joint Commission on the \n           Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, Joseph H. \n           Kanter Family Foundation, Marshfield Clinic, Medical \n           Group Management Association, National Association of \n           Manufacturers, Premier, Society of Critical Care \n           Medicine, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, Tennessee \n           Hospital Association, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S. \n           Pharmacopeia, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, VHA \n           Inc.\n\n[[Page S7369]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7369-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  WE SHALL NOT FORGET: KOREA 1950-1953\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise on this day to commemorate \nthe end of the Korean War, an often overlooked, yet very important \nevent in history. ``Forgotten'' is a term used too often about the \nKorean War; for veterans and their families, the war is very real, and \nsomething they can never forget.\n  Officially, the war was the first military effort of the United \nNations, but American involvement was dominant throughout the conflict. \nThousands of Americans were shipped off to that distant land, joining \nwith other soldiers from other allied nations, to help defend the \nrights of strangers against a hostile and merciless invasion. \nUnfortunately, many who fought bravely to aid the Koreans lost their \nlives while waging the war.\n  Today, I want to pay homage to all who served in this war. The troops \nfrom the United States and the 20 other United Nations countries who \nprovided aid to the South Koreans deserve our great acclaim every day, \nbut even more so on this special anniversary. These great countries \nunited to preserve the rights of South Korea, a small democracy \nthreatened by the overwhelming power of the Communist government. South \nKorea did not have sufficient military resources to protect its \ninterests. Fortunately, the United Nations member countries were \nunwilling to sit back and watch North Korea, with the aid of China and \nthe Soviet Union, drive democracy from the continent of Asia.\n  On June 25, 1950, troops from Communist-ruled North Korea invaded \nSouth Korea, meeting little resistance to their attack. A few days \nlater, on the morning of July 5th--still Independence Day in the United \nStates, Private Kenny Shadrick of Skin Fork, WV, became the war's first \nAmerican casualty. Kenny was the first, but many more West Virginians \nwere destined to die in the conflict , in fact, more West Virginians \nwere killed in combat during the three years of the Korean War than \nduring the 10 years that we fought in Vietnam.\n  At the end of the Korean War, a U.S. casualty report confirmed 36,940 \nbattle deaths. An additional 103,284 servicemembers were wounded in \nbattle. More than 8,000 Americans are still missing in action and \nunaccounted. How can we possibly call one of the bloodiest wars in \nhistory a ``forgotten war?'' Are those who served in Korea ``forgotten \nsoldiers?''\n  Make no mistake, those who fought in Korea will never be forgotten. \nThey serve as examples of true Americans, and the debt we owe to our \nKorean War veterans, like the veterans of all other wars, is \nimmeasurable. Unfortunately, these soldiers, like the Vietnam veterans \nwho followed, received no parade when they returned home. They quietly \nwent back to the lives they left and blended into their communities, \nunsung heroes of a faraway war.\n  Six years ago, we dedicated the Korean War Memorial. This stirring \ntribute to the veterans of this war poignantly bears out the hardships \nof the conflict.\n  The Memorial depicts, with stainless steel statues, a squad of 19 \nsoldiers on patrol. The ground on which they advance is reminiscent of \nthe rugged Korean terrain that they encountered, and their wind-blown \nponchos depict the treacherous weather that ensued throughout the war. \nOur soldiers landed in South Korea poorly equipped to face the icy \ntemperatures of 30 degrees below zero, their weaponry outdated and \ninadequate. As a result of the extreme cold, many veterans still suffer \ntoday from cold-related injuries, including frostbite, cold \nsensitization, numbness, tingling and burning, circulatory problems, \nskin cancer, fungal infections, and arthritis. Furthermore, the \npsychological tolls of war have caused great hardship for many \nveterans.\n  As a background to the soldiers' statues at the Memorial, the images \nof 2,400 unnamed men and women stand etched into a granite wall, \nsymbolizing the determination of the United States workforce and the \nmillions of family members and friends who supported the efforts of \nthose at war. Looking at the steadfast, resolute faces of these \nindividuals invokes in the viewer a deep admiration and appreciation \nfor their importance to the war effort.\n  Author James Brady, a veteran of the Korean War, spoke for all those \nwho served in the war when he wrote, ``We were all proudly putting our \nlives on the line for our country. But I would later come to realize \nthat the Korean War was like the middle child in a family, falling \nbetween World War II and Vietnam. It became an overlooked war.'' Mr. \nBRADY conveys the sentiments of many of the veterans who served in this \nwar and underscores our need to give these veterans the recognition \nthey are long overdue.\n  Today, I salute the courage of those who answered the call to defend \na country they never knew and a people they never met. Through their \nselfless determination and valor in the battle, these men and women \nsent an important message to future generations. I thank our Korean War \nveterans; their bravery reminds us of the value we put on freedom, \nwhile their sacrifices remind us that, as it says at the Korean War \nMemorial, ``Freedom is not free.'' We shall never forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7369-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nlast year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on October \n14, 2000 in Billings, MT. Chris Lehman, 23, shot Roderick Pierson, 44, \nwith a BB gun. Mr. Lehman later admitted to shooting Pierson because he \nwas black. Mr. Pierson was shot while walking with his 6 year-old \ndaughter.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7369-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7369-S7370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BURMESE MILITARY RAPES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the military junta in Burma must be \njudged not by what it says, but rather by what it does.\n  The recent editorial in the Washington Post on the rape of ethnic \nminority women and girls by Burmese military officials is heartbreaking \nand horrific. It is by no means a stretch to characterize the junta's \nmismanagement and oppression of the people of Burma as a ``reign of \nterror.''\n  I join my colleagues in both the Senate and House who have called for \njustice for these heinous crimes, and for continued pressure on the \nillegitimate regime in Burma to relinquish power to the sole legitimate \nrepresentative of the people of Burma, the National League for \nDemocracy. As the editorial rightly states ``Burma's leaders cannot \nbring the criminals to justice because they are the criminals.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the editorial ``The Rape of \nBurma'' be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 23, 2002]\n\n                           the Rape of Burma\n\n       Recent events have led some people to predict that one of \n     the world's most repressive regimes may be growing a bit less \n     so. The generals who rule, or misrule, the Southeast Asian \n     nation of Burma, which they call Myanmar, released from house \n     arrest the woman who should in fact be the nation's prime \n     minister, Aung San Suu Kyi. They have allowed her to travel a \n     bit, and they have released from unspeakable prisons a few of \n     her supporters. Grounds for hope, you might think.\n       Then came release of a report, documented in horrifying \n     detail, of how Burma's army uses rape as a weapon of war. The \n     rapes take place as part of the junta's perpetual--and, \n     outside Burma, little-noticed--war against ethnic \n     nationalities, in this case in Shan state. The Shan Human \n     Rights Foundation and Shan Women's Action Network documented \n     173 incidents involving 625 girls and women, some as young as \n     five years old, taking place mostly between 1996 and 2001. \n     Most of the rapes were perpetrated by officers, in front of \n     their men, and with utmost brutality; one-quarter of the \n     victims died.\n       What is telling is the response of the regime to the \n     report. Rather than seeking to\n\n[[Page S7370]]\n\n     bring the criminals to justice, it has unleashed vitriol \n     against the human rights organizations, accusing them of \n     drug-running and the like. This is the junta's usual pattern, \n     whenever it is found to be scraping the bottom of the \n     morality barrel: child labor, forced labor, torture. It \n     denies all and attacks the truth-tellers. Yet, over the years \n     the evidence of barbarity has been so inescapable that even \n     the junta's would-be friends have found it impossible to \n     overlook it. Burma's leaders cannot bring the criminals to \n     justice because they are the criminals.\n       Later this month Secretary of State Colin Powell will \n     travel to the region for meetings with senior officials. \n     Earlier this month he instructed his diplomats to express \n     outrage over the reported use of rape as a tactic of war; he \n     should personally express the same outrage. He also should \n     make clear that Aung San Suu Kyi--whose democratic party won \n     an overwhelming victory in 1990 elections that the junta \n     nullified--should be permitted more room to maneuver: \n     permission to publish a newspaper, for starters. The Burmese \n     regime should not receive rewards for cosmetic \n     liberalization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7370-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO MRS.

O'Donnell, an outstanding Civil Servant who will retire \nfrom the Federal Government on August 3, 2002 after distinguishing \nherself with over 31 years of dedicated service. During her career, \nMrs. O'Donnell has served in a succession of key positions where she \nhas established a pattern of clearly exceptional performance and \nservice leading to outstanding results in all her duties for the \nDepartment of the Army and the Department of Defense.\n  Mrs. O'Donnell served in a succession of administrative and \nsecretarial positions of ever increasing responsibility in Germany and \nthe United States culminating in her current assignment for the past 15 \nyears as the personal assistant to the Army's Chief of Legislative \nLiaison. Marian O'Donnell's efforts and accomplishments are examples of \nextraordinary dedication and professionalism. Throughout her career, \nshe was honored repeatedly by her superiors because of her efficiency, \nmeticulous attention to detail, and ability to handle a multitude of \ntasks simultaneously. Marion's understated charm resulted in numerous \noutstanding performance ratings, quality step increases, and two \nCommander's Award for Civilian Service which so many of her peers have \ntried to emulate.\n  While serving as the personal assistant to the Chief, Legislative \nLiaison Marian O'Donnell played a key role in the Army's congressional \nliaison efforts. She is the conduit though which Members of Congress, \ntheir staffs, senior Army and Defense officials dealt with the Army's \nleadership. A competent and unflappable professional, Marion has always \nplaced the Army and our Nation first. Throughout her service, Marian \nO'Donnell was regarded as the thread resulting in smooth and flawless \nchanges to the Army's congressional liaison leadership.\n  Despite the demands of her career Marian still found time to do \nvolunteer work with her Church and serve as counselor with its \nPregnancy Crisis Center. She is truly a civil servant of the first \norder and an outstanding citizen. On behalf of the Congress of the \nUnited States and the people of this great Nation, I offer my heartfelt \nthanks for her years of service and best wishes for a well-deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7370-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7370-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7370-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7370-S7371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 4775.

A bill to provide lasting protection for inventoried \nroadless areas within the National Forest System; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise today to join with my colleague \nfrom Washington, Senator Cantwell, to ensure that the remaining, \nundisturbed areas within our National Forest system are permanently \npreserved.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have worked with the Forest Service and \nparticipated in the public comment process on the development of the \ncurrent Roadless Area Conservation Rule. This administrative procedure \nwas several years in the making with extensive public outreach of \npublic hearings across the country. Thousands of Americans voiced \nsupport for protecting these areas from road building and other \ndevelopment.\n  For my part, this legislation today continues efforts I have \nundertaken with my colleagues from the Southeast to protect the \nexisting roadless areas in the Southern Appalachia forests. In 1997 I \nurged the Secretary of Agriculture to impose a moratorium on new road \nconstruction in these inventoried roadless areas. Last year, I urged \nPresident Bush to embrace and implement this important resource \nconservation policy. I was very encouraged that the President announced \nhis administration's support for this rule on May 4, 2001.\n  Today, with this rule under legal challenge, I believe that it is \nimportant to take another step forward with ensuring that this rule is \ncodified so that it has the full force of law. While some may advocate \nchanges to the current rule to gain advantages for greater use or \ngreater restrictions on these inventoried roadless areas, I want to \nassure my colleagues that our legislation today mirrors the current \nrule. With the extensive efforts of the Forest Service to analyze the \nimpact of the rule and the large number of public comments in support, \nwe must stay true to this effort.\n  The devastating fires on Forest Service lands in the West this summer \nhave renewed our commitment to programs to reduce the fuel load on \nforest lands. I support Sen. Domenici's initiatives to redirect Forest \nService funding of fuel reduction projects in areas adjoining \nresidential areas, and remain committed to giving the Forest Service \nall of the tools it needs to reduce the loss of life and property from \nfires.\n  An important reason for my support today is because I am convinced \nthat the Roadless Rule does not prevent the Forest Service from \nundertaking any fire prevention activities in roadless areas. Nor, when \na fire exists, does the rule prevent the Forest Service from taking any \nappropriate action, including building roads in roadless areas, to \ncreate fire breaks or other means to control a wildfire.\n  But, Mr. President, there must be no doubt on this important issue. \nFor that reason, we have provided further clarification that the Forest \nService has every authority to prevent fires or to respond to fires, \nand to use appropriated funds to undertake fire suppression activities \nin roadless areas.\n  This rule is a balanced approach to forest service management because \nit provides for reasonable exceptions for activities in roadless areas. \nI remain committed to the multiple-use management of our national \nforests. Timber and mineral resources on these public lands are assets \nthat should be appropriately utilized and available for all Americans. \nMy view of multiple-use management also recognizes and advances the \nrecreational and environmental assets of these roadless areas.\n  The remaining roadless areas in our national forests are important \nfor providing outstanding recreational opportunities for the public. \nThese lands also provide wildlife habitat and protect the water quality \nof many watersheds that serve as downstream drinking water sources for \nour communities.\n  The Roadless Area Conservation rule is also sound fiscal policy for \nour national forests. The Forest Service has documented an $8.4 billion \nbacklog in maintaining existing roads within our national forests. \nContinuing to build new roads in these fragile areas will only further \nstrain the scarce dollars within the Forest Service.\n  As I have indicated, the legislation we are introducing today does \nnot change the substance or spirit of the Roadless rule in any way. To \nbe clear, this legislation preserves the exemptions in the rule to \nallow for road construction where needed to protect these lands from \nfloods, fires, and pest infestation. It ensures public access to \nprivate lands, and recognizes the existing rights to ongoing oil and \ngas leases.\n  For Virginia, this legislation ensures that 394,000 acres of \ninventoried roadless areas in the George Washington and Jefferson \nNational Forests are permanently protected. During the public comment \nperiod on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement, the Forest Service \nreceived 68,586 comments from residents of Virginia. The Forest Service \nadvises me that of this amount more than 98 percent of the comments \nsupported full protection of these roadless areas.\n  I am pleased to support this legislation that is important to all \nregions of the country. The public has voiced its overwhelming support \nfor this important conservation initiative, and I trust that my \ncolleagues will respond by passing this bill this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN:\n  S. 2792. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize \nthe Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out \ncertain authorities relating to the importation of municipal solid \nwaste under the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of \nHazardous Waste between the United\n\n[[Page S7374]]\n\nStates and Canada; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am introducing legislation today with \nCongressman Dingell that will give a voice to the people of Michigan \nwith regard to the importation of Canadian municipal waste.\n  Over the past two years, imports from Canada have risen 152 percent \nand now constitute about half of the imported waste received at \nMichigan landfills. Currently, approximately 110-130 truckloads of \nwaste come in to Michigan each day from Canada. And this problem isn't \ngoing to get any better. These shipments of waste are expected to \ncontinue as Toronto and other Ontario sources phase out local disposal \nsites. On December 4, 2001, the Toronto City Council voted 38-2 to \napprove a new solid waste disposal contract that would ship an \nadditional 700,000 tons of waste per year to the Carleton Farms \nlandfill in Wayne County, MI, in the near future. In addition, two \nother Ontario communities that generate hundreds of thousands of tons \nof waste annually have signed contracts to ship their waste to Carleton \nFarms.\n  Based on current usage statistics, the Michigan Department of \nEnvironmental Quality estimates that Michigan has capacity for 15-17 \nyears of disposal in landfills. However, with the proposed dramatic \nincrease in the importation of waste, this capacity is less than 10 \nyears. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality estimates that, \nfor every five years of disposal of Canadian waste at the current usage \nvolume, Michigan is losing a full year of landfill capacity.\n  We have protections contained in an international agreement with \nCanada. In 1986, the U.S. and Canada entered into an agreement allowing \nthe shipment of hazardous waste across the U.S./Canadian border for \ntreatment, storage or disposal. In 1992, the two countries decided to \nadd municipal solid waste to the agreement. However, although the \nAgreement requires notification to the importing country and also \nallows the importing country to reject shipments, its provisions have \nnot been enforced.\n  Further, the EPA has said that it would not object to municipal waste \nshipments. We believe that in order to protect the health and welfare \nof the citizens of Michigan and their environment, the impact of the \nimportation on State and local recycling efforts, landfill capacity, \nair emissions and road deterioration resulting from increased vehicular \ntraffic and public health and the environment should all be considered. \nThe shipments should be rejected by the EPA.\n  Canada could not export waste to Michigan without the Agreement, but \nthe U.S. refuses to implement the provisions that would protect the \npeople of Michigan. We believe that the EPA has the authority to \nenforce this Agreement, but this legislation would put additional \npressure on the EPA to enforce it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 2795. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for payment under the prospective payment system for hospital \noutpatient department services under the medicare program for new drugs \nadministered in such departments as soon as the drugs administered in \nsuch departments as soon as the drug is approved for marketing by the \nCommissioner of Food and Drugs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday that will fix a flaw in Medicare's claims processing system that \ncurrently denies thousands of cancer patients timely access to \nlifesaving treatments. This legislation will ensure that administrative \ndelays do not force Americans with cancer to wait to be treated with \nexisting innovative drug therapies that stand to improve and prolong \ntheir lives.\n  The Food and Drug Administration, FDA, recently granted fast track \nauthority to a new class of cancer therapies. These therapies, which \ncombine immunotherapy and radiological treatments, offer promise and \nhope for many cancer patients. Under current Medicare policy, however, \nreimbursement for FDA-approved drugs in an outpatient setting does not \nbegin until Medicare issues a billing code for the drug. Consequently, \nthere is often a delay of several months between FDA approval of and \npatient access to a drug.\n  Prior to the designation of a Medicare billing code, doctors will not \nprescribe innovative treatments for patients in an outpatient setting \nfor fear of their being denied reimbursement by Medicare. However, \nwithin the inpatient setting, Medicare will reimburse hospitals \nimmediately after FDA approval. Given this discrepancy in current \npolicy, I am introducing legislation that will allow doctors to submit \nclaims retroactively and require Medicare to pay for innovative drugs \nadministered in hospital outpatient settings immediately after FDA \napproval.\n  Cancer patients cannot afford to wait for drugs that have the \npotential to improve their health and even save their lives. For \nAmericans battling cancer, time is of the essence. This legislation \nwill provide cancer patients with both the hope and the opportunity to \nlive longer and healthier lives. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. Nickles, Mr. Graham, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Specter, Mr. Hatch, and \n        Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 2796. A bill to authorize the negotiation of a free trade \nagreement with Uruguay; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nauthorizing President Bush and his Administration to negotiate a free \ntrade agreement with Uruguay. I am pleased to be joined by the \nfollowing co-sponsors: Senators Breaux, Chafee, Grassley, Nickles, \nGraham, Hagel, Specter, Hatch, and Cochran.\n  President Bush has instructed U.S. Trade Representative, Robert \nZoellick, to pursue a Free Trade Area of the Americas. I support this \neffort and this bill is not intended to compete with or replace that \nimportant undertaking. Instead, this legislation seeks to highlight the \nimportant relationship the U.S. enjoys with Uruguay and promote the \nneed for extending free-trade to South America.\n  Uruguayan economic reforms focused on the attraction of foreign trade \nand capital have proven successful. The economy of Uruguay grew \nsteadily until low commodity prices and economic difficulties in export \nmarkets caused a recession in 1999. President Jorge Batlle has stated \nhis intention to continue the promotion of economic growth, \ninternational trade, lower tariffs, and attracting foreign investment. \nMore than one hundred U.S.-owned companies operate in Uruguay, and many \nmore market U.S. goods and services.\n  Uruguay is a member of the World Trade Organization and a dynamic \nmember of the Southern Cone Common Market, MERCOSUR, with Argentina, \nBrazil, and Paraguay. Furthermore, it is an active participant and \nproponent of the Free Trade Area of the Americas process and is \ncoordinator of the e-commerce group and sub-coordinator of the \nagricultural subsidies group.\n  If the United States hopes to sustain its economic strength in the \n21st Century, we must participate in an expanding global economy. We \nmust aggressively pursue opportunities in new and emerging markets. We \nmust maintain our technological and competitive advantage and sell our \nproducts, services and agricultural commodities in these areas. \nAmerican agriculture, telecommunications, computer services, and other \nsectors will benefit from the opportunity to compete in Uruguay under a \nfree trade agreement.\n  As South America continues to recover from the Argentinian economic \ncrisis we must look for opportunities to engage the region in free \ntrade. A free trade agreement with Uruguay would provide American \nbusiness with unfettered access to another lucrative market and \nUruguayan business will have better access to American markets to \nsuccessfully weather the region's economic fallout. A U.S.-Uruguayan \nfree trade agreement is a win-win for the United States and Uruguay.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will approve this important legislation in \nthe near future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 2799. A bill to provide for the use of and distribution of certain \nfunds\n\n[[Page S7375]]\n\nawarded to the Gila River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nauthorize the distribution of judgement funds to eligible tribal \nmembers of the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona. Representative \nHayworth recently introduced companion legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The Gila River Indian Community Judgement Fund Distribution Act \nresolves two half-century old claims by the Gila River tribe against \nthe United States for failure to meet Federal obligations to protect \nthe Community's use of water from the Gila River and Salt River in \nArizona. The original complaint was filed before the Indian Claims \nCommission on August 8, 1951. In 1982, the United States Court of \nClaims confirmed liability of the United States to the Community, and \nrecently the settlement of these two claims was determined to be seven \nmillion dollars.\n  So much time has passed that the Indian Claims Commission formerly in \ncharge of fund distributions no longer exists. However, a debt does not \ndisappear. The judgement award has since been transferred from the \nIndian Claims Commission to a trust account on behalf of the Community, \nmanaged by the Office of Trust Management at the Department of \nInterior.\n  This judgement award was certified by the Treasury Department on \nOctober 6, 1999 for the final portion of the litigation to the two \nremaining dockets of the Gila River Indian Community. Since that time, \nthe Community has been working with the BIA in an attempt to finalize a \nuse and distribution plan to submit to Congress for approval. As \noutlined in its plan, the Community has decided to distribute the \njudgement award equally to eligible tribal members.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the tribal resolution approved by \nthe Gila River Indian Community in support of this payment plan in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Gila River Indian Community, Sacaton, AZ\n\n  Resolution GR-30-01--a resolution to approve a payment plan for the \n      distribution of funds awarded under dockets 236-C and 236-D\n\n       Whereas, the Gila River Indian Community (the \n     ``Community'') and the United States have been involved in \n     litigation regarding Docket 236 since August 8, 1951 and two \n     of the original fourteen dockets, Docket 236-C and Docket \n     236-D, remain to be resolved as to distribution;\n       Whereas, Docket 236-C sought monetary compensation from the \n     United States for its failure to engage in fair and honorable \n     dealings through failure to carry out its obligation to \n     protect the Community's use of water from the Gila River;\n       Whereas, Docket 236-D sought monetary compensation from the \n     United States for its failure to engage in fair and honorable \n     dealings through failure to carry out its obligations to \n     protect the Community's use of water from the Salt River;\n       Whereas, in Gila River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community v. \n     U.S. 29 Ind. C1.Comm. 144. (1972), the Indian Claims \n     Commission held that the United States, as trustee, was \n     liable towards its beneficiary, the Community, as to the \n     Docket 236-C claims:\n       Whereas, in Gila River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community v. \n     U.S., 684 F.2d 852 (1982), the United States Court of Claims \n     held that the United States, as trustee, was liable toward \n     its beneficiary, the Community, as to the Docket 236-D \n     claims;\n       Whereas, with approval by the Community under Resolution \n     GR-98-98, the Community entered into a settlement of Docket \n     236-C and Docket 236-D with the United States on April 27, \n     1999 regarding the amount of liability for the sum of Seven \n     Million Dollars ($7,000,000.00);\n       Whereas, on May 5, 1999, the United States certified the \n     judgment for the Community, which allowed payment to be made \n     into the trust account on behalf of the Gila River Indian \n     Community and which such payment was made into the trust \n     account managed by the Office of Trust Funds Management in \n     Albuquerque, New Mexico and is accruing interest;\n       Whereas, the Indian Judgment Funds Act of October 19, 1973, \n     87 Stat. 466, as amended and implemented by 25 CFR Part 87, \n     requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit a plan of \n     distribution for docket funds to the United States Congress; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Community had developed the attached plan of \n     distribution, entitled ``Plan for the Use of the Gila River \n     Indian Community Indian Judgment Funds in Docket 236-C and \n     Docket 236-D before the United States Court of Federal \n     Claims'' (the ``Plan of Distribution''), to be submitted to \n     the Secretary of the Interior for consideration and approval. \n     Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Gila River Indian Community Council \n     adopts and approves the attached Plan of Distribution, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Governor, or in the Governor's absence \n     the Lieutenant Governor, is authorized and directed to submit \n     the attached Plan of Distribution to the Secretary of the \n     Interior for approval, be it finally\n       Resolved, That the Governor, or in the Governor's absence \n     the Lieutenant Governor, is authorized and directed to \n     execute and sign necessary documents to fulfill the intent of \n     this Resolution.\n\n  The purpose of this legislation is to comply with Federal regulations \nwhich requires congressional approval for distribution of judgment \nfunds to tribal members. The terms of the legislation reflect an \nagreement by all parties for a distribution plan for final approval by \nthe Congress. As part of this legislation, the BIA is also seeking to \nresolve remaining expert assistance loans by the Gila River Indian \nCommunity, the Oglala Sioux Tribe, and the Seminole Tribe of Florida, \nas originally authorized by the Indian Claims Commission.\n  Members of the Gila River Indian Community have waited half a century \nfor final resolution of all their legal claims regarding this matter. \nAfter considerable delay, it is only fair to resolve this matter and \nprovide compensation as soon as possible. With the short time remaining \nin this session, I hope that the Senate will act quickly to move this \nlegislation through the process.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the text of the bill and a section-\nby-section summary in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide emergency disaster assistance to \nagricultural producers; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, on March 28, 2002, Secretary Veneman \ndeclared Montana a drought disaster. This drought designation came two \nmonths earlier than in 2001, and eight months earlier than in 2000.\n  The unrelenting drought Montana is suffering has brought economic \nhardship to our agriculture producers and rural communities. In 1996, \nthe year before the drought, Montana received $847 million in cash \nreceipts from wheat sales. In 2001, four years into the drought, \nMontana received $317 million in cash receipts, a 62 percent decline.\n  Agriculture is more than 50 percent of my State's economy, and is \ntruly the backbone of my State. The drought not only affects our \nfarmers and ranchers. It is felt throughout our rural communities. \nSmall businesses are being forced to close their doors. Families are \nmoving away to find work. It would be virtually impossible to find a \nsingle person who has not been either directly or indirectly affected \nby the dry conditions that we have.\n  Without our help, without passing natural disaster assistance, it is \nestimated that 40 percent of Montana's farmers and ranchers will not \nqualify for operating loans for the 2002 crop year. A large percentage \nof these hardworking people will lose their land, their homes, their \njobs, and their way of life. They will not be purchasing clothes, seed, \nfeed, fertilizer, or equipment in their local stores. They will have to \nmove, take their kids out of school. Small towns will die.\n  It is unfortunate that farmers and ranchers from Montana have to \nsuffer the effects of prolonged drought without Federal assistance \nbecause disaster was not as wide spread in 2001 as it has been in 2002. \nThe farmers and ranchers who suffered from severe drought in 2001 \nshould not be penalized, rather rewarded for their persistence and \ndedication to Montana's vital industry. We desperately need cooperation \nand support from all sides to prove relief to our producers that have \nstruggled through dry conditions for so long. We need disaster \nassistance immediately and we need to provide extra assistance for \nthose who have endured drought in 2001 and 2002. It is time to take \naction and to provide for those who have produced so many vital \nresources for the people of the United States.\n  I am disappointed that we have not been able to produce legislation \nthat is much needed and long overdue to benefit the hard working \nfarmers and ranchers of the state of Montana and across the country. \nMany of the agricultural producers in Montana who have worked the same \nland for generations will no longer be able to survive as farmers or \nranchers without disaster relief. Consecutive years of drought have \ncaused economic devastation that soon prevent these agricultural \nproducers from doing their jobs. The effects of this cycle will be \ndevastating to the economy and the people of my state.\n  Unfortunately natural disaster is no longer an issue for just a few \nStates. As of July 22, forty-nine of 50 States are impacted by drought \nand 36 percent of our country is currently classified as some level of \ndrought. This is an issue that can no longer be ignored.\n  I am pleased today to introduce with Senator Burns a natural disaster \npackage that will provide assistance to producers who have had losses \ndue to natural disasters in 2001 and 2002. It also includes funding for \n2001 and 2001 for the Livestock Assistance Program and the American \nIndian Livestock Feed Program. The package that we introduce today is \nthe same policy that 69 of my Senate Colleagues supported when Senator \nEnzi and I offered the amendment to the Farm Bill but extended to cover \nthe 2002 crop year as well.\n  It is true that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has utilized the \ntools that they have available to them. Access to low interest loans, \ngrazing and haying on CRP acreage are important pieces to ensuring that \nour producers stay in business. However, there is still one major piece \nof the puzzle missing and that is natural disaster assistance.\n  It is also true that crop insurance is a very important risk \nmanagement tool. I supported the crop insurance reform bill and I \nsupport and understand the importance of crop insurance. More than 90 \npercent of insurable acres in Montana are insured. Unfortunately for \nthe program to be run in an actuarially sound fashion, producers are \nhelped the least when they hurt the most. When a producer is suffering \nfrom consecutive years of drought, their premium increases and their \ncoverage decreases.\n  We have the opportunity to stop that process. To keep our rural \ncommunities and economies alive. Rural America is resilient. And like \nthem, I will not give up. Thousands of people are suffering from a \nrelentless drought. They deserve natural disaster assistance and I will \ncontinue to fight to ensure they get it.\n  I am pleased to be working with my fellow Senator from Montana, and I \nask each of my Senate colleagues to join us in this effort.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I rise today to express my support of the \nEmergency Disaster Assistance Act of 2002. I am proud to join my \ncolleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, in introducing this \nlegislation.\n  However, more importantly I rise today in support of America's \nfarmers and ranchers. In my home State of Montana, we are looking at \nour fifth summer of severe drought. Many places in my great State are \ndrying up and blowing away. Dirt fills the ditches alongside the roads \nand so many tumbleweeds clog the fences. I fear this may be the case \nfor much of the West and Midwest after this summer.\n  This legislation would provide much needed relief to those farmers \nand ranchers hit the hardest by the drought. Many have argued the Farm\n\n[[Page S7379]]\n\nBill adequately met the needs of those earning their living in \nagriculture. I disagree. The Farm Bill provides economic assistance, \nbut not weather related disaster assistance.\n  In fact, it does not help farmers ``when times are tough,'' and the \ndrought conditions of the past several years indicate that these are \nindeed very difficult times. The very reason I am requesting drought \nassistance is precisely because this farm bill does not sufficiently \nmeet the needs of those farmers who have suffered loss due to natural \nconditions during the past 4 years. I believe the farmers in the most \nextreme situations are the very ones we should be helping.\n  I am committed to working with my colleagues to get this much-needed \nassistance out to our rural areas, to the places that need it the most. \nI am also committed to doing this in the most responsible way possible. \nI believe we can reach an agreement and find a realistic amount that \nhelps producers, yet is fiscally responsible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7379-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 305--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 15, \n2002, AS ``NATIONAL HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WEEK''\n\n  Mr. THURMOND submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              S.

Res. 306\n\n       Whereas the people of the United States respect the Iranian \n     people and value the contributions that Iran's culture has \n     made to world civilization for over 3 millennia;\n       Whereas the Iranian people aspire to democracy, civil, \n     political, and religious rights, and the rule of law, as \n     evidenced by increasingly frequent antigovernment and anti-\n     Khatami demonstrations within Iran and by statements of \n     numerous Iranian expatriates and dissidents;\n       Whereas Iran is an ideological dictatorship presided over \n     by an unelected Supreme Leader with limitless veto power, an \n     unelected Expediency Council and Council of Guardians capable \n     of eviscerating any reforms, and a President elected only \n     after the aforementioned disqualified 234 other candidates \n     for being too liberal, reformist, or secular;\n       Whereas the United States recognizes the Iranian peoples' \n     concerns that President Muhammad Khatami's rhetoric has not \n     been matched by his actions;\n       Whereas President Khatami clearly lacks the ability and \n     inclination to change the behavior of the State of Iran \n     either toward the vast majority of Iranians who seek freedom \n     or toward the international community;\n       Whereas political repression, newspaper censorship, \n     corruption, vigilante intimidation, arbitrary imprisonment of \n     students, and public executions have increased since \n     President Khatami's inauguration in 1997;\n       Whereas men and women are not equal under the laws of Iran \n     and women are legally deprived of their basic rights;\n       Whereas the Iranian government shipped 50-tons of \n     sophisticated weaponry to the Palestinian Authority despite \n     Chairman Arafat's cease-fire agreement, consistently seeks to \n     undermine the Middle East peace process, provides safe-haven \n     to al-Qa'ida and Taliban terrorists, allows transit of arms \n     for guerrillas seeking to undermine our ally Turkey, provides \n     transit of terrorists seeking to destabilize the United \n     States-protected safe-haven in Iraq, and develops weapons of \n     mass destruction;\n       Whereas since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     and despite rhetorical protestations to the contrary, the \n     Government of Iran has actively and repeatedly sought to \n     undermine the United States war on terror;\n       Whereas there is a broad-based movement for change in Iran \n     that represents all sectors of Iranian society, including \n     youth, women, student bodies, military personnel, and even \n     religious figures, that is pro-democratic, believes in \n     secular government, and is yearning to live in freedom;\n       Whereas following the tragedies of September 11, 2001, tens \n     of thousands of Iranians filled the streets spontaneously and \n     in solidarity with the United States and the victims of the \n     terrorist attacks; and\n       Whereas the people of Iran deserve the support of the \n     American people: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) legitimizing the regime in Iran stifles the growth of \n     the genuine democratic forces in Iran and does not serve the \n     national security interest of the United States;\n       (2) positive gestures of the United States toward Iran \n     should be directed toward the people of Iran, and not \n     political figures whose survival depends upon preservation of \n     the current regime; and\n       (3) it should be the policy of the United States to seek a \n     genuine democratic government in Iran that will restore \n     freedom to the Iranian people, abandon terrorism, and live in \n     peace and security with the international community.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, today we are resolved to see a new, \nrational foreign policy toward Iran, a policy that will engage the \nproud people of that nation and support their aspirations to be free of \nthe theocratic state that abuses and oppresses them.\n  It is time that we recognized that the forces of extremist clerics \nand their allies have so completely dominated the government of Iran \nthat there is no means to achieve political liberalization within the \ncurrent system. While President Khatami has often spoken of \nliberalization, the last 5 years show that either he is unwilling or \nunable to effect any democratic change.\n  In fact, the record of his administration has been increasing \ncensorship, religious vigilantes and intimidation, and wide-spread \npolitical repression. The State Department has identified systematic \nabuses including summary executions, disappearances, and wide-spread \nuse of torture and other forms of degradation.\n  Student dissidents within Iran have become increasingly better \norganized, and have been faced with greater repression. The frequent \ndemonstrations\n\n[[Page S7380]]\n\nby these students, women, and even religious dissidents, as well as the \ngrowing movements of expatriates show that there is a yearning for \ndemocratic change within the Iranian people. It should be a core value \nof our foreign policy to encourage and support any people who seek only \nthe fundamental human freedoms laid out in our own bill of rights.\n  There is also self-interest involved in this move. The Iranian regime \nhas been supplying arms and cadre to terrorist movements attacking our \nallies in Turkey, Armenia, and Israel, and has striven to be a \ndestabilizing force throughout the middle-east and central Asia. This \nis not the fault of the Iranian people, but of a criminal class that \ndominates them and strangles their hopes for a peaceful and progressive \nfuture. In the days following the tragedy of September 11, it is the \npeople of Iran who spontaneously filled the streets in shared grieving \nover the loss of American lives.\n  In dealing with Iran we must focus all of our efforts on the people, \nand their hopes for a free and democratic nation. The Voice of America, \nRadio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty must redouble their efforts to \nprovide uncensored truth to the Iranian people. The State Department \nmust cease lending legitimacy to the current regime and pursue a policy \nof fundamental democratic change; this administration must seek ways to \naid and sustain those movements that will effect that change, to the \nbenefit of the Iranian and American people alike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7380-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 131--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER \n              2002, AS ``NATIONAL MILITARY FAMILY MONTH''\n\n  Mr. INOUYE submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                            S.

Madam President, today I rise to honor all our military \nfamilies by submitting a Concurrent Resolution to designate November \n2002, as National Military Family Month. As we all know, memories fade \nand the hardships experienced by our military families are easily \nforgotten unless they touch our own immediate family.\n  Today, we have our men and women deployed all over the world, engaged \nin this war on terrorism. These far-ranging military deployments are \nextremely difficult on the families who bear this heavy burden.\n  To honor these families the Armed Services YMCA has sponsored \nMilitary Family Week in late November since 1996. However, due to \nfrequent `short week' conflicts around the Thanksgiving holidays, the \ndesignated week has not always afforded enough time to schedule \nobservance on and near our military bases.\n  I believe a month long observation will allow greater opportunity to \nplan events. Moreover, it will provide a greater opportunity to \nstimulate media support.\n  A Concurrent Resolution will help pave the way for this effort. I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this tribute to our military \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7380-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4319.

Madam President, I rise to enthusiastically support the \nnomination of David William Thomas to be the next United States Marshal \nfor the District of Delaware.\n  It has been my pleasure to know Sgt. Thomas for many years. He is a \ngood and decent person, a devoted and committed husband and father, a \nfine police officer, a volunteer fire fighter and an all around ``great \nguy.'' I believe he will serve both Delaware and the United States \nvery, very well.\n  ``Tito,'' as many call him, has been a police officer for more than \n20 years. He began his career as a patrol officer with the University \nof Delaware Police where he quickly developed a reputation for firmness \nin his enforcement of the law and university policy as well as for \nsensitivity to the particular needs and concerns of the student body. \nAfter three years, Sgt. Thomas moved to the Delaware State Police where \nhe served in several different capacities ranging from Patrol Trooper, \nwhere the rubber literally hits the road, to public information \nofficer, interacting with the public and the media.\n  During his tenure with the State Police, ``Tito'' Thomas worked \ndirectly for two governors of Delaware. During the second term of \nformer Governor Mike Castle who is now Delaware's congressman, Sgt. \nThomas provided security as a member of the Executive Protection Unit. \nDuring my own second term as Governor, ``Tito'' served as Legislative \nLiaison for my Department of Public Safety, promoting public safety \nlegislation in our state general assembly.\n  In addition to his employment as a police officer, Sgt. Thomas has \nserved his community as a volunteer in other capacities. Notably, he is \na member of the Aetna Hose Hook and Ladder Volunteer Fire Company in \nNewark, Delaware and a volunteer CPR Instructor with the American Heart \nAssociation.\n  David Thomas' extensive and varied background in law enforcement, his \ndemonstrated sense of commitment to his community, his devotion to his \ngrowing family and his exemplary moral character all serve to qualify \nhim well to be United States Marshall for the District of Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/25/senate-section/article/S7384-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
