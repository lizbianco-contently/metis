Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 50 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled on the \nLugar amendment, No. 2473.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I yield to myself the time I may require. \nBeing mindful there are others who may wish to speak on my amendment \nbut seeing none for the moment, let me review the amendment for the \nbenefit of Senators who, perhaps, followed the debate yesterday.\n  I have offered an amendment which, in essence, changes substantially \nthe ways in which farm families are supported in the United States of \nAmerica. I have moved to a concept of a safety net in which, \nessentially, each farm family--regardless of the State, regardless of \nwhat products or farm animals or timber or what have you which comes \nfrom that farm--has equal standing. I think that amendment ought to be \nappealing to most States.\n  As I cited yesterday, just 6 States of the 50 receive about half of \nthe payments under the current system. That would be concentrated \nfurther in the bill that now lies before us. That concentration really \noccurs regardless of State, although many States receive very few \nbenefits at all. If, in fact, 6 States receive about half, the 44 \ndivide the rest and, as I cited yesterday, many States have fewer than \n10 percent of their farm families who participate in these payments at \nall.\n  I make that point again because I suspect it is not apparent to many \nSenators, to many people in the public as a whole, who believe we are \ntalking today about the totality of agriculture in our country, farm \nfamilies of all sizes. Much is said about small farm families, those \nwho are in stress, in danger of losing their farms.\n  Without being disrespectful of anyone's views on these subjects, I \npointed out these small family farms are not likely to gain much \nsustenance from the subsidies that are being suggested presently. Let \nme cite, without getting into anyone else's backyard, the situation in \nthe State of Indiana.\n  The current program targets 16 percent of the payments in Indiana to \n1 percent of the farms--1,007 farms. In fact, it becomes equally \napparent at the top 2 percent, which gets 26 percent, a quarter of all \nthe farms. By the time you get to the top 10 percent, which now \nincludes 10,000 farms out of roughly 100,000 that received payments \nfrom 1996 to 2000, the top 10 percent receive 66 percent of all of the \nmoney.\n  Any way you look at it, the reasons for this are perfectly clear. \nEssentially, the payments are made on the basis of acreage and yield. \nThose farmers who are strongest make use of research; they make use of \nmarketing techniques. They, in fact, have costs that are less than the \nfloor, so there are incentives to produce more each time we come along \nwith another farm bill. And that will be the case again. Therefore, the \ngist of my amendment is we must change.\n  The distinguished chairman of the committee, as he responded last \nevening, said the Lugar amendment contemplates so much change it will \nbe shocking to country bankers; it will be shocking to farmers \ngenerally. When you knock the props out of all kinds of layers of \nprograms that have been built up year after year, one subsidy on top of \nanother, even if it only touched 40 percent of farm families generally \nwith 60 percent not touched at all, certainly there will be an impact \non the 40 percent.\n  My point is the 40 percent overstates it. The real impact will be \nupon the 1's, the 2's, the very top numbers in terms of people who have \nvery large enterprises. I think that is not the will of the Senate. But \nthe effect of the policies has been this, as detailed State by State by \nthe Environmental Working Group Web site. Any Senator, prior to a vote \non this amendment, can go to that Web site and find out, person by \nperson, every farm that has received subsidies during the last 5-year \nperiod that is covered, plus the summary I have cited.\n  The change I am suggesting is one that is still a generous amount of \ntaxpayer money. Yesterday Investor Daily editorialized about the debate \nwe are having and commended my bill as the best of the lot but \nsuggested it is still a lot of money from some taxpayers in America to \nfarmers. Indeed, it is to the extent that I am suggesting a farmer \nreceive a voucher worth 6 percent of all that he or she produces on the \nfarm and that it not be simply curtailed to wheat, corn, cotton, rice, \nand soybeans but to livestock, to fruits and vegetables, to wool, to \nwhatever comes from that entity--all things added up on the Federal tax \nreturn that arrive at a total farm revenue picture.\n  I used the hypothetical farmer yesterday who received, say, $100,000 \nof total receipts from all sources getting a voucher for $6,000, enough \nto pay for a full farm insurance policy that guarantees 80 percent of \nthe revenue based on the last 5 years.\n  There are very few businesses, if any, in America that could purchase \nthis kind of revenue assurance that would guarantee--given the ups and \ndowns of our economy--at least 80 percent of the revenue would be \navailable come hell or high water, including bad weather, bad trade \npolicies, and whatever. This $6,000 voucher would not be paid for by \nthe farmer. It is by virtue of the production indicated on the tax \nreturns that he or she submits. It is possible, because we already have \na generous crop insurance program as I pointed out that undergirds \nagriculture now, that not all farmers will take advantage of that, \nwhich is too bad. The educational process must continue so farmers \nunderstand how much insurance and assurance they could obtain under \ncurrent legislation.\n  My point is, we ought to be providing a safety net that has equality \nfor all States, all crops, all conditions, and all sizes of farms and \nthat genuinely meet the needs of a safety net as opposed to a haphazard \ndisaster relief bill here or there on the appropriations of \nagriculture, and the perennial summer debates about supplemental \nassistance, that somehow there are shortfalls, even though this year we \nare having a record net income for all of agriculture--$61 billion. It \nhas never been higher.\n  Yet this debate proceeds as if the totality of American agriculture \nwere in crisis. The 10-year bill suggested by the House of \nRepresentatives suggests the crisis inevitably goes on for 10 years \nadding one subsidy on top of another throughout that period of time.\n  That is what my amendment tries to stop. I appreciate that for many \nSenators the problem of explaining all of this to their constituents \nmay be difficult. The easier course may be simply to say: I did my best \nfor you.\n  As I witnessed the debate thus far, I have an impression that many \nSenators have come into that mode as they approach the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, or me, or other Members who have been \ninvolved in the debate. The question is not that overlayers of \nsubsidies on top of subsidies is good for the country, good for farmers \ngenerally, good for the deficit, or good for whatever. The question is, \nwhat is in this bill for me, or my farmers, or the political support I \ncan gain from the person to whom I can write that I was in there \nfighting for the last dollar for you.\n  I must admit that the bill which has been laid down before us by the \nAgriculture Committee has a lot of money in it. The disillusionment \nwill come that 60 percent of farmers will find there is nothing in the \nbill for them--nothing. I hope they understand that before we conclude \nthe debate.\n  In my State of Indiana, two-thirds of the farmers will find out very \nrapidly that there was very little left for them after the top 10 \npercent took the money. That will come as a disillusion, perhaps. But \nhope springs eternal, perhaps. A trickle-down theory might occur even \nin farm subsidy bills.\n  Let me point out that there is an opportunity here for both a safety \nnet for farmers and finally a turnaround from a policy that came in a \nlong time ago with deep origins in the row crops coming out of the \nDepression but less and\n\n[[Page S12991]]\n\nless relevant to the actualities of farming in America today and what \npeople actually do.\n  The 2 million farms that are listed by the census in most cases do \nnot have active farmers on the farm. The most rapidly rising source of \nnew farms in the country are persons who are professionals, doctors, \nlawyers, teachers, and others who purchase 50 acres, or sometimes more \nwithin a reasonable driving distance of their urban offices, or \nlocations, because they like some space. If they produce on that entity \nof 50 acreas or 100 or whatever the acreage may be, at least $20,000 in \nsales of anything agricultural, they are classified under USDA \nstandards as a farmer. So the 2 million are made up principally of \npersons who gain some income from the farm.\n  The only persons who gain the bulk of their income from the farm are \ncommercial farmers in America. Most of them have 1,000 acres or more. \nThey comprise roughly 10 percent to 15 percent of all of the entities. \nEven on those farms it is usual that one member of the family has a day \njob in the city or somewhere else.\n  That is the nature of the business. I mention this because, in an \nattempt to have a comprehensive farm bill, it is virtually impossible \nto target and to find 2 million people. I think my bill does this the \nbest because it simply says whether you produce $20,000, and you are in \nfact a lawyer, you still qualify as a farm so that there is at least \nsomething more than a casual interest in the farm. If you have $20,000 \nin sales of any sort, you are eligible for the 6 percent voucher.\n  My bill is not excessively generous as you rise in income because \nafter the first $250,000 total revenue the voucher percentage drops to \n4 percent to the next $250,000. After $500,000 to $1 million in \nrevenue, it is 1 percent. Then sales on your farm over $1 million would \nnot have the voucher. Thus, there is a limit effectively of about \n$30,000 for a farm family coming from this program.\n  The distribution to all farm families in America in all States means \nthat the money that is finally provided in my bill is spread even over \na 10-year stretch. We are talking about a 5-year bill. Because many of \nthese bills have been scored for 10, it is still less than the bill \nbefore us. But the cost of my bill in the 5 years we are talking about \nis dramatically less in large part because, although a lot of money is \ngoing to all the farm families at the rate of 6 percent of everything \nthey are doing, essentially we are winding up the target prices, the \nloans, and the other subsidies on top of another. Therefore, as you \nsubtract those savings, OMB has scored this 5-year experience in the \ncommodity section of the Lugar bill of only $5 billion as opposed to, \nas I recall, the $27 billion for 5 years in the bill before us now. \nThat is substantial money.\n  Let me point out that in addition there are some important aspects in \nthe second section of my bill. The distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, as he responded yesterday, pointed out that the committee \nbill has much more generous provisions for the nutrition section. I \napplaud that. I worked with the chairman to make certain we had very \nstrong bipartisan support for doing more in the food stamp area, in the \nWIC Program, in the School Lunch Program, and in the feeding of people \nwherever they may be in America.\n  But there is a difference between the two bills--my bill, \nessentially, is the amendment before the Senate now--with some of the \nsavings that come from this remarkable difference between $5 billion \nfor commodities in my bill and $27 billion in Senator Harkin's bill. My \nbill provides $3.7 billion for nutrition in the first 5 years and the \nHarkin substitute $1.6 billion. That is a substantial difference.\n  Yesterday, I detailed the extraordinary efforts of hunger groups \nthroughout our country, of advocates not only for the poor but for \nbetter nutrition, of people involved in the School Lunch Program who \nregularly testified before our committee, as well as those who have \nbeen advocates for full coverage of the Women, Infants, and Children \nProgram--the WIC Program--to fulfill those objectives.\n  My bill allocates $3.7 billion in the next 5 years. If it were scored \nover 10 years, it would be up to $11.9 billion. The Harkin substitute \nhas $1.6 billion in the first 5 years, scoring $5.6 billion in the 10-\nyear period, with less than half the nutrition impact. That is not by \nchance.\n  For Senators who believe one of the major points of a farm bill that \ncomes from Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry ought to be the feeding \nof all Americans, in addition to targeted benefits for very few \nAmericans on the production side, I hope they will find my amendment \nappealing. It was meant to be that way. The priorities are significant.\n  For the moment, Madam President, I will yield the floor so I will \nhave a few moments, perhaps, at the end of the debate to refresh \nmemories of Senators who may not have heard all of this presentation \ntoday and may be preparing for their votes.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time in \nthe quorum call I am about to propound be charged equally against the \ntwo sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as I understand, again, for the benefit \nof all Senators, we are under an hour of debate evenly divided on the \nLugar amendment regarding nutrition with a vote to occur at 10:30; is \nthat correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is \nto be a 50-minute debate equally divided and controlled with the vote \nto occur at 10:25.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand I must have about 25 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Madam President, now that we have had some opportunity over the \nevening to look at Senator Lugar's proposed nutrition title, I would \nlike to discuss a little bit of the difference between his approach and \nthe approach we came out of the committee with, again, keeping in mind \nthat our nutrition title did come out of committee, if I am not \nmistaken, on a unanimous vote on that title.\n  Again, like so many other things that have come through any \nlegislative process here, but especially on agriculture, I am sure \nthere were things we might have wanted to do differently in one way or \nthe other. Would we like to put more money in nutrition? Yes. But then \nwe have to balance it with everything else we have. So we tried to come \nout with a balanced bill, as I said yesterday.\n  I really believe my colleague's amendment would upset that balance \ngreatly. And even though we might want to do more for nutrition, I \nbelieve we have met our responsibilities for nutrition in this bill to \nmeet the nutritional needs of our people. I will go through that \nshortly.\n  I did want to correct one thing. I believe my colleague and friend \nsaid that on nutrition our spending over 5 years is $1.6 billion. Our \ndata shows that our outlays for 5 years are $2.2 billion. I just wanted \nto make that correction. I think his is $3.7 billion and we are at $2.2 \nbillion. I do know his outlays are more than ours; at least I believe \nhis budget authority is $3.7 billion. I do not know what the outlays \nare for 5 years, and perhaps Senator Lugar could enlighten us on that. \nBut I just want to talk about some of the differences and some of the \npotential problem areas I see in the title proposed by Senator Lugar.\n  I think we have all agreed that the outreach for the Food Stamp \nProgram\n\n[[Page S12992]]\n\nis vitally important to make sure that eligible people understand they \ncan participate and to get them to participate. In the past, this has \nreally been a problem. So we put provisions in our bill that would \nprovide for more outreach to go out and make people understand they are \neligible for food stamps. That, I believe, is lacking in the Lugar \nproposal.\n  Again, this is one area where, if you look at the amount of money we \nhave for nutrition, you have to understand that food stamps are an \nentitlement; that if the economy goes down, if people are out of work, \nif they qualify, they get food stamps. That is not included in our \nbill. That is just an entitlement. What is important is whether or not \npeople know they can get food stamps, whether or not they know they are \neligible, and the outreach programs that will bring people into the \nFood Stamp Program. That is where I believe we have met that \nobligation. The Lugar proposal does not. It is important to go out and \nget people to understand they are eligible for the Food Stamp Program. \nSo we included a number of provisions to make sure that information \nabout the Food Stamp Program and the applications are made available to \neligible people who are not now participating in the program.\n\n  We also include pilot programs, testing different ways to go out and \nreach people. Those pilot programs are not in the Lugar proposal.\n  The committee bill also includes provisions that will help able-\nbodied adults without dependents--subject to time limits under the Food \nStamp Program rules--to find jobs. For example, the committee bill \nallows a rigorous job search activity to count as a work requirement \nfor able-bodied people without dependents. Quite frankly, if people are \nmaking an honest effort to find work, if they are in an approved job \nsearch program, why should they be penalized? They should be eligible. \nWe have that in our bill. That is not in the Lugar proposal.\n  In our bill we have also designated funds specifically for employment \nand training activities for this very group of people. While States \nshould have flexibility to use their employment and training funding as \nthey see fit, they should be able to draw upon a special reserve for \npeople who are subject to a time limit. If there is a time limit, they \nought to be able to have some leeway for employment and training \nactivities. Again, we have that in our bill. That is not in the Lugar \nproposal.\n  Our bill also acknowledges that people who participate in employment \nand training activities have certain additional expenses, such as \ntransportation. If they are looking for a job--let's say they are in a \ntraining activity. They may have to go clear across town or across the \ncity to this training activity. That costs money. We increase the \namount of money available to States to help defray those costs. That is \nin our bill. That is not in the Lugar proposal.\n  Another key difference between what is in the committee-passed bill \nand Senator Lugar's proposal is that we include a substantial commodity \npurchase of $780 million over 5 years. At least $50 million of that \nwill go to purchase fruits and vegetables for the School Lunch Program. \nAt least $40 million a year must be used to purchase commodities for \nthe TEFAP Program--The Emergency Food Assistance Program. Again, \nSenator Lugar's proposal only provides funding for TEFAP commodities, \nnot for the School Lunch Program. Again, if we are talking about low-\nincome families on food stamps who need nutritional help, it is their \nkids who are in school who get the free meals--free or reduced-price \nmeals; mostly free in this case. So we provide money in the bill to go \nout and buy apples and to buy oranges and to buy other fruits and other \nvegetables for the School Lunch Program to meet the free and reduced-\nprice School Lunch Program for these needy kids. That is not in the \nLugar proposal. We provide $40 million for the TEFAP Program; Senator \nLugar provides $30 million, $10 million less.\n\n  We also included a pilot program. This may seem insignificant, but I \ndon't think so. We included a pilot program to test in public schools \nin four States to see whether or not distributing free fruits and \nvegetables is beneficial and whether students would take advantage of \nthat. In other words, the idea is, if a student is in a public school, \nrather than going to the vending machine and putting in their 75 cents \nor a dollar now and getting a candy bar or something like that--usually \nin the vending machines there is candy, and then down at the bottom \nthere is usually an apple at the same price--the kid is not going to \nbuy the apple.\n  Let's say you provided in the school lunchroom free apples, free \noranges. Let's say a student has a hunger pain. They can go to that \nvending machine and put in their $1 or 75 cents or they can go to the \nlunchroom and pick up a free apple. We provide for that pilot program \nin four States. That is not in the Lugar proposal. This would also be a \nproposal beneficial to our fruit and vegetable growers. Certain \nvegetables we are talking about--carrots, broccoli, whatever, celery, \ndifferent things such as that--that kids could get free under this \npilot program, it is not included in the Lugar proposal.\n  We also in our bill include a provision to strengthen nutrition \neducation efforts in the Food Stamp Program. A lot of people in the \nFood Stamp Program use their food stamps and they buy Twinkies and \npotato chips and fat-filled kinds of food. It may not be very \nnutritious. We need more nutrition education in the Food Stamp Program. \nWe include a provision to strengthen that. I do not believe that is in \nthe Lugar proposal.\n  There is one other point I want to make, and that is in terms of \nwhether or not people who are in certain programs, who rely on certain \nprograms for noncash assistance, such as the Temporary Assistance to \nNeedy Families--if you are getting child care and things such as that, \nif you are in that category, basically we are saying you should be \neligible for the Food Stamp Program. You should not have to go back and \nqualify for this, qualify for that, and go through all the redtape. \nSenator Lugar includes a provision that would have the effect of making \npeople who rely on this noncash assistance ineligible for the Food \nStamp Program. Again, a lot of times these people use the Food Stamp \nProgram as a boost to help get back on the road to self-sufficiency.\n  Last year we worked to give States the option of liberalizing the \nfood stamp vehicle. A number of States have already done this. They \nhave changed their policies on the value of a car you can have. I \nwonder if it is going a bit far, as Senator Lugar does, to require that \nall States exclude all vehicles from consideration in determining food \nstamp eligibility. We want to liberalize it. I think my State is way \ntoo low. When you have a State that says you can only have a car worth \n$3,500, these are the people who need transportation to go back and \nforth to work. That is the kind of car that breaks down all the time. \nThese rules ought to be raised. Some States are much higher.\n  I stand to be corrected, but I think Utah, for example, is several \nthousand--maybe more than that--higher in an automobile. It just makes \nsense to allow a person to have a decent car that doesn't break down \nall the time.\n  Senator Lugar says we will require all the States to exclude all \nvehicles, as I read the amendment. I could be corrected on that, but \nthat is the way I read it. That is going a bit far. We ought to let the \nStates rate the eligibility, but to require them to exclude all \nvehicles may be loosening it up too much.\n\n  The restoration of the immigrant benefits provision is very \ncontroversial to some people. We tried to take a targeted approach \nwhere benefits are restored to the most needy legal immigrants; that \nis, children, the disabled, refugees, asylum seekers. We say the kids \nwho are of legal immigrants should not have to wait to get food stamps. \nAgain, this is in line with our thinking that if you are a child, you \nought to get nutrition because it saves on health care. We know that \nchildren who receive nutrition learn better. They will be better \nstudents. As far as kids go, we are saying: If you are a child of a \nlegal immigrant, you should get food stamps now.\n  As I read the Lugar amendment, he says they have to wait 5 years--all \nimmigrants who have been in the United States for at least 5 years. \nUnder the committee-passed bill, we don't wait 5 years to restore \nbenefits to children. We do it immediately, not 5 years from today.\n\n[[Page S12993]]\n\n  Again, there are some significant differences between what Senator \nLugar is proposing and what we have done in the committee. It is true, \nI admit quite frankly, that Senator Lugar puts more money into \nnutrition than we do. That is true. But I still will say that in terms \nof the program that most needy people rely on to meet their nutritional \nneeds--that is, the Food Stamp Program--the most critical part of that \nis outreach, information, and support to people who are not now \napplying but who are eligible to get into the Food Stamp Program. That \nis what we do. That doesn't cost a lot of money. And if it does get \npeople into the program, and they get food stamps, that is not counted. \nThat is not counted on our ledger sheet.\n  I believe our bill actually will provide more nutritional support to \npeople than the Lugar proposal, even though it doesn't show up on the \nbalance sheet as such.\n  The other part is simply the fact that where Senator Lugar is getting \nthe money for this really does upset the balance we had in our \ncommodity programs. I don't think this is the time to demolish farm \ncommodity programs in order to adopt a wholly untested voucher system \nas a total replacement. That is the other side of this amendment. Farm \nprograms are not perfect. I will be the first to admit it. But we \ncannot abandon the safety net at a time when it is obviously inadequate \nalready.\n  What this amendment does is weaken help for all program crops--dairy, \nsugar, peanuts, everything--and it replaces it with a voucher program \nwhereby a farmer can go out with a voucher and get crop insurance and \ncan get insurance, not just for destruction of crops but for lack of \nincome. It has been untested. We don't know if it would work.\n  This is something that probably ought to be done on a pilot program \nbasis at some point, but not right now, a whole commodity program that \nwe have structured. Quite frankly, I believe that on our committee we \nhave a lot of expertise. We have Senators on both sides who have been \ninvolved in agriculture for a long time. We have former Governors on \nour committee. We have former Congressmen on our committee. We have \npeople who have been on the agriculture committees of their State \nlegislatures, of the House of Representatives, and now in the Senate. \nWe have people with a lot of expertise in agriculture on our committee.\n  These are not people who just sort of off the cuff decide to do \nsomething in agriculture. These are people, Senators, such as the \npresent occupant of the Chair, who think very deeply about what is best \nfor their people and what is best for the commodities in their State.\n  The Senators know their commodities and the programs. So we hammered \nout and worked out compromises and a commodity structured program that \nwill benefit all of agriculture in America. Again, it may not be \nperfect. I daresay I haven't seen a Government program yet that is \nperfect. But to throw it all out the window and to substitute this \nuntested, untried voucher program when we have no basis to understand \nhow it would ever work right now would cause chaos and disruption all \nover agricultural America.\n  On the nutrition side, I believe that our approach, the committee \napproach we have come out with is responsible, reasonable; it gets to \nthe kids who need nutrition; and it has a good outreach program to make \nsure people who are not on food stamps understand it. On the other \nhand, on the commodity side, I believe our commodity program is well \nstructured, sound, responsible, evenhanded all over America, and it is \nbuilt upon programs and ideas that we know work. We know direct \npayments work. We know loan rates work. We know that conservation \npayments work. These things out there have been tested and tried and \nthey work. Now is not the time to pull the rug out from underneath our \nfarmers for an untested program.\n  For both of those reasons--on the commodity side and nutrition side--\nI respectfully oppose the Lugar amendment and urge all Senators to \nsupport the well-thought-out, responsible nutrition title that we \nbrought out from the committee. It is good, solid, and it is something \nfor which I think we can be proud.\n  With that, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I respectfully say to my distinguished \ncolleague that the only well-thought-out aspect of the bill before us \nare thoughts as to how a Senator might be enticed by more money for \nparticular crops for his or her State. It is a catchall bill. It really \nhas no particular philosophy. One subsidy is piled on top of another.\n  That is my point. Somebody has to bring an end to this chaos. The \nchaos is not going to be joyous if continued as the Senator from Iowa \npointed out. Sixty percent of farmers get nothing from this; they are \nnot going to get a dime. I hope that understanding finally comes \nthrough to agricultural America. This bill is targeted at a very few \nfarmers. Forty percent at least have a chance; but as a matter of fact, \nas we pointed out numerous times, half of the payments go to 8 percent \nof those farmers who have a chance. And very sharply, large percentages \ngo to a very few that fall behind the top 8 percent. In fact, by the \ntime you get to the top 20 percent, 80 percent of the money is gone, \neven for that segment that is getting something.\n  This bill has been a grab bag of trying to figure out how various \nSenators might be enticed into a coalition if a certain amount of money \nwas promised, regardless of who it goes to--the size of the farmers and \nthe problems of the farmers notwithstanding. I have tried to shake up \nthe order and say that if we are going to distribute money, let us do \nso to all farmers, all States, all crops, all animals, as opposed to \nthe very few that are clearly the targets of the bill that came out of \nthe Agriculture Committee.\n  The chairman is right. We have been doing it this way for almost 70 \nyears. With increasing overproduction, increasing reduction of prices, \nthis bill stomps down prices. They have no chance to come up. I hope \nthere will not be any speeches next year on why prices are at an \nalltime low. Of course, they are going to be low. If you stimulate \noverproduction, they will go down every time. We have been doing that \nconsistently year after year. To suggest that chaos ensues because you \ntry to bring an end to this seems to me not very logical.\n  I admit that it would be a total surprise to the country if all \nfarmers shared, if all States shared--a remarkable surprise. I think it \nwould be a good surprise, as a matter of fact. That is why I am \nsuggesting what is admittedly a very large change. We are winding up \nthe old and trying out a true safety net for all of us in agriculture.\n  Let me respond briefly on the nutrition side. The distinguished \nchairman has pointed out what he believes are deficiencies in my \napproach. Let me say that, at the bottom line, we may not provide as \nmuch information about how you get the benefits, and perhaps that is a \ndeficiency, but we simply provide more food, more nutrition for \nmillions more Americans. That is pretty fundamental.\n  The outlays in our bill are $4.1 billion, and the chairman's bill is \n$2.1 billion. That is twice as much food. In ours, the budget authority \nis 3.7 and his is 1.6--twice again. It is very hard to match the \nquantity of the service, the number of people being affected, by \ngetting into the particulars.\n  Having said that, I am perfectly willing to work with the chairman, \nas he knows, to try to find whatever deficiencies we can meet, making \ncertain that all Americans know of the possibility for whole meals. \nThat is our intent, to have a very strong nutrition safety net with the \nassistance of almost every group in our society; they have been working \nat this longer than the chairman and I have.\n  I hope Members will vote for my amendment. I believe it is a \nsignificant change that will lead not only to less subsidization but to \nhigher prices, higher real market values that come to farmers, with a \nsafety net in the event there are weather disasters, trade disasters, \nand other things well beyond the ability of farmers to control.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Lugar \namendment to the Farm bill before us and to\n\n[[Page S12994]]\n\nexpress my strong support for the nutrition provisions included in the \nunderlying bill as introduced by Senator Harkin.\n  I want to make it clear that while I appreciate Senator Lugar's \ninvestment in food stamps and food nutrition programs, I oppose the \nLugar provisions on the commodity title because it undermines a crucial \nsafety net for our Nation's farmers. These commodity assistance \nprograms are vital to the competitiveness and survival of the U.S. \nfarming base and the rural communities that depend on a healthy \nagricultural economy.\n  I applaud Senator Lugar's attention to the need to expand the Food \nStamp Program in this difficult economic time. The Food Stamp Program \nis one of the most effective and efficient ways we directly help low-\nincome families, and the elderly and disabled. The language in Senator \nHarkin's bill will make this important program more efficient and \neffective for those who rely on it most.\n  There is no doubt that the economy is weaker than it was at this time \nlast year--or even this summer when we passed President Bush's tax \ncuts. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, announced on \nMonday that the country has a $63 billion deficit in the first 2 months \nof the new fiscal year. CBO's report attributes most of the extra \nspending to increased Medicaid costs and unemployment benefit claims.\n  This does not surprise me, especially when one considers these \nindicators of the current state of Washington's economy: Unemployment \nrose a half-point in October to reach 6.6 percent in the State--the \nhighest rate in the Nation; new claims filed for unemployment insurance \nclaims rose 33 percent over the same month last year; we now have the \nhighest number of initial unemployment insurance claims since 1981; and \nunfortunately, one of our strongest and most stable employers--Boeing--\nhas announced that 14,000 of its workers in Washington State are going \nto be out of a job by next summer. This news is absolutely devastating \nfor my State--according to the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, for every \nBoeing job lost the region loses another 1.7 jobs.\n  There is no doubt that our economy works best when people are \nworking. But when people lose their jobs, they need help to manage \ntheir unemployment, train for new jobs, and make an easy transition to \nnew careers. And this includes broad-based assistance to families, \nespecially through the food stamp and other Federal nutrition programs. \nIf families are hungry and not meeting their basic needs, they \ncertainly cannot focus on the training they need to attain long-term \nstability and self-sufficiency.\n  I believe that strengthening the Food Stamp Program to assist low-\nwage workers and those recently out of work is a critical component of \nCongress's response to the weakening economy. Unfortunately, as the \neconomy deteriorates many working families are joining the lines at \nlocal food banks. Just this week, the Seattle Times reported on the \nfood shortages in our area food banks and the fact that so many \nfamilies are now seeking assistance from the very food banks to which \nthey once donated. In fact, food stamp participation in Washington \nState increased over the last 12 months by 8.2 percent. But I am \nparticularly concerned about those who are eligible for food stamps but \ndo not use them since we passed the 1996 welfare reform legislation, \nfood stamp participation rate decreased 32.2 percent in Washington \nState.\n  Sadly, the percentage of households with children facing food \ninsecurity--those who do not know where their next meal is coming \nfrom--is higher in Washington State than across the rest of the \ncountry. And food insecurity among emergency food recipients--those \ngoing to food banks, to emergency kitchens and shelters--is nearly 50 \npercent higher in Washington than the rest of the country. And this is \ndespite the fact that over 315,000 people in the State of Washington \nparticipate in the Food Stamp Program, and 153,000 people participate \nin the Women, Infants, and Children, WIC, Program.\n  I strongly support the nutrition provisions in the underlying bill. \nIn order to address the increasing need for food stamp and other \nFederal nutrition support, Senator Harkin has increased mandatory food \nstamp spending by $6.2 billion over the next 10 years.\n  The Harkin Farm bill provides an extension for transitional food \nstamps for families moving from welfare to work; extension of benefits \nfor adults without dependents; and increased funding for the employment \nand training program. The bill would allow households with children to \nset aside larger amounts of income before the food stamp benefits would \nbegin to phase out.\n  Importantly, the bill simplifies the program for State administrators \nand participating families. Specifically, it simplifies income and \nresource counting, calculation of expenses for deductions, and \ndetermination of ongoing eligibility in the program. Together, these \nimprovements will help both States and recipients because they lower \nburdens and increase coordination with other programs, such as \nMedicare, TANF, and child care, that the States administer.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill restores food stamp benefits \nfor all legal immigrant children and persons with disabilities. \nAccording to Census data, 27 percent of children in poverty live in \nimmigrant families, 21 percent are citizen children of immigrant \nparents, and 6 percent are immigrants themselves.\n  Unfortunately, many citizen children of legal immigrants who remain \neligible for the Food Stamp Program are not participating. Many of \ntheir families are confused about food stamp eligibility rules, and in \nsome cases, the child's benefit is too small for the household to \ninvest the effort to maintain eligibility. In fact, since 1994, over 1 \nmillion citizen children with immigrant parents have left the program \ndespite remaining eligible.\n  After the Federal Government eliminated food stamp benefits for legal \nimmigrants Washington State was the first State to put its own funds \ntoward restoring food stamp eligibility for legal immigrants. The State \nFood Assistance Program uses State funds to support legal immigrants \nwho were disqualified as a result of the 1996 welfare reform law. In \nfact, 11 percent of all food assistance clients in WA State are legal \nimmigrants. This bill restores the Federal commitment to ensuring that \nlegal immigrants have access to these important Federal programs.\n  When we passed President Bush's tax cut, I said that I believed the \ncountry is at a critical juncture in setting our fiscal priorities--\ndeciding between maintaining our fiscal discipline and investing in the \nNation's future education and health care needs, or cutting the very \nservices used daily by our citizens. That statement is even more \nrelevant today. Passing the food stamp expansions included in the \nHarkin Farm bill gives working families struggling to make ends meet \nthe security they need in these uncertain times.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nis charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, my understanding is that I have a minute \nand a half, which is declining as time goes by equally charged to both \nsides. So as opposed to seeing all of that decline, let me say I am \nmost hopeful we are going to have a strong vote for the Lugar amendment \nbecause I believe it is a good amendment for all Americans.\n  I stress that because sometimes in our zeal in these agricultural \ndebates we are doing the very best we can for those in agricultural \nAmerica, and that may be in many of our States as much as 2 percent of \nthe population. But the rest of America also listens to this debate and \nwonders why there should be, as in the underlying bill, a transfer of \n$172 billion over the next 10 years from some Americans to a very few \nAmericans--particularly, if 60 percent of the farmers don't participate \nat all and if it is narrowed to those who have very large farms. Most \nAmericans, when confronted with that proposition, don't like it.\n\n[[Page S12995]]\n\n  I am preaching today, I suppose, to the choir of all Americans and \nhoping that agricultural America also understands that if we are ever \nto have higher prices and market solutions on farms, we must get rid of \nthe subsidies that are a part of the underlying bill. And I do that. At \nthe same time, I provide assurance and a safety net which I believe is \nequitable to all farmers and likewise to all Americans who look into \nthis and find at least some hope for farm legislation as we discuss the \nLugar amendment. I ask for the support of my colleagues. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Indiana just mentioned in \nrebuttal to my remarks about how not all farmers are getting benefits \nunder this farm program. He is right. I believe the committee bill \nbegins to change that somewhat. We include a conservation title in our \nbill that was supported unanimously by the committee that will begin to \ndirect some funds toward those farmers who have not been included in \nour farm programs in the past--our vegetable farmers, organic farmers, \nfruits, minor crops. Now they will be able to get benefits from farm \nprograms if they practice responsible stewardship of the land, protect \nthe soil, and protect the water.\n  Quite frankly, I believe this is going to be one of the best \nprovisions for other areas of the country that have not participated \nbefore in our farm programs. That is in the committee bill. I know \nSenator Lugar's amendment does not touch that, but I understand there \nis going to be an amendment offered by Senators Cochran and Roberts \nthat will take that away.\n  I hope those who believe that we have to expand our reach and include \nmore farmers in our farm programs will oppose that amendment because \nthis is the one element that will go out to help those smaller farmers \nand the farmers who have not been in the major crops before.\n  We also have an energy title. That energy title is new in this bill. \nAgain, the Lugar amendment does not touch that. I understand that. I am \nnot talking about that. The Cochran-Roberts amendment will basically \ndefund all that. That is another provision that can help a lot of our \nsmaller farmers and others who have not been included in farm programs \nin the past.\n  I wanted to make the point we have taken strides to reach out in this \nbill to get farm program benefits to all regions of America.\n  Senator Lugar also spoke about low prices and overproduction. The \nanswer to low farm prices is not to idle half of America and to put all \nthese farms out of business. That certainly should not be our answer. \nIf you like imported oil, you will love imported food. That seems to be \nthe answer. We will just shut down all the farms in America and buy our \nfood from overseas. Good luck when that starts happening.\n  We need agriculture. We need food security for our own Nation. We \nneed to find new markets, new outlets for the great productivity, the \ngreat production capacity of American agriculture. That is what we \nneed--new markets.\n  Conservation is a marker. I believe energy is a new marker. Whatever \nwe can make from a barrel of oil we can make from a bushel of soybeans \nor a bushel of corn or a bushel of wheat. Biomass energy, plastics, \nbiodiesel, ethanol--think of the possibilities--pharmaceuticals. There \nare all kinds of items that come from our crops that we have not even \ntried. I believe that is what this bill also starts to do: find those \nnew markets for the great productive capacity of America in \nagriculture.\n  The answer is not just to shut down half of America. That is not the \nanswer at all. Think what that is going to do to our small towns, our \nrural communities, our families if we do that.\n\n  We have to keep the production going. We have to find new markets, \nand that is what we start to do in this bill.\n  I believe also we have met all of the objectives of the nutrition \ncommunity. We met with them. They testified before our committee on \nmore than one occasion. Quite frankly, we met basically their \nobjectives.\n  I also point out when Senator Lugar says he provides more money for \nfood--maybe yes, maybe no. Really what the Lugar amendment does is it \nincreases the standard deduction a little bit. There are some \nadditional provisions for able-bodied adults without dependents, but \nmost of the money that is in the Lugar amendment is in simplifying \nrules, in simplifying programs. We include some of those in ours, but \nhe goes a little bit further.\n  I still believe the most important thing we can do is to provide the \nunderpinning of nutrition, as we did in the committee bill, and then do \nmore outreach to make sure people who are eligible for food stamps know \nthey can get them and make it easier for them to apply for food stamps. \nWe do that in our bill. That outreach, quite frankly, is not in the \nLugar amendment.\n  I think it is arguable whether the Senator provides more food than we \ndo. I believe I can make the case we actually would provide more food \nbecause we do more outreach and get more people involved in the Food \nStamp Program. We provide better commodity purchases for our school \nlunch programs. I believe that is a wash. Keep in mind the Lugar \namendment destroys all our commodity programs, and we are not going to \ndo that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand all time has expired. I move to table the \nLugar amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are making progress on the farm bill. \nWe have a couple of big amendments that were very thoroughly debated \nand voted on. We are ready to move ahead with other amendments. We are \nready to move on. If other Senators have amendments, we are open for \nbusiness. We hope people will come forward. We have maybe some \nreasonable time limits. On the Lugar amendment we had a decent time \nlimit. We debated it thoroughly.\n  It is vitally important that we finish this farm bill and that we do \nit expeditiously. I do not know exactly when we are going to go home \nfor Christmas. This farm bill needs to be finished. We need to finish \nit expeditiously. The House passed their bill, and we need to pass ours \nand go to conference.\n  We can finish this bill today. I see no reason we can't finish it \ntoday if we have some healthy debate on a couple more amendments. I \nknow Senators Cochran and Roberts have an amendment they want to offer, \nwhich is a major amendment. We could debate that today and have a vote \non that\n\n[[Page S12996]]\n\ntoday. There are perhaps other amendments. I haven't seen any, but I \nhave heard about some. I think we could move through this bill today \nand get it finished and go to conference.\n  I urge all Senators who have amendments to come to the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield to my friend from North Dakota \nfor a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I certainly share the Senator's interest \nin trying to conclude this farm bill or consideration of the farm bill. \nI am wondering, is there any opportunity at some point today to attempt \nto get a list of those who have amendments who wish to offer them on \nthis legislation?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think the Senator has made a good suggestion and a good \ninquiry. I hope that at sometime today, with the leaders of both sides, \nwe can have a finite list of amendments, that we can agree on those, \nand move ahead, because if we do not, we will just be here day after \nday after day after day, and, as the Senator well knows from his \nexperience here, this could go on indefinitely.\n  So we do need to get a finite list. I hope we can get that done, I \nsay to my friend.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further, I know it is certainly \nthe goal of the Senator from Iowa to get a bill through the Senate, \nhave a conference, and then get it on the President's desk for \nsignature before we conclude this session of Congress. While I know \nthat is ambitious, it certainly is achievable. I think we have the \nopportunity to finish this bill today or tomorrow. I know the chairman \nof the House Agriculture Committee is very anxious to go to conference.\n  Is the Senator aware that the chairman of the House committee has \nindicated he is very anxious to begin a conference, which suggests if \nwe can get a bill completed through the Senate, and get it to \nconference, we will be able to perhaps get it out of conference and on \nto the White House?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from North Dakota, I think it is \ndefinitely possible we can get this done. I know that Congressman \nCombest and Congressman Stenholm, the two leaders of the Agriculture \nCommittee on the House side, are anxious to get to conference. They \nhave basically looked over what we have here, and we have looked over \nwhat they have in their bill. Really, I do not think the conference \nwould take that long. But we just have to get it out of the Senate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. One final question, if I might. I suspect the Senator \nfrom Iowa has been asked a dozen times now, before 11 o'clock, when we \nare going to finish this session of Congress or when we are going to \nfinish this bill. I think everyone around here kind of wants to know \nwhen this session of Congress might end.\n  That makes it all the more urgent we finish our work on this bill \nbecause this bill, the stimulus, Defense appropriations, and a couple \nof others need to be completed. I appreciate the work of the Senator \nfrom Iowa and the Senator from Indiana. And I know the Senator from \nMississippi is going to have an amendment.\n  I really hope we can have a good debate on important farm policy and \nthen proceed along and see if we can get this bill into conference in \nthe next 24, 48 hours. I appreciate the work of the Senator from Iowa \nand the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Seeing the Senator from Minnesota, who wants to speak, I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Feingold). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, while the leader is on the floor and while \nMr. Baucus is on the floor, will the Senator yield to me for 5 minutes?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Does the committee have permission to meet?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't know.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No.\n  Mr. BYRD. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, what is \nthe rule with respect to the meeting of committees during the operation \nof the Senate while the Senate is in session?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. When the Senate is in session, the committees \nmay meet for 2 hours, but not beyond that, and not beyond 2 p.m.\n  Mr. BYRD. As of today, when would that time expire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 11:30.\n  Mr. BYRD. At 11:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 11:30 a.m.\n  Mr. BYRD. So the committee may not meet after 11:30 without the \npermission of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I put the Senate on notice I will object to that committee \nmeeting after 11:30 today while the Senate is in session.\n  Mr. President, along that line, may I say I have asked the chairman \nof the Finance Committee to give some of those of us who are opposed to \nfast track an opportunity to appear before the committee. I am not on \nthe Finance Committee. I would like to have an opportunity to appear \nbefore that committee and speak against fast track. That is all I am \nasking.\n  I made that personal request of the chairman of the committee \nyesterday, and he said: Well, I could appear before the committee after \nit had acted on fast track, after it had marked up the bill.\n  Well, there is no point in my appearing before the committee after it \nhas marked up the bill. That is a really silly suggestion, if I might \nsay so: I will make my impassioned plea to the committee after the \ncommittee has met and marked up the bill. Why should I go appear before \nthe committee after that committee has marked up the bill? What a silly \nproposition.\n  Mr. President, there are those of us--there are a few around here--\nwho object to fast track. And I am sorry the distinguished chairman of \nthat committee said no.\n  Now, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I don't think I \nwould say that to any Senator. I would not say it to a Republican \nSenator; I would not say it to a Democratic Senator. The very idea, on \na matter as important as fast track to discuss around here--I am just \ndisappointed a Senator would get that kind of a brushoff.\n\n  Now understand, I went to the distinguished chairman yesterday and \nasked him if he would mind putting that matter off and allow some of \nus--or a few of us; I know one Senator who is against fast track--to \nallow us to appear before the committee. And I got kind of a brushoff, \nI would say. Well, all I could say was I was disappointed. I am still \ndisappointed.\n  Let me read a section of the Constitution to Senators. Section 7 of \narticle I, paragraph 1:\n\n       All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House \n     of Representatives; but----\n\n  Get this----\n\n     but----\n  Mr. President, may we have order in the rear of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order, please.\n  Mr. BYRD. So I come to the conjunction ``but''--paragraph 1, section \n7, article I, of the U.S. Constitution. Here is what it says:\n\n     but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on \n     other Bills.\n\n  Now, we all know that when fast track is brought to the Senate, \nSenators may not propose amendments. In my way of reading the \nConstitution, that is not in accordance with what the Constitution \nsays. What did the Framers mean? It is obvious that they meant the \nSenate could amend on any bill.\n  Let me read the whole section again, the whole paragraph, section 7:\n\n\n[[Page S12997]]\n\n\n       All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House \n     of Representatives; but----\n\nB-U-T----\n\n     the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other \n     Bills.\n\n  It doesn't say it ``shall.'' The Senate may not want to offer any \namendments, but it ``may.''\n  But now we come along with this so-called trade promotion authority. \nHa, what a misnomer that is. And that is plain old fast track. And a \nlot of Senators and House Members are going to go to their oblivion on \nfast track if the people back home ever wake up to what is going on.\n\n     . . . but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as \n     on other Bills.\n\n  It doesn't say ``on some other Bills'' or ``on certain other Bills.'' \nIt says ``as on other Bills.''\n  It seems to me the Senate has a right to amend. And I know there are \nsome of us who sought to appear before the Supreme Court on the subject \nof the line-item veto, and the Supreme Court ruled that we do not \nqualify because we personally were not injured by the line-item veto. \nBut on a case which was later brought by parties that did qualify as \nhaving been injured, the Supreme Court ruled the line-item veto was \nunconstitutional.\n  I wonder what the Supreme Court would say about fast track, \nespecially in light of this constitutional provision. I am here to \nraise that question. If the committee can complete its business before \n11:30, that will be in accordance with the rules. But if it doesn't, I \nhope somebody on that committee will make the point that the committee \ndoes not have permission to meet. I would object to any request made \nfor that today.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for \nraising a very important issue at this time. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I may be permitted to speak for up to 15 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield briefly for a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I will yield while retaining my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent that at the cessation of the \nSenator's 15 minutes I be recognized to proceed for up to 15 minutes as \nin morning business, unless the managers of the bill have some business \nrelating to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we should give the Republicans, if they \nwish, 15 minutes in morning business following the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, much has been said during the last weeks, \nregarding the negotiations between the Senate and the House over \neconomic stimulus legislation. Most recently, the rhetoric of House \nRepublican leaders and even a couple of our Senate colleagues has \nbecome heated and even vitriolic. Some of their comments about our \nmajority leader would be expected from a bunch of adolescents in a \njunior high school locker-room. They reflect much more on those who \nutter them than on the person about whom they are intended.\n  The House Republican leadership also seems unduly preoccupied with \nthe process our Senate Democratic Caucus reportedly might use to \nconsider this proposed legislation. I really don't see how that is any \nof their concern. What they should be concerned about, instead, is how \ntheir proposals will affect our national economy and the citizens of \nour country.\n  If people are wondering why we Senate Democrats are being so \nresolute, they should look at what the House Republicans are trying to \nfoist upon us. Remember that their package was called ``show business'' \nby the Secretary of the Treasury. And that's the nicest thing one could \nsay about it! It is a huge bundle of holiday goodies to the people who \nneed them the very least: the wealthiest Americans and the largest \ncorporations.\n  Much of the House bill has nothing to do with providing an economic \nstimulus. Rather, it is a massive giveaway of taxpayer dollars. Take \ntheir proposal to repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax. That is \na provision which requires profitable businesses, with numerous \ndeductions, to pay a minimum amount of corporate taxes. Without it, \nthey would pay little or even nothing.\n  But the House Republicans did not only repeal this tax, they also \nmade it retroactive to 1985, and they would immediately refund all the \nmoney companies paid under this provision during the last 15 years.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, that would result in a lump sum \npayment of $2.3 billion to the Ford Motor Company; $1.4 billion to IBM; \n$671 million to General Electric; $608 million to Texas Utilities \nCompany; $572 million to Chevron Texaco; $254 million to Enron--in \ntotal, $25.4 billion of corporate payouts.\n  It is bad enough that these huge checks come from the U.S. Treasury, \nfrom the taxes paid by working Americans. What is even worse is that \nthey would actually come out of the Social Security Trust Fund's \nsurplus. That is because the surpluses in the other funds--in the \nFederal general fund and in the Medicare Fund--have already been wiped \nout by last spring's excessive tax cut and by the current recession. \nNow the House Republicans want to use the only surplus left: in the \nSocial Security Trust Fund, to give these huge cash payments to mostly \nprofitable corporations, and masquerade them as economic stimulus. \nMinnesota's largest newspaper, the Star-Tribune, in an editorial, \ncalled the House stimulus package, ``. . . a brazen giveaway to \naffluent corporations.'' The Star-Tribune went on to say,\n\n       Senate Republicans vowed to do better--and they introduced \n     an economic stimulus package that is a brazen giveaway to \n     affluent individuals.\n       What the two packages have in common, apart from appeasing \n     narrow constituencies, is that they have turned fiscal \n     stimulus inside out. They would do almost nothing to help the \n     ailing economy today, but would continue to drain away \n     Federal tax revenues for years to come, long after the \n     economy has recovered.\n       To their credit, Senate Republicans rejected most of the \n     corporate tax breaks that somehow found their way into the \n     House fiscal package. Those provisions are so arcane and so \n     irrelevant to the economy's current plight, that they could \n     only have been written by corporate lobbyists.\n       But the Senate GOP approach has an entirely different set \n     of flaws. Its main tactic is to accelerate a series of rate \n     cuts in the individual income tax, cuts that were supposed to \n     phase in during the next several years. Because these rate \n     reductions go exclusively to upper-bracket taxpayers, the \n     Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that 55 \n     percent of the tax relief would go to the top one percent \n     of households. That is bad stimulus policy, because such \n     households, already spending at high levels, tend to save \n     more new money than they spend. It is also disastrous \n     fiscal policy, because three-quarters of the tax cuts \n     would take place after 2002, making Washington's long-term \n     budget outlook even worse than it is today.''\n\n  The Senate Republicans' proposal, which is also the President's \nproposal, would give $500,000 over 4 years to families making $5 \nmillion a year. And that figure illustrates another unwise feature of \ntheir plan. It's not just a one-time, economic stimulus, it gives \ncontinuing tax reductions to the wealthiest Americans, even after an \neconomic recovery is underway.\n  The Republicans' insistence on these egregious proposals is why we \ndon't have an economic stimulus bill today. I want to thank--and I \nbelieve the American people will thank--our Majority Leader, Senator \nDaschle, and our two principal Democratic negotiators, Senator Baucus \nand Senator Rockefeller, for standing strongly against these giveaways, \nand for insisting on a bill that will provide a real, immediate \neconomic stimulus. Our Democratic stimulus bill will direct money to \nworking Americans, to people who have lost their jobs during this \nrecession, and to businesses specifically for reinvestments in our \neconomic recovery.\n  As the negotiations continue, I am hopeful that leaders in both \nHouses, from both parties, will retain those principles.\n\n[[Page S12998]]\n\n  I am approaching the end of my first year of service in the U.S. \nSenate. I remain extraordinarily grateful to the people of Minnesota \nfor giving me this opportunity. It has been a remarkable year for me, \nand for all of us. I have developed an enormous respect for the Senate, \nas an institution, and for many of its Members.\n  Yet, this economic stimulus debate reminds me of what I most disliked \nabout Washington before I arrived here, and what I have seen too much \nof while I have been here. It is the national interest being subverted \nby special interests; subverted by the special interests of the most \naffluent people and the most powerful corporations in America, by the \nindividuals and institutions who already have the most and want more \nand more and more.\n  When I arrived here a year ago, we were looking at optimistic \nforecasts of Federal budget surpluses totaling trillions of dollars \nduring the coming decade. What a wonderful opportunity, I thought we \nall would have to put this money to work for America by improving our \nNation's schools, highways, sewer and water systems, and other \ninfrastructure.\n  What an opportunity for all of us to work together and fulfill a 25-\nyear broken promise that the Federal government would pay for 40 \npercent of the costs of special education in schools throughout this \ncountry. What a tremendous accomplishment in which we could all share: \nprovide better educations and lifetime opportunities to thousands of \nchildren with disabilities; allow school boards and educators to \nrestore funding for regular school programs and services, so that all \nstudents would receive better educations; and reduce the local property \ntax burdens of taxpayers to make up for this broken Federal promise.\n  I thought another of our top priorities would be a prescription drug \nprogram, to help our nation's senior citizens and people with severe \ndisabilities afford the rising costs of their prescription medicines. \nDuring my campaign last year, I listened to so many heartbreaking \nstories of suffering and despair by elderly men and women--the most \nvulnerable, aged, and impoverished among us. They are good people, who \nhave worked hard and been upstanding citizens throughout their lives. \nYet, their retirement years are now being ravaged by the effects of \nthese escalating drug prices on their fixed and limited incomes. Many \nseniors have cried as they told me their stories. Some have even told \nme they prayed to die rather than to continue to live in such \ndesperation.\n  The budget resolution we passed last spring provided $300 billion to \nfund a prescription drug program to help relieve these terrible \nfinancial burdens and to lift these good and deserving people out of \ntheir black despair. Yet, not one piece of legislation to accomplish \nthis purpose has made it to this Senate floor this year. Not one.\n  Now, we're told, these anticipated budget surpluses have disappeared. \nThere won't be enough money to fully fund special education. There \nwon't be enough money for a prescription drug program.\n  Yet, there was enough money last spring to fund a $1.3 trillion tax \ncut--40 percent of whose benefits will go to the wealthiest one percent \nof Americans. Not enough for schoolchildren and the elderly. Over $5 \nbillion to millionaires and billionaires.\n  And now they are at it again. Those in Congress who championed last \nspring's huge tax giveaway are proposing another one under the guise of \nan economic stimulus. And at the very same time, House Republicans on \nthe Education Conference Committee have rejected the Senate's proposal \nto increase funding for special education to its promised 40 percent.\n  They claim the entire IDEA program must first be reformed. Yet, a few \nweeks ago in the House, they passed an energy bill, giving over $30 \nbillion in additional tax breaks to energy companies and utilities. \nThey didn't require any reform from them. The administration hadn't \neven requested these tax breaks--but the House Republicans just gave \nthem to the big energy companies and utilities anyway.\n  There always seems to be enough money around here for the rich and \nthe powerful, be they people, corporations, or other special interests. \nBut there's no money for special education funding for children or for \nprescription drug coverage for seniors.\n  It's very hard for me to understand how 535 Members of Congress, who \nwere elected to represent the best interests of all the American \npeople, could have produced this result. It's very hard for me to \nexplain it to the schoolchildren, parents, educators, and senior \ncitizens I see back in Minnesota. And it's, thus, very, very hard for \nme to witness yet more of the same going into this so-called economic \nstimulus legislation.\n  We should pass a good economic stimulus package. It would benefit our \ncountry. But we would better do nothing than to pass another shameful \nexample of greed and avarice once again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak to a decision \nthat I am told and have read is about to be made by the President--a \nvery significant decision and, I think, an incredibly dangerous one--to \nserve notice that the United States of America is going to withdraw \nfrom the ABM Treaty.\n  Under the treaty, as you know, a President is able to give notice 6 \nmonths in advance of the intention to withdraw.\n  Mr. President, we live in tumultuous times. The transition from the \nold cold war alignments to new patterns of conflict and cooperation is \npicking up speed. This transition is not quiet, but noisy and violent. \nFor 3 months now, it has been propelled by a new war.\n  In the modern world, high technology and rapid communications and \ntransportation put our own country and our own people on the front \nlines of that war. We are on the cutting edge of revolutionary \ndevelopments in everything from medicine to military affairs.\n  We are also on the receiving end of everything from anthrax to the \nattacks of September 11--and we will remain vulnerable in the years to \ncome. The question is: how vulnerable?\n  How shall we deal with this accelerated and violent transition? How \nwell is the Administration dealing with it?\n  And is their primary answer--withdrawing from ABM and building a star \nwars system--at all responsive to our vulnerabilities?\n  We can find some answers in both the experience of the last 3 months \nand the President's speech yesterday at the Citadel.\n  Wars are chaotic events, but they impose a discipline upon us.\n  We must focus on the highest-priority challenges.\n  We must use our resources wisely, rather than trying to satisfy every \nwhim.\n  We must seek out and work with allies, rather than pretending that we \ncan be utterly self-reliant.\n  How well have we done? In the short run, very well indeed.\n  Our people and institutions rose to the occasion on September 11 and \nin the weeks that followed.\n  We took care, and continue to take care, of our victims and their \nfamilies.\n  We resolved to rebuild.\n  We brought force to bear in Afghanistan, and used diplomacy in \nneighboring states and among local factions, to prevail.\n  We have also gained vital support from countries around the world, \nalthough we have been slow to involve them on the ground. We have \nshared intelligence and gained important law enforcement actions in \nEurope in the Middle East, and in Asia.\n  We have begun to take action to combat bioterrorism. At home, we have \nlearned some lessons the hard way and we have accepted the need to do \nmore. We are stepping up vaccine production.\n  But we have yet to take the major actions that are needed to improve \nour public health capabilities at home--or our disease surveillance \ncapabilities overseas, to give us advance notice of epidemics or \npotential biological weapons.\n  Neither have we moved decisively to find new, useful careers for the \nthousands of biological warfare specialists\n\n[[Page S12999]]\n\nin Russia who might otherwise sell their goods their technology or \ntheir capabilities to Iran or Iraq, to Libya, or to well-funded \nterrorists.\n  This is no longer a matter for just those of us who have intelligence \nbriefings to know--and we have known this for a long time. Now the \nworld knows that rogue states and terrorists have, in fact, attempted \nto buy nuclear weapons, biological weapons, and chemical weapons.\n  The President recognizes the problem of bioterrorism, and listed it \nin his speech yesterday. At the Crawford summit, President Putin and he \npromised more cooperation to combat bioterrorism. So far, however, \nthere has been a great deal more talk than action. Al-Qaida's eager \nquest for weapons of mass destruction has, in my view, highlighted and \nbrought home to every American the importance of nonproliferation, of \nclosing down the candy store, so to speak, where all these radical \nwackos go to shop.\n  The President understands this. In his speech yesterday, after \ntalking about the need to modernize our military, he said:\n\n       America's next priority to prevent mass terror is to \n     protect against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \n     and the means to deliver them. . . .\n       Working with other countries, we will strengthen \n     nonproliferation treaties and toughen export controls. \n     Together we must keep the world's most dangerous technology \n     out of the hands of the world's most dangerous people.\n\n  That is correct and well-phrased rhetoric. It gives nonproliferation \na high priority. It recognizes the importance of international \ntreaties. But where, Mr. President, are the actions to match that \nrhetoric? The President offers only a new effort ``to develop a \ncomprehensive strategy on proliferation,'' something he has been \npromising for over a year.\n  Meanwhile, just last week, the United States of America \nsinglehandedly brought to an abrupt and confusing halt the Biological \nWeapons Convention Review Conference that is held every 5 years. Why? \nBecause the administration was determined not to allow any forum for \nthe negotiation of an agreement to strengthen that convention.\n  This was diplomacy as provocation, in my view, and it was and is a \nself-defeating approach. It undermined our efforts to achieve agreement \non proposals we made earlier in the conference, such as to address the \nneed for countries to enact legislation making Biological Weapons \nConvention violations a crime. We asked that it be made a crime to \nviolate the convention. We proposed that, but then we shut down the \nconference, killing even our own proposal, because we did not want any \nfurther discussion or a possible new agreement.\n  The President may understand the need to work with other countries, \nbut some people under his authority do not seem to get it. For that \nmatter, where are the actions to promote nonproliferation across the \nboard?\n  The White House review of our programs in the former Soviet Union has \nbeen limping along for over 10 months. But when the fiscal year 2002 \nbudget was presented, we were told the funds for Nunn-Lugar were being \nreduced. Those are the funds we use to send American personnel to \nRussia to dismantle their nuclear weapons delivery systems their \nstrategic bombers and missiles.\n  We were told that the cut was not permanent, that the reason was they \nwere reviewing whether or not the money was being well spent. While \nthey are reviewing, those nuclear-tipped missiles sit there, and the \ninability of the Russians to dismantle them because of lack of money or \ncapability still exists. Thus, we got promises of new efforts, but in \nthe fiscal year 2002 budget there is actually a cut in these programs. \nThe Department of Defense has left so many funds unspent that \nthe appropriators tried to cut the Nunn-Lugar program just to get the \nPentagon's attention.\n\n  Nonproliferation is, thus, our No. 2 priority, but the engine is \nstill in first gear. The same is true of our supposed top priority: \nmodernizing our military. The vaunted rethinking process in the Defense \nDepartment has yet to produce much that is new, and the fine \nperformance of our forces in Afghanistan owes more to strategy and \nequipment developed in the Gulf War and the ``revolution in military \naffairs'' of the last decade than it does to anything new this year.\n  If you want action with your rhetoric, go down to the No. 3 priority \nin the President's speech: missile defense. Even there, however, the \naction is more diplomatic, or rather undiplomatic. If news reports are \ncorrect--and I know they are, based on my conversation today with the \nSecretary of State--the President will shortly announce his intention \nto withdraw in 6 months' time from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of \n1972.\n  Russia will not like that. Some here will say: So what? What does it \nmatter what Russia likes or does not like? But none of our allies likes \nit either. And China, I predict, will respond with an arms buildup, \nincreasing tensions in South Asia, causing India and Pakistan to \nreconsider whether to increase their nuclear capability and, as strong \nas it sounds, in the near term--meaning in the next several years--this \nwill cause the Japanese to begin a debate about whether or not they \nshould be a nuclear power in an increasingly dangerous neighborhood. \nAll of that is against our national interest.\n  But the President will invoke Article XV of the ABM Treaty, which \nallows a party to withdraw ``if it decides that extraordinary events \nrelated to the subject matter of this Treaty have jeopardized its \nsupreme interest.'' In my view, invoking this clause is a bit of a \nstretch, to say the least. No new enemy has fielded an ICBM missile, \nwhich is the only missile our national missile defense is intended to \nstop. Tactical missile defense is not barred by the ABM Treaty, and \nRussia has said it would even amend the treaty to permit an expanded \nUnited States testing program. So where is the jeopardy to our supreme \ninterest?\n  The administration has said it wants to conduct tests that would \nbreach the ABM Treaty, but the head of the Ballistic Missile Defense \nOrganization in the Pentagon told Congress earlier this year that no \nbreach was needed to do all the tests that were needed and scheduled.\n  Informed scientists say the features added to the test program that \nmight breach the treaty, which the Defense Department presented to the \nArmed Services Committee several months ago, are far from necessary, \nespecially at this time. Phil Coyle, the former chief of testing for \nthe Pentagon, says we can conduct several years of needed testing \nwithout having to breach the treaty's terms.\n  The administration wants to build an Alaska test bed with several \nmissile silos at Fort Greely that it says could be used for an \nemergency deployment. But the new interceptor missile for the missile \ndefense will not be ready yet. The so-called ``kill vehicle,'' the \nthing that separates from the interceptor missile and hits the incoming \nwarhead, will not have been tested against realistic targets yet. And \nthe radars supporting this system, the battle management capabilities, \nare pointed at Russia, so they will not even see a North Korean missile \nas it flies into southern California, following the scenario cited by \nthose who try to justify building a limited missile defense system.\n  So where is the real action on missile defense? Is the announcement \nof our intent to withdraw from the ABM Treaty a real action, or is it a \nWhite House Christmas present for the right wing, who dislike arms \ncontrol under any circumstances and see this season of success in \nAfghanistan, unity on foreign policy, and Christmas as a propitious \nmoment to make this announcement?\n  Is now the time for unilateral moves--now, while we are still \nbuilding coalitions for a changed world in which old enemies can reduce \ntheir differences, at a minimum on the margins, and maybe even work \ntogether out of their own self-interest?\n  We are in a time of great risk. But there is also great opportunity. \nDespite the horrors visited upon us on September 11, the truth is we \nwere attacked by the weakest of enemies. Al-Qaida is a group that no \ncivilized state can tolerate. It was sheltered by a regime with almost \nno international legitimacy and little support, even in its own land. \nIts goals and methods were so extreme as to be an object lesson to the \nworld on why we must oppose all international terrorism. Many of its\n\n[[Page S13000]]\n\nmembers and supporters, lacking in Afghanistan the popular support that \nin other wars have enabled guerillas to blend into the landscape, were \nleft to fight an armed conflict in which our side could readily \nprevail, as we have done.\n  Meanwhile, the vast majority of countries, including some longtime \nadversaries, have lined on up on our side. Their cooperation has been \nand will remain important in our war effort, in the war against \nterrorism. The war has also opened doors that have been shut for many \nyears. Opportunities have expanded for cooperation on issues of mutual \nconcern. As the President said yesterday at the Citadel:\n\n       All at once, a new threat to civilization is erasing old \n     lines of rivalry and resentment between nations. Russia and \n     America are building a new cooperative relationship.\n\n  We must seize the opportunity that this war has afforded us. \nClausewitz long ago explained that triumph in war lies not so much in \nwinning battles, but in following up on your victories. The same is \ntrue in the broader arena of international politics. We must follow up \non the cooperation of the moment and turn it into a realignment of \nforces for decades to come--so that our grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren can look back on the 21st century and say that it did not \nreplicate the carnage of the 20th century.\n  How many Presidents get that opportunity? How many times does a \nnation have that potential?\n  Withdrawal from the ABM Treaty will not make nonproliferation, which \nshould be our highest priority and which combats our clearest danger, \nany easier to achieve. I find that especially worrisome.\n  A year ago we were on the verge of a deal with North Korea to end \nthat country's long-range ballistic missile program and its sales of \nmissiles and missile technology. Now we seem far away from such a deal, \npursuing instead a missile defense that will be lucky to defend against \na first-generation attack, let alone one with simple countermeasures, \nuntil the year 2010 or much later. What good will a missile defense in \nAlaska do, if North Korea threatens Japan or sells to countries that \nwould attack our allies in Europe, or sells to terrorist groups that \nwould put a nuclear weapon in the hull of a rusty tanker coming up the \nDelaware River or into New York Harbor or San Francisco Bay? How does \nwithdrawal from the ABM Treaty help defend against those much more \nrealistic, near-term threats?\n  What expenditures of money are we going to engage in? How are we \ngoing to deal with what Senator Baker, our Ambassador to Japan and \nformer Republican leader, said is the single most urgent unmet threat \nthat America faces, made real by the knowledge that al-Qaida was trying \nto purchase a nuclear capability?\n  We must corral the fissile material and nuclear material in Russia as \nwell as their chemical weapons. The Baker-Cutler report laid out \nclearly for us a specific program that would cost $30 billion over the \nnext 8 to 10 years, to shut down one department--the nuclear \ndepartment--of the candy store that everyone is shopping in.\n\n  Senator Lugar actually went to a facility with the Russian military \nthat housed chemical weapons. He describes it as a clapboard building \nwith windows and a padlock on the door, although its security has been \nimproved with our help. He could fit three Howitzer shells in his \nbriefcase. Those shells could do incredible damage to America.\n  How does withdrawal from the ABM Treaty defend against any of that? \nWhich is more likely--an ICBM attack from a nation that does not now \npossess the capability, with a return address on it, knowing that \ncertain annihilation would follow if one engaged in the attack; or the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction technology and weaponry, \nso it can be used surreptitiously?\n  If you walk away from a treaty with Russia, will that make Russia \nmore inclined to stop its assistance to the Iranian missile program? Or \nwill Russia be more attempted to continue that assistance? Russia has \nnow stated, in a change from what they implied would happen after \nCrawford, that expansion of NATO, particularly to include the Baltic \nStates, is not something they can likely tolerate--not that we should \nlet that influence our decisions on NATO enlargement. Which do we gain \nmore by--expanding NATO to the Baltic States, or scuttling the ABM \nTreaty with no immediate promises of gaining a real ability to protect \nagainst any of our genuine and immediate threats? If we end the ABM \nTreaty, will Russia stop nuclear deals of the sort that led us to \nsanction Russian institutions, or will it cozy up to Iran's illegal \nnuclear weapons program?\n  The President made nonproliferation the No. 2 priority yesterday and \nmissile defense No. 3. I truly fear, however, that his impending \nactions on that third priority will torpedo his actions on his No. 2 \npriority. If that should occur, we and our allies will surely be the \nlosers.\n  So far, the administration's conduct in the war on terrorism has \nshown discipline, perseverance, the ability to forge international \nconsensus, and the flexibility to assume roles in the Middle East and \nin Afghanistan that the administration had hoped it could avoid. In \nthis regard, the American people have been well served, and I \ncompliment the President.\n  The war is only 3 months old, however, and the new patterns of \ncooperation and support are young and fragile. We should nourish them \nand build on them. This is not the time to throw brickbats in Geneva or \nto thumb our noses at treaties.\n  We read in Ecclesiastes: A time to tear down and a time to build up. \nIn Afghanistan and elsewhere, we are rightfully and wonderfully tearing \ndown the Taliban and al-Qaida. But if our victories are to be lasting \nand give lasting benefit, we must simultaneously build up the \nstructures of international cooperation and nonproliferation. The \nopportunities afforded by a war will not last forever. Today the doors \nto international cooperation and American leadership are wide open. But \nif we slam them shut too often, we will lose our chance to restructure \nthe world and we will be condemned to repeat the experience of the last \ncentury, rather than move beyond it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/12/senate-section/article/S13000-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13000-S13041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAGRICULTURE, CONSERVATION, AND RURAL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2002--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been on this bill now--we started \nMonday with debate. We had good amendments offered yesterday, with full \ndiscussion. Today we have had a vote on Senator Lugar's bill, which was \nin the form of an amendment.\n  I hope during the next few hours we can have other amendments \noffered. We are arriving at a point--staff has drawn up a unanimous \nconsent request that I, at a later time, will propound to the Senate. \nThat will be that there be a finite list of amendments so we know the \nuniverse from which we are working.\n  On our side, I say to my friend from Indiana, it appears we have just \na few amendments, a very few. Maybe some of those won't even require a \nvote.\n  I have been told by various people on the minority side that they \nhave some amendments to offer. I saw here, a minute ago, my friend from \nNew Hampshire. He usually offers a sugar amendment. That is what he \nmight be doing today.\n  In short, in the not too distant future I will seek approval by \nunanimous consent agreement to have a time for a finite list of \namendments, and then, of course, after that we will ask that there be a \ncutoff period for the filing of amendments. So I will just put everyone \non alert that is what we are going to do. I hope we can move this \nlegislation along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have listened to the Democratic assistant \nleader, the whip. I appreciate the sense of urgency of moving this \nlegislation at this late hour.\n  We are dealing with a 5-year agricultural policy for our Nation. \nThere is no\n\n[[Page S13001]]\n\nquestion that it is critical and necessary that we deal with it. He and \nothers have chosen to bring it before this body in the final hours of \nwhat should be a week toward recess or adjournment, awaiting the next \nsession. I had hoped this would not be the case, but it is.\n  I would truly appreciate--and I think American agriculture would \nappreciate--a full debate. We have had that on the bill of the ranking \nmember, Senator Lugar--his alternative. It was important because it is \na clear point of view that needs to be--must be--debated. We will have \nother alternatives up. I think the Cochran-Roberts alternative \nprovision to the Harkin bill expresses clearly a balanced approach \ntoward a 5-year agricultural policy.\n  The Senator from Nevada has within the Harkin bill a provision that, \nfor western Senators and arid Western States, is an issue that is an \nanathema to western water law and the rights of States to determine the \ndestiny of their own water. I and others will want to engage the \nSenator from Nevada on that issue. That could take some time.\n  I know of a good number of amendments that I think will be coming. \nThe Senator from New Hampshire is now on the floor to offer an \namendment in relation to the sugar program that is both within the \nHarkin provision and in the Cochran-Roberts provision. That, again, is \nanother important issue for many of the Western States and many of the \nSouthern States. My guess is it will deserve a reasonable and right \namount of debate. In my State of Idaho, hundreds of farmers will be \nimpacted, depending upon the success or failure of this amendment.\n  What I am trying to suggest to the Senator from Nevada is that even \nat a late hour and this rush to get things done, you don't craft 5-year \npolicy in a day or in a few days. You do a year's policy, oftentimes, \nbecause we know we will come back to revisit it again and again every \nyear.\n\n  We hope that when we are through here, our work product will be \nconferenced with the House and with the Secretary of Agriculture and \nthis administration in a way that will establish a clear set of \ndirections for production agriculture in this country. We know that \nproduction agriculture over the last good number of years has suffered \nmightily, under a situation of at or below break-even costs for \ncommodities, for all kinds of reasons.\n  The chairman of the Agriculture Committee is trying to remedy that in \nhis bill. The ranking member has offered an alternative, and others \nwill offer alternatives that have to be debated. I cannot, nor will I, \nsupport a rush to judgment.\n  Agriculture policy for my State is critical to the well-being of the \nNo. 1 feature of Idaho's economy, and we cannot decide simply, on the \neve of Christmas, in an effort to get things done quickly, that we \ndebate something that does not expire until next September.\n  While I think we have adequate time this week to do so, and maybe \nnext week, to address other issues--because it appears we will be here \nfor some time--then we must do it thoroughly and appropriately. I hope \nthe Senator will not push us to try to get us to a point of collapsing \nthis into just a few more hours of debate. It is much too important to \ndo so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. I say briefly to my friend from Idaho, the Senator answered \nhis own question--certainly mine. There is a lot to do on this bill. I \nacknowledge that. But we completed our last vote before 11 o'clock \ntoday. For the last hour, we have basically listened to people talking \nabout the stimulus bill and the antiballistic missile treaty. The \nreason they have been talking about those things is there is nothing \nhappening on the farm bill.\n  If we have these important issues--for example, everyone is familiar \nwith the Cochran-Roberts legislation--let's get them here and get them \nvoted on.\n  I am happy to see my friend from New Hampshire here. The \ndistinguished Senator has always had a real issue with how sugar is \nhandled. Good, he is here. Let's debate this and vote on it.\n  I hope, with other matters raised by the Senator from Idaho, people \nwill come forward and do that, that we not have a slow walking of these \namendments. We are not trying to rush anyone into anything. But we are \nsaying when there is downtime here when people are not doing anything \nrelating to the farm bill, it is not helping the cause. That is why I \nthink no matter how many amendments there are, there should be a time \nfor filing those amendments.\n  We are arriving at a point where I am going to ask consent to have a \nfinite list of amendments, and we are going to see if they will agree \nto have a cut-off time for filing amendments. If that is not the case, \nthen other action will have to be taken.\n  This legislation is important to America. We are doing everything we \ncan to move it as expeditiously as possible. It is unfortunate that we \nare working under time constraints. That is how it works in the Senate. \nWe are always busy. There is always something coming up, this holiday \nor that holiday. The fact is, the farming community of America is more \nconcerned about getting this legislation done than when we go home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I come to the floor to offer an amendment \non behalf of myself, Senator Lugar, and Senator McCain, cosponsors of \nthe amendment. This amendment deals with what has been a fairly well-\ndebated and discussed issue in our farm policy; that is, how we price \nsugar in this country. The sugar program in this country has been, in \nmy humble opinion, a fiasco and an atrocity with the inordinate and \ninappropriate burden on American consumers for years.\n  I call up my amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2466 to Amendment No. 2471\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself, \n     Mr. McCain, and Mr. Lugar, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2466 to amendment No. 2471.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To phase out the sugar program and use any resulting savings \n                    to improve nutrition assistance)\n\n       Beginning on page 54, strike line 1 and all that follows \n     through page 87, line 8, and insert the following:\n\n                            CHAPTER 2--SUGAR\n\n                      Subchapter A--Sugar Program\n\n     SEC. 141.

Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nagain, I am not trying to hurry the Senator. Does the Senator have any \nidea how long his statement will take?\n  Mr. GREGG. My statement won't take more than about 15 or 20 minutes. \nI understand Senator McCain will speak and Senator Lugar may wish to \nspeak. I don't know how long anyone else will want to take. I am going \nto ask for the yeas and nays as soon as our dialog is over.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are only meetings going on from 1 \nuntil 2 o'clock. If we could vote at quarter to 1, that would be fine.\n  Mr. GREGG. I can't really at this time agree to a timeframe because \nof the fact that I am not sure who wants to speak in opposition. I want \nto give them adequate time. I don't mind going to a vote as soon as we \ncan.\n  Mr. President, the sugar program as constituted and as it has evolved \nover the years has regrettably become a raid on the pocketbooks of the \nAmerican consumer to benefit a small number of sugar producers in this \nNation.\n  The price of sugar in the United States is approximately 2 to 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes what the price of sugar is on the world market. The burden of \nthat inflated price is borne by the consumers. In fact, the cost to the \nconsumers is approximately $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion a year \ndepending on whose estimate you use. That inflated price is a function \nof the fact that we have set up a system of nonrecourse loans, a very \narcane system which essentially guarantees to the producer of sugar in \nthis country 18 cents for its cane sugar and 22.99 cents for sugar beet \nsugar. In comparison with the fact that if they were to grow and try to \nsell that type of sugar in the open markets, the amount they would \nactually get would be somewhere in the vicinity of 9 cents. The effect \nis that the U.S. consumer is paying the difference between 9 cents, \nwhich is what the world price is, and 22 cents for sugar.\n  If the market were appropriately adjusted to reflect world price, you \nwould probably end up with a sugar price in the United States of around \n12 cents, or approximately 55 percent of what the present price is in \nthe United States.\n  The effect of this is that all products that use sugar have an \ninflated cost. It costs a lot more than it should.\n  Who bears that cost? The American consumer bears that cost. Who is \nthe American consumer?\n  We hear all of this debate about small family farms and how we are \ntrying to protect small family farms. That is a worthy cause, indeed. \nBut the American consumer is also under a lot of economic pressure. The \nAmerican consumer--especially if you are living on a fixed income, if \nyou are a senior citizen living off your Social Security check, if you \nare a welfare mother living off payments from the Government, if you \nare in a family with a mother and a father working two jobs trying to \nmake ends meet, trying to send children to school, and trying to make \nsure they have a good lifestyle for their family--is under a lot of \neconomic pressure, too.\n  But it turns out that in order to benefit a very small number of \ngrowers--believe me, it is an incredibly small number of growers--we \nrequire all of these Americans to pay a lot more for the food they eat \nthan they should have to pay if we had a market economy for sugar.\n\n  Forty-two percent of the benefit of the subsidy for sugar goes to 1 \npercent of the growers. There are some extraordinarily wealthy families \nand businesses in this country who are essentially putting their hands \nnot in the cookie jar but in the pockets of the American citizenry and \ntaking money out of that pocket so that they can have this ridiculous \nsubsidy on sugar that is so unrelated to what it costs, No. 1, to \nproduce it, and No. 2, what the world price is.\n  The sugar producer industry has told us for years: Well, this program \ndoesn't cost a thing. It doesn't cost the American taxpayer anything \nbecause there was no tax payment to support the sugar program. That was \ntrue for many years. In fact, there was an assessment fee they paid \ninto the Treasury. It was sort of what I call a purchase fee. They got \nto buy, with one dollar, five dollars. It was a great deal to them. \nThey paid $1 into the Treasury but they got $5 back from the consumer.\n  This is one of the great sweetheart deals in American political \nhistory. They could charge the sugar producers their assessment fee and \npay into the Treasury $260 million, which I think they paid in on the \naverage--something like that. What they failed to mention was that for \nthat little assessment fee they got $1.5 billion of subsidy.\n  That is a pretty good deal. There are not too many deals in this \ncountry even in our capitalist system where you get a guaranteed return \nof $1.5 billion when you pay in $260 million. There are not that many \ngood deals like that out there anymore. I don't think there ever was. \nBut there are for the sugar producers. That is history. That situation \nno longer exists.\n  Today, they are not paying in any more as a net issue. They are \nactually now getting paid tax dollars on top of this subsidy they get--\ntax dollars which amounted to about $465 million because the \nGovernment, under the nonrecourse loan process, had to go out and buy \nthe sugar. Not only do we have to buy the sugar, but we have to store \nthe sugar. We are getting back to that time of the 1970s and 1980s when \nPresident Reagan came in and found warehouses full of butter. There \nwere people in this country who needed butter. Reagan was smart enough \nto ask why we were storing all of this butter and to get rid of it. \nThey gave it to people who needed it.\n  We are starting to do that with sugar again, just like we did with \nbutter. We are starting to store sugar. Now we have one million tons of \nsugar. It is projected we are going to have 12 million tons of sugar in \nthe next 10 years. It is going to cost us $1.4 billion in tax dollars.\n  This isn't the subsidy that consumers pay. We are going to first hit \npeople with a subsidy. They are going to have to pay more for sugar \nthan they should have to pay. Then we are going to hit them with a tax \nto produce the sugar for which they are already paying too much--$1.4 \nbillion it is projected. We are going to have 12 million tons of sugar.\n  I do not know where we are going to put it. Maybe we are going to \nfill up the Grand Canyon. When you float the Grand Canyon, you will get \nall the sugar you ever wanted. We will have to find a place to put it. \nI am sure somebody will come up with a creative idea of where we are \ngoing to put it. Storing it will cost a huge amount of money. I have \nforgotten, but I think it is maybe $1 million. But there is an estimate \nfor that, too. You have to figure we have to pay to store the sugar.\n  So we are going to have all this sugar we do not need. We are going \nto pay all these taxes we should not have to pay to buy this sugar we \ndo not need. And then we are going to have this program which continues \nto produce sugar we do not need at a price which has no relationship to \nwhat the open market charges for sugar.\n  Just to reflect on that for a moment, I have a chart which shows the \ndifference between the world market and the American price on sugar.\n  Some people will say: Oh, but this world market is a subsidized \nmarket. In some places it is. I acknowledge that. In some places it is \na subsidized market. But not universally and not for a majority of the \nsugar producers in the world. In fact, if we were to open American \nmarkets to competition, you could be absolutely sure we could\n\n[[Page S13003]]\n\nstructure it in a way that the sugar that came into the country in a \ncompetitive way was not subsidized. So we would not have that problem. \nSo as a practical matter, we can get around that issue, and it is not a \nlegitimate issue.\n  So where are we? Basically, where we have been for many years. In the \nmid 1980s, the Congress had the good sense to say: Listen, this program \nmakes very little sense. There are a lot of people making a lot of \nmoney at the expense of the consumers, and there is no market forces at \nwork here at all. And there is no reason why we should continue a \nprogram that has all these detrimental effects.\n  There is another detrimental effect I need to mention, as long as we \nare at it, that is not a monetary one. It is an environmental one. We \nknow that because we have so grossly overpriced the sugar production \nthat there has been more of an impetus to create more sugar cane \ncapability, especially in Florida. The effect of that, on especially \nthe Everglades, has been devastating--so devastating, in fact, that \nlast year, under the leadership of Senator Smith from New Hampshire, we \nhad to pass a new bill to correct the problems in the Everglades, which \nis another bill that is going to cost us a huge amount of money in \norder to correct the problem that was created by the subsidized sugar \nprices and the overproduction of sugar.\n  We know as we clear these fields for sugar cane production, \nespecially in Florida--although there is now in place a system to try \nto get some logic to that process--we know that has a huge detrimental \nimpact on the environment of that area because most of these areas are \nmarginal wetlands and also critical wetlands and especially recharge \nareas for the Everglades.\n\n  So on top of all the other problems the program has, it has had this \nunintended consequence of creating a significantly environmentally \ndamaging event, at least in Florida.\n  So where does that leave us? As I was mentioning, in the mid-1980s, \nwe had the good sense, as a Congress, to say: Hey, listen. This makes \nno sense. This program makes no sense. Why should we be paying twice \nthe price of sugar on the open market? Why should we be paying taxes to \nbuy sugar we do not need? And why should we be sending the majority of \nthis money to a small number of producers when the vast majority of \nAmericans are affected?\n  So we actually had a few years without a sugar program. There will be \nan argument made, I suspect, that is what caused the price of sugar to \nfluctuate. Yes, it did. That was the idea, that you would start to see \nmarket activity in the sugar commodity. Unfortunately, we did not \nparticipate in this experiment long enough to find out whether we could \nbring market forces to bear. But we were clearly moving in that \ndirection.\n  The argument that that fluctuation in price, which was the precursor \nof having a market event, is one reason you do not want to have sugar \nproduction subsidized or one reason you have to have sugar production \nsubsidized is as if to say because Ford Motor Company cuts the price of \nits car and comes out with zero financing, we should suddenly subsidize \nFord Motor Company because the market is clearly having an effect on \ntheir price.\n  This program is obviously important to a number of States that have \nproducers. But you cannot justify it in its present structure. It needs \nto be reorganized.\n  So what my amendment does is to eliminate the nonrecourse loan event. \nIt makes the loans recourse and takes the savings and moves them over \nto the Food Stamp Program so that people who are on food stamps and who \nneed to buy food commodities which are suffering from an inflated price \nbecause of the sugar industry will have more money available to them to \ndo that.\n  Remember, sugar goes beyond candy, by the way. Some people think it \nis always candy. Sugar is in just about any product you buy that is a \nprocessed product. It has sugar in it. So if you are on food stamps, \nand you are trying to buy some pasta or you are trying to buy a meat \nsauce or you are trying to buy some sort of hamburger assistance that \ngives it a little flare, all of those products, which are important to \nthe nutrition of a person on food stamps, are having an inflated price \nbecause they have sugar in them.\n  This amendment says, let's take the savings which will be regenerated \nhere and move it into the Food Stamp Program. It is a very reasonable \namendment. I am sure it is going to pass this year, even though it may \nnot have passed in the last 7 years that I have offered it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Actually, I do not have any time left, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire yields the \nfloor.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me use some time now. I know other \ncolleagues want to speak to this issue of the Gregg amendment. I will \nspeak for a time on it because there are some important issues to be \ndiscussed.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has, once again, portrayed the sugar \nprogram that has been a part of agricultural policy in this country for \na good number of years as somehow evil and unjust, going to a small \nselect group of people.\n  For the hundreds of farmers in Idaho who, for the last 2 years, have \nlost a lot of money raising sugar beets--and under the new provisions \nwithin the Harkin bill or the Cochran-Roberts substitute would make no \nmore money--I find the arguments of the Senator from New Hampshire \ninteresting and unique--interesting because he said he would eliminate \nthe recourse loan program and transfer the money to the Food Stamp \nProgram.\n  It is pretty difficult to transfer money that does not exist, No. 1, \nbecause under the no-net-cost approach that is provided within both \nversions that we are debating today, there is no authorized money \nspecific to this program.\n  As we know, over the last good number of years, because of the buyout \nof the market store and resell into the market concept, actually the \nDepartment and the Secretary of Agriculture were making money. There \nhas been this brief period of time when recourse loans were purchased \nback, but from 1991 to 1999 about $279 million was actually made for \nthe U.S. Treasury, all from the program. About 1.5 percent of the \ncommodity program expenditure actually got caught up in recourse loans \nover the last year. But, again, that is that pool of money out there \nused for these purposes, with no specificity directed to the sugar \nprogram itself.\n  As the Senator has mentioned, the sugar program, as we call it, has--\nand his graph showed it--brought relative stability to the sugar market \nin this country. I say relative stability because during that period of \ntime that he was talking about, in which there was not a program, there \nwas a substantial runup and decline in price.\n  Not only were there dramatic peaks and valleys, not only did the \nconsuming public feel it, but the large wholesale consumers were, when \nit was at its peak, very concerned. It shoved the cost of their \ncommodities--candy bars or soft drinks, other uses of sugar--up. But \nwhen that price then declined, of course, they didn't reduce the price \nof their product because they had already established a price in the \nmarket.\n  I find it most fascinating because there is the general assumption on \nthe part of the Senator from New Hampshire that, if his amendment were \nto pass, the consumer would benefit, and there is absolutely no \nevidence in fact that that would happen. In fact, there is argument \nquite to the contrary.\n  Over the last couple of years we have seen a dramatic decline in \nsugar prices in this country, even with the current program. Nowhere \nhave we seen any one retail product on the consumer market shelf \ndecline as a result of the reduction in sugar. Where does it go? My \nguess is it goes into the profitable bottom line of that commercial \nproducer out there. I don't argue that. It is the reality of what we \nare dealing with.\n  I don't think the amendment the Senator is offering brings down the \nprice one penny on a candy bar, one penny on a bottle of pop, or any \nother commodity in the marketplace, from boxed cereal to any other \nproduct that has sugar added to it to enhance flavor and to \ncharacterize the product to see it come down. That is simply a false \nargument. The reason I use the word\n\n[[Page S13004]]\n\n``false'' is because the evidence that it would is quite to the \ncontrary. The evidence is that it would not because clearly we have \nseen that kind of price not happen in the last several years.\n  The U.S. producer price for sugar has been running at 20-year lows \nfor almost 2 years, down more than a fourth since 1996. That is under \nthe current program. That is why this past year we have seen some \nforfeiture of sugar, and that is why the Department of Agriculture now \nowns some sugar.\n  The bill that is before us, the new policy that will become \nagricultural policy, changes that and moves us clearly back to a no-net \ncost to the consumer.\n  Grocers and manufacturers are not passing through these lower prices, \nas I have mentioned, whatever the product. While we have seen this drop \nin price almost to a historic low, the harm has not been to the \nconsumer because they have not felt it, or, the positive side, it has \nbeen to the farm family who has been the producer of the product and \nhas had to offer the flexibility that they must in a production \nscenario to offset those kinds of costs.\n  There are a good many other issues out there. I see several of my \ncolleagues in the Chamber to debate this issue. I will deal with other \nportions of it as we come along.\n  The United States is required to import, under current law, nearly \n1.5 million tons of sugar or about 15 percent of its consumption. We \nalready buy sugar off the world market. Each year, whether the U.S. \nmarket requires that sugar or not, that is the agreement. That is what \nthe program offers.\n  In addition, unneeded sugar has entered the U.S. market outside of \nthe sugar import quota through the creation of products from import \nquota circumvention. We, for the last several years, have had the \nfrustration of what we call stuffed product, product that is \nintentionally enhanced with sugar, brought into this market \nreprocessed. The sugar is pulled out of the product--in this case \nmolasses--to get around these kinds of limitations in the marketplace \nand limitations to the market itself. Why? Obviously, sugar is a \ncommodity that moves. And we have now had court tests against that \nsaying, yes, those are violations.\n\n  We also have an agreement with Mexico under the North American Free \nTrade Agreement that brings sugar into this market. So to suggest that \nwe are immune to a world market is not all of the story. The story is \nthat 15 percent of the sugar that is in the U.S. market is world market \nsugar.\n  When the Senator from New Hampshire quotes the world market price, he \nis quoting the open price. He is not quoting the price of Western \nEurope. He is not quoting the price anywhere else in the world. All \nprices differ based on supply, demand, and access to markets.\n  What we have tried to do over the years with the sugar program is \ncreate stability, stability to the consumer and to the producer. \nHistorically, we have been very successful in doing just that.\n  We have done it in large part at no cost to the American taxpayer \nand, in fact, at less cost to the American consumer. The dramatic \nrunups in sugar prices that had to be passed immediately through to the \nconsumer simply have not existed.\n  There are a good number of other arguments I know my colleagues want \nto make on this issue. It is an important part of an overall \nagricultural policy for this country. It is an important part of an \noverall farming scenario for my State and for many other States in the \nNation. It creates stability in the farm communities of my State. It \nhas historically been a profitable commodity to raise in Idaho. It is \nno longer today.\n  I hope the programs we are debating that are within the Harkin bill \nand that are within the Roberts-Cochran substitute will bring stability \nback to the sugar beet producer in the Western States and in the \nDakotas and Michigan, and certainly to the cane producer in the South.\n  I yield the floor. When the appropriate time comes, as the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire has already requested the yeas and nays on his \namendment, I will ask my colleagues to stand in opposition to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend \nfrom Idaho. It is an interesting issue. It affects much of the country, \nall the way from Wyoming to Hawaii cane sugar, Louisiana, down to \nFlorida, back through our part of the world. We are talking about an \nindustry that provides nearly 400,000 jobs.\n  It has been said that this is a small, minute industry. It is not. In \nfact, in my State it is one of the few agricultural crops which are \nrefined, ready for the market, ready for the shelf when they leave our \nState. So we have factories there that provide employment, of course. \nIn many rural communities, sugar is a very important economic issue, \nnot only to farmers but also to processors. Economically, it generates \n$26 million annually.\n  The debate over sugar takes place nearly every year, and the same \narguments come up year after year. The fact is, there is a solid reason \nto have an industry of this kind, and I hope it will continue in the \nfuture. By world standards, U.S. producers are highly efficient--\neighteenth lowest in the cost of production out of 96 producing \ncountries and regions--despite, of course, having the highest labor and \nenvironmental standards. Some of the lowest cost is produced in the \nWest. So we are interested and involved in that.\n  As was pointed out, often there is talk about the world market. The \nfact is, the world market is a dump market. It is what remains after \nthe other countries use all they can and put it on the market. It is \nnot an economic cost. To compare that is simply not true. The current \nprices in all world export markets are dumped.\n  Of course, as was mentioned, one of the things we have just gone \nthrough in terms of Canada is the unfair situation called stuffed \nmolasses, where it is against the trade arrangements to bring in sugar. \nSo they mix sugar and molasses, bring it across the line, take it back \nout of the molasses and market it as sugar. Fortunately, we were able \nto get a court decision on that. Hopefully that gimmick is closed. We \nwill continue to work on it, of course.\n  The fact is that consumers do benefit. The retail price of sugar is \nvirtually unchanged since 1990. Our prices are 20 percent below \ndeveloped market prices. And interestingly enough, as is the case with \nlots of agriculture, the product price to the producer is quite \ndifferent than to the consumer. I think it points it out here. The \nproducer price, since 1996, is down 23 percent. At the same time, the \nconsumer price is up 6 percent. So the idea that this program is a \nhandicap to consumers is simply not accurate.\n  As I said, the price for sugar to the producer has fallen 23 percent, \nbut grocery stores have not lowered their price. Cereal is up 6 \npercent. Cookies and cake are up 10 percent. Ice cream --my favorite \nthing--up 21 percent. So we have a program that affects many people, \nwhich has been good for consumers in this country. We have a program \nthat has generated a good deal of money and since 1990 in market \nassessment tax. We have lots of good things in this program, and we \nneed to continue to make sure it is there for consumers and it is there \nfor producers.\n  I want to mention a couple of other items. As an industry, the U.S. \nretail price is 20 percent below the average of developed countries. It \nis third from the lowest in the world in the retail price of sugar. \nThat is interesting, and it is good for consumers. Certainly, in terms \nof the work required to buy a pound of sugar, the United States is \nthird from the bottom, only above Switzerland and Singapore. So in \nterms of our economy, sugar is a bargain for the consumer. As I \nmentioned, these prices have gone up.\n  So we have a program that has worked, a program that is very \nimportant to consumers, to producers and processors, and it will be \nchanged some. We are going to have more within the industry an effort \nto control production so we don't have excessive production. That is \ngoing to be done. Not only have we had a good program, we are in the \nprocess of having an even stronger program. I will resist the amendment \non the floor and urge my fellow Senators to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nrelated to the sugar program. That has become\n\n[[Page S13005]]\n\nsort of a biannual exercise, where we must come to the floor and defend \na program that has really worked in favor of not only the American \nproducer but also the consumer of sugar products.\n  I don't know how many Members of Congress, the mail situation being \nwhat it is, have had a lot of people writing and telling us: You have \nto do something about this terrible sugar program because the price of \nsugar is so high that I can't afford to buy sugar to sweeten my tea or \nto use on the food in my home.\n  The fact is that the program has worked very well for both the \nproducer of the product and also for the consumers of the products. It \nis a program that has a great deal of history. Since about 1985, the \nsugar program has had a loan much as the other commodities have had. \nThe loan has been about 18 cents a pound for cane sugar producers. That \nhas been the loan level for a number of years--for about 15 years now. \nIt has allowed the American sugar producer to survive.\n  Very simply, the program works. If the market that exists for sugar \nis above the loan level, our producers are able to sell it for whatever \nthey can get above the 18 cents level. If the price falls below the 18 \ncents level for sugarcane, then the Government will provide, in the \nform of a loan, that amount per pound to the American sugar producer. \nThat allows them to stay in business.\n  The good news is, unlike some of the other commodities, our \nGovernment can help guarantee there will be a minimum price, trying to \ncontrol the imports that come into this country. Some would argue that \nwe should have free trade and they should be able to sell into this \ncountry anything they want anytime they want. The reality of the \nsituation is that most countries--over 100-some countries in the world \nthat try to sell sugar in this country--take care of their own domestic \nneeds, and then they dump the rest into the U.S. market for any price \nthey want. They don't care whether they get 18 cents, or 5 cents, or 8 \ncents for it; they just want to get rid of it. They attempt to dump \nwhatever they don't need into the U.S. market, which, obviously, if we \ndidn't have a program, would be allowed to destroy the industry in this \ncountry completely.\n  So the farm bill--it is a good package, and I thank the folks who \nhave worked in committee to put it together--will continue that type of \nprogram, at no cost to the American taxpayer, which I think is unique \nin itself as far as this commodity is concerned. It is a good program, \nand it has worked.\n  This is really interesting, and I will use one chart. When people \nlook at whether the price of sugar is going up--well, the price to the \npeople who produce it is going down. Since 1996--these are producer \nprices, the people out in the field. Since 1996, the producer wholesale \nprice level for sugar has gone down 23.4 percent. That is since 1996. \nSo when people argue that somehow producers are getting rich off the \nprogram, the reality is that the price, according to the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, has gone down 23.4 percent over the last 5 \nyears for the people who actually produce the product.\n  If anybody has a complaint about the price of sugar--and what I \nmentioned in my opening comments is that we don't have people marching \non Washington, or making phone calls, or writing letters saying the \nprice of sugar is too expensive. Nobody is complaining about it. If you \nlook at the facts, the products that have increased in price and some \nof the products you should go after are the candy industry, cereal, \ncookies and cakes, bakery products, and ice cream. Those products have \ngone up substantially higher over these years than the wholesale \nrefined sugar price. Retail sugar increased only 5.8 percent; that is \nall. So the housewife, or the person buying groceries for the family, \nhas not noticed an inordinate increase in the price of sugar at all. It \nis in keeping with the cost of other inflationary price increases we \nhave seen, or even more than the regular increases.\n\n  But there have been increases in products that use sugar. If there is \na complaint, we ought to look at them. The wholesale price at which \nthey buy the sugar has gone down 23 percent, but their price at the \nretail level has increased by as much as 21.4 percent in the case of \nice cream and 14 percent in bakery products.\n  We have a program that has worked well. We have a loan program that \nsets a price that has been 18 cents since about 1985. It is a good \nprogram, and it operates at no cost to the taxpayer. It keeps beet \nfarmers and sugarcane farmers in business. In Louisiana, all of our \ncane farmers are small family farmers; they are not large. They work \nhard every day. The only thing they need is a little bit of assistance \nthat we provide in this program, at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  To change something that has worked would be the wrong policy. I \nstrongly urge that we defeat the Gregg amendment to this important \npiece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for \nhis remarks because he is right on target with respect to this \namendment.\n  This amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire is a mistake. When \nthe Senator from New Hampshire gets up and tells our colleagues that \nthe world price for sugar is just over 9 cents a pound, it is not true.\n  That is not what the world price of sugar is. If one thinks about it \nfor a moment, it could not possibly be because the cost of producing \nsugar is over 16 cents a pound. In fact, it is about 16.3 cents a \npound. So how could it possibly be that the world price for the \ncommodity is just over half of what it costs to produce? It cannot be, \nor the entire sugar industry worldwide would be bankrupt. This is very \nclear.\n  I do not think there is anybody who really knows the sugar industry \nwho does not understand that the cost of producing sugar is between 16 \nand 18 cents a pound. That is what it costs to produce. So anybody who \ntells you that the world price is a fraction of what it cost to produce \nis firing with blanks.\n  The hard reality is, that is not the world price of sugar. That is a \ndump price for sugar. I guess it is easy to understand how these \nmisassumptions occur because people are not familiar with the industry. \nThe fact is, the vast majority of sugar in the world moves under long-\nterm contracts. When they go to this so-called world price, they do not \nhave what is the true price of sugar. What they have is what sugar is \ndumped for outside long-term contracts. It is a fraction of the sugar \nthat is sold in the world.\n  If you want to do a reality test, what I am saying has to be true \nbecause if it was not, the entire industry would have gone bankrupt \nlong ago because they would be getting a price for their product that \nis a fraction of what it cost to produce.\n  I respect the Senator from New Hampshire. I like him. I serve with \nhim on the Budget Committee. He is one of our most able members. But \nwhen he talks about the world sugar market, he just has it wrong. When \nhe says the price of world sugar is less than 10 cents a pound, that is \nnot accurate. That is a dump price. That is the sugar that sells \noutside of long-term contracts.\n  The occupant of the chair, the Senator from Hawaii, is deeply \nknowledgeable on this matter. The Senator from Hawaii has helped lead \nthis debate many years in this Chamber. He understands the industry, \nand he knows that the vast majority of sugar in the world sells under a \nlong-term contract.\n  That is what I think is misleading the Senator from New Hampshire. \nThose long-term contracts are not part of this calculation on the so-\ncalled world price because, in fact, it is not a world price; it is a \ndump price. It is for sugar that sells outside of long-term contracts, \nthat those who have produced more than they sell under long-term \ncontracts go out and dump.\n  I want to go to the next point that I think is very important for \npeople to understand. That is the developed countries' retail sugar \nprices. The United States is 20 percent below the average. This chart \nshows what retail sugar prices are in developed countries: Norway, 86 \ncents a pound; Japan, 84 cents a pound; Finland, 83 cents a pound; \nBelgium, 75 cents a pound; Denmark, 75 cents a pound, and on it goes. I \nam part Swedish, 62 cents. I am part\n\n[[Page S13006]]\n\nDanish. Sugar is 75 cents there. Norway--I am part Norwegian, too--is \n86 cents. They are paying a lot more in those countries for the retail \nprice of sugar than we are paying.\n  I am part German, too. Germans are paying 45 cents per pound. Where \nis the United States? We are third from the bottom.\n  When our colleague from New Hampshire runs out here and says to \neverybody that the consumers are getting gouged, it is not true. It \njust does not stand up to any analysis. The fact is, we are third from \nthe bottom in the developed world on what we pay for sugar.\n  I can understand how confusing the economics of this industry are to \nthose who are not familiar with the industry and not familiar with \nagriculture, but the reality is very simple: What farmers are getting \nhas been going down and going down substantially over the last several \nyears. We are on the brink of a massive failure of sugar producers all \nacross this country because of the collapse in the prices they are \nbeing paid for their product.\n  The Senator from Louisiana showed the prices that sugar producers are \nreceiving is down 24 percent. That is the reality. The other reality is \nthat consumers in this country are getting on a relative basis, on a \ncomparative basis, looking at what consumers pay in other developed \ncountries, a very good deal. The truth is, it is a very competitively \npriced product in this country and right around the world.\n  Finally, the point I think is so important to me and so important to \nunderstand is when the Senator from New Hampshire says the world price \nof sugar is under 10 cents a pound and farmers are getting paid 18 \ncents or 22 cents and there is this huge profit, he does not have it \nright.\n  The world price of sugar is not 9.5 cents a pound. That is the dump \nprice. That is what a small minority of the sugar produced in the world \nsells for, that sugar which is outside of long-term contracts. That is \nwhere the vast majority of sugar sells, and the vast majority of sugar \nsells for about 20 cents a pound. That is the reality, that is the \nfact, and we should not be misled or misguided as to the economics of \nthis industry.\n  It would be a disaster for thousands of families who produce sugar \nall across this country if the Senator from New Hampshire were to \nprevail. You cannot be an island unto yourself. The fact is, the sugar \nindustry is supported in virtually every country within which it is \nproduced--in fact, every country. Not virtually every, not almost \nevery, but every single country. That is what we are up against.\n  Either we can fight back and give our people a fair fighting chance \nor we can roll over and play dead and wave the white flag of \nsurrender--give up, give in, and let these people go broke and be \npoorer for it as a nation.\n  I hope the Senate will respond, as we have, so many times in the past \nin recognizing that this industry is important to the strength of rural \nAmerica, just as the rest of agriculture is critically important to the \nstrength of rural America.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friends from North Dakota, \nLouisiana, and others who are speaking against this amendment and \nexplaining the facts. Once the facts are known, I believe Senators will \nknow this amendment is not a good idea.\n  We want a strong agriculture policy in America, and we want a level \nplaying field. We know that much too often other countries tend to \nfavor their producers, their industries, their companies at the expense \nof the United States, at least more so than we Americans do.\n  Every other country has a more, if I can use the term, socialistic \npolicy; that is, tends more toward Government intervention in helping \nthe producers and companies and their industries, than does the United \nStates. Frankly, it is the view of the United States that we be a more \nfree market, more independent, and let producers and companies pursue \ntheir own agenda. At least on a comparative basis that has made us \nstronger than other countries. It is a major strength of \nAmerica. Having said that, we clearly don't want to make matters worse.\n\n  In the meantime, even though other countries do subsidize their \nproducers or their companies or industries more than we do, we, through \nour ingenuity--this is a general statement; there are exceptions--are \nable to fight back with greater ingenuity, creativity, good old \nAmerican can-do, common sense, and find a way to get the job done. We \ndon't moan and complain but fight and get the job done.\n  This amendment moves us in the opposite direction. It says although \nthe playing field is not level, although it is tilted today against the \nUnited States with respect to sugar, we will tilt it even more against \nAmerican sugar producers. That is what this amendment does.\n  As other Senators have ably demonstrated, the facts show that \ncompared to other countries the United States ranks, for Government \nsupport for sugar, third from the bottom. Other countries protect their \nsugar industry much more than the United States. Sugar prices in the \nUnited States are lower, significantly, to the consumer.\n  I am having a hard time understanding why this amendment is on the \nfloor. Why would we as Americans want to hurt ourselves? It is \nunfathomable. I cannot come up with a reason--unless it sounds good on \nthe surface because we have a quota system in the United States that \nprovides stability to American producers. If that system in the United \nStates were eliminated, or if the amendment pending of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire were adopted, not only do producers already suffering \nsuffer more--prices are down 23 percent--but local communities suffer: \nthe shops, businesses, and gas stations. It is not just those who work \nin factories and the fields producing the cane or the beets.\n  Sugar is a valuable commodity in my state of Montana. More than $188 \nmillion in economic activity is generated in Montana each year by the \nsugar and sweetener industries and creates close to 3,300 jobs in my \nstate.\n  The production of sugar in the United States is a large and \ncompetitive operation. Throughout the Nation, the sugar industry \ngenerates 373,000 jobs in 42 States and creates $21.2 billion in \neconomic activity.\n  Our American sugar producers are among the most efficient in the \nworld. The United States ranked 28 our of 102 sugar-producing countries \nfor the lowest cost in overall sugar production. And the United States \nis the world's fourth largest sugar producer, trailing only Brazil, \nIndia, and China.\n  But despite these positive statistics, our sugar producers are \nhurting. Producer prices for sugar have fallen sharply since 1996. \nWholesale refined beet sugar prices are down 23 percent. Prices for \nsugar have been running at a 20-year low for most of the past two \nyears. This has caused a deep hardship for American sugarbeet and sugar \ncane farmers. Many have gone out of business and many more are on the \nbrink of economic ruin.\n  We have seen 17 permanent sugar mill closures in the nation since \n1996. These closing are devastating to entire communities. Devastating \nto our producers, mill employees, transportation, restaurants, small \nbusinesses, and the list goes on. Some producers are trying to buy \nmills that are on the brink of bankruptcy in order to protect further \ncommunities from these losses.\n  For example, the Rocky Mountain Sugar Growers Cooperative is in the \nprocess of purchasing several mills in the Montana, Colorado and \nWyoming areas. These producers, and the cities that depend upon them, \nneed a sugar policy that they can depend upon so that they can once \nagain flourish.\n  We need a strong sugar policy. American sugar farmers are efficient \nby world standards, and are willing and prepared to compete on a level \nplaying field against foreign sugar farmers, but they cannot compete \nagainst foreign governments. We must give them the level playing field \nthey need.\n  I strongly urge this amendment be defeated. It does not make sense. \nOnce the Senators know the facts, Senators will realize this amendment \nshould not be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, who have spoken so \neloquently and forcefully on this subject, in urging the Senate to \ndefeat the Gregg amendment.\n\n[[Page S13007]]\n\n  Mr. President, Louisiana is a sugar State. There are 18 sugar mills \nand two sugar refineries in Louisiana and we have more acreage devoted \nto sugarcane than any other State. Many of our parishes rely on the \nsugar industry for their economic vitality. It is an important industry \nthat is hundreds of years old in the State of Louisiana and throughout \nmany parts of our Nation. Nationwide, the sugar industry directly and \nindirectly affects 37,200 jobs in 42 States. It is a $21 billion \nindustry.\n  At this time in our Nation's history, with a recession underway, and \nwith our efforts to try to build ourselves out of this recession, we \nwant to do things in Congress that help, not hurt. The Gregg amendment \nis taking us in the wrong direction. We need to be creating jobs, not \neliminating them. The sugar industry means thousands of jobs to \nLouisiana.\n  Are consumers harmed by our national sugar policy? Absolutely not. \nSugar prices have been relatively stable because of this sugar \nmechanism in the farm bill. There are different provisions in this farm \nbill, but the sugar provision is unique in that it is a provision that \ncan actually return money to the Federal Treasury. It is a self-help \nmechanism. From 1991 to 1999, this policy was a net revenue raiser of \n$279 million. Sugar loans last year amounted to only a little over one \npercent of federal commodity expenditures, and this negligible cost \nwill be defrayed as that sugar is gradually sold back into the market. \nIn addition, between 1997 and 2001, the government rightly spent $90 \nbillion to save rural America from other commodity forfeitures. None of \nthat money went to sugar producers.\n  Because the sugar industry does not enjoy the same types of price \nsupports as other commodities, we have developed over many years in \nCongress a program that both maintains low retail prices and provides \nsupport to an industry that must compete with heavily subsidized \nforeign sugar programs. The Senator from New Hampshire's Amendment \nwould replace production by efficient, unsubsidized American sugar \nfarmers with sugar from less efficient, heavily subsidized producers \nfrom Brazil and Europe.\n  I believe the American sugar program is one worth supporting. It has \nbeen carefully crafted, and helps retain jobs in Louisiana and around \nthe Nation. It is something we need to continue to support, not one to \nmove away from.\n  Let me also add, I am particularly pleased with the vote the Senate \nhad yesterday on the dairy provisions. By a one-vote margin we came to \na compromise that will help strengthen the underlying farm bill. \nRejecting the Senator from New Hampshire's amendment gives additional \nstrength to a farm bill that helps keep price supports in place, that \nappropriately subsidizes certain crops, that enables the sugar industry \nto continue to flourish in Louisiana and throughout the Nation and, \nmost importantly, protects jobs that are so important to our Nation at \nthis particular time.\n  We have other challenges. We have trade issues that have to be worked \nout, but this amendment offered by Senator Gregg should be defeated.\n  I am happy to join my colleagues in support of that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I rise in opposition to the Gregg amendment. In my \nopinion, this is a terrible amendment. Essentially it abolishes the \nsugar program and significantly injures a good many family farmers who \nare struggling under ordinary circumstances to try to make a decent \nliving.\n  I will try to correct some of the misconceptions about the sugar \nprogram. First, I thought I would point out that this debate is about \nthis.\n  This is the fun-sized Baby Ruth candy bar. This debate is about candy \ncorporations versus family farmers.\n  I intend to eat this Baby Ruth when I am finished. That is why I \ndon't have a large, full-sized Baby Ruth. This is a fun size. Let me \nread for a moment the ingredients of this candy bar.\n  For the corporation that makes it, I am not casting aspersions upon \nyour product. Since I intend to eat it, I would be telling people it is \na pretty decent product. Let me describe what is in it.\n  Ingredients: Sugar. That is not in bold type, it just says sugar. \nThat, of course, misses the point. There is a lot of sugar in this \ncandy bar. That is what this debate is about. This debate is about the \nprice of the sugar that this company is paying for and putting in this \ncandy bar.\n  What else is in this candy bar? Although this debate is about sugar \nonly, I thought it would be useful, perhaps, to read the entire list of \ningredients: Roasted peanuts, corn syrup, partially hydrogenated palm \nkernel, coconut and soybean oils, high fructose corn syrup, dextrose, \nskim milk. And then emulsifiers--with a couple of emulsifying words I \ncannot pronounce--and artificial flavors, TBHQ. Maybe I won't eat this \nafter I finish; maybe I will. Emulsifiers: Artificial flavors, \ncarrageenan, TBHQ, and citric acid to preserve freshness. Then they \nhave added caramel color.\n  So that is what is in this little old Baby Ruth. This issue is about \nthe sugar, the first ingredient in this candy bar.\n  This amendment is not new. We have had this amendment time and time \nand time again because those who produce candy in this country, among \nothers, want a lower cost of sugar.\n  Let me ask the question. Has anyone noticed recently that the price \nof candy bars has decreased? Go to the store, go to the candy counter \nand pick out a bar, any bar, and ask yourself, has there been a \nreduction in the price of that bar? Maybe a 10-percent cost reduction? \nMaybe 20? Maybe 30? Maybe 40? Anybody see any of that? I don't think \nso. Same candy, same price or higher price, but they are paying less \nfor sugar.\n  Who gets the benefit of that so-called less for sugar? Those who \nreceive lower prices for sugar are the families out there in North \nDakota and Minnesota and the Red River Valley who are producing sugar \nbeets. They are good, hard-working honest folks. They produce a good \nproduct. They plant those beets and they hope very much they will get a \ndecent crop. When they get a decent crop, they hope, through their \nmarketing mechanisms, they will have a decent price.\n  But you know what has happened to the sugar producers and beet \nproducers and cane producers and so on? The underlying farm bill has \nbeen so poor, so badly constructed in the last 6 or 8 years, that \nfarmers, because the underlying farm bill for other crops has been so \npoor, farmers have planted more in beets. That is the fact. It relates, \nof course, to the underlying Freedom to Farm bill, which has been a \nterrible failure. But it is not just that there has been some \nadditional acreage planted. That is not the issue that drives this \ntoday. We have had some price problems but that is not the issue that \nis driving all this.\n  Let me give an example of what is driving it. It always comes back to \nthis, it seems to me. We have a circumstance where, for example, today, \non Wednesday, we are going to import sugar from Brazil into this \ncountry. It is not supposed to be coming in. It is highly subsidized by \nBrazil. And Brazil ships its highly subsidized sugar to Canada. Then \nthey load liquid molasses with Brazilian sugar and ship it into the \nUnited States in contravention of our trade laws. It is a so-called \nlegal way of cheating. It happens in our trade laws virtually all the \ntime and nobody can do a blessed thing about it.\n  So those who are farming out there in the Red River Valley, trying to \nproduce beets, and hope beyond hope they can support their family and \nget a price for their beets, they take a look at this and say, what \nabout this cheating in international trade, this so-called stuffed \nmolasses?\n  I hold up a Baby Ruth. We all know what a Baby Ruth is. Has anybody \never eaten stuffed molasses? Stuffed molasses is a term of art in \ninternational trade that means someone has taken Brazilian sugar, ran \nit through Canada, added it to a liquid and moved it to the United \nStates, taken the sugar out of it, and moved it back to Canada. It \ncomes back again and again and again. All it is is a transport for \nBrazilian sugar which is unfairly subsidized, and that cuts the legs \nout from under our producers and nobody wishes to do anything about it.\n  I wish someone would come to the Chamber with half the energy with \nwhich they come to the Chamber on these kinds of bills to try to get \nrid of\n\n[[Page S13008]]\n\nthe sugar program and cut the legs out of our producers, I wish they \nwould come to the Chamber with that energy and say, let's stop the \ncheating in international trade.\n\n  Let's stop the stuffed molasses, stop it dead. It is cheating, it is \nunfair, and undercuts American producers.\n  When we are talking about trade, does anyone think of the farmer in \nMinnesota or North Dakota who is out there trying to raise beets, that \ntheir responsibility is to compete against Brazilian producers who are \nbeing unfairly subsidized? Is that trade that is fair? I don't think \nso, not where I come from. In my hometown, we understand what fairness \nis. We grew up understanding the definition of the word ``fair.''\n  What is happening to our farmers in international trade, all of our \nfarmers? And I can go through long lists dealing with the issue of \ndurum wheat in Canada and others, but let me focus on this issue of \ntrade in sugar to demonstrate how unfair it is to American producers. \nYet we do not have any energy coming to the Chamber, except those of us \nwho have been trying desperately to write a law which prohibits that \nmolasses coming down here under the term of ``stuffed molasses.'' That \nis simply a liquid truck to bring Brazilian sugar into this country to \nhurt American producers.\n  We have had people say today that the world price for sugar is way \ndown here. The U.S. price for sugar is way up here. I guess they just \nmiss the facts about how sugar is both produced and then marketed \naround the world. Almost all sugar around the world is traded by \ncontract, country to country. That which is not is the residual amount \nof sugar surplus that is dumped on the open market at an artificial \nprice. It has nothing at all to do with the market value at which sugar \nis selling or is being bought and sold. It has nothing to do with that.\n  So we have people come out here with a chart with a price that is \nirrelevant. It is just irrelevant. If this were automobiles, that would \nbe the salvage price but it is irrelevant to what a new car is selling \nfor.\n  On the issue of price, let's put that to rest once and for all. The \nprice for sugar is the price at which sugar is traded internationally \nand predominantly the price at which it is traded internationally by \ncontract is not at all related to the dump price that has been alleged \nas the world price by those who offer this amendment.\n  Let me hold up a couple of charts that other of my colleagues have \nused as well. Some say, well, this really doesn't matter. All that \nmatters here is the price of sugar in the grocery store. The fact is, \nwhat matters is that this is an important part of this country's \neconomy. It provides over 400,000 jobs, a good many of those jobs in \nNorth Dakota and the Red River Valley, men and women who have a dream \nto run a family farm and make a living, and they expect public policy \nto support that. They expect public policy to weigh in in their favor \nagainst unfair trade.\n  Instead, too many bring public policy to the floor of the Senate that \nsays let's give the candy corporations a little more benefit and take \nit away from those who are trying to run a family farm. I have nothing \nagainst candy corporations. I eat candy--probably more than I should. \nAs I said, I intend to eat this piece of candy. But the candy \ncorporations have done right well. What has happened is they have seen \na substantial reduction in the price of sugar and they love it. They \nhave seen a substantial increase in their profits and they enjoy it, \nbut has the consumer seen any evidence that the price of sugar is lower \nthan it was? No. This is a transfer from the pockets of those running a \nfamily farm trying to produce sugar beets to the corporate coffers in \nthe accounts called ``profits'' in the pockets of some of the largest \ncandy companies in the country. That is what it is. It is \nrevenuesharing. It takes from those who have not and gives to those who \nhave.\n  When you strip away all the pieces of this debate, this dispute is \nvery simple at its core. This industry produces a great many jobs in \nthis country. It is important to this country. It faces fundamentally \nunfair trade, and it has a sugar program that for many, many years has \nworked, contrary to other farm programs that have been miserable \nfailures. Now we have had, routinely, people come to the floor of the \nSenate to say we want to take apart that which works. It doesn't make \nany sense to me.\n  The producer prices for sugar plummet. The wholesale refined price \nfor sugar--you see what happened, a 23.4-percent reduction.\n  I asked the question about the candy bar, but let me ask it about a \nbox of cereal. That cereal aisle in the grocery store is a wonderful \naisle. It has so many different kinds of cereal these days you can \nhardly stop to see them all or understand them all. There are just lots \nand lots of boxes of cereal.\n  When I take my kids to the grocery store with me, they know all those \nnames. They have seen them advertised. They want to buy the most \nbyzantine boxes of cereal I have ever heard of. Occasionally they sneak \nthem into the grocery cart.\n  Has anyone ever seen a reduction in the price of cereal as a result \nof a reduction in the price of sugar? I don't think so. Has anyone seen \na reduction in the price of cookies or cakes at the retail level? No. \nThey are heavy users of sugar. How about other bakery products? What \nabout ice cream? Is ice cream selling at a substantial reduction? Of \ncourse, that is a tremendous carrier of sugar as well. No. I don't \nthink so. What about doughnuts? Is the price of doughnuts down because \nthe price of sugar has plummeted? I don't think so. I think the price \nof doughnuts is up. I think the price of candy bars and cookies is up, \nincluding the profits of candy manufacturers who now want more. They \nwant more. This is not enough. They want more.\n  They want to kill the sugar program. The answer to those interests \nthat want to do that is, you are not going to be able to do it--not \ntoday, not tomorrow, not next month, and not next year. This is a \nprogram that works. It is constructed in a way that works. It works for \nAmerican family farmers and for American consumers.\n  We have a stable supply of sugar and a stable price. We had it for a \nlong time until the most recent problems that, in my judgment, came \nabout because the underlying farm bill didn't work.\n  Stability of supply and price serves both the family farmer interests \nand consumer interests. I think there are other interests here. I admit \nthat. There is the interest of the candy manufacturers, and there are \ninterests of others. But I am most especially interested in the broader \nquestion of public interest that reflects those who live and work on \nour land in this country--family farms--and the interests of the \nbroader spectrum of the American public who want a stable supply at \nreasonable prices on their grocery store shelves. That is what this \nissue is about.\n  I don't disparage those who have offered this. They come from their \nperspective. They represent the candy manufacturers. Some other \ninterests want lower sugar prices.\n  I represent family farmers who want a fair deal. All they want is a \nfair deal. They are not getting it. This amendment would further \ndestroy their opportunity to make a living. We are going to kill this \namendment, I hope, in the next couple of hours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nHawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak against the amendment \nbeing offered by my colleague from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, that will \nterminate the sugar program. This program is a vital subsidy that \nprovides valuable assistance to U.S. sugar farmers and ensures that \nsugar remains an affordable commodity for American consumers. While we \nare all facing difficult times, I must remind my colleagues that \nAmerican farmers are hurting.\n  We must also realize that should we lose the sugar program in our \ncountry, our sugar farmers would go out of business and we would be at \nthe mercy of world sugar. We would be suffering with high prices. We \nwould not be in control of prices, and the American public would be \nhurt.\n  United States producer prices for sugar have decreased by close to 30 \npercent since 1996. Many sugar farmers have gone out of business and a \nnumber of beet and cane mills have closed. In the same period, 17 sugar \nmills have\n\n[[Page S13009]]\n\nclosed. Seven of those sugar mills were located in the State of Hawaii. \nToday we have just two sugar mills in Hawaii.\n  Opponents of the sugar program believe that this program is outdated \nand artificially inflates sugar prices for consumers. In fact, the \nopposite is true. The program has acted as a cushion against imports \nfrom the world dump market. Our sugar program has been successful in \nensuring stable sugar supplies at reasonable prices. United States \nconsumers pay an average of 17 cents less per pound of sugar than their \ncounterparts in other industrialized nations. Low U.S. prices save \nconsumers more than $1 billion annually. Consumers elsewhere around the \nglobe do not enjoy the low prices we have in America. Most American \nconsumers would be amazed at the price of sugar in other industrialized \nnations, as revealed by my colleague from North Dakota. That is why I \nsay that the sugar program is critical to American consumers.\n  While the sugar program had a modest cost for forfeitures of sugar \nloans in 2000, this cost amounted to only 1.5 percent of the Federal \ncommodity program expenditures. These costs will be defrayed as sugar \nis gradually sold back into the market. Furthermore, U.S. retail sugar \nprices have remained virtually unchanged for more than a decade and are \n20 percent below the developed-country average.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment No. 2466. If Congress \nterminates the sugar program, not only will a dynamic part of the \neconomy disappear from many rural areas, but consumers will also lose a \nreliable supply of high-quality, low-price sugar.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I was at a labor rally on the economic \nrecovery plan and lost my voice, but I came back here to speak on this \namendment. I have been following this debate a little bit. I wanted to \ncomment on what I heard on the floor.\n  In that rally there were indeed some steel workers from the Iron \nRange of Minnesota, I say to my colleague from Minnesota. Basically, \nthe message was this: We are out of work through no fault of our own. \nWe are running out of unemployment insurance benefits, and we don't \nhave coverage for our loved ones, for our children, or for our \nfamilies. I believe this is sort of a test case of whether or not we in \nthe Senate, or for that matter in the administration, care about hard-\nworking people. We are very much a part of our country coming together. \nIn fact, we keep celebrating the firefighters and policemen and others. \nNow when America's working families really need help, where are we?\n  I will tell you, any economic recovery plan is just simply, as far as \nI am concerned, unconscionable without making sure we extend the \nunemployment insurance benefits to make sure that part-time workers are \ncovered and to make sure we get the health care benefits to these \npeople.\n  I do not know how we can possibly take these working families and put \nthem in parentheses. We have had tens of billions of dollars of \nassistance for the airline industry. I look at the House of \nRepresentatives, and they have about $30 billion-plus of tax breaks for \nthe energy companies, including oil companies that made huge profits \nlast year. They want to do away with the alternative minimum tax and \ngive $1 billion here and $1 billion to this multinational corporation. \nThey want to lock in these ``Robin Hood in reverse'' tax cuts, which \nprovide more for the wealthiest top 1 percent. However at the same time \nwe are worried about the Social Security surplus and say we have no \nmoney for children, for education, for the IDEA program, for children \nwith special needs, or to help people who are out of work right now.\n  I will tell you, this is a test case of whether we have \n``compassionate conservatism'' or the heart and soul of my party. \nDemocrats need to fight hard for these working people. In any case, I \nthink that is a transition to this debate because I am hearing a number \nof my colleagues in this Chamber talking about eliminating the sugar \nprogram.\n  By the way, a lot of our sugar beat growers, as my colleague from \nMinnesota knows, are independent producers. What is interesting is that \nthis particular sugar program really sets the loan rate at good level, \nwhich gives our producers the ability to bargaining to get a decent \nprice in the market, which, frankly, I want for all our farmers, far \nmore than depending on AMTA payments and other direct Government money.\n  But I have to say to Senators--I have to figure out the right way to \nsay this; if I say ``cynical,'' it sounds as if that is too shrill--but \nI am skeptical about this commitment to the Food Stamp Program and more \nfunding for nutrition programs. I am skeptical because during the \ndebate on the welfare bill in 1996 that significantly cut food stamp \nbenefits, which, by the way, is the major child nutrition safety net \nprogram in our country, and very successful, some of the very Senators \nwho are on the floor today are saying the reason we need to cut the \nsugar program is because we need to dramatically expand food nutrition \nprograms. I think this is basically a cynical tradeoff, which will put \nunder a bunch of independent producers and farmers, saying the reason \nwe need to do this is because we need to dramatically expand food \nnutrition programs. I ask where were these Senators when we had a 30 \npercent reduction in food stamp enrollment. That was in the 1996 so-\ncalled welfare reform program. The fact is these Senators who had not a \nword to say.\n  I say to those Senators, where were you? In the committee, Senator \nHarkin and Senator Dayton and I have fought hard for food nutrition \nprograms. Frankly, my bottom line in conference is, anything less than \n$6.2 billion in the food nutrition program is unacceptable.\n  By the way, the House of Representatives, with a Republican majority, \nhas $3.6 billion for food nutrition programs. That is it. Now, all of a \nsudden, the very Senators--this is not a one-to-one correlation--but \nmany of the very same Senators I have never seen out here as advocates \nfor expanding food nutrition programs, for expanding the Food Stamp \nProgram, all of a sudden, when it comes to this nifty, clever little \nway of trading off a farm program that gives producers some leverage in \nthe market price to get a decent price versus the Food Stamp Program, \nnow we have the amendment offered on the floor. This is transparent.\n  In our Agriculture Committee deliberations, I voted for the higher \nprice-tag of $10 billion for food nutrition programs. Senator Lugar has \nbeen a good, strong advocate for food nutrition programs. I will say \nthat. There is no question about it. My comments are not aimed at the \nSenator from Indiana because I think he has been a true champion on \nthis issue. I am talking about a variety of things I have heard from a \nvariety of different Senators. And I see where this vote is going.\n  But I said in the Agriculture Committee, I refuse to accept this \ncynical tradeoff of a commodity program that provides some income \nassistance for farmers and/or provides some leverage for our farmers to \nget a decent price in the marketplace, especially if they are family \nfarmers--that is, the people who work the land, live on the land--and \nfood nutrition programs.\n  Now, I along with others will have an amendment later on to target \nsome of these commodity prices. From my point of view, not only can we \ntake some of that for a higher loan rate and a better price for our \nproducers, we can take some of that and put it in the food nutrition \nprograms. Fine. But do not come out of here with an amendment that \nbasically eliminates the program which will eliminate independent \nproducers. In this particular case, we are talking about sugar beat \nproducers, especially in the Red River Valley and other parts of our \nState of Minnesota.\n  Again, I would say that I am a little bit skeptical. I am a little \nbit skeptical of Senators who are coming out here who I have never \nheard a word from about cuts in the Food Stamp Program before, and now \nall of a sudden they become passionate advocates for the Food Stamp \nProgram, if it gives them an opportunity to eliminate a whole bunch of \nindependent producers, family farmers.\n\n[[Page S13010]]\n\n  Do I think that some of these farm programs are an inverse \nrelationship to need? Yes. Do I want to more target them? Yes. But I \nrefuse to accept in tradeoff that is explicit--not implicit, but \nexplicit--in this amendment that is before us today on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Let me also say quite a few of the Senators who are out here with \nthis amendment, and they can come out here and debate me, but I would \nbet that the historical record will show this: While we have had, in \nthe past several years, a dramatic rise in the use of food shelves and \nfood pantries, and while we have had any number of different reports \nthat have come out, especially by the religious community, about the \nrise in the number of ``food insecure households''--which is just \nanother way of saying homes where people are hungry, maybe to the tune \nof about 30 million or thereabouts; I do not remember the exact figure, \nmany of them children--while we have had reports about the dramatic \nrise of hunger and homelessness in our country, I have not heard one \nword from many of the Senators who have come out here today, who, all \nof a sudden, have become champions for the Food Stamp Program, if they \ncan eliminate a farm program that will eliminate family farmers, \nindependent producers in my State of Minnesota.\n  I say no to that. I hope my colleagues will join me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. We \nhave heard a lot of discussion over the years about the sugar amendment \nand the sugar program in the United States. In fact, as the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana indicated, we seem to have this \ndebate on at least a biennial basis. We have had this debate since I \nhave been in Congress, and long before that.\n  It would seem people in the country, and particularly here in \nCongress, would ultimately come to recognize what the true facts about \nthis program are. But, nevertheless, we continue to debate it.\n  I would like to talk a little bit about what really is at stake. \nThere is a lot of discussion about the fact that the United States \nsupposedly subsidizes its sugar and that that is a great cost to the \ntaxpayer, a great cost to the consumer, and an inequity in \ninternational trade.\n  The reality is, although there is a lot of talk about the world sugar \nprice--and I am going to discuss that in more detail in a minute--it is \na trumped-up argument.\n  The United States, as a matter of fact, has the sugar program because \nother nations are subsidizing their sugar. The world sugar price, as is \nso often debated in these halls, is a world-dumped sugar price.\n  What happens is, most nations that produce sugar produce enough sugar \nfor what is consumed in their nation, and then they have some amount of \nsugar left over. That sugar that is left over is then able to be dumped \non the world market through very anticompetitive and even predatory \npractices by these nations, where they are subsidizing the sugar \nproduction and dumping it into the world market in an effort to \nbasically help their producers gain an unfair advantage against the \nproducers in other nations.\n  What the United States did long ago was to recognize that if we were \nto allow this subsidized sugar to be dumped unjustifiably in the U.S. \nmarkets, it would drive the price of sugar in the United States \nunreasonably low and drive our producers out of business, thereby \nresulting in a capture of the market by these other nations and their \nproducers. What we always see in the economic cycle when that happens \nis that then the price can go up, as those who have driven out their \ncompetitors and the competition can, then more easily control the \nprice.\n  I show on this first chart what we are talking about in terms of the \nworld sugar dump market price. The world average production cost to \nproduce sugar is $16.26, and the world market price that we often hear \nabout is $9.52, which is why we have deemed it the world dump price. \nWhat happens is that a price far below the cost of production of sugar \nis generated by those nations that subsidize and provide other \nanticompetitive barriers to the proper movement of sugar in a real \nmarket. It is this subsidized sugar that would flow into U.S. markets, \nsignificantly jeopardizing our producers in a way that would cause many \nof them to go out of business, that the U.S. sugar program is designed \nto stop. That is really what is at issue.\n  The question we must ask ourselves is, Is the United States going to \nstep up to the plate and protect its sugar producers in an \nanticompetitive world market environment where clearly the competition \nis out there trying to drive our producers out of business?\n  Some respond by saying the U.S. sugar producers ought to be able to \nproduce their sugar more efficiently or it really isn't a world dump \nprice, and the fact is that U.S. sugar producers want to keep their \nsugar at unreasonably high prices.\n  Again, the reality is, when we study the nations that have retail \nsugar prices--I distinguish here between a retail sugar price, the \nprice the consumer pays at the marketplace to buy their sugar--the \nUnited States is clear down at the bottom of the developed countries in \nterms of the retail price paid for sugar in our markets. Our sugar \nproducers are producing sugar efficiently. The price of sugar at our \nretail level in our markets is very competitive worldwide. In fact, as \nyou can see here, we are clear down toward the bottom. The United \nStates is third from the bottom among developed countries in terms of \nthe low price of sugar.\n  The argument that our consumers are being hurt somehow by the sugar \nprogram is simply false. What is really at stake is that there are \nthose who would like to push production of dumped sugar, of subsidized \nsugar, and dump that sugar into the U.S. markets to gain advantage.\n  If you want to look at whether that will cause the price of goods \nthat utilize sugar to go down, you have to look at the marketplace in \nthe United States. Every year we debate this, the argument is made that \nthe sugar prices are unreasonably high because of the sugar program, \nand if we could get those sugar prices down, we would save the \nconsumers in the United States a lot of money. If you look at what has \nhappened to the price of sugar for the last 4 years, it has come down. \nIt has come down about 25 percent.\n  We haven't seen the price of products that utilize sugar come down at \nall. The price of those products has generally gone up over the last 4 \nyears. The savings there have not been passed on to consumers. Those \nsavings, if any, in the reduction of the sugar price in the United \nStates over the last 4 years, have gone directly into the pockets of \nthe producers, those who utilize the lower cost sugar in their products \nbut then continue to sell their products for either the same or an \nincreased price.\n\n  The real issue is whether the United States will continue to protect \nits sugar beet farmers. Right now, talking about sugar beets, the sugar \nfarmers throughout the United States are running at 20-year lows. For \nthe past 2 years, the farmers in the United States are getting 20-year \nlow prices, whereas the prices for the goods that utilize sugar have \nnot come down at all.\n  We need to debunk some of these false theories or false rumors that \nhave been placed out in the American public about what is happening in \nthe sugar debate.\n  Another argument that is often made is that the sugar program \ninvolves the U.S. Government subsidizing heavily its own sugar to \nprotect against this anticompetitive conduct. There are those who say \neven though we do recognize that there are predatory practices \nworldwide, the U.S. taxpayers should not be expected to be the ones who \nstep up to the plate and protect.\n  Again, let's talk about the real facts. The way the sugar program \nworks, the sugar producers themselves pay an assessment on their crops \nto help to fund the nonrecourse loan program that is established to \nprotect the sugar industry. The sugar program basically consists of two \nvery easy pieces: One, a nonrecourse loan; and, two, quotas on imports \nto protect us from dumped sugar being forced into U.S. markets.\n  If you look at what the cost to the U.S. Treasury has been as a \nresult of this nonrecourse loan program, you find something very \ninteresting. If you look at the last 12 years, this chart basically \ncovers 9 or 10 years. The U.S. Treasury has gained money because of\n\n[[Page S13011]]\n\nthe sugar program because in each of the years 1991 through 1999, I \nbelieve in almost every year prior to that, the assessment paid by the \nsugar growers was more than was necessary to pay for the cost of the \nloan program, and the excess went right into the U.S. Treasury. The \nFederal Government was making money off of the sugar program to the \ntaxpayers, not costing the taxpayers money.\n  It is true that in the year 2000 that reversed, and the loan \nassessments were not enough to cover it. And in that year there were \ncosts to the taxpayer as a result of the nonrecourse loan program. We \ncan't say that in every single year there is going to be a benefit to \nthe U.S. Treasury. But we can look at history and historically, in the \nvast majority of the years, the U.S. sugar program operates at no cost \nto the U.S. taxpayer. In fact, it puts dollars in the Treasury which we \nthen allocate to other important priorities in the United States.\n  Whether we are talking about the consumer, whether we are talking \nabout the taxpayer, or whether we are talking about the sugar growers \nin the United States, the sugar program is a program that is designed \nfor well-intentioned purposes and is working well. There is no reason \nwe should have to go through this debate endlessly, as those who would \nlike to drive the price of sugar down even further in the United States \ncontinue to attack the sugar program.\n  I encourage my colleagues to oppose the amendment to strike the sugar \nprovisions from this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks made \nby the Senator from Idaho and by the two Senators who preceded him from \nMinnesota and North Dakota. I was not aware until the Senator from \nIdaho pointed out the history in the sugar program, but I think this \ntestimony today certainly underscores the bipartisan support for this \nprogram and also the benefits not only to sugar beet producers in these \nrespective States but, as Senator Crapo has pointed out, to the \nAmerican people.\n  I see no one else is here right now so I thought I would take a \nmoment. I have been asked by the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, \nSenator Harkin, who is managing this bill, to sit in for him briefly \nbecause he has to chair a conference committee on one of the \nappropriations subcommittees. In baseball terms that is called \n``reaching deep into the bench'' to put me in that position. It does \ngive me an opportunity to speak for a moment about the superb job which \nthe chairman, Senator Harkin, has done in leading our Agriculture \nCommittee and also in bringing this bill to the floor.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, since he and I were both on this \ncommittee for this first year, we have had the good fortune to serve \nunder two very distinguished and outstanding chairmen of the committee. \nSenator Lugar from Indiana, when we first joined the committee, \nprovided magnificent leadership. His longstanding commitment and \nconcern not only to American farmers and to setting the right policy \nfor American farmers is evident, but also his deep support for the \nnutrition programs and benefiting children, consumers throughout this \ncountry.\n  When Senator Harkin became chairman, I had the opportunity then, \nalong with the Presiding Officer, to watch him provide the same kind of \noutstanding leadership. He has had the responsibility to bring this \nbill through our committee and to the Senate floor. I can honestly say, \nafter watching him over the last couple months, one of the positions I \nwould least want to assume is that of chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee. While it has great responsibility and great \nopportunity to be of service to those States, such as Nebraska, \nMinnesota, and others, which are so heavily dependent on agriculture, \nfrankly, the work the chairman has performed I think has been nothing \nshort of miraculous, trying to pull together all the agricultural \ninterests in our very diverse country.\n\n  We have had some of our differences and disagreements, certainly, but \nI think they have been more based on representing the interests of the \nfarmers in our particular States than anything else. Maybe some are on \nphilosophy and views on what the Government's role in agriculture \npolicy ought to be. Most of all, we come from 50 diverse States with \nvery different agricultural interests, and we are trying to knit that \nall together here.\n  Again, I think Senator Harkin has been phenomenal in his ability to \nbring together all the points of view and to reflect not only the \ninterests of his own State of Iowa--which, coincidentally, is \ncontiguous to my State of Minnesota, so we share many issues in \ncommon--but also those interests from all over the country. I think the \nbill that the chairman brought forward is really remarkable.\n  I have listened to the debate over the last couple of days. Again, \nthere are many different points of view, and they all have considerable \nmerit. I hear some who are critical of this effort because of the costs \ninvolved and the need to provide some of these supports to American \nfarmers and producers, and I sometimes think we have lost the context \nfor this legislation and the reason that we, even in the committee, had \nto adopt some of these provisions.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, where commodities such as corn, wheat, \nsoybeans, and dairy are certainly beneficiaries of these programs, I \nwish--and I know every farmer in Minnesota wishes and would greatly \nprefer not to--we did not have to receive any Government payments or \nsubsidies whatsoever--call them AMTA, countercyclical, or whatever. \nThey would much rather make a decent price and get a good profit in the \nmarketplace.\n  I come from a business family, and I know the Presiding Officer has \nbeen involved in business as well. You don't stay in business in this \ncountry if you can't make a profit on what it is you produce and sell. \nThat is what American farmers want to do. They are business men and \nwomen first and foremost. They love the land and the work they do, but \nthey are in agriculture to make a profit--a sufficient profit to pay \nfor all their equipment, their seed, and other investments, and to get \na fair return. Most important, they want to be able to provide for \ntheir families.\n  Something strikes me as terribly wrong in this country when these \nhard-working men and women--America's farmers--want to spend their \nlives and devote their careers to feeding the people in our country and \nthroughout this hungry world, yet they can't make a decent profit on \nwhat it is that they themselves produce. I know farm families in \nMinnesota where the families and their children are literally going \nhungry because they can't make enough producing commodities to be able \nto buy what they need for their own families.\n  That is the crisis we have seen in the past. I think we have seen it \nclearly--at least speaking from Minnesota's perspective--get worse and \nworse under the current farm bill. It was put together with all the \nbest intentions. I don't think there was anybody in the Senate or in \nthe House 6 years ago, when this bill was put together, who had \nany intention other than to best serve the interests of American \nfarmers and the American people. But the fact remains that in the \naftermath of that legislation, the decoupling of prices from payments \nand setting up of AMTA payments that were based on pre-1996 levels of \nproduction has essentially locked in historical production, as well as \nthe payments made according to the size of these farm operations, and \nthat is, prices declined for many key commodities, and in subsequent \nyears Members of Congress from both parties came back and agreed \ntogether, under the administration of the former Democratic President--\nso this was bipartisan--they came back together year after year and \nauthorized these emergency payments.\n\n  Last year in the United States, the Federal Government was the \nlargest provider of financing and income for American farmers. In some \nStates, including parts of my own, net farm income in these areas was \nless than the amount of the Federal Government payments in support of \nthese commodities. In other words, in the marketplace the farmers lost \nmoney. If they had not received these Government payments, they would \nhave been out of business. That is again why, from my perspective, the \nCongress, and the administration, year after year, acted as they did, \nbecause they knew if they did not do so, given the market prices that \nwere not just through the floor; they were in the sub-basement, the \nfarmers\n\n[[Page S13012]]\n\nwould be going out of business. If they hadn't acted as they did, \nMinnesota farmers, by the thousands, would have been out of business.\n  Therefore, if we don't act as we are today, if we were to say take \naway all these subsidies and let's return the dollars and use them for \nsome other purpose, that would absolutely bankrupt farmers in Minnesota \nand, I believe, throughout significant parts of this country.\n  So the goal of Chairman Harkin's work and our work on the committee, \nas I view it, has been to take the predicament in which we find \nourselves today with American agriculture and say how do we move \nourselves out from behind this economic eight ball that we find \nourselves behind and move forward in a way that restores some of the \nmarket prices, at least if I had my way, to levels that are such that \nfarmers could make a good price and profit.\n  Even though we dodge that issue in this country, frankly, there are \nforces--and some have been referred to by some of my colleagues--who \nprefer to see the price that goes to the farmers themselves as low as \npossible, and who benefit from having low market prices for basic \ncommodities because then, through the processing and the transport and \nretail and the like, they have a greater margin for profit in their own \nenterprises, striking that balance so that the American consumer, at \nthe end of that, still pays a reasonable amount, which the consumers do \ntoday--remarkably less of their total family income as a percentage for \nbasic food than virtually any other country in the world, because we \nhave an efficient agriculture system, one that overall provides food \nfor the consumer at a low price, providing for quality as well.\n  Those who want to keep prices low--and we have had this discussion in \nthe Agriculture Committee, the Chair will remember, with the Secretary \nof Agriculture, where I asked the Secretary, because there are some in \nthat administration and part of that Department who reportedly, from \nwhat I have read of their remarks, think the prices should be kept \nfairly low, should not get too high, because then it would have a \nnegative effect on our efforts to expand trade and the like.\n  So I asked the Secretary if she could provide for us what are the \ntarget market prices for these commodities that the administration \nthinks are in the best interests of American farmers, as well as trade \nand everything else. I have not yet received an answer to that question \nthat I raised some time ago.\n\n  So to lay all the cards on the table here, clearly, as I say, there \nare many competing forces, and Chairman Harkin, in my view, has done an \nextraordinary job of balancing them and putting this bill before us. I \nmight say the same about the conservation title. I know Senator Harkin \nand other Members have worked closely on that. He has been working on \nthese new initiatives in conservation for the last couple of years. I \nknow because I had an opportunity--and some of the environmental groups \nand farm groups in Minnesota told me even before I took office about \nhow they have been working with Senator Harkin and with his excellent \nstaff for the last couple of years framing these conservation programs.\n  Senator Harkin recognized that we have already in current law--\nthrough, again, bipartisan efforts and with bipartisan support--such \nvery important conservation programs as CRP, WRP, the ways in which we \nhave encouraged farmers and paid them through Federal funds to set \naside lands that are probably better off not being in agricultural \nproduction--they may be marginal for that purpose; they may have \nenvironmental issues with extensive farm production--and where we \ntherefore make it possible financially for farmers to do the right \nthing. What they would like to do is act as stewards of that land and \nto go ahead.\n  So we have seen those programs. They produce wonderful results and \nsupport the men and women in my State of Minnesota and across the \ncountry--environmental groups and farmers. This is one of those times \nwhen people from all different interests, backgrounds, and perspectives \nseem to agree that, again, within the right balance, setting aside this \namount of acreage has been in the best interests of our country.\n  These are Federal Government programs that have worked for farmers \nand environmentalists. They have worked to preserve our resources. They \nhave worked for sports men and women, fisher men and women, and \nhunters.\n  Senator Harkin wanted to focus in particular on those farmers who \nhave land in production but who themselves, especially during these \ntimes of economic hardship, would like to undertake some improvements \nfor conservation purposes and do not have the resources, sometimes even \nthe technical know-how, to do so.\n  He crafted this new conservation program, the Conservation Security \nAct, which is a major component. It should be called the Harkin \nConservation Security Act, to give due recognition to the leadership he \nhas provided in support of farm organizations, environmental groups, \nand others in Minnesota and elsewhere in the country.\n  If we initiate a new approach which is successful, I believe it will \nbe a tremendous cornerstone of our nationwide conservation efforts by \nproviding farmers with funds and working with them and with people with \nexpertise in farmland conservation so they can bring more of their \nagricultural production into the best conservation practices known and \nprovide them with funds to do so. I think that is an extraordinarily \nimportant part of the legislation.\n  Finally, Mr. President, since I have the opportunity, I want to say \nhow important I think the energy title of this legislation is. Again, I \ncommend Senator Harkin for his leadership in this area as well. He has \nbeen one of the champions in the Senate for a number of years in taking \nour agricultural commodities, such as corn, which is certainly \nprevalent in his State of Iowa and my State of Minnesota, and using \ncorn for purposes of ethanol production, providing what is a winner all \naround, providing an additional market for domestic commodities so we \nraise the prices, as I said earlier, in the marketplace, and providing \nfor cleaner fuel as an alternative, as a substitute for some of the \nhydrocarbon additives. Ethanol is an enormous contribution to a cleaner \nenvironment across this country, and also to domestic oil reserves.\n  I look forward next year to working in the area of expanding the use \nof soybeans for diesel fuel as an additive, and I know Senator Harkin \nhas been willing to take the leadership, along with myself and others, \nin that area as well.\n  Again, I commend the chairman. I certainly commend the ranking member \nas well, but I think through the chairman's hard work especially, we \nhave a bill today I am very proud to support.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, when I saw the Senator from Minnesota was \nspeaking on the farm bill, I wanted to come and thank him publicly for \nthe role he has played as a new member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  The Senate Agriculture Committee deals with some of the most \ndifficult issues when we are dealing with a new farm bill. This has \nbeen a debate that has extended over a long time. I point out that the \nSenator from Minnesota, as a new member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, in my judgment, has become one of its most thoughtful \nmembers. We saw that with respect to the amendments he offered and his \ndebate, both in the public sessions and also the sessions in which \nthere were only members discussing how we would proceed.\n  I thank him. It is awfully good to have a new colleague from a \nneighboring State who has done his homework on the issues in this farm \nbill. I believe that is the case with the Senator from Minnesota. I \ncommend him for the role he has already played.\n  One of the things that happens around here is you develop respect \nbased on your credibility, and the Senator from Minnesota I think has \nlaid a basis that will serve him well for many years to come in the \nSenate.\n  I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the role of the current \noccupant of the chair as well who is also a new member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, the former Governor of the State of Nebraska, \nalmost a neighbor to North Dakota, but someone with\n\n[[Page S13013]]\n\nwhom we have shared interests and somebody who has played a very \nimportant role as well in bringing this farm bill before the Senate.\n  We can acknowledge there were many who said we would never be here. \nThere are many who said we could not get a bill through the committee \nthis year, we could not get a bill on to the floor of the Senate. Now \nthey are saying we cannot get it out of the Senate. We will see. We \nknow there are those who are opposed to moving this legislation this \nyear. I think they are badly in error. Let me say why.\n  We are faced with the lowest prices in 50 years in agriculture. In \nOctober, the price review for agriculture came out, the so-called \nproducer price index. It indicated the biggest drop in prices that \nfarmers received in 91 years--the biggest monthly reduction.\n  Our major competitors are not waiting. The Europeans have clearly a \nplan and a strategy they are pursuing and pursuing aggressively. They \nare already providing their producers nearly 10 times as much in per \nacre support. They are providing 28 times as much in export subsidy to \ntake markets that have traditionally been ours. They hope we are \nasleep. They hope we will not act. They hope we will debate this bill \nto death and not move forward.\n  I hope they are wrong. I believe they will be proven wrong. It is \nincredibly important to this country that they are wrong because if \nEurope prevails, if they are able to maintain this differential in \nwhich they are continuing to grab market share that traditionally has \nbeen ours--remember, in the last 20 years they have gone from the \nbiggest importing region in the world to the biggest exporting region. \nThey have done it in 20 years. They have done it the old-fashioned way: \nThey have gone out and bought these markets.\n  We in this country will regret it for a very long time if we lose our \nworld dominance in agriculture. We are very close. The stakes are \nenormous, and this farm bill is the test. I hope we pass it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to strongly oppose the Gregg \namendment, which would essentially abolish the sugar program and place \nthe remaining two sugarcane producers in my state out of business.\n  Hawaii cannot afford the dramatic increase in unemployment that will \nresult from the shutdown of the remaining sugar operations. Sugar \nsupports much of the employment base on the Islands of Kauai and Maui. \nIf there is no relief to sugar prices, approximately 300 to 400 sugar \nand related workers will become unemployed. For a small island economy, \nthis would be an enormous loss of jobs at a time when there are few \nalternative employment opportunities in the state. The sugar industry \nin Hawaii has declined to about one-third of its size compared to five \nyears ago, and the remaining operations can remain globally competitive \nonly as long as the U.S. sugar program is in place. The U.S. sugar \nprogram provides a cushion against imports from the world dump market, \nwhere prices have run about half the world average cost of producing \nsugar for most of the past two decades.\n  U.S. producer prices for sugar have been running at 20-year lows for \nthe last two years, and it is extremely difficult for our producers to \ncompete because sugar production around the world is heavily \nsubsidized. Because of foreign subsidized surpluses the world dump \nmarket price has averaged, for the past decade and a half, only about \nhalf of the price it would have been in the absence of subsidies. For \nexample, the European Union (EU) has transformed itself from one of the \nworld's biggest sugar importers to one of the world's biggest exporters \nwith extremely generous producer subsidies. The EU subsequently \nunloaded its surplus sugar onto the world dump market with massive \nexport subsidies. Some 6 million metric tons of subsidized sugar is \ndumped on the world market each year, for whatever price it can bring \nin.\n  The U.S. sugar policy was a net revenue raiser of $279 million from \n1991 to 1999. The sugar provisions in S. 1731 allows American sugar \nfarmers and producers to compete on a level playing field against \nforeign sugar farmers. I urge my colleagues to defeat the Gregg \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a couple of hours ago, I came to the Chamber \nand indicated we needed to move this legislation along. We have not \nmoved it very far, although this has been a stimulating debate on the \ntopic of sugar.\n  I have spoken to the Republican manager Senator Lugar, and he has \nindicated he wants to speak, Senator Enzi wants to speak. And I see my \nfriend from Arizona. I do not know if he has had an opportunity to \nspeak yet. I say through the Chair to the Senator from Indiana, I do \nnot know if the Senator from Arizona has spoken. I have not been in the \nChamber all day. He may want to speak.\n  It appears not.\n  When Senator Lugar finishes his statement and the Senator from \nWyoming finishes his statement, I will move to table this amendment.\n  I also say to the manager of the bill for the minority, I hope \nsometime this afternoon we can have a cutoff for filing of amendments. \nIf we are not able to determine how many amendments there will be and \nsome time for a filing deadline, it appears people are not serious \nabout moving this bill along.\n  I look forward to the next vote, and we can talk to the two leaders \nat that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished colleague from \nNevada in response, it is indeed my impression that following the \ndebate on the sugar amendment, Senator Domenici wishes to offer an \namendment, and then Senator Bond from Missouri will come in, and then \nSenator McCain.\n  Mr. REID. That sounds good.\n  Mr. LUGAR. At least we know there will be some activity. I want to \nspeak on the sugar program. For the moment, I am prepared to yield to \nmy distinguished colleague from Wyoming because I will be here for \nquite awhile, and to conserve his time so he might be heard, I yield \nthe floor, and I will ask for recognition again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Gregg amendment \nwhich is to phase out the sugar program. The goal of U.S. sugar policy \nis for our producers to provide a consistent supply of inexpensive \nsugar to consumers. We have met that goal. Sugar is an important part \nof almost every food product. The U.S. sugar policy has provided food \nmanufacturers with an unwavering supply of sugar without cost \nfluctuations. All consumers have benefited from this steady supply. The \nU.S. sugar policy has allowed producers in Wyoming and other States to \nprovide for the country's sugar needs without going out of business.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire claims the U.S. would be better served \nif we purchased our sugar from the world market. I will not deny the \nprices for sugar on the world market are less expensive than the \ncurrent U.S. sugar prices. It is important to note that the world \nmarket is a dump market. It is comprised of surplus sugar from \nsubsidized countries.\n  Countries such as Mexico supply the world market. Mexico now has an \naverage overproduction of 631,000 pounds. Even though 250,000 pounds of \nthat surplus production is accepted into our market under the NAFTA \nside level, the Mexican Government recently bought and paid the debts \non almost half of the sugar refineries in Mexico. If that is not \nsubsidization, I don't know what is.\n  I met with the folks from the Mexican senate yesterday. They were in \nthe United States to talk about sugar. I had to remind them of their \noverproduction, and if the world market opens up it will grow even \ngreater. I had to talk to them about the NAFTA side letter so that our \nhigh fructose corn syrup can go to Mexico and eliminate some of the \noverage we have here.\n  I know for a fact some of the people who served in this body at the \ntime that NAFTA came up only voted for NAFTA on the basis of that side \nletter. That side letter is now not being recognized by the Mexican \nGovernment.\n  They are creating a crisis in America, a crisis in Wyoming. The sugar \nbeet growers in Wyoming are working desperately to make their product \nwork, to make sure there is an even domestic supply. We shifted all of \nour energy supply overseas--not all, but a\n\n[[Page S13014]]\n\ngood deal of it. You can see the crisis that this is causing at the \npresent time in this country. Should we do that to sugar too; get rid \nof our local producers and have those countries in the other parts of \nthe world ban together to control the price of sugar and make us pay \nthrough the nose for sugar? I don't think that is a very good idea.\n  Our sugar producers in Wyoming are coming up with alternate ways to \nmake their production work better. One of the ways they are doing that \nis to buy the refineries. They are not asking the Federal Government to \nbuy the refineries. They are buying the refineries. They are forming \nco-ops and putting their land up against the refinery. Why? They get a \nlittle bit of profit off of the sugar, off of the production of the \nsugar. They will get another little bit of profit off of the refining \nof the sugar. If they can put together enough of the different layers \nthat are presently going to other people, they will be able to make a \nliving from the sugar.\n  Don't be fooled by the glut of sugar in the world market. The price \nmay be low now, but I guarantee that will change. As soon as the U.S. \naccepts this amendment and begins buying from the world market, the \nprice for sugar in that market will rise. We will be left at the mercy \nof the world market because our growers will no longer be in business.\n\n  In Wyoming alone, the Main Streets of at least four rural communities \nwould become ghost towns. They will no longer be able to meet the needs \nof our own country. While sugar beets remain the No. 1 cash crop in \nWyoming, the price farmers receive for their sugar is at a 20-year low. \nThat shows the dire situation all agricultural producers are in this \nyear. The companies that refine the sugar beets into sugar in Wyoming \ncan no longer afford to remain open.\n  The farmers in my State and others have banded together to try to \npurchase the refineries. They are attempting and fighting to do \neverything they can to remain viable and competitive. These are not \nfarmers waiting for the U.S. Government to bail them out; they are \nfighting for their own future.\n  The Senate should defeat this amendment. We should continue to \nsupport sugar beet and sugarcane farmers just as we support all farmers \nwho produce agricultural commodities in the United States. The sugar \nprogram portion of the total net outlays for all commodity programs \nfrom 1996 to 2001 was only .19 percent, a small cost to maintain a \nsteady supply of sugar to our consumers and to provide for communities \nthat rely on the sugar community.\n  This becomes a domino effect. We talked about the problem with \nairlines and how people rely on airlines. If you are in a small \ncommunity, one of the four small communities in Wyoming that rely on \nsugar beets, when the industry goes down, the whole economy goes--I \ndon't care how well the airlines are flying. They are not asking for \nthe United States to buy the sugar refineries as they have in Mexico. \nThey are just asking for a fair chance at their economy and a little \nlonger to develop these co-ops. I hope Members stick with us on the \nsugar amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nstatement of the Senator from Indiana, Senator Burns be recognized for \nup to 15 minutes to speak on this amendment; Senator Craig be \nrecognized to speak up to 15 minutes on this amendment; and that I then \nbe recognized. I will move to table the underlying Craig amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Reserving the right to object, my understanding--perhaps \nsomeone can advise me--is that Senator Gregg wanted to make a final \nargument. Could the leader offer at least a proviso of time for Senator \nGregg?\n  Mr. REID. That is appropriate, and I also ask unanimous consent that \nthere be no intervening amendment prior to my motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, which, \nas has been pointed out by all speakers, effectively phases out the \nsubsidies provided under the existing Federal sugar program.\n  Apropos of the comments made by my colleague from Wyoming, almost all \nfarmers are supported by some program, as I attempted to point out this \nmorning, and only about 40 percent of farmers in our country receive \nany benefits from all of these programs. I appreciate that colleagues \nfind this difficult to believe, but nevertheless it happens to be the \ncase. It is the case because historically programs arise attached to \nvery specific crops. In the case of the row crop of wheat, corn, \ncotton, and rice and the evolution of things, soybeans have come into \nthat category and there have been very special programs over the course \nof time established for sugar or peanuts, for tobacco, for wool and \nmohair. In due course, programs have come up largely through a sense of \nequity and disaster areas that have somehow touched upon so-called \nspecialty crops.\n  But after all is said and done, the farm bill essentially is a \nfocused bill historically on program crops. Sugar is one of these. As a \nresult, those who are involved in the sugar program are among the 40 \npercent who are beneficiaries as opposed to the 60 percent of American \nfarmers who are not.\n  Having said that, in the amendment I offered this morning I did not \noffer discriminatory comments with regard to the sugar program any more \nthan other programs. Rather inclusively, I suggested that $1 of revenue \nfrom sugar ought to be treated the same as $1 of revenue, say, from \nhoney or from wool or whatever. That would be true, in my judgment, for \nsugar farmers. If the farm does only the production of sugar, that is \ngoing to be the only item in the list. But, nevertheless, that sugar \ngrower would have been entitled to a 6-percent voucher on the first \n$250,000 of value, 4 percent on the next $250,000. Admittedly, that \nwould bring a certain amount of discomfort to a very small number of \nsugar growers.\n\n  But, as Senator Gregg pointed out, a very small number receive 40 \npercent of all the money in the sugar program, as is the case again and \nagain in agricultural programs as they are now. They go to a minority \nof farmers to begin with. A very small minority of that minority \nreceive a disproportionate amount of the payments--such as, in the \ntotality of things, 47 percent of payments going to just 8 percent of \nfarmers.\n  The sugar distribution is even more pronounced, with a vengeance. \nTherefore, the amendment Senator Gregg offers, a phaseout of these \nsugar subsidies over the course of a period until we get to zero in the \nyear 2006. There is a transition that phases into the world market that \nhas been discussed. I will touch upon that. It offers, at least, a \nglidepath out of this, given the fact we are not going to have a whole \nfarm view but continue with very specific commodities because the \nprogram has had very unfortunate results, as Senator Gregg has detailed \nand that I want to underline.\n  In essence, his amendment would phase out the so-called loan rate for \nsugar beets and sugarcane, reducing it to zero. Marketing allotments \nand quotas for both sugar beets and sugarcane would be eliminated \nbeginning with the year 2003 crops. Senator Gregg's proposal would make \nthe funding offset of approximately $1.2 billion over 10 years, \naccording to CBO estimates, available to lift the shelter cap in place \nin the Food Stamp Program. So, in essence, Senator Gregg is moving this \nmoney, which is going disproportionately to very large sugar growers, \nto nutrition programs for the poor.\n  Eliminating this cap, as the Senator points out, will help a large \nnumber of families whose actual housing and utility costs put them in a \nsituation of choosing between shelter and food.\n  This morning, as we discussed my amendment, I chose to offer a \nsolution of roughly doubling the amount of money over the course of 5 \nyears in food programs. Senator Gregg goes about this in a different \nway, given the loss of my amendment this morning.\n  The Senate committee bill maintains, as it stands, many of the \ncurrent sugar program provisions and, in fact, provides additional \nbenefits that proponents have required as well. It eliminates the \nmarketing assessment on sugar, reduces the CCC interest rate on pricing \nboard loans, authorizes a payment-in-kind program, reestablishes\n\n[[Page S13015]]\n\nthe no-net-cost feature of the program, and provides the Secretary with \nauthority to implement allotments on domestic sugar production.\n  The loan forfeiture penalty on sugar also is eliminated. The taxpayer \ncost of all of this is expected to be about $530 million in mandatory \nnew spending, above baseline, during the next 10 years. This is the CBO \n10-year score.\n  I mention that because there has been considerable discussion. \nWhatever may be the merits or demerits of the sugar program, the costs \nto the taxpayers is de minimis. Albeit, a small problem in the past \nyear, but nevertheless this was an aberration, as suggested. But it is \nno aberration when CBO scores the sugar program in the Harkin bill as \n$530 million. That is real money, taxpayer money over the next 10 \nyears. This is hardly a harmless procedure.\n  There has been long debate about the effectiveness in the \nadministration of the program. I wish to touch upon some of those \nproblems as an illustration of unintended consequences of the sugar \nprogram.\n\n  The U.S. Government, for many years, as all have pointed out, has \nsubsidized domestic sugar production through a combination of price \nsupports but, perhaps equally effectively, import quotas. That has led \nto, if we were discussing this in a foreign policy debate, some very \nserious problems. For example, throughout the 1980s, as this body and \nthe President of the United States seriously talked about democracy in \nCentral and South America and in the Philippines, the sugar situation \narose every time. The countries were attempting to help find their way \nto the ballot box but then, fairly rapidly, due to some type of \neconomic consequences in which the newly elected officials could be \nsupported, they ran up against the fact that we restrict the amount of \nsugar imports to this country and restrict them rather severely.\n  A so-called sugar quota system occurred in the world, country by \ncountry--literally of how many pounds each country was allowed to ship \nto us. It mattered not what the price was. The entire situation was \ncarefully regulated. Why? Because those who had formulated the sugar \nprogram readily saw that if we were offering stimulus to production in \nthis country at the same time mandating imports from other countries, a \ncollision was going to occur--which has occurred, from time to time. \nBut what also happened was that other countries around the world were \nprohibited, really, from the economic sustenance that those exports to \nour country would have meant for them.\n  So on the one hand we talked about foreign assistance, foreign aid to \nthese countries to shore up their fledgling economies and fledgling \ndemocracies, but not through allowing them to ship to us something of \nwhich they had surpluses and in fact produced at a fairly low \nproduction cost.\n  Throughout this debate, the production cost, the worldwide cost has \nbeen mentioned at approximately 16.5 cents. But that is the average \ncost. That is almost saying there is some type of average cost for the \nproduction of corn in the United States of America, which means maybe \napproximately half of corn growers are more efficient than that. Some \nare very much more so, as a matter of fact.\n  I mention this because some countries have a natural advantage in the \nproduction of sugar that we do not have. This is an acquired skill in \nthe United States. Our problem, then, in terms of foreign policy, was \nexacerbated further, as has been pointed out, when we came into the \nNAFTA agreement. This is a serious problem on the horizon, not touched \nupon in great detail today but it would be by anybody in a sugar \nconference because we pledged to have a fairly free flow of Mexican \nsugar.\n  This gets into other internal agricultural disputes because those who \nare producing high fructose syrup--and this is largely corn growers who \nare interested in this situation--feel badly treated by the Mexicans. \nThey have protested in about every way, in all the various settlement \nfora, that they are being shut down by Mexican intransigence. Mexicans \nare replying: By the way, you are supposed to take our sugar.\n  So to say the least we have a problem here between corn growers, if \nwe were in that fora, and sugar growers. Likewise, our treaty \nobligations somehow are in some disarray when it comes to this issue.\n  In any event, domestic sugar processors have benefited from price \nsupport loans that guarantee them at least two to three times the world \nprice of sugar and sometimes more.\n  We touch upon, once again, this price of sugar. And others have \npointed out that the true average of 16.5 cents is the world price. I \ntook a look at the Wall Street Journal this morning, and it is now \nsomewhat less than 8 cents. It has not been a good week for sugar.\n  The proponents at least of the sugar program point out that this is \nso-called dumped sugar and that what I and others don't understand is \ncountries and big users contract with each other. Presumably the idea \nis that they contract at some price that must be adverse to their \nsituation because clearly it must be higher than the world price. \nApparently, do this year after year, and keep on doing it regardless of \nhow far above the world price it is.\n  For a commonsense listener of this debate, that listener might say: \nWhy, just to test out the system, don't you just buy the 8-cent sugar? \nWhy would you want to make a contract at 15, 16, 17, or 18 cents? The \nsophisticated sugar producer might very well say: Well, because that is \nabout what it cost. And, by and large, that is where the bulk of it is \nif you have a big contract. You really need a lot. You need a certainty \nof supply. You need continuity of management, and so forth, as some \nhave pointed out, and long-term contracts. But you don't look at the \ndaily posting in the Wall Street Journal. But if you have something out \nthere, I understand that.\n  We have sophisticated discussions about sugar prices that involve all \nof these aspects of certainty.\n  With regard to the pricing of various commodities, in my farm \nexperience from time to time the starch company has suggested that, if \nI would guarantee a flow of corn month by month, which means that I \nwould bear the storage costs and the problems of transportation and \nmarketing, and what have you, they would be prepared to pay a premium \nfor every bushel of corn well above anything that I could sell it for \nin the futures market, for example. Why would they do that? Because a \nguarantee of a certain number of thousands of bushels month by month \nwith a fairly short haul and certainty in the neighborhood is valuable \nto them.\n  I can well understand why people would come to contractual agreements \non sugar that might be above the fluctuations of the world market at \nsome point. However, for the domestic consumer of sugar--this includes \nothers well beyond candy companies or those who are commercially \ninvolved in these operations--it would be attractive to consumers in \nthe United States if they could consider the possibility of buying this \ndumped sugar. It is as inexpensive as the sugar that was not dumped. As \na matter of fact, domestic producers say that would be unfair because \nour production costs are well above that cost.\n  One can understand their argument on this despite the contracts which \nthey claim to have made at prices that are much higher in a situation. \nBut consumers are always helped by markets and by genuine competition. \nThere is a lot of it out there.\n  The suggestion is that somehow if we were seduced by the idea of 8-\ncent sugar and started buying, that suddenly it would be gone, and that \nit would be back to 16 cents. That is nonsense. My experience, at least \nin visiting people all over the world who are involved--in the \nCaribbean, South America and Philippines--is they have a lot of sugar. \nIt would not just be dumped. It would come in a steady flow, and it \nwould come at a cost that is substantially less than that which is now \npaid by consumers. We would have tax reductions across the board.\n\n  It has the same effect as a drop in the price of gasoline, which we \nall applaud. No one, to my knowledge, is condemning Saudi Arabia for \ndumping gasoline on the American market. As a matter of fact, we want \nthem to dump some more--as much as they can. We fear that our good \nfortune might end at some point; that the cartel might get together and \nsomehow remedy the predicament. But for the moment, as consumers of \ngasoline, we understand the\n\n[[Page S13016]]\n\nissue clearly. So should we as consumers understand the issue of sugar, \na common substance used by most of us.\n  I am saying in terms of our standard of living that our situation \nwould be enhanced. It would be a tax cut through the Gregg amendment.\n  For the moment, however, imports are restricted through quotas that \nare among the last remaining protection barriers in U.S. trade law. \nThat, of course, means even with our barrier with Mexico with whom we \nthought we had reduced the barrier--the whole purpose of NAFTA--and \ndespite claims that the sugar program operated at no net cost in fiscal \n2000, the sugar program cost the taxpayers--not consumers but \ntaxpayers--$465 million, according to the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture. That is a substantial sum of money.\n  Furthermore, as we have heard, the Federal Government ended fiscal \nyear 2001, the last year we were in, owning 1 million tons of surplus \nsugar, some of which is now given back to producers as payment for \nplowing up their growing crops.\n  USDA projects that by decade's end, the Government will own not 1 \nmillion but 4 million tons of sugar acquired through this program--\nthrough forfeiture of sugar pledged for collateral for nonrecourse \nloans under the program.\n  Senator Gregg has said--and I affirm--that we cannot follow this \nindefensible path. Under our current international trade commitments, \nwe must soon permit increasing imports and obligations under ``WTO'' \nand NAFTA, which, coupled with record high domestic projections, will \nresult in a sugar supply far in excess of demand. A long-term and \nrational solution must be implemented in the near future.\n  I compliment the Senator from New Hampshire for at least a bypass \nsolution rather than an abrupt termination. The sugar program, in \nessence, is a transfer of wealth from many who are not able to pay--\nlow-income persons--to a fairly small group of producers, many of whom \nare, in fact, very large corporations and wealthy individuals.\n  We are now talking about the sugar producers--not the candy companies \nthat have been given some criticism for their wealth and their \nfinancial means.\n  Nearly all other farm programs make transfer payments from the \nTreasury. Thus, the transfers--whatever their merits--bear some \nrelation to ability to pay since they utilize funds generated by the \nprogressive income tax. But the sugar program works just the opposite. \nAny tax on food places a greater burden on low-income Americans. Thus \nmy point: Any decrease in the price, such as the ability of incoming \nshipments of sugar at the world market, serves as a tax decrease for \nthe same reason.\n\n  The sugar program ultimately must hurt consumers, despite the pledge \nthat somehow stability is maintained, somehow that a moderate price is \nmaintained, as opposed to prophecies that the price literally would \ntake off if we were going to buy in the world exports at 8 cents.\n  Finally, I would just say, simply, the price of all food that \ncontains sugar would be affected in addition to the raw product. Sugar \ngrowers' own statistics show that in developed countries with access to \nthis world-priced sugar--and I cite particularly our friends in \nAustralia and Canada; these are countries that really have not been so \ninhibited in utilizing the world-priced sugar at these prices--retail \nprices in Canada and Australia are lower than in the United States.\n  Only countries with protectionist sugar regimes--and that would \ninclude the European Union, of course--have consumer prices that are \nhigher.\n  If this were entirely an economic debate, it would be serious enough \nbecause we are talking about consumers all over the country in what \namounts to a tax increase. And now this is augmented by actual Treasury \npayments in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  Senator Gregg touched upon the Everglades. Let me go into this \nfurther.\n  Sugar production on approximately 500,000 acres at the top of the \nEverglades has substantially contributed to the environmental \ndegradation of the Everglades. In 1996, the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee supported the inclusion of $200 million in that year to \npurchase lands in the Everglades agricultural area, simply to help in \nthe process of restoration. This was a bipartisan effort and one which \nFlorida Governor Bush called ``the linchpin of Everglades \nrestoration.''\n  From my personal experience, for a variety of reasons, I was \ncampaigning in Florida that year and was made well aware of what was a \ncollision of cultures, so to speak. A very huge number of Floridians \ndescribed the situation to me in detail. I went to the Everglades to \nsee this degradation for myself, as well as the sugar plantations and \nall that was involved.\n  People could have rationalized, in times gone by, that, after all, \nhuman beings should be supported in agriculture, that the spoilation of \nwhatever was there had happened elsewhere in our country at various \ntimes in history, that it was too bad if additives to the crop: \nfertilizers, chemicals, what have you, floated downstream and even got \noffshore and created all sorts of ecological difficulties; that is the \nway it goes. And to seriously talk about winding this up, at this point \nin history, even if it meant that you could never restore the \nEverglades, or even the waterways of Florida, was really beside the \npoint.\n  But for many Floridians it was not beside the point. As a matter of \nfact, they proceeded to a very tough referendum campaign that was \ndecided ultimately by a very narrow margin in favor of the sugar \ngrowers, not those who were in favor of restoring the Everglades.\n  Thus, as a result of that debate, and in part because many of us in \nthe Nation as a whole believed that this is a very important \nenvironmental project, the Congress has come into it in a big way to \ntry to work with those in the State of Florida who still, in a fairly \nmodest way, are trying to wind up the worst of the predicaments and \nwrestle with the history of the past.\n\n  Let me just make the point, Members who are thoughtful about this \nsugar amendment need to think about the economics. I appreciate the \nproblem is the Everglades, not North Dakota or Minnesota or sugar beets \nin the North. One cannot describe the same environmental catastrophes \nto those, and yet they are caught in the same economic problem. But we \nreally need to consider the expenditures that are now going to be \ninvolved as the Congress, the President, and others, including the \nGovernor of Florida, have become not only aware but determined, really, \nto turn around the course of history which ecologically has been \ndisastrous in this situation.\n  Clearly, we ought not to be doing, in this bill, what we are doing, I \nfear, with almost every other crop; that is, offering incentives for \nmore production. And that, I fear, we are doing again here. One can say \nthat, after all, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. \nIf you are going to offer more incentives to corn farmers to plant more \ncorn, why be sparing with regard to the sugar brethren at this point?\n  I suppose there is a certain rough equity. If you are planning to \nsimply overproduce everything, then, perhaps, consistency gets in the \nway here. But I would suggest that would be a mistake not only with \nregard to the sugar program but clearly with regard to the ecological \nand environmental consequences.\n  The right move is to wind up the sugar program. Members have pointed \nout such amendments have been offered seemingly for time in memorial. \nDuring the 25 years I have served on the committee, I cannot remember \nhow many sugar amendments have arisen, but they have come frequently, \nat least one every farm bill, usually with great discouragement to the \nproponents.\n  I believe three farm bills back, if memory serves me right, a modest \nproposal came during the markup around the Agriculture Committee table. \nA Senator offered a suggestion that the loan rate be reduced by 2 \ncents. I think even in those days it was 18 cents or 16 cents. The \nsuggestion was 2 cents be subtracted from that. That was roundly \ndefeated. If it got three votes, that may overstate it. How could this \nbe? Why such support of a reduction of such a modest amount?\n  The fact is, around the table in the Agriculture Committee--and this \nis\n\n[[Page S13017]]\n\nnot news to the Senator from Delaware--many of us who are deeply \ninterested in the crops and in the agricultural practices in our States \nhave a feeling we have come to that table to protect whatever is there. \nSometimes that is very difficult for Members. The case is tougher and \ntougher to defend as the years go on, but that does not deter most. \nApologetically, we will say: I have to do what I have to do. I can be a \nstatesman somewhere else, but not when it comes to sugar or peanuts or \ntobacco or even corn.\n  I understand that. As a result, what I often have observed, in 25 \nyears, is that those who have something to protect, as a matter of \nfact, make up a very large majority of us around the table. The \nsituation would be--I think simplicity may be overstating this, but, \nessentially, if you are there to protect tobacco, you call upon your \nbrethren who are protecting sugar or protecting peanuts or wool and \nmohair or indigo or honey or whatever the program may be--all of these \nprograms have been highly suspect for years. From time to time, some \nhave actually been wound up. There was good fortune in this respect a \ncouple of farm bills ago when I think we finished the honey program. \nWool and mohair certainly was gone, but it reappeared, not because of a \nfarm bill but in the dead of night, in an appropriations bill at the \nend of a session, such as now, the proponents have managed to bring it \nback. So even around the table, when we make reforms, they do not \nnecessarily stick. Therefore, I admire the courage, the foresight, \nstatesmanship, and the wisdom of the Senator from New Hampshire in \ntrying again today.\n  He has offered a constructive amendment which is good for America. At \nsome point we really have to think about that. We can become so \nparochial and so narrow in our focus that we believe that a very few \ngrowers of any crop, whether it be sugar or something else, are worthy \nof our utmost attention.\n  But Americans generally listening to this debate, I believe, will \nfind the equation I have offered a reasonable one; namely, we welcome \nthe so-called dumping of oil by Saudi Arabia and others; we welcome the \nlower price of gasoline because our cost of living situation is helped. \nWe would welcome, in my judgment, the purchase of sugar at the world \nprice. We would welcome the fulfillment of our agreement with Mexico \nbecause that is so important not only with regard to agriculture but \nwith regard to general trade and prosperity with our neighbor to the \nsouth as well as an enhanced standard of living in this country. And we \nwelcome fulfillment of our WTO obligations because all of us want to \nexport more of the things we do well in our States.\n  We cannot withhold our obligations to recognize that in other places \nsometimes people do things well also, and our consumers benefit from \nthose laws of trade.\n  I call for support of the Gregg amendment and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMontana is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it is hard to follow my friend from Indiana \nbecause he makes his argument so sound that it is hard to argue with \nhim. I look upon the support we give American agriculture, no matter \nwhat segment, as an insurance policy.\n  The figure was that the sugar program costs the American taxpayers \nsome $460 million a year, something like that. That is in the \nneighborhood. That may not be correct. That is less than $1.60 per \nAmerican. I can't insure my car for that price. What we are talking \nabout here is that even though sugar prices go down, we still see \nprices of those products that have a high preponderance of sugar in \nthem continue to go up. That is the record. It is there for all to see.\n  If one looks at the total picture of $73 billion a year we put into \nthe agriculture budget, one has to remember that over half of that is \nprograms on nutrition, food stamps, WIC, many others, meals on wheels, \nschool lunch programs, all subsidized by the American taxpayer. The \nrest of it is farm programs and the administration of those farm \nprograms.\n  I look at it as an insurance policy. No other country in the world \nhas a grocery store like we do. Americans have to agree with me that \nwhen you go into a grocery store, there is a variety of anything you \nwant to eat. I realize that maybe we don't look upon that as an \nimportant thing, but the second thing we do every day when we get up is \neat. I don't know what the first thing you do is; that is up to you. \nBut we all need it. We would like to have a little insurance and a \nlittle security in the food we buy both from a quality and quantity \nstandpoint. And we do.\n  You can buy your meat, prepare it any way you want. Same thing with \nyour fresh fruits and vegetables. This is just about the only country \nin the world, that has fresh vegetables even in the northern tier of \nStates. When there is blowing snow outside, we can still buy fresh \nlettuce and vegetables. It is an infrastructure and a distribution \nsystem that is unmatched in the world.\n  Getting back to farmer income, for many years agriculture, at the \nproduction level, lived on 15 to 20 cents--and that varied--of the \nconsumer dollar which went back to the American farmer. Now we are \ntrying to get by on 9 or 10 cents. Our cost of production, our cost of \nvehicles, our cost of machinery, of our fertilizer, our chemicals, \neverything it takes to produce a crop is higher. Let's take, for \ninstance, wheat. In my State it is around $2.75 a bushel. That is lower \nthan it was coming out of World War II, 50 years ago.\n  We are a blessed nation. We can produce. The American farmer can turn \nit up, and they can produce it. My goodness, can they produce it. Yet \nwhen it comes time to write the check, not near as many of those \ndollars and pennies filter down to the American farmer. Think about \nthis: When you buy a loaf of bread, less than a nickel's worth of wheat \nis in it.\n  Yes, the retail price of sugar in Canada is lower than in the United \nStates, 6 cents a pound. No wonder the people who handle sugar in \nCanada like the idea of stuffing. This is the only industry where it is \nmandatory by law and by trade negotiations and trade agreements that we \nimport so much sugar--not trying to overproduce here in the United \nStates, but it is mandatory. It comes to about 15 to 20 percent of our \ntotal production is mandatorily put on our market. If we look at the \nsurplus, that is just about our surplus.\n  We can talk about numbers and figures. In fact, we can swim in those \nnumbers and figures. But at some time we have to take a real look at \nthe men who are on the ground in charge of producing. They are the \nones. It is on their backs that this good economy operates. We don't \nspend 50, 60, 70, or 80 percent of our income just to put a meal on the \ntable. We do it for less than 20 cents.\n  In order to ensure that supply of quality and quantity, and also \nprepared in any way that you want, there has to be some sort of an \ninsurance policy that that, too, will remain. We have bigger things to \nargue about in this Senate than this sugar program and what it costs. \nIn fact, the cost, when you compare it to the rest of the economy, is \nnothing.\n  We could talk about food safety. We could talk about terrorism and \nits impact on our ability to move food from the producer to the table.\n  That is what we are talking about here. It is an industry that should \nbe allowed to survive. Sugar producers did put forth a plan for why \ninventory management is the plan for sugar farmers, consumers, and \ntaxpayers. Let's not get caught up in saying that if we take away a \nsugar program, the cost will go down to the consuming public, when the \nfigures bear out that it is not true. That was very ably pointed out. \nThat is not true.\n  If we had assurance that we could do a lot of things and provide food \nfor those who are in need--that is what this does, and it makes it \naffordable. What it saves on the consumer side also saves on the \nGovernment side whenever we start talking about nutrition programs and \nprograms that we are willing, as Americans, to provide those who are in \nneed. Nobody ever thinks about those savings.\n  On the loans--nobody ever thinks that--while we have the sugar, it is \nsold. Where did the money go? We just hear about the initial \nappropriation for the program, but we never get an accounting on how \nmuch the Government owned, how much it sold and the difference. If we \nlost a little money, then that takes that so-called--everybody hates \nthis word--subsidy number way\n\n[[Page S13018]]\n\nback. It is hard to get those accounting numbers.\n  So what I am saying is that Americans are willing to ensure the \nstability, the quality, and the supply. They are willing to accept and \npay for that insurance policy. If you look at the whole bill, I think \nit is around $250, $270 a household across the country. You can't \ninsure your car or your house for that, and you can't insure your life.\n  I had a cookie while coming over here. Obviously, I've had a lot of \ncookies in my life. I have never missed a meal, nor do I intend to. But \nI also understand that this society is the benefactor of people who \nreally know how to produce. Now, talking about limitations and all of \nthat, let me tell you folks that on the farm and ranch, the people who \nwere inefficient, just playing around and trying to farm and could not, \nthey are gone.\n  We are talking about an agriculture that is down to the point where \nthese are the good people who know how to operate and they are \nefficient. Our production, as far as increasing our production per \nacre, has almost been capped out. We can't increase that any more. So \nthe old analogy saying we have to be more efficient and increase our \nproduction per acre, and our cost --we will have more to sell, but our \ncost of production continues to edge up there, also.\n  I am always reminded of the two fellows in Montana--brothers--and \nthey go to Mississippi and buy watermelons for 75 cents apiece and haul \nthem to Montana and sell them for 74 cents apiece. One looked at the \nother and said: We are not making any money. The other suggested: We \nhave to get a bigger truck. Well, that is not happening in agriculture \nanymore. That is not happening there.\n  So the consumers of America, who are benefactors of this great \nproduction, are willing, I think, to buy that insurance policy that \nsays, yes, we will have a supply; yes, it will be ample; yes, it will \nbe quality; and, yes, it is guaranteed to be at that grocery store that \nis open 24 hours a day and the ability to buy anything you want to eat, \nin any amount, at any quality, prepared in any way. That is what we are \ntalking about there. That is what American agriculture is all about.\n  We want to help people. I don't know of anybody who ever showed up at \nour house who didn't get fed when mealtime rolled around. That is the \nway of the people of the prairies of this great country.\n  The Senator from Indiana knows of the values in rural America. They \ndeserve to make a living--just to make a living. Sugar is no different. \nThat is all they deserve.\n  Now, are there people who abuse the system? Sure, there are. There \nalways are, but they are few. The people who really need the help are \npeople who didn't buy a new pickup last year and didn't buy one all \nthrough this boom. We have seen cattle prices a little bit better now, \nbut we haven't seen a great boom on the farm or ranch through this \ngreat economic recovery we came through. We did see our cost of \nproduction escalating. For everything we bought, prices went up because \nof the last boom.\n  I hope we will table this amendment and not send the wrong signal to \nagriculture and the American people that, yes, we like the insurance \npolicy that we have and, yes, we like that security.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIdaho is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, debate on the Gregg amendment to the Harkin \nfarm bill is nearly at an end. We have had an ample period of time to \ndiscuss the pros and cons of a national sugar policy not just for the \nproducing beet or cane farmer in the great North, Northwest, or the \nSouth, but also a sugar policy for the American consumer, who has seen \nvery stable sugar prices for well over a decade.\n  What I have recognized in my years of involvement with this issue is \nthat the producing side of the sugar industry is very willing to create \na dynamic program that does not cost the American taxpayer any money, \ncreates a stability of price both at the farm level and also at the \nmanufacturing level and, ultimately, the consumer level. That has been \nthe historic pattern of a sugar policy, except for just the last 2 \nyears.\n  In fact, over the course of the last decade, this program has not \ncost the American taxpayer any money. It has returned money to the \nTreasury of the United States. In fact, it has made money for \ntaxpayers. The program of acquiring from the market, holding, and \nultimately entering the market with the product has served us well.\n  There is now a large supply of sugar worldwide, including in the \nUnited States. We have seen some efforts of importers outside and \ninside our country to try to avoid the 15-percent volume level we allow \ncoming into this country. Some have argued that if you kill the \nprogram, down comes the price and the consumer benefits. Ironically, \nthat just isn't true. The price is now down well below what it was a \nfew years ago. Yet the price of a product that has substantial \nsweetener in it--sugar, I should say, as there are other forms of \nsweetener--hasn't gone down; it has gone up. Nearly 80 percent of the \nprice of any food product on the market today is not the food itself; \nit is the cost of labor, the cost of processing, advertising, \nmarketing, and shelving. All of that goes into the price the consumer \npays.\n  So when a less than 20-percent item in the overall cost of a product \ndeclines, as other costs of input are going up, the consumer sees no \ndifference and, in many instances, there is an increase, as some have \ntalked about in the Chamber this afternoon.\n  In the Harkin bill that is before us, in a substitute that will be \noffered, known as the Cochran-Roberts bill, the sugar industry, working \nwith the Congress in shaping the new policy, has recognized again the \nneed to change, to be dynamic--not only to comport to budget \nrequirements but also to deal with the consumer and make sure the \nconsumer gets a reasonable shake and the producer gets stability in the \nmarket.\n  The sugar titles in both the House and Senate proposed farm bills \ndirect the Secretary of Agriculture to operate the U.S. sugar policy \n``at no cost to the Federal Government by avoiding the forfeiture of \nsugar to the Commodity Credit Corporation.''\n  It is that forfeiture that some have seized on today that has only \nhappened twice in a period of well over a decade that we want to get \naway from.\n  For somebody to suggest there is going to be a good deal of money to \ntransfer to some other program within agriculture policy or the bill or \nthe appropriations, that just is not the case. The new farm bill will \nrestore to the Secretary of Agriculture a key authority that was \nsuspended in the 1996 farm bill--the authority to limit domestic sugar \nsales during times of surplus through flexible marketing allotments.\n  The bill also grants the Secretary the authority to reduce Government \nsugar stocks and the potential for future sugar loan forfeitures by \naccepting bids for Government sugar in return for reducing future \nproduction.\n  The United States is required, as I mentioned earlier in the debate, \nto import 1.5 million tons of sugar, or about 15 percent of its \nconsumption each year, whether the U.S. market requires that sugar or \nnot.\n  In addition, unneeded sugar has entered the U.S. market--again, \nsomething mentioned by myself and others--to avoid the import quotas in \ncreative ways, what we call stuffing or the stuffing of the product. \nBecause of the special concessions of NAFTA and the concessions to \nMexico combined with this stuffing effort, we go beyond the 15 percent \nof total U.S. consumption or the 1.5 million tons.\n  The Secretary's current lack of ability to limit domestic supplies in \nthe face of large and relatively uncontrolled imports resulted last \nyear in historically low domestic sugar prices and the first \nsignificant sugar loan forfeiture in nearly two decades.\n  Once again, none of that translated to the market shelf; none of it \ntranslated to the consumer's pocketbook; all of it translated to the \nbottom line of the processor or the confectioners, and their profits \nwent up at the cost of the consumer and not at the profit of the \nfarmer.\n  Under the new farm bill, sugar marketing allotments will \nautomatically be in place unless triggered by a high level of imports \ngreater than 1.532 million short tons. With domestic sugar supplies \nunder control, we believe the\n\n[[Page S13019]]\n\nSecretary will be able to balance market supply and demand and ensure \nmarket price sufficient to avoid sugar loan forfeiture and any \nGovernment costs.\n  The Congressional Budget Office scoring of the new no-cost sugar \npolicy, however, shows a modest cost. I recognize that even though it \nis clearly the intent and the purpose of the legislation not to have \nthat.\n  Since CBO cannot assume other policy changes, it must assume that \nimport quota circumvention problems will persist, that U.S. sugar \nimports will be high, and that marketing allotments in other years will \nnot be triggered, and absent marketing allotments, sugar loan \nforfeitures might occur again.\n  Remember, I keep talking about the flow of product into the market. \nThat is part of that world sugar my colleague from New Hampshire talks \nabout, exposing well over 15 percent of the U.S. domestic market to the \navailability of that world product.\n  The industry, however, is convinced that policy changes will occur to \nrectify the import quota circumvention problems. We have had court \ntests in our favor. We are working now to block the ability of \nimporters to stuff product with the hope of pulling that sugar out and \nentering it into the market. A successful U.S. Court of Appeals ruling, \nas I mentioned, has halted circumvention of the import sugar quota by a \nproduct entering through Canada and, as we know, it is called stuffed \nmolasses.\n\n  Legislation is pending in the Senate, of which I am a coauthor, that \naddresses the circumvention problem. I hope we can move it. I hope all \nwill join with us to disallow that kind of illegal act.\n  I believe that brings the debate full circle. The Senator from New \nHampshire is worried and wants to eliminate the existing program. We \nare concerned about the taxpayer and want to recreate the program in a \nway that not only protects the producer and stability but protects the \ntaxpayer and offers the consumer stable prices in the market. We \nbelieve what we are offering today, what the Senator from New Hampshire \nis trying to strike, can accomplish that purpose.\n  I ask my colleagues to join us in voting to table the Gregg amendment \nand to give the adjusted policy, again, the opportunity to work its \nwill in the market with the producer, with the consumer, to the \nadvantage of all.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cleland). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from New Hampshire is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot of debate on this program. I must \ntake exception to some of the things said by the opposition because it \nappears they are inconsistent with the facts.\n  For example, the representation that this program is not going to \ncontinue to cost the taxpayers money is one which is not supported by \nthe facts. In fact, USDA, which is responsible for the agricultural \nproducts of this country, has said we will purchase close to 4 million \ntons of sugar over the next decade. Where we are going to put this we \ndo not know--somebody's garage, I guess--and that will cost us $1.6 \nbillion in tax revenue. So this is an expensive program. If we put it \nback into a marketplace concept, we will save the taxpayers those \ndollars, which dollars under this amendment can be used to assist \npeople who are on food stamps who are trying to buy staples to live a \ndecent life and have adequate nutrition.\n  Secondly, the point was made, and I do not understand the concept \nhere, that foreign sugar is coming in through molasses, through spiking \nof molasses, and that is clearly affecting the availability of sugar in \nthis country, and that is what we have to stop. Why do you think it is \ncoming in? It is coming in because the price of sugar in this country \nis so absurdly high.\n  You can actually go through the huge exercise of taking molasses, \nspiking it in some other country, then shipping it into our country and \nrefining it off, and you can still produce sugar that is dramatically \nless in cost than what it costs the American consumer to get sugar \nbecause we have this price which is 2\\1/2\\ to 3 times the going market \nrate of the sugar--22 cents and 18 cents versus about 9 cents. It is as \nif they are saying: The marketplace actually might work, but we are not \ngoing to allow it to work. If there is anything that shows that we can \nreduce the price of sugar to the American people, it is the fact people \nare willing to go through this huge machination to get sugar into this \ncountry, around all the barriers the sugar producers have produced. It \nis counterintuitive at the extreme to make that argument.\n  This debate comes down to a very simple fact, which is this: 42 \npercent of the revenues and the benefit of this program are going to 1 \npercent of the farmers, but all the American people are paying $1.9 \nbillion in extra cost to support that program. The price of sugar is \n2\\1/2\\ to 3 times the cost on the world market because we are trying to \nbenefit a very narrow group of people who are very effective \nconstituents, I guess, and argue their case effectively as constituents \nbut clearly have no equity to their argument. As a practical matter, \nthey are reaching into the pockets of the American people and taking \ndollars out of those pockets which could otherwise be used to purchase \nmore food or better commodities.\n  It is a program which is totally counter to everything for which we \nas a capitalist, market-oriented society stand. It cannot be justified \nunder any scenario other than it represents the power of one interest \ngroup to benefit at the expense of the American people and the American \nconsumer.\n\n  I greatly appreciate the statement of the Senator from Indiana who \nknows more about agricultural policy than I will ever know, who forgot \nmore about agricultural policy than I will ever know. In his support of \nthe amendment he gave one of the clearest statements as to why this \nprogram is such a disaster from a standpoint of economics and from a \nstandpoint of production and from a standpoint of its impact on the \nconsumers of America and from a standpoint of its impact on the \nAmerican taxpayer. I thank him for his support of this amendment. I \nhope people will listen to his logic and his reason and oppose the \nmotion to table this amendment, which I understand is going to now be \nmade by the assistant leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator have any objection to the manager of the \nbill speaking for 3 minutes prior to the vote?\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. I ask Senator Harkin be recognized for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have not had anything to say about this \namendment yet. I point out sugar is so cheap in this country you cannot \nbelieve it. It is cheap for the consumers buying it in the store. It is \ncheap when you go out to eat. The people who benefit from the Gregg \namendment would be the manufacturers. They are not going to pass this \non to the consumer. No way.\n  We want to keep our sugar farmers in business; 420,000 Americans are \nemployed in the sugar industry. It would ruin them. It would ruin our \ncorn sweetener market, further depressing extremely low corn prices in \nmy part of the country. This is wrapped up in a lot more than just what \nthe price of sugar is that Senator Gregg is trying to get at. I have \nalways said sugar is probably one of the cheapest products anywhere for \nconsumers.\n  Here is a bag of sugar, Holly Sugar. I am not pushing Holly Sugar, \nbut that is what I happen to have. They are little bags of sugar. How \nexpensive is this sugar? Go into any restaurant and take the sugar, put \nit in a glass, in your coffee; you can take two bags of sugar and put \nit in your coffee. Do you know what the price is? Nothing. It is so \ncheap that the restaurants do not even charge for it. Next time you go \nto a restaurant, have a cup of coffee, reach over and grab the bowl of \nsugar and put in a couple of teaspoons. They don't even charge because \nit is so cheap.\n  There has been a lot of talk in the Chamber about the sugar products. \nSugar is one of the best buys for the American consumer today. A 5-\npound bag of sugar at Safeway is $2.\n  If you want to gouge the consumer and give more to the processors and \nthe candy manufacturers and everybody else, then you want to vote for\n\n[[Page S13020]]\n\nthe amendment of Senator Gregg. If you want to help the sugar farmers \nand the 420,000 Americans who work in the sugar industry and corn \nfarmers all over America who depend upon this, we ought to defeat the \nGregg amendment. I point out on July 20, 2000, we had the same basic \namendment before the Senate. It was defeated 65-32. I hope the same \nhappens again today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I move to table the Gregg amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, we are making headway. We are making good \nprogress. I thank the people who are offering these amendments. We have \nhad good debates. We are moving right along. So I hope now we can have \nanother amendment up and we can have more votes today and get this bill \ncompleted.\n  I understand Senator Domenici has an amendment he will be offering in \na couple minutes. With that, again, I hope Senators will be ready to \noffer amendments. I hope we can have some time agreements and move \nthrough them. I hope we will have another vote very shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate the words, as always, of our \nchairman. My understanding is, in a couple minutes Senator Domenici \nwill offer an amendment. After disposition of the Domenici amendment, \nwe are anticipating an amendment to be offered by Senator Bond, and \nthen, following that, an amendment by Senator McCain.\n  In the meanwhile, amendments might come from the other side of the \naisle. But these three amendments are known quantities with the Members \nwho wish to be recognized as we dispose of the amendments.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2502 To Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to offer an amendment on \nbehalf of seven or eight Senators. I will name them in a moment. For \nthe interest of the Senators, my discussion about this amendment will \nprobably take about a half hour, and then I understand about five or \nsix Senators would like to speak. Nobody will be speaking extremely \nlong, but we think this is a very important issue. More than just the \nSenator from New Mexico are desirous of being heard on this amendment.\n  I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration. I offer this on behalf of myself, Senators Craig, Crapo, \nBurns, Hutchison, Enzi, Thomas, Kyl, Smith of Oregon, Hatch, Allard, \nand Campbell. I have submitted it to other Senators. I fully expect \nmore to join soon. I send it to the desk with those cosponsors at this \npoint. As I receive others, I will submit them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself, \n     Mr. Craig, Mr. Burns, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Enzi, \n     Mr. Thomas, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n     Allard, and Mr. Campbell, proposes an amendment No. 2502 to \n     amendment No. 2471.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n          (Purpose: To strike the water conservation program)\n\n       On page 202, strike lines 14 through 22 and insert the \n     following: ``technical assistance)'' after ``the programs''; \n     and\n       (3) in paragraph (2), by striking ``subchapter C'' and \n     inserting ``subchapters C and D''.\n       Beginning on page 121-118, strike line 4 and all that \n     follows through page 121-130, line 19.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand we are engaged in what some \nwould call a very serious effort. I want everyone to know my intention \nis not to in any way delay our process. As this issue evolves, Senators \nwill know that for the West, this is a very important decision.\n  I note the presence of Senator Reid who is also a western Senator. He \nhad something to do with putting the provisions in that I would like to \ntake out. So hopefully we will have some discussion before we are \nfinished.\n  This is a motion to strike essentially all of the provisions, brand \nnew provisions in the law, that would take the conservation program \nthat we have in effect--that is called the conservation reserve \nprogram--and would create a brand new one for 1,100,000 acres of land \nin the West. It would say that the Secretary of Agriculture, not the \nSecretary of the Interior, as we have now, would have the authority to \nacquire this acreage, up to 1.2 million acres, and the water rights \nthat come with it, and then to use the water rights for the first time \nin derogation of State water law. In other words, they could be used \nfor Federal purposes, not bound by State law.\n  This is a very big decision for States such as New Mexico and many \nWestern States, as you can see, that in just a few hours, most of the \nWestern States' Senators are on board trying to prevent this from \nbecoming effective.\n  Actually, the conservation reserve program has been a very effective \nprogram. The Senator from New Mexico in no way intends to change that \nprogram. In fact, I believe the underlying bill that was produced by \nvarious Members who have been speaking in the Chamber even makes the \nconservation program bigger and perhaps even better. But there is \nanother provision I am referring to that is brand new.\n  The language contained in this substitute requires that the Secretary \nof Agriculture devote 1.1 million acres of the conservation reserve \nprogram to a new water conservation program. That didn't exist before. \nWe now have a water conservation program.\n  Specifically, this program will allow the Secretary of Agriculture to \nenter into contracts with private landowners, estates, or Indian tribes \nfor the transfer of water or the permanent acquisition of water rights \nto benefit environmental concerns out in our waterways and in our \nvarious waters in the West.\n  When enrolling this new acreage, this language requires that the \nSecretary of Agriculture give priority to land associated with water \nrights. Heretofore water rights were not necessarily considered as a \nparamount reason or a high-priority reason for selecting these various \nacreages to make up the conservation reserve. This now says the\n\n[[Page S13021]]\n\nSecretary of Agriculture will give high priority to these lands that \nare going into this reserve, if they have water rights along with them.\n  The purpose of the old program was to remove vulnerable land from \nproduction, not for the acquisition of water rights. Everybody here who \nhas praised the conservation reserve program praised it because it \nremoved vulnerable acreage from production and it had no higher \npurpose. Now we have established a brand new higher priority, and that \nis to acquire land if it has water rights.\n  In essence, this is an attempt to pirate private water rights from \nindividuals for purely Federal interests. Allowing the Secretary of \nAgriculture to permanently acquire these water rights gives the Federal \nGovernment control over State water.\n\n  I don't think we ought to do this. I wish I would have had a chance \nto sit down across the table and discuss this approach with those who \nhave put it in this Agriculture bill, including my good friend Harry \nReid. I don't think western Senators, when confronted with their \nconstituents and asked by their constituents in water-short States \nwhether it would be prudent to create a high-priority program that \ncould take those water rights as part of a conservation reserve program \nand attribute them to the Federal Government so the Federal Government \ncould use it for Federal purposes, environmental or otherwise, and in \nthat manner run inconsistent, if they so desire, with State water law, \nwould agree.\n  We already have shortages that are sufficient, which means we don't \nhave enough water for the natural uses that we have been making for \nyears. We don't have enough water in two of our basins in New Mexico \nthat are alongside of rivers, be it the Rio Grande or the Pecos. We \ndon't have enough water for the current users under existing State law, \nwhich is a water rights system built upon first in use and application.\n  The first in time that does that is first in time in terms of \nownership and priority. That is an already existing system. It has \nexisted under Spanish law in our State. Many States in the West have \nfirst in time of use, which creates first in right for waters along \nstreams.\n  Here in the East there are many Senators who are going to say: This \ndoesn't have anything to do with us. They are probably right. They \ndon't have any shortage of water. In fact, many of the Eastern States \ndo not have this allocation method. They use what is referred to in law \nschool as the riparian rights system. If you are alongside of a stream, \nyou use the water alongside the stream. Not so in States such as mine \nand Arizona and the others, Idaho, Iowa, Oregon. You use the water in \nproportion to your having taken it from the stream and put it to a \nbeneficial use. In the Western States, that is either constitutionally \nestablished or statutorily established, but it is powerful proprietary \ninterest in situations up and down and across our borders as water \nbecomes more and more scarce.\n  In essence, all I choose to do in this amendment, where I am joined \nby the various Senators I have just named, is to say at the end of the \nsession we should not be considering a change in water rights for the \nWest.\n  (Ms. STABENOW assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I urge that Senators help us by just taking this out of \nthe bill and saying another time, another place, we will have some \nsignificant hearings. Let's hear from our States and our communities, \nand let's hear from water ownership districts and associations, be they \nin Wyoming, New Mexico, or wherever. Let's hear from them and let's see \nhow inserting this new bargaining chip in the middle of a river basin \nmight have either a negative or positive effect.\n  I actually believe we do not need in the basins of New Mexico--which \nare very short of water right now, and some are arguing whether there \nis enough for the already existing rights --another player plunked down \non the stream that can, in fact, apply this water to another separate \nuse and even abandon the State water law that controls how it is used, \nwhere it is applied, and what it is used for. I just don't think it is \nthe right time.\n  I would have thought if we were going to make such a change or \nimposition on State law as it pertains to water, we would have gone a \nlittle slower and would not have come up with an agriculture bill where \nthese water rights have not been part of any hearings in the \nappropriate committees. As a matter of fact, I am not sure but that \nthese provisions would have been subject to the jurisdiction of the \nother committees besides Agriculture. I believe the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee would have liked to look at this new language in \nterms of new priorities and new rights.\n  So this is an attempt on my part not to change but to just strike \nthese provisions. I don't have amendments to the provisions crafted on \nbehalf of Senator Reid, or whomever, and put in this bill. I don't \nthink we ought to do them tonight on an agriculture bill, when it could \nhave a profound impact on water rights in the West. There are certain \ngroups that maybe can't get all the water they want in our States, for \nwhat they see as important uses. They have come along and said maybe we \ncan do it this way; we can let the Secretary of Agriculture acquire \nthese water rights as part of an old program that had nothing to do \nwith acquiring water rights but had to do with acquiring properties to \nbe put in a reserve so that we would have a better chance for these \nproperties and these lands to develop and become usable if they are \ntaken out of use and put into a reserve.\n  Now somebody has found that we can take a piece of that and grab with \nit water rights and then let the Federal Government decide how to use \nthem under Federal law, not State law. Changing the program--this old, \ngood, solid program, the CRP program--could force many farmers to \nchoose not to participate in a program for fear that they could be \ncoerced into giving up their water rights.\n  I don't think this is the right thing to do. I don't believe we are \nanywhere close to correct in assuming that this should be a highest \npriority for the CRP in the future. I cannot believe that of all the \nuses out there that go along with the CRP, Conservation Reserve \nProgram, that we could establish without any serious and significant \nhearings that the Secretary of Agriculture--a new person in this \nequation, as it used to be the Secretary of the Interior. Now we have \nadded the Secretary of Agriculture in this bill, and I don't think that \nis a move we should have made without significant hearings either, but \nthis would change that.\n  So I close my first round on the Senate floor by asking my \ndistinguished friend, Senator Reid, if he will consider taking these \nprovisions out of this bill. I don't believe they belong here at this \ntime, when we haven't had an opportunity for significant hearings \nregarding the subject, and when it is clear and obvious to this Senator \nthat we are going to give the Secretary of Agriculture a whole new \nseries of rights under a program that is working well now, working well \nto take lands out of production. Now we are going to say we are giving \nthe Secretary of Agriculture a new authority--and it is of highest \npriority--to acquire lands for this program if they have water rights \nso the Federal Government has both water rights and Conservation \nReserve Program land. Then once the Federal Government has it, the \nSecretary of Agriculture is no longer bound by State law but can \naccomplish in a basin that is strapped for water a conflicting use just \nto come along and plunk itself on the water with a brand new right not \ngoverned by the State law that has been in effect, in many cases, for \ndecades on these river basins.\n\n  So I hope that Senators will go along with the huge preponderance of \nwestern Senators and say let's strike this provision for now. Let's go \nback next year and have hearings on what will this do to the water \nrights in the West. What will it do to water districts and river basins \nthat are already so short of water that the next legal wars for the \nnext decade or two are going to be over whether there is enough water \nfor the existing priorities under State law. I think in many cases we \nare going to say there probably isn't. We are probably going to say, if \nthere isn't, how can we justify a new high priority for the Federal \nGovernment to acquire these water rights as part of a Conservation \nReserve Program and then use it as they see fit.\n  It is a pretty clear-cut case. Is now the time to do this or not? \nAgain, I\n\n[[Page S13022]]\n\nwork on many issues with my distinguished friend, Senator Reid from \nNevada. We are chair and ranking members on an appropriations \nsubcommittee that does a lot of great things. We understand each other \nvery well. I actually didn't know anybody was working on this \nprovision, including my friend, Senator Reid, that would change or have \nthe potential for changing the water rights priorities from State \npriorities to an imposition of Federal priorities on river basins that \ndon't have enough water for what rights already exist and that are \nbeing applied under State law.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator be kind enough to add me as a \ncosponsor?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am delighted to do that. I yield the floor at this \npoint.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am happy to respond to my friend from \nNew Mexico. However, there are a number of myths. A myth is something \nwhich I guess takes a long time to perpetuate, so maybe we will not \ncall these full-blown myths, but there is some misinformation the \nSenator has been given.\n  I will talk about the first myth: Some claim that the water \nconservation program will preempt State law and allow the Federal \nGovernment to run water law in the States. That is simply not true.\n  Any application to enroll in the program would have to be approved by \nthe State in which the farmer farms. For example, if a rancher in \nNevada decided he or she wanted to be part of this program and the \nDepartment of Agriculture decided it was a good deal, they would have \nto go to Mike Turnipseed, Nevada's water engineer, and if he said no \ndeal, there would be no deal. All this talk of coercion is without \nlogic.\n  I find, and I say with respect to the senior Senator from New Mexico, \nwhen we have legislation and there are not any meritorious arguments \nagainst it, the first thing one says is there is another committee that \nhas jurisdiction or it has multiple committee jurisdiction. That has \nbeen raised in this debate.\n  The other argument continually raised when one does not have \nsubstantive arguments to good legislation is: We need more hearings. \nWhenever you hear that, it should trigger figuring out what the real \nmerits of the opposition might be, and the merits of the opposition to \nthis program are very weak.\n  Myth No. 1: The water conservation program would preempt State law \nand allow the Federal Government to run water law in the States. Not \ntrue. It does not preempt State water law. Also, 41 million acres are \nin this big bad program. There are 41 million acres in the overall \nprogram. This little program Senator Domenici is talking about has 1.1 \nmillion acres. So 40 million acres basically are untouched by this.\n  Myth No. 2: The water conservation program would create a huge new \nFederal program to permanently buy water rights.\n  Fact, not fiction: 90 percent of the program is focused on short-\nterm, 1- to 5-year contracts to lease water. Why do we focus on short-\nterm leasing of water rights? We do it because, No. 1, leasing water \nfor the short term keeps farmers in farming. After they have to deal \nwith the Department of Agriculture for 1 year, they retain full \nownership of their water.\n  No. 2, it provides a source of water for endangered species, for \nexample, in drought years when other conflicts are very severe. That is \nwhen these conflicts come about dealing with endangered species, such \nas fish. It is because there is a shortage of water.\n  No. 3, it will provide a supplement to farmer income in years in \nwhich they face water supply restrictions due to Endangered Species Act \nconcerns. This actually helps the farmers.\n  Keep in mind, this program requires a willing seller, a willing \nbuyer, and we protect property rights. Why shouldn't somebody who is a \nrancher or farmer have the same property rights as somebody who runs an \nautomotive dealership, or a manufacturer? Why shouldn't a rancher or \nfarmer have the right to do with his property what he wishes?\n  Even if we say a willing seller and willing buyer, and that is what \nwe have, they do not even have the ability to do that unless they get \napproval of the State water engineer, whether it is Wyoming, New \nMexico, or Nevada. So all this talk about coercion is absolutely \nsenseless.\n\n  Also, I would think my friends from the West would be happy for a \nchange. We have a farm bill that gives help and actual money rather \nthan verbiage to the western part of the United States. That is what \nthe conservation section in this bill is about. I have stood in this \nChamber and I have been to press conferences with the chairman of this \ncommittee. One thing about Senator Harkin, in his legislative career in \nthe House and the Senate, he has always been willing to do things that \nchange the world in which we live for the better.\n  He, in this instance, has been willing to change the traditional way \nwe do agriculture. That does not mean it is bad. It means it is \nwonderful; it is progressive. That is what this legislation is about. \nThis legislation protects every farmer in the State of Iowa, but also \nit recognizes there are other parts of the country than the breadbasket \nof this country. Most of our groceries come from the State he \nrepresents and the States surrounding him.\n  The reason I have been willing to go forward on this legislation--and \nI say the whole bill. This is a big bill. I do not know how long the \nbill is, but it is big. We have a tiny little section, but I would vote \nfor the bill anyway because I recognize what the Senator has done is \nexcellent. There is more support for this legislation because it helps \nother parts of the country.\n  The people who are giving information, that the Senator from New \nMexico is receiving, are giving bad information. Senator Domenici is a \nsmart man. He has been mayor of a city. He has been here longer than I \nhave. But when he says this program coerces farmers and States, he is \nwrong, it does not do that: Willing seller and willing buyer. If a \nfarmer or rancher does not want to do a deal it is his property. He \ndoes not have to do a deal.\n  Another myth: The water conservation program would undermine private \nproperty rights. I have touched on this a little bit. The water program \nis pro-private property rights--that is, the program is supportive of \nprivate property rights. This is a willing seller-lessor program. A \nfarmer decides whether or not to lease or sell his water rights. There \nis nothing more pro property rights than allowing property owners to \ndecide what to do with their own land and their own water.\n  Let's take, for example, the State of Nevada. I was telling someone \nthe other day about Nevada. Nevada is a huge State. It is the seventh \nlargest State in the country by acre. From the tip of the State to the \ntop of the State is 750 miles, maybe 800 miles. It is very wide, more \nthan 500 miles in the north. Madam President, we have very little \nwater. We share the Colorado River with a lot of States, and the mighty \nColorado has done a great deal for the western part of the United \nStates. Compare that with some of the rivers in the State of Michigan.\n  I will never forget when I first came to Washington, I went to \nVirginia on a congressional retreat. I said: This must be the ocean. It \nwas a river. The river was more than a mile wide. We do not have rivers \nlike that in Nevada. What people in the east call creeks we call \nrivers.\n  I would like to name some rivers in Nevada. We have the Colorado that \nwe share. We have the tiny, little Walker River. It is so important to \nNevada, but it is a tiny river. One can walk across it in most places \nsome of the year. The Truckee River, which is so important to Reno and \nSparks, it has an irrigation district at the end of it. It is also a \ntiny little river, and there are many times of the year one can walk \nright across the river in various places.\n  Carson River is a little river that runs hard in the spring. It is a \nwild river in the mountains, but it is a little river. Many rivers in \nNevada have no water most of the time.\n  We understand in Nevada what water is and what a shortage of water \nis, and I am not about to give away Nevada's water. I understand, \nthough, that if a rancher in Nevada has land and he has water which he \nowns, he should be able to do with it what he wants. If there is a \nprogram out of 41 million acres--we have been able to get a program \nthat\n\n[[Page S13023]]\n\nhas 1.1 million acres that allows this farmer, this rancher, for once, \nto do something with his property.\n  For example, I started talking about Nevada and I got carried away \nwith my great State.\n  If a farmer in the Truckee River Basin in Nevada decided he would \nlike to switch from growing alfalfa, a very intense water crop--and we \ngrow a lot of it in Nevada, but it takes huge amounts of water--but he \ndecides that he wants to grow native seed to help with restoration of \nranchland in the Great Basin.\n  We have had fires in the desert, especially in the high desert, and \nwe need to have seed to plant there. If a farmer decided he wanted to \nswitch and grow native seed, why shouldn't he be able to go and say, I \nwant to make a deal? We will lease your land for 2 years. We have saved \nthe water. Something else can be done with it. It doesn't sound like we \nare doing bad things.\n\n  In fact, it seems to me we are giving a property owner, for lack of a \nbetter description, more tools in his tool box with which to make money \nand provide for his family. We are doing the right thing.\n  I have heard the term ``taking.'' I know what a taking is. I am \nfamiliar in the Constitution that you cannot take a person's private \nproperty without due compensation. This has nothing to do with that. If \nthe rancher decides he does not want to do native seed, he simply does \nnot grow it. No one will force him to do it. Once he and the department \ndecide they want to do it, they still have to get approval of the State \nwater engineer.\n  I had somebody call me today complaining about the program. I said: \nTell me what is wrong with the program. Listen to what they said. I was \nstunned. They said: Well, if somebody decides with their own property--\nI am paraphrasing--to make a deal and lease it for a year, 2, 3, or 4, \nup to 5 years, what they are doing in parched, arid Nevada, they are \nsaying if they do that and you take certain land out of agriculture, it \nchanges the ground water. And what they are saying is, if you allow the \nwater to go downriver, you are stopping people from drilling wells and \npumping water because of the irrigation that takes place.\n  That doesn't make very good sense for voting against this \nlegislation.\n  Let me give another example. We have a beautiful lake in Nevada. We \nhave two lakes like it. They are called freshwater desert terminus \nlakes. They are freaks of nature. Pyramid Lake was basically saved \nafter work in this body to save it. Pyramid Lake, because of the first \never Bureau of Reclamation project, was going dry. Lake Winnemucca, the \noverflow from Pyramid Lake, did dry up. It is as dry as the ground on \nwhich I stand. But we have another desert terminus lake called Walker \nLake. It is in the middle of nowhere. It is in a place called Mineral \nCounty.\n  Mineral County has always been very good to me. I have always carried \nMineral County. On one occasion I was elected to the Senate I carried \ntwo counties: Clark County, where Las Vegas is, and Mineral County. I \nlost every other county in the State of Nevada. Mineral County always \nsticks with me. They have this big lake. There are only 28 lakes like \nWalker Lake and Pyramid Lake in the whole world. The lake has been \ndrying up. We have been very fortunate in the last 7 years. We have had \na lot of water and it has been able to get into the lake. About 6 or 7 \nyears ago we had a year and a half to go before all the fish in the \nlake would be dead it was so starved for new water. There are people \nwho believe the lake is worth saving.\n  As I have indicated, we can do it and still take care of agriculture. \nThere is an Indian reservation that depends on the water, little tiny \nWalker River. We can handle that. We have to do things differently from \nthe past. We cannot do what we have done in the past because everyone \nwill fail if that is the case.\n  Here is an example if somebody wanted to change their income and make \nmore money, they go to native seed and do a deal with the Government. \nSome of the water would run into the lake and preserve that great \nnatural beauty we have, Walker Lake. They should be able to do that. \nOr, the alternative is wait until we get into a real bad problem, and \nendangered species problem, and lawsuits are filed. This is a way to \navoid that or have money available to help solve the problems. There \nare places all over the Western United States that benefit from this.\n\n  I repeat, farmers who choose not to participate in the program will \nnot be hurt. Some farmers who choose to enter into short-term \nagreements to transfer water during drought years will actually benefit \ntheir colleague farmers who decide not to participate because, if some \nfarmers lease water for fish and drought years, it will ensure there is \nenough water for both farming and farmers and those who are dealing \nwith the threatened and endangered species.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to at some point, but I have a statement \nthat is quite long. If the Senator would be kind enough to keep track \nof the questions, I will be happy to explain.\n  Another myth: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has no authority for \nbusinesses offering to help mitigate farmers for endangered species or \nother conflicts. Federal agencies have affirmative obligations. They \nhave no choice under the Endangered Species Act to do all they can to \nconserve species.\n  I say to my friend from Idaho, his predecessor, now the Governor of \nIdaho, and I, Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus, had a great endangered \nspecies bill we brought to the floor. For various reasons, the then-\nmajority leader, Senator Lott, decided not to bring it up. We lost a \ngreat opportunity for a bipartisan revamping of the Endangered Species \nAct. We didn't do that. It is too bad.\n  I talked to Senator Baucus earlier today about another subject and \nthat came up. That was a good move we made. It is too bad the \nlegislation did not become law.\n  All Federal agencies have affirmative obligation under the Endangered \nSpecies Act to do all they can to conserve species. When it comes to \nconserving endangered fish, agriculture and water is the main issue. \nThis program will help USDA and the States help farmers and help \nmitigate these endangered species conflicts.\n  The Department of Agriculture is the perfect agency to interact with \nfarmers in the conflicts. They trust the USDA more than, say, the Fish \nand Wildlife Service.\n  Madam President, willing sellers, willing buyers--this legislation in \nthis bill that the committee supported is legislation that is pro-\nprivate property. There is nothing that prevents a State from saying: I \ndon't like what you are doing, farmer. You cannot change what you have \nbeen doing. The State water engineer has the right to do that.\n  The conservation title in this legislation is a very important new \nprogram to help mitigate the conflicts between farmers and the \nenvironment. It is not only for that purpose; it is to give farmers and \nranchers the ability to do things differently than they have in the \npast, to make money in a different way than in the past. This has \nnothing to do with making money. If they don't want to do it, no one \norders them to do it.\n  The controversies I talked about, which come up on occasion, usually \ncome to a head in drought years when Endangered Species Act protections \ntrump water over ranchers for farmers and ranchers. There is example \nafter example. We had legislation here earlier this year. I don't \nrecall the exact date, but Senator Smith from Oregon was very concerned \nabout what was going on. I don't know his feelings on this legislation \nbut if this legislation had been in effect when the problem started in \nOregon there wouldn't be the problems. Farmers would have some \nalternative. As I understand it, we have given them some financial \nrelief. But they are in bad shape. This could have helped them.\n\n  These controversies result in some really difficult situations. \nIrrigation pumps providing water to farmers are on occasion cut off so \nthreatened and endangered fish, for example, don't go extinct. You may \nnot like the endangered species law, but it is the law. You have to \ndeal with it. You cannot avoid it.\n  When these conflicts reach this critical stage, there is not much we \ncan do to alleviate the economic impact. This happens to ranchers and \nfarmers and the regional economies tied to farming and ranching.\n  There is, in the West, a new West. When I was raised in Nevada, \nmining\n\n[[Page S13024]]\n\nand ranching were really big. They are still big, but the rest of my \nState has grown. Las Vegas has grown so much, 70 percent of the people \nlive in that metropolitan area now. All the ranches and farms that were \nin Clark County are gone now. There may be a few people raising a \nlittle bit of hay for their horses, but basically it is gone now. So \nthere is a new West, in the sense that there are things other than \nranching and mining.\n  That does not take away from the importance of these two industries. \nI have spoken on the floor for long periods of time defending mining. \nPeople say to me all the time--and people write nasty letters to the \neditor--asking, how can somebody who says he is for the environment \nsupport mining?\n  I do it for a lot of reasons. One is my father was a miner. In fact, \nmy staff brought to my attention yesterday some news articles that one \nof them found, going through the Library of Congress, I guess, out of \ncuriosity about me. When I was 10 days old, my father was blasted--what \nwe call blasted. He was working in a mine. The bad fuse did not have \nthe workplace protection they have now. They lit the holes, one of the \npieces of fuse ran, one of the holes went off, and of course blew him \ninto the air, blew the soles off his shoes, blew out his light. He was \nin a vertical mine shaft.\n  When they set off the holes, they have a ladder they can take up with \nthem they call a sinking ladder. He was, I guess, in a state of shock. \nHe tried to climb out of this hole. He didn't realize one of the legs \nof the ladder had been blown off, so every time he tried to climb up, \nhe would fall. He couldn't figure it out.\n  It was a brave man who heard the hole go off and knew that he hadn't \ncome up to the next level. Knowing there were 10 other levels burning, \nthis man named Carl Myers came down to that shaft--my dad was a bigger \nman than he--and carried my dad out of that mine. He received a \nCarnegie Medal for saving my dad's life when I was 10 days old. That is \nwhen that incident took place.\n  So I defend mining for a lot of reasons. I do it for my father. I do \nit because it is good for Nevada. We have thousands and thousands--the \nbest blue-collar jobs we have in Nevada relate to mining. I think a lot \nof people who complain about mining don't know what they are talking \nabout, for lack of a better description.\n  Ranching is important. Ranching doesn't create a lot of jobs, but it \ncreates a way of life that we should all envy. So that is why I do what \nI can to recognize that we have a new West but we also have an old West \nthat we need to protect. This legislation is about protecting the old \nWest, keeping farmers and ranchers in business. Those people who are \ncrying out in a shrill voice that this legislation hurts them, I do not \nbelieve that.\n\n  We need to create programs to help lessen conflicts in drought years. \nThe water conservation program included in Chairman Harkin's bill is \nthe first tool we have in a Federal farm policy that actually addresses \nthis problem. I commend him again and again for doing this. This \nlegislation has support of people who had never supported this \nlegislation before. I am sorry to say there are some ranchers and \nfarmers who are being given bad information. They should be happy that \nwe are trying to give them other tools, I say, in their toolbox, so \nthat they can do things they have never been able to do before.\n  Again, I repeat for a fifth time: Willing sellers and willing buyers. \nIf a rancher or farmer decides he wants to do something different and \nhe has the ability to work something out with the Department of \nAgriculture, great, I hope they can do that. But if they do that and \nthe State water engineer, rightly or wrongly, denies them the ability \nto go forward, that is his prerogative. That is what State water law is \nall about. And this legislation protects State water law.\n  Here is how this program works. It is very similar to a program \nfarmers already are familiar with, which is extremely popular, called \nthe Conservation Reserve Program, CRP.\n  Under CRP, farmers enroll land in the farm, reducing farming on their \nland and improving wildlife habitat on other land. This is the law now. \nThe farmer collects a payment for participating for a 10- to 15-year \ncontract term. That is the law now. We decided not to go for a 15-year \ncontract period but for a 1- to 5-year contract period. Under the new \nConservation Water Program, the one they are trying to strip from this \nbill, a farmer could enroll that land to a program and do farming on \ntheir land, but instead of focusing on wildlife improvements on the \nland, the farmer could agree to transfer the water associated with the \nland to provide water for all kinds of reasons.\n  Unlike the CRP, the Water Conservation Program would provide farmers \nwith very flexible options and terms of how they would agree to \ntransfer water. They can enter into contracts of 1 to 5 years, as I \nhave said, with the Department of Agriculture, to provide water. This \nshorter contract term works for this program because what we are \nfocused on in the program is building a drought water supply in years \nwhen there are threatened species or other problems arise because of \nthe drought.\n  Farmers also can enter into option contracts with the USDA, where \nthey would just give the Department of Agriculture an option on their \nwater which would be exercised in a drought year. Again, the farmer \nmakes money. Farmers would keep on farming unless or until the option \nwere exercised.\n  The issue of transferring water sometimes can be controversial for my \ncolleagues. Some express concern this program will enable the Federal \nGovernment to buy water rights where a State doesn't want the rights \nsold. This simply is not true. It is simply not true. The program \nspecifically provides that State water law is paramount. Under this \nprogram, a water transfer will not happen unless the State approves \nthat transfer under its own law, not under this law. We are not \nchanging State water law. But under the State law as it now exists, the \nState approves the transfer under its own law. In States where the \nwater law does not permit transferring water for these programs, the \nprogram simply couldn't be used.\n  To show how sincere we are about this, we had a couple of staffers \ncome to my staff and say: I am not sure my Senator wants part of this \nprogram.\n  Fine, we will opt you out.\n  Oh, no, we don't want to be opted out.\n  We gave them the alternative: If you don't like it--I think you are \nlosing a tremendous advantage for your agricultural community--we will \nopt you out.\n  They didn't want that.\n  But there are some very good reasons that States should want to \nparticipate in the program and facilitate such transfers. Let me give \nbut three reasons.\n  First, these transfers will help ensure that water is available for \nfreshwater life during dry months, helping increase flows during \nhistoric times of seasonal low water.\n  Second, protecting freshwater species is among the most important \nconservation objectives related to endangered species. This is the law.\n  Freshwater species are North America's most endangered class. They \nare vanishing five times faster than North America's mammals or birds \nand as quickly as tropical rain forest species. That is a matter of \nfact. Habitat loss and degradation are the single biggest threat to \nfreshwater species in trouble. Inadequate streamflow is the largest \nhabitat-related threat.\n  Third, a program which provides for flexible options for water \ntransfers, not simply permanent acquisition, but short-term options \nwill help mitigate farming in rough years and allow farmers to continue \nfarming. It seems like a pretty good idea.\n\n  I am happy to yield for a question without my losing the floor to my \nfriend, the junior Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, the Senator talked about the fact this is \nbased on a willing relationship. But if I understand the amendment \ncorrectly, it is willing only in the sense that any landowner who \nwanted to participate in the new CRP acreage that is authorized under \nthe farm bill would be required to either temporarily or permanently \nyield his or her water rights or could simply choose not to participate \nin the new acreage.\n  The question is, Is there any way for a landowner to participate in \nthe acreage program for the CRP that is being expanded here without \nbeing required\n\n[[Page S13025]]\n\nby contract to yield up their water rights?\n  Mr. REID. No. But why would someone want that? Why should they have \nit both ways?\n  Mr. CRAPO. The response to that is the CRP works very well. It is \ndoing a lot of good for wildlife in the United States. It is not \nspecifically focused on the acquisition of water rights. The expansion \nof the CRP, which we are trying to accomplish in this farm bill, will \nexpand the successful operations of the CRP.\n  The concern I have and that many others have is the Senator is \nproviding in his amendment that no landowner in America can participate \nin the expansion of the CRP without being required to yield their water \nrights. Although I realize that is voluntary in the sense they do not \nhave to participate, it is not voluntary in the sense that a landowner \nwho wants to participate cannot do so without having to yield water \nrights.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as I have indicated, the program we are \ntalking about is approximately 1 million acres out of 41 million acres. \nWe are talking about 1 million acres which will alleviate some of the \nmost desperate problems we have in the West. It seems to me that \nbreaking out of the curve a little bit is the way to go. I guess the \nSenator from Idaho might have a different philosophy. I think no one is \nbeing forced into doing anything. If they want to participate in the \nprogram subject to their wanting to do it--the Department of \nAgriculture acknowledging it is a good idea--then the State water \nauthority can approve.\n\n  I think it is a pretty good deal. It is a small part of land. Some \npeople have talked to me who do not understand the program. Once I \nexplained it to them, they felt pretty good about it. A lot of people \nthought we were wiping out the other program. We are not.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Will the Senator yield for one additional question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAPO. With regard to the issue of whether State law still \napplies or whether State law must be complied with in the transfer, let \nme ask the question. The additional question I wanted to raise is \nwhether State law applies. The Senator from Nevada indicated State law \nwould still be required to be complied with in any transfer of water \nrights. In Idaho, as I am sure in many States, when a water right is \ntransferred the State authority evaluates it and takes into account a \nnumber of considerations before they authorize the transfer. Will it \ninjure any other water user rights? Are the priorities established in \nState law for the use of the water being met?\n  Is the Senator telling us that if a landowner wanted to participate \nand yield his water rights in this new acreage that the State water law \nwould still be applicable and the State authorities could say this does \nnot fit the requirements of State law and prohibit that transfer?\n  Mr. REID. Let me, first of all, make sure I stated my previous answer \nproperly. When I talked about 41 million acres, I want everyone to \nunderstand that it was originally 36.4 million acres and we increased \nthat and set aside 1.1 million acres for this water conservation \nprogram.\n  In response to the Senator's question, if State engineers, for \nwhatever reason, decided under State law they didn't want to do \nwhatever the State authority is, it wouldn't be done.\n  We have had a troubling situation with the Truckee River. I get so \nupset at that State engineer. I think sometimes he does not know what \nhe is doing. He knows a lot more about water rights than I do. He has a \nright to do whatever he wants to do. This wouldn't change that.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I appreciate that response from the Senator. I guess we \nhave a disagreement on the level of voluntarism and whether it is \nappropriate in the CRP. I appreciate the Senator clarifying that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I understand the distinguished Senator \nfrom Montana wants to speak. I wanted to say to Senator Reid that I \nappreciate his compliments. When he opened up, he said I was smart \nbecause I was a mayor. I want the Senator to know that the fact I was a \nmayor doesn't make me very smart.\n  Mr. REID. Can I respond briefly?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. Having worked with the Senator for the entire time I have \nbeen in the Senate, the fact that he was a mayor has certainly helped \nme understand why he knows so much about budgetary matters. No one \nworks harder on the budget than a mayor.\n  Setting all of that aside, I don't need to enumerate the Senator's \nqualifications for everyone here to know how knowledgeable and how \nversed he is on legislative matters. He has a great educational \nbackground. He is a good athlete. He is a fine man. The fact that he \nwas a mayor only adds to his qualifications.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much. I want to give my friend \nfrom Nevada a thought. He made a very serious and significant series of \nstatements about the voluntary nature of this, that the truth is, for \nStates such as mine--I don't know about Nevada--the major water \ndistricts and the river waters that will be used by farmers, ranchers, \ncities, et cetera, do not need another big purchaser of water rights \ncalled the U.S. Government's Secretary of Agriculture. We don't need \none of those for our basins. Voluntary means how high the person who is \nbuying will go in paying. I imagine the Secretary of Agriculture has a \nlot more money than any other buyer around. The purchasing in the \ndistrict will be distorted by the gigantic reach of the Secretary of \nAgriculture.\n  What will they be looking for? They will want to buy the acreage to \ndo something different than we are planning to do with that water now, \njust as sure as we are here. They are not going to be acquiring it to \ndo what the basin currently permits. It is going to be for another \npurpose.\n  We are just plunging down in the middle of an already totally \noccupied water district a new buyer, the great big Secretary of \nAgriculture. They can come in and purchase this for Federal Government \npurposes. There is no question about it.\n  Frankly, I don't think anybody who has assets and resources in their \nStates would want to say everything will be OK, even though everything \nis tight right now. We don't know if there is enough water for the \ncity. We don't know if there is enough water for the fishpond, the \nlake, or the streams. But that is all right. We are going to approve \nthat program so big daddy, the U.S. Agriculture Secretary, can come in \nand buy up water rights. Of course, it is all going to work out because \nthey are benevolent anyway and willing. Everybody is going to be OK. \nThe State water superintendent has to say OK anyway. Frankly, I don't \nthink we ought to give them the right to get into a district with that \nkind of power and end up calling it willing and calling it equal and \ncalling it equality. It is not so. It is going to be tremendously \ndistorted on the side of the Department of Agriculture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I thank my good friend from New Mexico \nfor leading the charge on this particular part of the farm bill.\n  A while ago we were talking about myths. If this section does not \nerode the State adjudication process and the State would have to give \nits OK, if there is a section of willing seller and willing buyer--\nwhich, by the way, they already have that right--why have the \nlegislation? What other purpose does this legislation serve than the \nlandowner and the water right owner in that community?\n  Some 8 or 9 years ago a Secretary of the Interior made a speech and \nsaid: We can't change the culture of the West until we take over the \nfinancing and get control of their water.\n  I know the Senator from Nevada very well, and he understands the \nState of Nevada very well, that whiskey is for drinking and water is \nfor fighting. That has been pretty well accepted throughout the West. \nBut in this piece of legislation, which has been inserted into this \nbill, is language that would make it possible for the Federal \nGovernment to purchase water rights from individuals to protect \nsensitive species.\n  We have a hard time defining ``endangered'' or ``threatened.'' Now we \ncome up with a new term called ``sensitive species.'' When the \nGovernment owns the water rights, do we see, all over\n\n[[Page S13026]]\n\nagain, Klamath Falls, OR, where we had a vote in this Chamber that sent \na signal throughout the agricultural community that this body was more \nsensitive to a sucker fish than we were to 1,500 farm families in this \ncountry? You just stand there and watch your crop dry up because of a \nlaw and an insensitive Government?\n  Now, this was first introduced as a bill. The bill was S. 1737. The \nbill has never had a hearing. It has never seen the light of day until \ntoday with the introduction of this piece of farm legislation. Though \nit may be well-intentioned, I would say this: Whenever the Federal \nGovernment enters the picture, and willing seller/willing buyer, or \ncoercion, when you are going broke, and the fellow in town has the \nbiggest checkbook, and it happens to be the Federal Government, don't \nyou bet your last paycheck on whether the Government knows who has the \nbiggest checkbook. They also know the position you are in to finance \nyour situation, and where that water is going to go.\n  Just about every State in the West--I know it is true in Oregon and I \nknow it is true in Montana--has a water trust. They are already in \nplace. If a farmer or a rancher wants to give up what he is growing now \nand does not want to use that water, or he wants to sell or lease that \nwater to another irrigator who still has a crop that requires large \namounts of water, he can do that now. It does not require this \nlegislation. It does not need the big checkbook coming out putting him \nin a position where he must sell to the big checkbook.\n  If people doubt that, then I suggest they go out and try to run one \nof these irrigated farms. They are already in place. So the intrusion, \nalthough not intended, or the coercion, also not intended, happens in \nthe real world. And I hope this body operates in the real world.\n  My good friend from Nevada says it may change the groundwater. Let me \ntell you, it does. I live in an irrigated valley. I used to, anyway. I \nam up on a hill now.\n  I say to Senator Reid, let's take Clark County in your State where \nthat county has grown and pushed out the agriculture. You and I will \nnot see it, nor do I think our kids will see it, but there will come a \ntime when we will pay the penalty for building houses on the valley \nfloor covering up good, productive agricultural land that tends to \nprovide great benefits to us. We had better start building our homes \nand our houses and our businesses on dry land and let the valley \nproduce. That is the way societies have done it before, and those \nsocieties still are with us today. We may have to take a look at that.\n  I will tell you, when they turn the water out of the ditch, the wells \nat my house go dry because the water table drops. That happens every \nfall. So that is not a myth, I say to the Senator. It is true.\n\n  I have a letter here from the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. \nThe president of that association, Lynn Cornwell, is a resident of \nMontana. He is a good friend and a good rancher out of Glasgow, MT. \nThey would like to see this part of the agriculture bill deleted \nbecause they, too, understand what it does and the effect it has on \nfarming and ranching operations, even on dry land. I would say the \nbiggest share of the Cornwell ranch is on dry land.\n  I want to change the tone and restore the spirit of the law of the \nCRP, the Conservation Reserve Program. I will have an amendment that \nwill do that which I will offer in a little bit.\n  But my concern is, the willing buyer-willing seller is not the real \nworld. It is not the real world. It may be up to us, and those of us \nwho probably have never trod on a farm or a ranch, to deal with this.\n  I have been a very fortunate person. I have been an auctioneer for a \nlong time. I have had the painful experience of selling out some \nfriends who did not make it. The big checkbook always came into play. \nSo that is not the real world.\n  Then, I say, if this has nothing to do with circumventing the State's \nrights, water rights, and the adjudication process in that State, then \nwhy do we need the legislation? There is absolutely no reason for it. \nSo there must be another motive that cannot be seen just by reading the \nwords of this particular section.\n  I would hope that we would use a little common sense in this 17-\nsquare miles of a logic-free environment and not do anything that \nupsets the balance between the States, the Federal Government, \nirrigation districts, and private land owners. Because it is my \ninterpretation of the language that once you sign up in the \nConservation Reserve Program, then you might not have any choice but to \nrelinquish those water rights, even on a temporary basis. And that is a \nvery dangerous precedent in itself, of relinquishing those water rights \nto the Federal Government.\n  I have always taken the advice of an old rancher over in Miles City, \nMT: There is a way to survive in a harsh country. Never ever let \nanybody erode or give away your water rights, always keep a little poke \nof gold, and you will survive out here in pretty good shape.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              National Cattlemen's\n\n\n                                             Beef Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 12, 2001.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senate Majority Leader Daschle: Throughout the \n     formulation of the Senate farm bill, the National Cattlemen's \n     Beef Association (NCBA) worked diligently with members of the \n     Committee to develop a Conservation title that would reflect \n     the interests of NCBA and this nation's cattlemen. NCBA was \n     pleased with the bipartisan, voice vote approved Committee \n     title. However, modifications that are to be incorporated \n     into the bill by a manager's amendment take back many of the \n     positive strides supported by NCBA.\n       The manager's amendment will increase the Conservation \n     Reserve Program (CRP) to 41.1 million acres. This exceeds the \n     40 million acres that NCBA found acceptable. At this level, \n     CRP will negatively impact the economy of rural communities, \n     local feed grain and forage prices for livestock producers \n     and devote taxpayer dollars to setting aside land that could \n     be better spent on working lands. NCBA asked that increase in \n     CRP acreage be limited to no more than 40 million acres with \n     new acreage focused on riparian areas, buffer strips and \n     continuous sign-up acreage. Additionally, the managers' \n     amendment still does not provide for a reduction in rental \n     rates on CRP acres used for haying or grazing.\n       Long term funding of the Environmental Quality Incentive \n     Program (EQIP), at the time when producer needs are likely to \n     peak, has been reduced by $650 million dollars per year, from \n     the Committee passed bill. Reductions in funding in 2007 and \n     the out years, will put the long-term success of the program \n     at risk. By contrast, the Committee passed bill provided \n     continued funding that amounted to an additional $3 billion \n     over 10 years. NCBA, in addition to increased funding, asked \n     for a number of programmatic changes that continue in the \n     legislation. Our support for existing measures is dependent \n     on changes that will provide for program access to all \n     producers and ensure that soil, air and water quality are the \n     priorities for the program.\n       The manager's amendment includes a number of disconcerting \n     provisions related to the Water Conservation Program. This \n     new program would authorize the use of 1.1 million acres of \n     the CRP authorized enrollment acreage to acquire water \n     rights, both short-term and permanent, primarily for \n     endangered and threatened species recovery. This program also \n     specifically allows for the temporary lease of water or water \n     rights in the Klamath River basin of Oregon and California. \n     NCBA cannot support this program, despite the fact that only \n     ``willing sellers'' may participate. Willing sellers are \n     often found where there are endangered species; the Klamath \n     basin is a perfect example. Many farmers and ranchers have \n     become ``willing sellers'' because they can no longer afford \n     to farm. Buying all the water rights in the west will not \n     solve our nation's endangered species problems, which in \n     large part is due to the Endangered Species Act itself. It is \n     inappropriate in the context of a farm bill to attempt to do \n     so.\n       The Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) is another new program \n     that has garnered much support in this farm bill debate. NCBA \n     supports this program because it provides an option for \n     preserving the economic viability of grazing operations while \n     protection the grasslands upon which both wildlife and \n     ranching depend through the purchase of 30-year and permanent \n     easements. However, the Committee proposal strips the option \n     for non-profit conservation and agricultural land trusts to \n     hold and enforce the easements, which is critical for NCBA.\n       Conservation easements are rapidly becoming a valuable tool \n     in the protection of agricultural lands. However, many \n     landowners remain skeptical. As with any contract, it is \n     important to be able to develop a trust relationship among \n     the parties to the agreement. By allowing third party non-\n     profit land trusts to also be eligible to carry out\n\n[[Page S13027]]\n\n     the administrative responsibilities of the easement, the \n     landowner has the flexibility to work with the entity they \n     feel most comfortable. Several states have developed land \n     trust organizations for the purpose of holding and enforcing \n     agricultural conservation easements. Without the ability of \n     non-profit or agriculture land trust participation, the GRP \n     will not serve the interest of those family farmers and \n     ranchers for which it was designed.\n       We look forward to working with all Members of the Senate \n     to create a final package that meets the needs of today's \n     ranchers. In closing, NCBA believes that last minute \n     amendments to a balanced and bipartisan Committee passed bill \n     are lacking in a number of key areas and less attractive to \n     US beef producers.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to communicate with you on \n     these important issues. If you need further information or if \n     we can provide clarity to any points in this letter, please \n     contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lynn Cornwell,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I heard the comments made by my good \nfriend from Nevada earlier. I agree with him. The conservation title of \nthe Harkin bill is there to help mitigate western water conflicts.\n  I have been on the Agriculture Committee for 26 years now. It was the \nfirst committee I went on when I came here. I have heard a lot of the \ndebates on conservation practices and on water matters. We get \nconcerned about water in the East for different reasons than they do in \nthe West.\n  We have heard the comments of my friend from Montana. My home in \nVermont has a well. We live on a dirt road. We have to provide our own \nwater. We are certainly very careful about protecting the water we \nhave. Our home had once been a farm. They had to have water for the \ncattle. We know what it is.\n  This is not a case where you are going to willy-nilly transfer water \naway. In fact, under the amendment that the Senator from Nevada, Mr. \nReid, has proposed to the Harkin bill, it provides specifically that \nthe State law is paramount. In other words, if Nevada or Montana or \nanywhere else has a water transfer law, then nothing happens unless it \nis approved under the State law. It is not a case where the Federal \nGovernment just comes over and takes over things.\n  This proposal is here to make sure we plan before we are in trouble, \nbefore we are in a drought situation. When you get into a drought \nsituation, when you have those kinds of problems, there is not an awful \nlot you can do to help farmers or alleviate their economic impact, or, \nfor that matter, the regional impact on farmers because they fail.\n  So what this amendment would do is try to create those kinds of \nprograms that would help lessen water conflicts--not for the good \nyears, because in the good years there aren't any conflicts. In the \ngood years, everybody has plenty of water; nobody really thinks about \nit. This is the plan for those drought years. It is almost the biblical \n7 fat years and 7 lean years.\n\n  The Water Conservation Program that is included in Chairman Harkin's \nbill is the first tool we will have in the Federal farm policy to \nactually address the program. This program actually is very familiar. \nMost farmers know about the CRP program, the Conservation Reserve \nProgram. Farmers know that program. The program is extremely popular. \nThis follows it. In fact, under the new water conservation program, a \nfarmer could enroll land in the program, reducing farming on that land, \nbut it is totally voluntary. This is not something where Big Brother \ncomes in saying you to have do it. It is totally voluntary. You can't \ntransfer anything anyway if your State has already passed a law saying \nyou can't.\n  It is really designed to put as much power in the hands of the farmer \nas their own State would allow. Instead of focusing on wildlife, for \nexample, wildlife improvements on the land, the farmer could agree to \ntransfer the water associated with that land to provide water for fish \nand other wildlife, something that those who hunt, fish, or just are \nconcerned with the environment should like very much.\n  It actually operates basically the same way as every other \nconservation program in this bill. All the protections have been built \nin here, protections of saying that you can't override State law. You \nhave to make it voluntary. The farmers and ranchers themselves are \ngoing to make these decisions. We have done this in CRP.\n  We have done the Conservation Reserve Program in the past. That has \nproved very popular. I have some very careful farmers in my State, good \nYankee stock. They want to make darn sure they are doing something that \nprotects the farmers' sons and daughters afterwards. They sign up for \nthe CRP because they know it works.\n  I know the Senator from California is here. I yield to the Senator \nfrom California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator yields the floor for \na question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has yielded the \nfloor. Senators may compete for recognition.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friends, I will be brief and to the point. I \nthank my friend from Vermont. This particular part of the farm bill is \nvery important to our State that is having so many issues surrounding \nwater, the availability of water, and the ability to have enough water \nfor everyone--for the farmers, for the urban areas, for the suburban \nareas, for the environment, for fish and wildlife.\n  I had the experience of taking a hike along a river that is pretty \ndry. It is in a State park. They have a wonderful series of parks along \nthis river that is now so dry. This was the place where the salmon \nwould come. There is nothing sadder than seeing this happen, seeing us \nlose our habitat. It is our responsibility to make sure we do right by \nthe environment, right by the farmers, right by the urban users, right \nby the suburban users. That means we all have to live within this gift \nwe get from God that sustains us--the water. We have to use it wisely. \nWe have to be smart about it. We have to share it. If we do that, \neveryone will thrive in the end.\n  What Senator Reid has done by his excellent work on this bill--and I \nso much oppose this move to remove it from the bill--is to understand \nthis reality, that this is a precious resource, this water; that we do \nneed it for all the stakeholders. We know when we took up the issue of \nthe Klamath what a terrible situation we had there with the farmers \nliterally crying because they didn't have enough water to farm. They \ndidn't have an option to sell what water they had.\n  What Senator Reid does, through a leasing and a purchase program, is \nto make sure that on a voluntary basis farmers have the option to lease \nor sell some of their water. For example, suppose they choose to go to \nanother crop and they need less water. They can go to that other crop \nand then sell the excess water that they have and increase and enhance \ntheir incomes.\n  This is something that is very popular. In my State, I heard from \nfarmers who really support very strongly what Harry Reid is trying to \ndo. They tell me this would be a welcome opportunity for them. So when \npeople get up and say the West this and the West that, you can't speak \nfor the whole West because there are farmers in my State, in my region, \nwho believe this kind of a provision is going to help them survive. Let \nme repeat that. This kind of provision will help them survive. They \nhave told me that. They have written this to me.\n  Therefore, when Senator Reid was putting together this provision, I \nthanked him on behalf of those farmers who call the Reid provision a \nwin-win situation. Farmers could sell water they could not otherwise \nuse and, in exchange, get funds they need to keep on going, and fish \nand wildlife get the needed water.\n  I find it interesting that in this debate some on the other side talk \nabout the big, bad, evil Federal Government coming in and stealing \nwater away from farmers. First of all, I know Ann Veneman, and I don't \nthink of her in that way, and I don't think of the Federal Government \nas evil. I think people see the Federal Government as a necessary tool \nfor them to do the right thing, whether it is in foreign policy, \ndomestic policy, or protection of the environment. I don't think this \nadministration, or any administration, would come in like Big Brother \nor Big Sister\n\n[[Page S13028]]\n\nand disrupt a farmer's life. On the contrary, I think in fact that \nbecause this is voluntary, this is an option for farmers.\n  In closing, I don't need to go on at great length. I wanted to \nsupport my colleague from Nevada, the assistant Democratic leader, who \nI think has done an incredible job of crafting a very good provision. I \nam disappointed that we always seem to pit farmers against the fishing \npeople, fishing people against the urban and suburban people. In \nCalifornia, we have learned that we have to live together. We don't \ncome to this floor--Senator Feinstein and I--picking a fight with any \nof them. We try to bring everybody together. Senator Reid has done a \ngood job in trying to bring all the stakeholders together. In this case \nthe farmers stand to win, the environment stands to win, the fish stand \nto win, as does the wildlife and everybody else.\n  I think what I hear on the other side of the aisle is the old water \nwars, the old language, and it is the old threat, the old gloom and \ndoom. I urge colleagues to work with Senator Reid, give this a chance. \nI think this program could work. It could be a win-win for everybody.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I will limit my comments. I want to say \nthis while Senator Reid is on the floor. I used to live in his part of \nthe country and I understand his concern. If you haven't spent much \ntime in Nevada--I listened to his comments. I listened about Pyramid \nLake and Walker Lake, two lakes that rivers come into. And there is a \nplace called Tumble Sink in his State--the only place in the United \nStates where the further you go downstream, the smaller the river gets, \nuntil it just disappears.\n  I think this is a question that probably should have been fully \ndebated, with some kind of a hearing, and not attached to this bill. \nThe Senator from Montana, Mr. Burns, mentioned what we often call the \nlaw of unintended consequences. That is what I am concerned about, too, \nwithout adequate input. I know this may help a rancher or a farmer \nsurvive, but I can tell you they won't survive very long once the water \nis gone. I don't know how many Members of this body farm or ranch. I \nknow there are several, including me. You might make a short-term \nagreement to sell or lease some water, but if there is a change in the \nwater usage and you don't get it back, that is the end of your farming \nand ranching in the arid West, where we have to store something like 80 \npercent of our yearly water needs.\n  As I understand this part of the bill, the Secretary of Agriculture \ncan acquire the water for purposes other than agriculture during this \nperiod of time, even though I understand it is on a willing-seller/\nwilling-buyer arrangement and that he cannot participate in a CRP \nunless he also agrees to the water provision. You take them both or you \nget neither.\n  Now, I am reminded of something that happened. I did a hearing on \nwater in Fort Collins, CO, about a year and a half ago. One of the men \nwho testified--I was thinking about him when I was listening--was a \nman, like a lot of ranchers, who moves his water around, depending on \nwhat he is planning and where he wants the irrigated water to go. He \nhad a field that was dry as a bone, and he had ample water rights. So \nhe put a ditch in to carry some of the excess water he already owned to \nthis very dry field. Lo and behold, the field obviously came up very \nrich and beautiful and produced a wonderful stand of hay. Since there \nwas water and seed in the ground, a little mouse moved in called a \nPreble's meadow jumping mouse, which is on the Endangered Species List, \nor the Threatened Species List.\n  As you know, the Endangered Species Act takes into consideration \nhabitat. Once the mouse moved in, he found he could not move his \nditches anymore from there because it was declared habitat for that \nmouse. That is one of the concerns with this. Maybe it will work fine; \nmaybe it won't.\n  What if the rancher agrees to take his water out of production and \nput it in this Federal designation for a period of time, and wherever \nthat water is--as an example, out West--it is used for something else \nand, therefore, where it was in those fields is now dried up. As you \nprobably know, there is a program in the West reintroducing the \nblackfooted ferret on the Endangered Species List. They are beginning \nto grow little by little. There are a few more colonies established. \nWhat if something like that moved into that area where he had his water \nbecause they live on prairie dogs and live in dry ground, not near \nwater? My question would be: Is there a possibility that he could not \nget his water use back because that land he had irrigated might then \ncome under some kind of a criterion that would prevent him under the \nEndangered Species Act?\n\n  It is that kind of unanswered ambiguity about this section that makes \nme oppose it. I am not opposed to the concept. I am always looking for \nways that farmers and ranchers can survive because it is not easy. We \nhave more ranchers and farmers in the West whose wives are now driving \nschool buses to make ends meet. It is a tough lifestyle. There is no \nquestion that as the urbanization takes place in the West, there is \ngoing to be a bigger need for water.\n  Maybe someday we will have to change the way we use water, as they do \nin Israel and other dry countries where they have gone to drip \nirrigation and other things, rather than flood irrigating, which is so \nwasteful of water. But under the water law that exists now in the \nWestern States, I think this could really upset things, even though the \nlanguage says it cannot be done without the approval of the water \nauthority. Something, it seems to me, should be fleshed out completely \nthrough hearings and much better debate, rather than simply in the last \nfew minutes before the agriculture bill moves.\n  With that, I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this section of the \nbill and in support of the amendment to strike it as well. I think it \nis important as we debate this amendment we recognize that the Senate \nAgriculture Committee never considered this provision. It was never \nraised in any of the hearings we held on the conservation title of the \nfarm bill earlier this year, nor was it included in any version of the \nconservation title on which this committee has worked. It has simply \nbeen introduced on the floor now while debating the bill. It hasn't \nbeen vetted nationwide.\n  We are in the process of debating it now, as water users, water \nlawyers, and those who are involved in this issue around the Nation are \nhurriedly trying to evaluate it and get their information to us to \ndetermine what impact and what consequences it will have. I believe the \nlaw of unintended consequences, which was discussed by several other \nSenators here, is going to be played out if this becomes law and we \nwill then see what happens without having had the kind of thorough \nevaluation that it deserves in this body.\n  What the proposal does is to adjust the CRP, which is a very useful \nand time-tested program in the conservation title of the farm bill that \nhas been extremely successful over the years in helping us to improve \nthe habitat for wildlife, and for fish, and for species around the \nNation by addressing those concerns without doing it in the context of \nthe Endangered Species Act but doing it in the context of the \nconservation effort that we seek to achieve in our farm policies in \nthis Nation.\n\n  In fact, I have worked very hard this year and in the last couple of \nyears to put together a conservation title for the farm bill, and a \npart of that conservation title is to try to expand the CRP to make it \neven more useful in protecting habitat and improving circumstances \nnationwide for our wildlife.\n  Yet we have not seen this effort to try to hook Federal acquisition \nof water rights into the administration of the CRP until today. I have \nworked very closely with many of the Senators in the Chamber in other \nefforts to protect and strengthen our salmon and steelhead in Idaho \nunder the Endangered Species Act, another endangered species as well.\n  I worked hard to improve the Endangered Species Act to authorize our \nlandowners to have habitat conservation plans and options where they \ncan commit to use their land in certain ways that will help achieve the \nobjectives of the Endangered Species Act\n\n[[Page S13029]]\n\nand protect them from some of the onerous implications of the impacts \nthe act may have on them in the administration and use of their land.\n  Never until today have we debated a proposal to merge the CRP with \nthe Endangered Species Act and to do so in a way that facilitates and, \nin fact, initiates the Federal acquisition of water rights. That is \nwhat is causing such a significant concern around the country.\n  In my discussion with the Senator from Nevada earlier, he \nacknowledged that, although there is a lot of talk about the use of the \nvoluntariness in this package, it is only voluntary in the sense that a \nfarmer does not have to participate in the CRP if he does not want to \ngive up his water rights. But with regard to this 1.1 million acres \nthat is outlined in this proposal, any farmer in America has only one \nchoice: Either do not participate in this part of the expansion of the \nCRP or give up your water rights, either on a temporary or permanent \nbasis. Such a choice, in my opinion, is not very voluntary.\n  In fact, it will cause a lot of farmers who otherwise would have \ntaken advantage of this expansion of the CRP to do really good things \non their land and improve habitat to say: I am not going to give up my \nwater rights. So I am not going to participate in this program and they \nwill make that so-called ``voluntary'' decision, but what it really \nmeans is they have been deprived of this ability to participate in the \nexpansion of the CRP because the condition of giving up their water \nrights has been placed on it. That is what the debate comes down to.\n  Why is it necessary for us to expand into the CRP the Federal effort \nto gain control over water by acquisition of water rights and to fund \nit so the Federal Government can then come in with the deepest pocket \nin the market and buy water rights with the pressure or the tool of \naccess to the CRP used as the hammer?\n  The real debate here is: Why are we seeing this? I think the reason \nis one that has been suggested by several of the others who have \nspoken. Historically, we have seen an increasing effort by the Federal \nGovernment to gain access to and control over the water in this Nation. \nThat is a continuous issue we fight often in the West, and I know in \nother parts of the country it is fought as well. So there is an \nautomatic alertness by those who own water rights or who deal with \nwater rights or who seek to manage the water issues in the States, when \nthey see a new program with Federal dollars being pumped in and Federal \nconditions being brought in to a program that otherwise was working \nwonderfully with the purpose of saying we are going to utilize this \ngood program and restrict access for it to the new people who want to \nget in and do so on the basis that the only way they can use it is if \nthey give up their Federal water rights.\n\n  In a sense that is voluntary because they do not have to do it, but \nit is making it so anyone who wants to participate in the expansion of \nthe program cannot do so unless they fall within this provision.\n  The proposal I have made, and I hope still will be the one that \nprevails in the Senate with regard to the CRP lands, is indeed we focus \nour expansion of the CRP on those buffer strips and those areas where \nwe can have the most impact on habitat for wildlife, but not do it in a \nway that excludes every landowner in America who does not want to give \nup their water rights.\n  Let's not create just a limited application of this new expansion of \nthe CRP in a way that would essentially disqualify everyone who is not \nwilling to give up their right to water. That is my biggest concern \nwith regard to the so-called voluntariness issue and the purpose behind \nthis legislation.\n  Another point I think is critical to make is that those who advocate \nthis provision say it is important we protect these threatened species \nand species that could be benefited if the Federal Government could \ntake control of this water and utilize it for their benefit. It is a \ngood point. Utilization of the water resources of this Nation for the \nbenefit of species is critical, and yet under existing Federal laws, \nsuch as the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and so forth, \nand under existing State laws, almost everything that has been \ndiscussed as a very positive thing that should be done under the \nEndangered Species Act can already be done.\n  If you stop to think about it, as the Senator from Montana already \nsaid, the Federal Government can already buy water rights in a willing \nbuyer/willing seller arrangement. What is being added here is that \nlever or that hammer that says you cannot any longer participate in the \nexpansion of the CRP unless you sell your water rights. Just a little \nbit of a hammer--maybe not such a little hammer--on the water users of \nthis Nation.\n  Yet already we are achieving some of those objectives under the \nexisting law. For example, in my State of Idaho, the need for water for \nsalmon and steelhead has long been established, has been debated \nactually, but has long been something that has been sought to be \naddressed under the Endangered Species Act. For years, hundreds of \nthousands of acre-feet of water in Idaho on an annual basis have been \nmade available on this true willing buyer/willing seller basis where \nthe Federal Government has come in and obtained on fair evenhanded \nnegotiations the ability to get water out of the waterbank or out of \nsome projects or out of water users who do not need it for that year \nand to utilize it for the salmon and the steelhead.\n  That can be done, but it does not have to be done with the added \nhammer of prohibiting access to the CRP.\n  In the State of Idaho, for example, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, \nas I indicated, has been able to rent water from the State waterbank \nfrom willing sellers for almost a decade. Recently, in another context, \nthe Bureau has rented water in the Lemhi River area, a tributary of the \nSalmon River for the benefit of species. All of this was done under \nState law and Federal with the current system.\n\n  I have a letter from the Governor of the State of Idaho who asked us \nto oppose this legislation because it is in conflict with Idaho's water \nlaw and because, as he says:\n\n       In addition, the goal of implementing water quantity and \n     water quality improvement demonstrated to be required for \n     species listed under the Endangered Species Act can largely \n     be achieved under existing State laws.\n\n  The Governor goes on to give examples that explain we have those \nabilities and the desires in the States right now to achieve these \nobjectives.\n  What this comes down to, frankly, is: Are we going to modify and take \na step into the arena of our conservation title of the farm bill now \nand modify the CRP in a way that creates a hammer to force those who \nwould like to participate in it, would like to improve the habitat \nunder this program, would like to take the incentive that it provides \nand say: You cannot do it unless you give up your water rights? Or are \nwe going to use the existing voluntary basis of addressing these issues \nunder the Endangered Species Act, in terms of obtaining and utilizing \nwater rights, and let the CRP work as it has been intended to work and \nas it has so effectively worked over the last years to let farmers, \nwithout having to jeopardize their water rights, do those things they \nknow are going to benefit the species that reside on their property?\n  I think that it would be better, actually. If you want to look at \nwhat is going to actually result in the best results for species and \nfor wildlife in general in the United States, I think it is going to be \nbest if we allow those who own land and who operate land in \nagricultural endeavors to continue to utilize this expansion of the CRP \nprogram without the threats of giving up their water rights because you \nwill have many more people willing to participate then, many more lands \nthat will be available and be competitive for this expansion, and the \nSecretary will be able to have a broader array of choices in terms of \nthe allocations of the new CRP land.\n\n  A last question that perhaps the Senator from Nevada can answer, a \nquestion raised by some of the water users as they struggle to evaluate \nwhat will happen: What happens if a water user who enters into a \ncontract with the Secretary agrees on a temporary basis to give up his \nwater rights and then chooses, for whatever reasons--economic reasons \nor whatever--to break out of the contract and go back into production? \nI understand there are financial penalties for that. That is \nunderstood. By then taking that water\n\n[[Page S13030]]\n\nback from the Federal Government's utilization to the utilization of \nthe farmer, which I assume would be possible, would that then result in \na section 9 violation of the Endangered Species Act by taking water \naway from a species?\n  A lot of questions come up under this law as to what will happen if \nthis new regime for utilization of water is implemented. I know the \nSenator from Nevada says State law is not being superseded. The fact \nis, under the State laws in the West, many different evaluations have \nto be made before a water right can be transferred. In many cases, the \nwater right is actually owned by a canal company or irrigation \ndistrict, not by the land owner. So permission there would have to be \nobtained. Then approval from the State water authorities would have to \nbe obtained.\n  I assume from the answers we have gotten that would be left in place \nand no farmer would be able to participate unless he got approval from \nthe entities that were the actual owners of the water and from the \nState that manages the water. Again, that will limit dramatically the \nnumber of people who can take advantage of this expansion of the CRP. \nBut assuming that is in place, what happens if the Endangered Species \nAct becomes applicable to the new utilization of the water regime and \nthe farmer wants to take it back? We have a lot of questions that need \nto be answered.\n  In summary, we have not had a chance to thoroughly vet this issue. It \nhas not been reviewed in committee or hearings. There is a tremendous \namount of unrest building and developing around the country over what \nthis will do. The bottom line is, there is no established reason for \ntrying to connect the Endangered Species Act and the desire for \nexpansive Federal control over water to a very effective CRP that is \ndoing its job under the conservation title of the farm bill.\n  I encourage those Senators who will make their decision on this issue \nsoon as we come to vote on it to recognize we should reject this \nsection of the farm bill and support the amendment to strike this \nprovision and work in a collaborative fashion to develop the approaches \nto the farm bill that will expand and strengthen our conservation \ntitle, but not do so in a way so divisive.\n  I conclude with this. I have maintained for many years probably the \nmost significant piece of environmentally positive legislation we have \nworked on in Congress is the farm bill. It has tremendous incentives in \nthe conservation title to make sure the private land users in this \ncountry and the way we utilize our agricultural land and its production \nare incentivised for good, positive, conservation practices that \nbenefit species, our air quality, our water quality, and the like. That \nis what this conservation title does. That is what the CRP is designed \nto do. Do not saddle the CRP with this unnecessary effort to extend \nFederal control over water and Federal acquisition over water. Let the \nCRP work as it was intended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join with my colleague and partner from \nIdaho with what I think is, for Idaho, an arid Western State, probably \none of the more critical debates of new farm policy for our country.\n  Those who live east of the Mississippi have no comprehension of the \nvalue of a raindrop, the value of a bank of snow, or the value of a \nlarge body of water retained behind an impoundment, known as a \nreservoir. My forbears and Senator Crapo's forbears for generations \nhave recognized the value of storing water under State law and \nallocating this very scarce commodity to make the deserts of the West \nbloom and to become productive.\n  There is no question in anyone's mind, I hope, that the ability to \nallocate water is the sole responsibility of the States. That is a \nfundamental right that has been well established in law. While \noftentimes disputed by those who disagree, it is rarely ruled against \nin court.\n  Why are we gathered here tonight? Because an amendment would propose \nin some nature, yet to be argued, that that fundamental principle of \nwestern water law is somehow overridden by a Federal law.\n  My colleague from Idaho was very clear in pointing out the rather \nperverse incentive created within this bill. The authors take a very \npopular conservation program known as CRP and suggest if you wish to \nenter it anew, somehow you have to give up something increasingly more \nvaluable. That has never been the concept. The benefit of CRP and the \nintent of CRP--and I am one who has been here long enough to say I was \nthere at the beginning of this idea--said it was to take erosive lands \nout of the market, give that land owner something in return for the \nvalue of the conservation that would result.\n  What has happened in the meantime is a well established record that \nthese lands once tilled were turned into grasses and stubbles and root \nbase that held the water, stopped the erosion, and became some of the \nfinest upland game bird habitat in the West.\n  In my State of Idaho, it is an extremely popular program where \npheasant, chukar, and sage grouse now flourish because of the program. \nThe incentive was the right and natural incentive. It was not: I want \nto provide you something, but to do so, I want to take something away.\n  The Senator from California, a few moments ago, opined about the fact \nof a dry river bed. I am not going to suggest States have allocated \ntheir water always in the proper fashion. We in the West are in a tug \ntoday, a tug of war over water because we are populating at a very \nrapid and historic rate compared to the last century. Agriculture, some \nmanufacturing, and human consumption were the dominant consumptive uses \nof water. We failed to take into recognition the value of fisheries on \noccasion or riparian zones. We now understand that.\n  But here is the catch-22. My State, for 100 years, added to its water \nbase. My State created more water than that State ever had before the \nWestern European man came. Why? Because we created impoundments, we \nsaved the spring runoff, and we increased the abundance of water in my \nState by hundreds of thousands of acre-feet. But about a decade and a \nhalf ago, because of environmental interests and attitudes, we stopped \ndoing that. The Federal Government said: We will build no more dams. It \nis not a good thing to dam up rivers. So it stopped. We stopped adding \nwater to a very arid Western State. And it is true across the West. So \nwe locked into place the amount of water that was there. We could add \nno more.\n  Two decades ago, I joined with the Senator from Colorado to establish \na new water project in southeastern Colorado and we have fought it for \ntwo decades. It still is not constructed. Yet it would have added an \nabundance of new water to that corner of the State. It was denied by \nenvironmental interests and others. That is really a very encapsulated \nhistory as I know it.\n\n  Now what is happening, in an area where we have been locked into a \nlimited amount of water, unable to store or generate more by spring \nrunoff, we are saying you have to divide that which is currently used \nfor other uses.\n  I will tell you, the arguments are pretty legitimate: Fisheries, \nwater quality, in-stream flow, riparian zones--something we all want. \nIt is something we all believe in. But because of the situation the \narid West has been put in, when we offer up to do this, we have to take \nit away from somebody else. We can't add because we have no more water \nwith which to work.\n  We are at the headwaters of a mighty water system in my State known \nas the Snake-Columbia system. The mighty Snake River begins just over \nthe mountain in Wyoming, springs through Idaho, and picks up the \ntributaries and dumps from the Idaho into the Columbia River, and our \nrivers and our streams are the habitat for salmonoid fisheries--salmon, \na marvelous species of fish. They come up from the ocean to spawn, and \ntheir offspring go back to the ocean. That has become an increasingly \nimportant issue in my State because they are now listed as endangered \nor threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\n  The State of Idaho has sent upwards, at times, of 700,000 acre-feet \nof their water, under law, downriver to help those fish. But there are \nthose who want more.\n  As my colleague from Idaho said, the Bureau of Reclamation in Idaho \nis, in\n\n[[Page S13031]]\n\nfact, acquiring water from Idaho and its willing seller. That is the \nappropriate thing to do. It is not an adversary relationship. If you \nhave surplus available and it is in a nonuse way, we will acquire it \nand put it to some other use.\n  But that fight doesn't occur here in the Nation's capital. It occurs \nin Boise, in Idaho's capital, in the State capital of our State where \nwater law, water fights ought to exist. If you are going to fight water \nin Colorado, you fight it in Denver, you don't fight it here, because \nit is not our right to do so. If you are going to fight water in New \nMexico, you fight it in Albuquerque.\n  And we will have those fights. The West is replete with a history of \nwater fights. Why? Because it is a scarce commodity. It is a lifegiving \ncommodity--to the human species, to the fish, to the wildlife, to the \nplants that become the abundant crops that have made our States the \ngreat productive States that they are. But it was the men and women of \nIdaho from the beginning who decided how Idaho's water ought to be \nallocated--not the Federal Government, not the Agriculture Committee of \nthe Senate, not the Secretary of Agriculture, but the citizens of the \nState of Idaho.\n  So the senior Senator from New Mexico offers an amendment to strike \nthe provision for the water conservation program as proposed by the \nSenator from Nevada, and he is right to do so. It doesn't mean a \nprogram such as this couldn't exist. It doesn't mean a program such as \nthis should not exist. But if it does exist, it ought to be the right \nof the State to decide whether its citizens can participate in it \nbecause it is the State's right to decide how that water gets allocated \nand not the Federal Government's.\n  When I first came to Congress in the early 1980s, there were some \nvery wise environmentalists who were scratching their heads and saying: \nWait a minute, if Idaho is 63 percent owned by the Federal Government \nand the citizens of the Nation and most of the tops of those watersheds \nwhere that water system of the West begins are Federal land, why isn't \nit Federal water? And there was a thrust and a move to take it.\n\n  We blocked it. We stopped it. Why? Because of the precedent and the \nhistory and the reality that when you are in a State such as mine and \nthat of Senator Mike Crapo, where we get about 15 inches of rainfall a \nyear, water is sacred. What do we get here, 60-plus in a good year? \nPeople east of the Mississippi don't worry about water so much. They \ndon't realize that you have to control it and impound it. Actually, \nthey are trying to control it to keep it off their lands most of the \ntime, to keep it out of their farms because it floods and does damage. \nWe have had those fights here--reclamation fights and all of that \ndrainage kind of thing in wetlands. Quite the reverse is true out there \non the other side of the Rockies, on the other side of the Mississippi.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I worked with the Senator from Idaho on a good number \nof water bills for a number of years. Maybe I should correct him \nbecause we have one more water project to build, and that is what he \nand I have been working on in Colorado for the last two decades. But \nsomething came to my mind as I have been listening to the debate, and I \nwould like to ask the Senator a question, since he is the only one on \nthe floor.\n  Most of the western States have several problems including over \nappropriation, which means more people own the water than there is \nwater. That is why we have been fighting back and forth. One of the \nthings common to the West but not common to the East is called water \ncompacts. We have them between counties sharing scarce water, we have \nthem between States. Colorado happens to be an upper basin State, as it \nis called; California, a lower basin State; and we share the water that \ngoes down the Colorado River. We also share the water, under a \ncontractual agreement, that goes down the Rio Grande that starts in \nColorado, that goes to Texas.\n  In addition to interstate compacts, we have international compacts \nbecause we have a compact with Mexico to provide a certain amount of \nwater from both of those rivers to that nation.\n  Most of the water that is in ranching now recharges back to the \nground. It goes back either through runoff irrigation, which goes back \nto the river, or if it is sprinkled, it usually recharges the aquifer \nto some degree. One of the big unknown questions for me is if there is \na possibility, if we change the use or allow the Federal Government to \nchange the use, it would in any way upset existing compacts. I would \nlike to ask the Senator if he has thought about that, if he has any \nviews on that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I appreciate the Senator asking the question. I am not \nsure I can respond. What the Senator has clearly demonstrated though, \nby the question, is the complex character of western water and western \nwater relationships. The Senator is in the headwaters of the mighty \nColorado River. Yet the citizens of the State of Colorado don't have a \nright to drain the river because the Colorado is the headwaters of a \nriver system that goes all the way to the Gulf of California. All of \nthose relationships have developed over the years.\n  I am not sure I can answer that question. I think it is literally \nthat technical. That is why, when somebody says, Oh, this causes no \nproblem--until you review it and put it into the context of the law \nthat governs water, a clear answer cannot be given. And I am not a \nwater attorney.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Exactly the point. We don't know the problems that will \nbe created, and that is why I think it is wrong to move forward with \nthis bill with this section in it until we have had some really in-\ndepth hearings as to how it would affect water in all the States of the \nWest.\n  I appreciate the time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from Colorado also mentioned something else in \nthe context of his question that I think is often not understood. The \nIdaho Fish and Game Department would tell any citizen, or any \nquestioning person, that there is more wildlife and more abundance of \nwildlife in Idaho today than ever in our known history except for maybe \nprehistoric times. Before the crust shifted and the glaciers receded \ntotally, we were a fairly tropical area, and there may have been a more \nabundant wildlife at that time. But I am talking about known history.\n  We have more wildlife in our State today, in the general sense, than \never in our State's history. They will tell us very simply why. There \nis more water.\n  While some of our citizens are concerned that it isn't where they \nwould like it to be as it relates to their particular interest--whether \nit be a fish or a riparian zone--the abundance of deer, elk, antelope, \nand some of our upland game birds is in direct proportion to the amount \nof water that is now being spread upon the land by humans. It is that \nmultiplier that I talked about earlier on that Idahoans have been \nincreasing the overall volume of water in their State, on an annualized \nbasis, ever since we set foot in the State and began to homestead it \nand turn the land and make it productive.\n  For example, we used to flood irrigate, spread the water openly on \nthe land, over the Idaho aquifer. Because we wanted to conserve the \nwater, we have moved from flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation.\n  We dramatically reduced the amount of water that is now being \nreturned to the aquifer. We changed the very character of a climate \nthat we created in the beginning upon which wildlife depended. Herein \nlies the question that needs to be asked of the impact of what the \nSenator might want to do with his amendment.\n  Let us suggest that you, for a period of time, leased your water from \na given acreage of land and it became arid, and certain wildlife moved \non the land that liked arid land. Then, later on, you chose to irrigate \nthe land which might drown out the particular arid species and somebody \nfiled on you because you were threatening that species and risking its \nendangerment. Are you in violation of the law when you say you are only \nreturning the land to its pre-existing use?\n  Let us say you dried up the land and caused the species that were \nrare to leave because the lack of moisture turned it arid.\n  Those are all the kinds of simple complication because we have made \nthe law so critical and caused some of our friends to become such \ncritics. Those are reasonable questions to ask.\n\n[[Page S13032]]\n\n  In the West and in the arid regions of our country, a long while ago \nthis Congress recognized how important it was for those who lived in \nthe arid areas to determine the use of the water. Some scholars called \nit the oasis theory. My grandfather said that very early on when he was \nhomesteading; he homesteaded where the water was. Why? Because it is \nlife for you and your family, and the livestock. In that case, it was \nmy granddad's sheep ranch. It wasn't by accident that he became the \nowner and controller of water because it was a very limited commodity \nand it allowed him to grow and to expand his business, if he had to.\n  That has been the history of the West. That is why we must not allow \nthis amendment to exist. I am not saying the purpose isn't right, nor \nam I saying the Secretary of Agriculture might not want to ask the \nState to participate. But they ought to be asking and the State ought \nto have a right to say yes or no, and there ought not be any perverse \nincentive that if you do not, you won't get something in return that \nothers can get.\n  That isn't the way conservation programs ought to be developed. There \nought to clearly be incentives. The additional CRP offers just that. It \nhas been a very successful program in the foothill countries of the \nupland areas, in the steep countries, and the erosive lands that were \nonce farmed. That is what ought to happen this time.\n  I hope we can work out those differences. If not, we will have to not \nonly attempt to strike, as the Senator from New Mexico is now \nattempting to do, but we will have to follow any effort through to \nconference and work with our colleagues in the House to make that \nhappen.\n  That is how critically important this is for the West and for all of \nus involved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are going to put ourselves in a \nquorum because the principals involved are working on a way to resolve \nthe issue that is brought to the Senate in the Domenici amendment to \nstrike. That is why we are not going to be speaking for just a while. \nWe hope we are saving time by doing this.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nDomenici's amendment to strike the conservation provisions of this \nlegislation.\n  As former chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee with \njurisdiction over western water, and now the ranking member, I have \nlabored with my colleagues for a good deal of time to try to resolve \nthese issues. This proposal coming in without any hearings, and without \nany input from the Western States that care so much for their \nprosperity over water, and this particular portion of this legislation \nis absolutely premature and inappropriate. It doesn't belong in here.\n  Senator Domenici's amendment to strike the conservation provision is \nsomething I wholeheartedly support. We simply do not need to have \nanother program with the intent of taking water away from farmers. That \nis just what this does.\n  This program, as I indicated, has not had a hearing, and it will \ndirectly affect programs within the jurisdiction of our Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources. It took us years and years to craft and \nenact the Upper Colorado Fish Recovery Program. I am of the opinion \nthat this could be adversely affected if these provisions are adopted.\n  We are presently in the midst of considering reauthorization of the \nCALFED Program in California. I know Senator Feinstein worked very hard \non that. Its effects on Federal and local obligations in the Central \nValley of California are paramount. This new program could \nsignificantly affect the effort and directly increase obligations of \nFederal contractors in the Central Valley.\n  There is a multispecies program under consideration in the lower \nColorado that could be directly and adversely affected as well.\n\n  Further, there is not the slightest reference to the requirements of \nreclamation law, and most farmers west of the Mississippi are dependent \non the operation of reclamation law. That is what they are governed by; \nthat is what they live by; that is the gospel. There is no reference to \nthat.\n  As a consequence, these people have to feel very uneasy and very \ninsecure about this proposal.\n  Again, there is certainly justification for Senator Domenici's \namendment to strike. The entire chapter in the Daschle amendment should \nbe introduced as separate legislation. It should be referred to the \nproper committee, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and \nhave full hearings. Consideration should be given before any action is \ntaken.\n  I certainly don't subscribe to the theory that these programs are \nvoluntary. We have seen too much of that.\n  We have ample evidence from the last administration of the ability of \nthe Federal Government to coerce people to agree. We also had ample \nevidence from the last administration of their ability to use Federal \nlaw to reinterpret State water law. Secretary Babbitt's proposal by \nregulation to declare nonuse to be a beneficial use in the Lower Basin \nof Colorado is evidence of that.\n  There is nothing to give us any comfort that another Secretary, such \nas Secretary Babbitt, could not use this authority to completely \nabrogate State water law and force the farmers to adhere or simply go \nout of business.\n  I support the amendment by the Senator from New Mexico to strike \nthese provisions. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I think we have \ndiscussed this to the point where it is evident and clear that this is \nnot good legislation.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. CARNAHAN). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I think that the debate was a very \ngood one. I think we all understand each other much better. Senator \nReid and I have reached an agreement, and my fellow Senator from New \nMexico has been a participant and a helper.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2502, As Modified\n\n  I send to the desk a modification of my amendment, the strike \namendment. This amendment, as modified, is offered on behalf of myself, \nmy colleague, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 130, line 9, insert the following: ``Before the \n     Secretary of Agriculture begins to implement the program \n     created under this section in any State, the Secretary shall \n     obtain written consent from the governor of the State. The \n     Secretary shall not implement this program without obtaining \n     this consent. In the event of the election or appointment of \n     a new governor in a State, the Secretary shall once again \n     seek written consent to allow for any new enrollment in the \n     program created under this section in that State.''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Madam President, rather than explain it, I will \njust read it. Tthen everybody will understand what we have done is make \nthis a consensual program. That means that the Governor of the State \nmust agree for his State to be in this new program. And that right is \ngiven to each Governor if, in fact, there is a new Governor while the \nprogram is still in existence.\n  So I am just going to read it:\n\n       Before the Secretary of Agriculture begins to implement the \n     program created under this\n\n[[Page S13033]]\n\n     section in any State, the Secretary shall obtain written \n     consent from the governor of the State. The Secretary shall \n     not implement this program without obtaining this consent. In \n     the event of the election or appointment of a new Governor in \n     a State, the Secretary shall once again seek written consent \n     to allow for any new enrollment in the program created under \n     this section in that State.\n\n  I yield to Senator Bingaman who wants to comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague. First, let me \ncompliment him for raising concerns about the provision. I also \ncompliment Senator Reid for his commitment to try to help deal with \nsome of these issues requiring additional attention to water \nconservation in the West.\n  I do think that is a real need. It is a real need we see all the \ntime. Senator Domenici, my colleague, raised questions about the \nparticular program and how that would affect our States and whether it \nwould be an appropriate program to implement. Those were very valid \nquestions.\n  This modification that Senator Domenici has now sent to the desk, on \nbehalf of himself and me and Senator Reid, is a very good compromise. \nWhat it does is make it very clear that each State can make its own \ndetermination as to whether this is a program in which it wants to be \ninvolved. If it does not, then clearly it should not be forced to do \nso. This is a very good result. It certainly meets our needs in New \nMexico.\n  I compliment Senator Domenici for this modification. I compliment \nSenator Reid as well for his leadership on this whole range of issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, so the record is clear, I want everyone to \nknow that Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman have been most \nreasonable in their approach. We early on tried to get an opt-out \nprovision. This makes much more sense and is mechanically something \nthat will work very well. I also appreciate the dialog we have had off \nthe floor with Senator Crapo, who is a water law lawyer. He is going to \ncome back later with some other questions he has. We will be happy to \nvisit with him.\n  I am grateful for moving this issue along. As I have said all along, \nthis is one of the real strong points of this new bill. I am grateful \nthis amendment will be accepted shortly.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I appreciate what the Senator is working to do with our \ncolleagues from New Mexico. This is a vast improvement without question \nover what I believe is a major intrusion into water law and the very \nreclamation laws that many of our colleagues before us have written. I \nam not quite sure we have bridged the gap yet. I do believe there is a \nvery real precedent here that is risky at best as it relates to our \nreclamation laws.\n  This particular amendment has not withstood that test. Nor has it had \nthe very intricacy of water law reviewed against it. That is critical.\n  I know the intent and the good intentions of the Senator from Nevada. \nThis is a phenomenally complicated area. To study water law today and \nto look at the court proceedings over the last decades would argue that \nvery clearly.\n  My colleague from Idaho has spent a good deal of time with water law. \nI am not a lawyer; I have not. But I do recognize a precedent when I \nsee it and something that is new and unique to a very important body of \nlaw. I hope we can continue to work to perfect this. I do believe there \nis a very clear perverse incentive here that no person, nor public \npolicy, should have embodied within it.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend from Idaho, his elucidation is the \nreason we have the States having the obligation, if they want in this \nprogram, to say ``we want in the program.'' I think from what the \nSenator outlined, if a State doesn't want in, then they don't come in. \nAs I have indicated earlier in my remarks, I would be happy to work \nwith Senator Craig's colleague, Senator Crapo, who now is in the \nChamber, to see if we can come up with something that will meet his \nquestions and some of his concerns.\n  I have indicated to him that I certainly will not reject outright \nanything he has to say. I have an open mind and would be happy to visit \nwith him. I have also indicated to Senator Kyl that there is absolutely \nno question that this has nothing to do with changing State law. The \nSenator has indicated at a subsequent time he will submit to us some \nlanguage, and we will be happy to take a look at that, if he believes \nthis language in our legislation is not clear enough. He also has had \nexperience in water law, as has the Senator from Idaho. I would be \nhappy to take a look at that.\n  I have had great experience working with the Senator from Arizona, \nwho has been extremely important in our working on one of the most \ndifficult water problems we have had in the entire West. The State of \nArizona and the State of Nevada were at war for about 3 years, a bitter \nwater war. As a result of our help and the water expertise of the \nSenator from Arizona, and perhaps a little of my political work on the \nissue, we were able to work something out. So now the States of Arizona \nand Nevada are working together hand in glove.\n  I look forward to working with these Senators in the near future on \nthis issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Has the \namendment been adopted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back any time we might have on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nSenator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I was not on the floor when Senator Domenici made his \nrequest. What is the status of the procedure at this point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I should have stated that when the Senator arrived. I \nhad the privilege of offering a substitute amendment for my amendment \nto strike. I merely substituted the new one for the motion to strike. \nSo if it is adopted or when it is adopted, we will have accomplished \none significant step. And that is that the program cannot be \nimplemented in any State without the concurrence of the Governor of \nthat State in writing.\n  There remains other issues that do not have to do with the consent \nand whether the program can be used in a State, but rather how will it \nbe applied vis-a-vis the 1.1 million acres that were intended for \nWestern States, for States, under this new provision. The Senator is \nworking on that. He now has some other people working on it. I have the \nutmost confidence that he will come up with some language. I anxiously \nawait it, and I will be there to help and support him. I think we have \neliminated a major concern our States had, and that was that this law \nwould be there, and it would be a new imposition. Even if the States \ndidn't want it, if they thought it was not good, they would be stuck \nwith it. I think we have eliminated that. All of the things we think \nare perverse about that are not going to happen.\n\n  I thank the Senator, because I didn't do it heretofore, for his help. \nHe has been here most of the afternoon. I do believe together we made \nan important contribution. I thank the Senator for that.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I would like to make a couple comments on \nthe amendment before we vote, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I will support the amendment Senator \nDomenici from New Mexico has proposed. I appreciate the opportunity to \nwork with him, and I believe he has done a tremendous job in \nidentifying a serious problem and getting, as he indicated, a \nsignificant part of it solved. There is still an additional problem \nwith which I have a concern. That is, even though we now have reached \nan agreement which will basically provide an opt-in situation in which \nthe Governor of each State has the authority to determine whether his \nState or her State will opt into these provisions, the problem we face \nis that the States that choose to opt out or to stay out are then \ndeprived of their ability to participate in this 1.1 million acres of \nCRP land that is being added to the CRP.\n\n[[Page S13034]]\n\n  There is a hammer there on the States now to either opt in or not \nhave access to this expansion of the CRP.\n  I have discussed this issue with the good Senator from Nevada, and I \nappreciate his willingness to work with me on trying to resolve the \nissue. He has agreed that we will try to work out the differences and, \nhopefully, be able to come forward with a unanimous consent request or \nsome type of approach that is agreed to. But if not, we will be able to \npropose additional amendments to try to address this issue, including \nstriking the provision, if we are not able to work it out.\n  I appreciate all of those here who have worked on this matter. \nSenator Craig has worked diligently, and Senator Domenici has worked so \nstrongly in bringing this forward. I appreciate the willingness of \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, to try to iron out the concerns we have \non western water law. I believe several other Senators from the West \nhave strong concerns. They may want to make brief comments. I will \nsupport Senator Domenici's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I made a mistake. I should have \nincluded as a cosponsor of the Domenici amendment all of those who are \ncosponsors of my motion to strike. They have indicated they want to be \non the amendment. We don't have any objection; quite the contrary. I \nask unanimous consent that they be original cosponsors as it is \ntendered to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I thank Senator Reid for the comments he \nmade. He is absolutely right that after years of acrimony, \nrepresentatives of the State of Nevada and Arizona solved a real \ndifficult water issue which became a win-win for both States. I am \nhoping that the kind of work we need to do in the Senate on this \nproposal can likewise result in win-win situations.\n  Western water law issues become very complex very quickly, and we \nwant to ensure that nothing we do here in any way adversely affects the \nlong-established, traditional water policies of the West. Senator Reid \nhas assured me that it is not his intention that this legislation be \ncontrary to State procedural or substantive water law, interstate \ncompacts, or, of course, Federal law. We are preparing language that \nwill affirm that.\n  I appreciate the Senator's concurrence in that view. Given the \ncomments of Senator Domenici, I am prepared to support his amendment as \nwell. There are additional concerns that I have about this. We will try \nto work those out and deal with them in an appropriate way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2502), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wish to inquire of the Senator from \nIowa, if I might get his attention. First of all, I congratulate those \nwho worked on this amendment. It sounds to me as if they have done a \nlot of hard work in reaching a solution. I inquire of the Senator from \nIowa and, perhaps, the Senator from Indiana of the progress in trying \nto find a list or to elicit information about what kind of a list of \namendments might be about to be offered on this bill. The reason I ask \nthe question is, it is 6:30 this evening and, of course, we are nearing \nthe end of the session. It is coming very close to Christmas. We want \nto finish this bill so we have time remaining for a conference with the \nHouse and time to get the bill to the President.\n  Because we have had long discussions and good discussions today on a \nnumber of amendments, I am inquiring on the part of both the manager \nand the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Indiana whether we have \na capability of exploring a list of amendments that might be available \nat this point.\n  Mr. LUGAR. If I may respond, Madam President, with the disposition of \nthe Domenici amendment, the next amendment--at least on our side--that \nwe are prepared to offer is that of the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond. Then Senator Burns has an amendment that he wishes \nto offer, Senator Murkowski has an amendment, and Senator McCain has \none. These are ones that are clearly identifiable at this point. \nSenator Burns may have more than one amendment, but he will commence in \nthis batting order with his initial amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand there is likely to be a larger amendment, or \na more significant amendment, the Cochran-Roberts amendment--not to \nsuggest that the others are not significant. But we have all been \nawaiting an amendment by Cochran-Roberts, which is not on the list. Is \nhe anticipating that?\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I anticipate that the Senators will offer their amendment. \nThey have been working on it, and I understand they are not prepared to \ndo so today. Perhaps they will be prepared to do so tomorrow.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might inquire one more time, is there an \nanticipation that there is an opportunity perhaps to finish this bill \nby sometime tomorrow evening, or does the chairman or the ranking \nmember expect this is going to take longer than that? In the context of \nthat, is there a time when one might be able to get a finite list of \namendments?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I respond, respectfully, to the Senator that at this point \na finite list is not possible. But it may be possible sometime \ntomorrow. We are attempting to canvas. I have simply identified \namendments that I think are significant, and the amendment the Senator \nidentified would be, too. The two amendments that we have dealt with \nthis afternoon have taken about 3\\1/4\\ hours and 2\\1/2\\ hours, \nrespectively, so these were not insignificant debates, which Members on \nboth sides of the aisle engaged in in a spirited way.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Again, I thank the Senator for his response. I invite the \nresponse of the Senator from Iowa, but I hope that perhaps we can find \na way to get a list of amendments and also agree to reasonable time \nlimits on amendments. There is Parkinson's law that the time required \nexpands to fit the time available. So because we are nearing the end of \nthe session, it is really important to find a way to reach an end \nstage. I ask the Senator from Iowa if he might respond on whether we \ncan get a finite list.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I hope by this evening, perhaps before we go out \ntonight. I will work with my distinguished ranking member, my good \nfriend, Senator Lugar, to see if we can get some kind of a list. It is \ntrue, as the Senator says, that the longer you stay here, more and \nmore--it is like that old game you play at the arcade, whack-a-mole, \nwhere they keep popping up. If we don't have a finite list, those \nlobbyists and everybody out there who is trying to get their year-end \ncounts up and get that year-end bonus, all their lobbying, and they can \ngin up all kinds of amendments around here to show the kind of work \nthey are doing. I am hopeful that we can get a finite list. I don't \nknow if we can do it tonight. I hope early tomorrow we can get a finite \nlist.\n  I want to assure the Senator from North Dakota, and every other \nSenator who is listening, we will finish this farm bill before we go \nhome. If there is anyone here who thinks that by slowing things down or \nsomething like that, that it is going to work, it is not. We are going \nto finish this farm bill. We should finish it this week. I believe we \ncan finish it this week. As long as we expedite the amendments, with a \nreasonable time for debate, I see no reason why we can't.\n  I have a letter sent to Senators Daschle and Lott, and they sent a \ncopy to me, and probably to Senator Lugar, too. It is from a whole list \nof farm groups. I don't know how many, maybe 30 or more of them. They \nsaid:\n\n       We believe it is vitally important this legislation be \n     enacted this year to provide an important economic stimulus \n     to rural America before Congress adjourns.\n\n  This was sent on the 10th. They said:\n\n       We fully understand that policy differences exist regarding \n     this important legislation \n\n[[Page S13035]]\n\nand would encourage a healthy debate on these issues. However, we are \nvery concerned that the timeframe to pass this legislation is rapidly \ndrawing to a close. We believe this will require the Senate to complete \na thorough debate and achieve passage of the legislation by Wednesday \nevening, December 12.\n\n  That is tonight, and we are not there yet. They say:\n\n       We urge you to allow Members an opportunity to offer \n     amendments that are relevant to the development of sound \n     agricultural policy while opposing any amendments designed to \n     delay passage of this important legislation by running out \n     the clock prior to the adjournment of Congress.\n\n  I can say to the signers of this letter that thus far all of the \namendments have been relevant, they have been germane, they have been \nmeaningful amendments, and we have had good debate. I hope we can \ncontinue on in that spirit and not cut off anybody, but I hope we can \nhave reasonable limits on time. We will be here, and we will finish \nthis bill before we leave this week.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                December 10, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Daschle and Lott: The undersigned farm, \n     commodity and lender organizations write to thank you for \n     your efforts to expedite the debate and consideration of a \n     new farm bill in the United States Senate, and to urge that \n     the legislation be completed in a timely manner without \n     delay. We believe it is vitally important that this \n     legislation be enacted this year to provide an important \n     economic stimulus to rural America before Congress adjourns.\n       We fully understand that policy differences exist regarding \n     this important legislation, and would encourage a healthy \n     debate on these issues. However, we are very concerned that \n     the timeframe to pass this legislation is rapidly drawing to \n     a close. We believe this will require the Senate to complete \n     a thorough debate and achieve passage of the legislation by \n     Wednesday evening, December 12.\n       We urge you to allow members an opportunity to offer \n     amendments that are relevant to the development of sound \n     agricultural policy while opposing an amendments designed to \n     delay passage of this important legislation by running out \n     the clock prior to the adjournment of Congress.\n       New farm legislation must be enacted this year to stimulate \n     and stabilize our rural economy that has been in a economic \n     downturn for five years with no turn-around in sight. Unlike \n     many sectors of the economy, production agriculture did not \n     share in the economic growth of the last decade and has been \n     devastated by depressed commodity prices, declining market \n     opportunities and increasing costs.\n       It is critical to producers, farm lenders and rural \n     communities that a new farm bill be approved this fall to \n     provide the assurance necessary to plan for next year's crop \n     production.\n       We encourage you and your colleagues in the Senate to \n     complete action on a new farm bill as soon as possible to \n     provide adequate time for a conference with the House of \n     Representatives in order to ensure a final bill can be \n     enacted this year.\n           Sincerely,\n       Agricultural Retailers Association.\n       Alabama Farmers Federation.\n       American Association of Crop Insurers.\n       American Bankers Association.\n       American Corn Growers Association.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American Sheep Industry Association.\n       American Soybean Association.\n       American Sugar Alliance.\n       CoBank.\n       Farm Credit Council.\n       Independent Community Bankers Association.\n       National Association of Farmer Elected Committees.\n       National Association of Wheat Growers.\n       National Barley Growers Association.\n       National Cooperative Business Association.\n       National Corn Growers Association.\n       National Cotton Council.\n       National Farmers Organization.\n       National Farmers Union.\n       National Grain Sorghum Producers.\n       National Mild Producers Federation.\n       National Sunflower Association.\n       South East Dairy Farmers Association.\n       Southern Peanut Farmers Federation.\n       The American Beekeeping Federation.\n       US Canola Association.\n       US Dry Pea and Lentil Council.\n       US Rice Producers Association.\n       United Egg Producers.\n       Western Peanut Growers Association.\n       Western Unite Dairymen.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wonder if there is an expectation of \nhaving a recorded vote on the Bond amendment this evening and what time \nthat might be expected. I do not know what the amendment is, but is it \nexpected there will be a recorded vote required on the Bond amendment?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I have not inquired of the Senator as to whether he wishes \nto have a recorded vote. That would be his privilege and I would \nsupport that. I do not know the degree of controversy that will attend \nhis amendment or how many Senators wish to speak on it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. At this point, the Senator does not know if we will have \nrecorded votes this evening or when?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I cannot respond to the Senator on that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator from North Dakota, I hope we have \nvotes this evening. We have to finish this bill. We are here. Let's get \nthe job done. I do not want to be here in the evening any more than \nanyone else. We have spent all day on this bill, and we have had two \nvotes today--three votes. We need more than that. I see no reason why \nwe cannot have a couple more votes before we go home.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I share that view, and I encourage us to \nmove along. I understand Senator Bond is here to offer an amendment. \nThe quicker we move through these amendments, the better it is for \nAmerican farmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, the staff has advised me they are working \non getting a time agreement which would lead to a vote on this measure \ntomorrow. I will be proposing an amendment that has a number of \nbipartisan cosponsors. I think the cosponsors will want to speak on it. \nI imagine there will be others who wish to speak in opposition. Since \nthis will be of some import, I hope we can work out an agreement on \nboth sides for effective consideration of this amendment.\n  Let me describe my amendment so people will get a flavor of what we \nare talking about in order to come to an agreement on the time and \nperhaps others may want to speak on it. I hope they will because I \nthink it is a very significant amendment.\n  The purpose of the amendment I wish to propose is to provide some \nprotection to farmers. The farm bill is designed to preserve and \npromote the agricultural base of this country and provide a safe, \nabundant, and affordable food supply for our people. Farmers continue \nto do more with less than any other sector of this economy and remain \nthe backbone of our economy providing our Nation and a large part of \nthe world with an inexpensive and safe source of food and fiber.\n  There are many ways to help farmers. One is to send them financial \nassistance. Another is to help provide know-how through research and to \nhelp open foreign markets, and they are all very important. I support \nthe efforts that are being made to provide that assistance to farmers, \nbut another way to help farmers is for Government not to hurt them, the \nabsence of pain. This is important.\n  However important or well intentioned Government seems to be, one of \nthe problems facing those in agriculture is the demands placed upon \nfarmers by various agencies of the Federal Government through the \nregulatory process. I have farmers in my State who tell me they spend \nmore time preparing for public hearings than they spend on their \ncombines. Some of the regulatory requirements and new rules clearly are \nnecessary and justified, but for those who may not meet the test, it is \ncritical that we provide the Department of Agriculture, specifically \nthe Secretary, with tools to represent the interests of farm families \nwhen conflicts arise.\n  We need to empower the USDA Secretary to have a stronger voice when \nshe represents the needs of farmers in interagency matters.\n  The bipartisan amendment I will offer is cosponsored by Senators \nGrassley, Enzi, Hagel, and Miller. It is supported by the American Farm \nBureau Federation, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the \nNational Corn Growers Association, the National Association of Wheat \nGrowers, the National Cotton Council, and the Southern Peanut Farmers \nFederation.\n  I also have a letter in which the Missouri organizations support the \namendment, including many of the significant entities in Missouri.\n\n[[Page S13036]]\n\n  The amendment simply authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to \nreview proposed Federal agency actions affecting agricultural producers \nto determine if an agency action is likely to have a significant \nadverse economic impact or to jeopardize the personal safety of \nagricultural producers.\n  Should the Secretary find that an agency action would jeopardize the \nsafety or the economic health of agricultural producers, i.e., farmers, \nit authorizes the Secretary to consult with the agency head and to \nidentify for the agency alternatives that are least likely to harm \nfarmers.\n  It makes sense that the agency serving agriculture looks at other \nregulations which may have a significant impact on farmers and say: \nThis is going to cause a real problem. Can we not achieve the \nobjectives of your regulation? Can we not carry out your purposes \nwithout having such a harmful impact on agriculture?\n\n  If the USDA and the Secretary cannot come to an agreement with the \nother agency proposing the regulatory action and the agency decides, \ndespite the USDA's best efforts to push forward with a final action \nthat will have a significant adverse economic impact on or jeopardize \nthe personal safety of agricultural producers, then the Secretary can \nelevate the decision to the White House, and the President is \nauthorized under limited circumstances to reverse or amend the agency \naction if doing so is necessary to protect farmers and if it is in the \npublic interest.\n  Under this amendment, the President would not be authorized to do so \nif the agency action is necessary to protect human health, safety, or \nnational security. The President would have to consider the public \nrecord, the purpose of the agency action and competing economic \ninterests, if any.\n  Finally, the legislation provides that a Presidential action taken \npursuant to this authority could be subjected to expedited \ncongressional review. In other words, the Secretary of Agriculture \ntries to work out an agreement with the agency. If the agency says, no, \nwe are not going to make any changes, we are not going to work with \nyou, then the Secretary has an option. The Secretary can take it to the \nPresident. The President says to the agency proposing to take this \naction: Stop, you are not going to do it. At that point, Congress, by \nexpedited action procedures we have already approved in other laws, can \nvote to overturn that Presidential action. So Congress has a role in \nthis regulatory procedure that would not be subjected to filibuster.\n  In short, this proposal is designed to give farmers through their \nadvocates and USDA a limited but considerable voice in agency actions \nthat impact them directly.\n  In offering this amendment, it is my intention to provide additional \ndiscretion to the President to solve disputes between agencies when \nmandates may be in conflict and they are unable to come to terms and \ndiscretion would better serve the public than gridlock, legal action, \nor other delaying actions or unnecessary confusion. With discretion \ncomes responsibility and accountability. I believe very strongly it is \nin the public interest to have political accountability and to limit \nthe circumstances where the elected officials who are accountable to \nthe citizens are not hiding behind bureaucrats when controversial \nissues arise.\n  Too many times we have had people say: That agency has sole \ndiscretion. Somebody in an agency, never elected by the people, not \nwith any visibility or public accountability, makes a decision with a \nserious impact on agriculture. Then the Secretary of Agriculture can \nraise it to the highest elected official in the land and say: You look \nat it, Mr. President. If you agree that it is an unwarranted \noverreaching action that has an economic impact or health and safety \nimpact on farmers, then the President can act. But we in Congress \ncould, if we wished, overturn that action of the President. So Congress \nhas a built-in protection against an overreaching Presidential action. \nWe are bringing questions with major impact on the agricultural sector \nup to the level of public discourse by people elected by the American \nelectorate.\n  This amendment, I believe, is an excellent opportunity to prompt USDA \nto play a more active and visible role fighting on behalf of farmers. \nFrankly, I have always thought they should take a more active role. \nThey have not always done so, much to the disappointment of the farm \ncommunity, which is supposed to be served by them and much to the \ndistress of those who support farmers.\n  Further, this amendment should help make other agencies more \nresponsive to USDA when USDA raises concerns on behalf of farmers.\n  We are debating farm legislation because we care deeply about our \nagricultural base. We care deeply about the economic and social value \nof farm families. We want to protect our food security and thus, by \nextension, our national security. While we can help many farmers with \n$170 billion in spending, we want USDA to be better able to take the \nsimple role of standing up for farmers if another agency that may know \nlittle, if anything, about food production is taking action that will \nharm farmers economically or physically. The Government can help \nfarmers by providing economic assistance. But the Government can also \nhelp by trying not to hurt them. That is what this amendment is all \nabout.\n  We are rightly concerned in this country if an ant is endangered or \nany other species, but we should also be concerned if a farm community \nis threatened or endangered. I believe we should give farmers an extra \nmeasure of leverage at the table if it is their personal livelihoods or \ntheir personal safety which is jeopardized. This limited, and I believe \nmeasured, amendment is designed to do just that. What we are doing is \nstrengthening laws that protect farm families.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to consider this amendment very \ncarefully, to provide their support, and to send a message to farmers \nthat we believe farmers are worthy of protection; we want the \nGovernment to make every sensible attempt to act as advocates for \nfarmers. We believe USDA should be active and visible, fighting for \nfarmers, and we believe the President and the Congress are capable of \nand can be trusted to weigh the public interest.\n  This says to the administration that farmers don't always have to be \nat the very bottom of the food chain. Frankly, they start the food \nchain and they should be treated as part of that food chain.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two letters of \nsupport, one from various national organizations dated December 7, and \none dated December 10 from Missouri organizations.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: We are writing to urge your support for \n     the Bond amendment providing authority to the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to review proposed federal agency actions that \n     may have a significant adverse economic impact or jeopardize \n     personal safety of farmers and ranchers.\n       These are very difficult times for agricultural procedures. \n     The cost and burden of regulation on agriculture has grown \n     exponentially over time and it is an important factor in \n     their struggle to remain competitive, both domestically and \n     internationally. We strongly support the Bond amendment and \n     believe that it will result in government policy being \n     implemented in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. We \n     appreciate your concern for the well being of farmers and \n     ranchers and urge your support of this amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     American Farm Bureau Federation.\n     National Association of Wheat Growers.\n     National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n     National Corn Growers Association.\n     National Cotton Council.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                December 10, 2001.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: We applaud your ongoing efforts to \n     reduce the regulatory burden facing our nation's farmers and \n     ranchers. It is entirely appropriate that the farm bill \n     include language that will stifle the regulatory onslaught \n     brought upon by bureaucrats who know little about modern \n     agricultural practices.\n       Today, farmers and ranchers have enough to worry about--\n     commodity prices are pitiful and input prices more volatile \n     than ever. Our members are being told they must be more \n     competitive if they are to succeed in an\n\n[[Page S13037]]\n\n     increasingly global trade environment. But unfortunately, our \n     nation's agricultural producers today find themselves \n     fighting the federal government on issues such as water \n     quality and quantity, access to crop and livestock protection \n     tools, and appropriate nutrient management.\n       We believe your amendment will add much needed commonsense \n     to the regulatory process. Additional review of regulations \n     by the Secretary of Agriculture, consultation with other \n     agency heads, and the authority for Presidential intervention \n     are dramatic improvements over current law.\n       We strongly support your amendment and urge other Senators \n     to support its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n         Missouri Farm Bureau; Missouri Corn Growers Association; \n           Missouri Pork Producers Association; Coalition to \n           Protect the Missouri River; Missouri Cattlemen's \n           Association; Missouri Soybean Association; MFA, Inc.; \n           Missouri Dairy Association; The Poultry Federation.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we have made some progress today on the \nbill. I appreciate the cooperation of many of our colleagues. I know \nthere is an amendment pending.\n  The distinguished Senator from Indiana has indicated other amendments \ncould be offered tonight. I notify our colleagues we do not anticipate \nany other rollcall votes tonight. I hope some might still be prepared \nto offer amendments. We could stack the votes for tomorrow morning. We \nwould like to keep going for awhile yet tonight. But in the interests \nof accommodating Senators with conflicting schedules, we will preclude \nthe need for any additional rollcalls tonight. We will have those votes \ntomorrow should they be required.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2511 to Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for himself \n     and Mr. Lugar, proposes an amendment numbered 2511 to \n     amendment No. 2471.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish within \n the Department of Agriculture the position of Assistant Secretary of \n                     Agriculture for Civil Rights)\n\n       Strike the period at the end of section 1021 and insert a \n     period and the following:\n\n     SEC. 1022.

Madam President, minority farmers have worked America's \nsoil throughout our history. And while these farmers have done so much \nto advance American agriculture, they have experienced intense and \noften institutionalized discrimination in the process.\n  From the broken promise of ``40 acres and a mule'' during \nReconstruction, to the discrimination inherent in many of the New Deal \nagriculture programs, to the first and second great migrations--during \nwhich so many left the land, never to return--the history of minority \nfarmers in America has often been a history of hardship and struggle.\n  Our Nation has seen the result of that hardship in the dwindling \nnumber of minority farmers, and the dwindling acreage of minority \nfarms.\n  In 1920, blacks owned 14 percent of our nation's farms. Today there \nare only 18,000 black farmers, representing less than 1 percent of all \nfarms.\n  Hispanics--who make up such a large share of farm labor--account for \na mere 1\\1/2\\ percent of all farm operators. For Native Americans, that \nnumber is half of 1 percent.\n  Perhaps most saddening is that the United States Department of \nAgriculture--the agency which was founded by Abraham Lincoln to be \n``the people's Department'' has often been part of the problem.\n  A 1982 report issued by the Civil Rights Commission stated that the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture was ``a catalyst in the decline \nof the black farmer.'' Statistics from that time show that only \nAfrican-Americans received only 1 percent of all farm ownership loans.\n  A lawsuit filed in 1997 by more than 1,000 black farmers resulted in \na historic settlement in which the government acknowledged significant \ncivil right abuses against black farmers.\n  It is not enough to recognize and remedy past failings. We need to \nwork to ensure that the USDA serves all of its customers fairly in the \nfuture.\n  That is why Senator Lugar and I are proposing that we establish an \nAssistant Secretary of Agriculture for Civil Rights.\n  The Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Civil Rights would be \nresponsible for compliance and enforcement of all civil rights laws \nwithin the USDA, including the compilation and disclosure of \ninformation regarding minority, limited resource, and women farmers and \nranchers. He or she would set target participation rates for \nminorities, and make sure that other agency heads and senior executives \nwill enforce for civil rights laws.\n  Last week, I received a letter in support of this amendment from the \nchairs of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus, and the\n\n[[Page S13038]]\n\nCongressional Asian Pacific Americans Caucus.\n  If they can speak with one voice in supporting this amendment, it is \nmy hope that we can speak with one voice in passing it.\n  A while ago, PBS aired a film entitled ``Homecoming.'' It is a \nchronicle of black farmers from the Civil War to today. In it, a farmer \nnamed Lynmore James is interviewed.\n  I think his words guide our consideration of this amendment:\n\n       There's no question in my mind that a lot of land has been \n     lost, and it was lost because of discrimination. But I don't \n     think we need to just close the books on it. I think that \n     where people have been wronged, it should be righted.\n\n  The most lasting way to truly see those wrongs made right is to \nensure that they are never repeated.\n  That is exactly what an Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Civil \nRights would do, and that is why I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of an \namendment that I think is truly important. The majority leader \ncertainly outlined the basic reasons for it. But let me illuminate \nfurther.\n  From hearings we had before the Agriculture Committee in recent years \nduring the period of time when I was privileged to serve as chairman, \nin each of those years we asked for reports from those responsible in \nUSDA on progress in the area of civil rights disputes. There were so \nmany. They were so complex and pervasive, and the backlog always seemed \nto be unusually and uncomfortably large.\n  Just last year we had an extensive hearing, and this came because the \nSecretary of Agriculture, then Dan Glickman, our former colleague from \nthe House who had become the Secretary, had taken a great interest in \nthis issue as a Member of the House and likewise in his new capacity. \nHe recommended, after following the lead of the Civil Rights Action \nTeam of the Department of Agriculture, that the head of civil rights \nbecome an Assistant Secretary. I think this is an appropriate time, in \nthe farm bill, as we project agriculture and its governance for the \ncoming years.\n  I would simply say that the reasons for civil rights problems at the \nDepartment of Agriculture appear legion, but they are not simply \nproblems of committees in the field, often a point of dispute in the \npast, but frequently allegations of discrimination in the \nadministration of the Department itself, which is something that is \nhere in Washington--or at least very much under the control of those \nwho administer the Department.\n  Whatever the reason--and certainly some will say this is precedent \nfor the appointment of a similar Assistant Secretary ad seriatim in \nCabinet after Cabinet post--and I appreciate that argument that has \nbeen offered from time to time--this is, I believe, a fortunately \nunique situation. Despite the best observation in a bipartisan way in \nour committee, and even with the cooperation of the Secretary of \nAgriculture, we have not overcome.\n  So I am pleased the distinguished majority leader has taken this \ninitiative. I was immediately pleased that he asked me to be involved \nwith this effort, which I am delighted to do. I think this is a \nconstructive amendment, and I am hopeful it will find the approval of \nour colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I thank the distinguished senior \nSenator from Indiana for his eloquence and for his willingness to be \nsupportive of this amendment. It is always a pleasure to work with him. \nCertainly in this case it is, again, a matter of import. I appreciate \nvery much his willingness to be involved.\n  I hope by the next time we pass a farm bill the numbers and the \nstatistics and reports of continued erosion of minority involvement in \nagriculture can be turned around. As the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana has noted, this has not been necessarily by design. I think in \nlarge measure it has happened for reasons beyond the control of any one \nindividual or any particular division of the Department of Agriculture. \nBut we can do better. It is our hope that by putting somebody in charge \nwe will do better.\n  It is our expectation that by the time we do another farm bill we can \nlook back with some satisfaction that we indeed have done better and \nresponded in a way that would make us far more satisfied about the \nprogress that I believe we can make in this area.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2512 To Amendment No. 2511\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2512 to amendment No. 2511.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n           (Purpose: To add provisions regarding nominations)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that, before Congress creates \n     new positions that require the advice and consent of the \n     Senate, such as the position of Assistant Secretary for Civil \n     Rights of the Department of Agriculture, the Senate should \n     vote on nominations that have been reported by committees and \n     are currently awaiting action by the full Senate, such as the \n     nomination of Eugene Scalia to be Solicitor of the Department \n     of Labor.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the second-degree \namendment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsecond-degree amendment and the Daschle amendment be set aside to \naccommodate an amendment to be offered by the Senator from Missouri, \nMr. Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, reserving the right to object, might I \ninquire of the majority leader when he would want to bring this back up \nfor the purpose of debate?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Certainly we can bring it up at some point tomorrow. As \nI understand it, Senator Bond was hoping to have at least an hour on \nthe amendment to be offered tonight. It would be my expectation that \nsometime tomorrow we would return to this issue.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, recognizing that the set-aside would not \nin any way infringe upon the right of myself as a person who offered \nthe second degree, and certainly the majority leader offered the first \ndegree, I do not object.\n\n\n                      Amendment Withdrawn No. 2511\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, to make things simpler, I withdraw my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I would like to inquire of the Senator \nfrom Missouri, as I understand it, the Senator wants an hour and a half \non his amendment. Could we use some of that time tonight so that in the \nmorning we could perhaps have some time?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if my friend will yield, I spoke to \nSenator Bond. He indicated he would like to speak tonight. He has four \nor five people who wish to speak tomorrow. He indicated he would be \nwilling to accept 1\\1/2\\ hours equally divided in the morning. He would \nwant his time tonight to count against the 90 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, there are a number of cosponsors who wish \nto\n\n[[Page S13039]]\n\nspeak in support of this amendment. My thought is maybe not everybody \nin this body will support it. By tomorrow morning, I think there may be \nothers who will wish to present opposing ideas. It would be my desire \nafter my cosponsors speak on it, if there is no opposition, that we \ncould yield back some of that time. I simply asked for 90 minutes \ntomorrow in case there are other people who want to weigh in. I expect \nthere will be more than the number who have registered as cosponsors.\n  I think this has a significant impact on the entire agricultural \ncommunity across the country. I would like to have the possibility of \nusing the 90 minutes in the light of day so people understand all sides \nof this issue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, will the Senator yield for the purpose \nof a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BOND. Certainly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I appreciate very much the Senator from \nMissouri yielding for that purpose.\n  I was going to inform my colleagues that we have already noted there \nwill be filing of cloture tonight. I know there are Senators who are \nasking about Friday and Monday. I am not going to propound the \nunanimous consent request because I don't think it has been properly \nvented on each side. I suggest that perhaps we could have cloture \ntomorrow and that we would be prepared to forego votes on Friday and \nMonday and still take into account the need to consider the so-called \nCochran-Roberts amendment regardless of cloture.\n  My thought is that we file cloture and vote on cloture and have \nconsideration of the Cochran-Roberts amendment with some expectation of \na vote at a later time on that. Whether or not that could be \naccomplished is still in question. But that is something that I \nsuggest. I notify our colleagues that will be a possibility: File \ncloture tonight, have a vote on that either tomorrow or Friday. If we \nhave it tomorrow, we could still bring up the so-called Cochran-Roberts \namendment for consideration.\n  I thank my colleague. I thank the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. As I understand the majority leader, cloture will be filed \ntonight, and, if we have a vote on that tomorrow, we will not be in \nsession on Friday--at least no votes on Friday or Monday.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I draw the distinction. We will certainly be in session \non Friday. My hope is we could bring up a conference report, and maybe \na conference report on education on Monday, but not have any votes.\n  That, again, will be up to all of our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. We have not hot-lined it. I just wanted to make that proposal \nand see what kind of reaction we would get. That would be the proposal, \nand I will have more to say about that at a later time.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, we had discussed a 90-minute time \nagreement on this amendment.\n  First, what is the pending business so we may be sure the amendment \nis to the appropriate measure?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Daschle substitute \namendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Amendment number 2471?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for a \nunanimous consent request which I think he thought I was going to make \nthe first time, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of S. 1731 at 9:30 on Thursday, December 13, there be 90 \nminutes for debate prior to vote in relation to the Bond amendment with \nthe time equally divided and controlled in the usual form with no \nintervening amendment in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2513 to Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senator Grassley, Senator Enzi, Senator Hagel, and \nSenator Miller, and I ask that it be considered pursuant to the time \nagreement just entered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Miller, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2511 to amendment No. 2471.\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n\n[[Page S13040]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Daschle for \n     Harkin substitute amendment No. 2471 for Calendar No. 237, S. \n     1731, the farm bill:\n         Tim Johnson, Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Thomas R. Carper, \n           Zell Miller, Max Baucus, Bryon L. Dorgan, Ben Nelson, \n           Daniel K. Inouye, Tom Harkin, Kent Conrad, Mark Dayton, \n           Deborah Stabenow, Richard J. Durbin, James M. Jeffords, \n           Thomas A. Daschle, Blanche Lincoln.\n\n                       Country of origin labeling\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, it has been brought to my attention \nthat there are unique concerns about how perishable agricultural \ncommodities are labeled under the country of origin labeling provision \nin the farm bill. Unlike meat products that are oftentimes either \nwrapped or displayed behind glass, shoppers physically handle produce \nto evaluate such characteristics as size or ripeness. Quite honestly, \nafter being handled by a consumer, a fruit or vegetable item is not \nalways returned to the original bin in which the product was displayed. \nFor this reason, each individual produce item may need to be labeled \nwhen physically possible to ensure accuracy about the country of origin \ninformation.\n  I am confident the method of notification language in the labeling \nprovision in the farm bill will ensure responsibility in information-\nsharing on the part of processors, retailers, and others under this \nact. Our language requires any person that prepares, stores, handles, \nor distributes a covered commodity for retail sale to maintain records \nabout the origin of such products and to provide information regarding \nthe country of origin to retailers. Nonetheless, I understand retailers \nhave some concerns about making sure they are provided with accurate \ninformation. Therefore, so that we can be confident this is workable \nfor retailers and others, I would like to recommend to my lead \ncosponsor of this legislation, Senator Graham of Florida, that we \nconsult with the growers, packers and retailers to develop a means to \nprovide such labels or labeling information to the grocery stores.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota. \nSenator Johnson, I appreciate your comments.\n  My primary objective in pursuing country-of-origin legislation is to \nprovide consumers with accurate information about where their produce \nis grown. My home State of Florida has required mandatory country-of-\norigin labeling of fresh fruits and vegetables for over 20 years, and \nFlorida consumers have made it known that they appreciate the \navailability of this information.\n  Many domestic products are already labeled for promotion purposes. \nOur proudly labeled ``Florida Oranges'' are a great example of a \nsuccessful marketing tool. There are any number of ways to label \nproduce, including price-look-up stickers, plastic attachments, paper \nwrapping, signs next to barrels of produce. Produce items are \nincreasingly being branded as another method of labeling. In \nrecognition of this fact, the labeling provision included in Senator \nHarkin's farm bill provides the flexibility to label items by any \nvisible and practical means.\n  That said, I understand retailers would prefer to receive their \nproduce shipments with country-of-origin labels already affixed to each \npiece of produce. To some degree, growers and packers are already \nlabeling their products, and retails are not required to provide \nfurther information if this in the case.\n  Regarding those products that do not arrive at the grocery store \nalready labeled, I encourage growers and shippers to continue to do \nthis and to work with retailers to find the most efficient methods to \nprovide accurate country-of-origin information and labeling.\n  I agree with the Senator from South Dakota that we should continue \ndiscussion with the industries impacted by this amendment, and I look \nforward to helping everyone identify the best methods to implement \nlabeling legislation and ensure that consumers have ready access to \ncountry-of-origin information.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today, along with my \ndistinguished colleagues Senator Murray from Washington State and \nSenator Inouye from Hawaii in support of two amendments to the \nAgriculture, Conservation, and Rural Enhancement Act of 2001 to promote \ncooperation between Indian tribes and the United States Forest Service \nin the management of forest lands.\n  This legislation would amend the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act \nof 1978 to establish an Office of Tribal Relations and other \ncooperative programs within the Forest Service to better provide for \nthe joint efforts of the Forest Service and Indian tribes. If the \npurpose of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act is to improve the \nmanagement, resource production, and environmental protection of \nnonfederal forest lands, then the 17 million acres of land held by \nIndian tribes and individual Indians should be included as a component \nof this law to facilitate cooperative management of our forests.\n  Tribes have a significant role to play towards our national goal of \nensuring that forests are managed as both sustainable resources and \nenduring habitats. Again, tribes or tribal members are responsible for \nthe management of approximately 17 million acres of forest land, which \nis eligible for about 750 million board feet of sustainable annual \nharvest. Much of this land shares borders with Forest Service land, and \ntribes also possess treaty rights within Forest Service land. The \nForest Service and tribes are linked not only by common interest but \nalso by a very practical need to work together.\n  Currently tribes may participate in the Forestry Incentives and \nForest Stewardship programs under sections 4 through 6 of the \nCooperative Forestry Assistance Act. These programs provide assistance \nto private landowners in order to keep their forest land healthy and \nviable. However, the programs are designed for cooperation with State \ngovernments and do not appropriately take into account the government-\nto-government and trust relationships that tribes have with the Federal \nGovernment. Also, there is general lack of understanding among tribes \nand Forest Service personnel regarding how the existing cooperative \nassistance programs would extend to individual Indians with land held \nin trust. As a result, tribes and individual American Indian and Native \nAlaskan landowners seldom participate in the programs.\n  In October 1999, the Chief of the Forest Service established a \nNational Tribal Relations Task Force to study tribal involvement in the \nmanagement of both Forest Service and Indian-held lands. The Task Force \nincluded representatives from the Forest Service, the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, BIA, and the Intertribal Timber Council. The Task Force found \nthat, indeed, cooperative forestry programs that specifically work with \ntribal communities are greatly in need in order to establish equity in \nforestry assistance and to fulfill stewardship responsibilities towards \nthe management of forestry lands held in trust.\n  This legislation responds to the need to improve tribal-Forest \nService coordination by allowing the Secretary of the Department of \nAgriculture to provide financial, technical, and educational assistance \nfor coordination on shared land, land under the jurisdiction of Indian \ntribes, and Forest Service land to which tribes may have interests and \nrights.\n  The Task Force similarly found, and I quote directly from the report, \nthat ``the current Forest Service tribal relations program lacks the \ninfrastructure and support necessary to ensure high quality \ninteractions across programs with Indian Tribes on a government-to-\ngovernment basis.'' My colleagues and I would like to improve the \nForest Service's ability to interact effectively with tribes by adding \nan Office of Tribal Relations within the Forest Service to be headed by \na Director appointed by the Chief of the Forest Service.\n  This office will be responsible for the oversight of all programs and \npolicies relating to tribes. This legislation outlines that it would be \nthe duty of the Office of Tribal Relations to consult with tribal \ngovernments, monitor and evaluate the relations between tribal \ngovernments and the Forest Service, and coordinate matters affecting \ntribes\n\n[[Page S13041]]\n\nin a way that is comprehensive and responsive to tribal needs. This \noffice will also cooperate with the other agencies of the Department of \nAgriculture, the Department of Interior, and the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  It is important that the Forest Service be able to effectively work \nwith tribal communities. At this point, we know from the Forest \nService, the BIA, and the Intertribal Timber Council that the Forest \nService lacks the programmatic structure to be able to accommodate and \neffectively work with tribes and those holding trust lands due to their \nunique legal and organizational status. As an arm of the Federal \nGovernment, the Forest Service must uphold the trust responsibilities \nwe have towards tribes. I believe that we have a duty, to tribes and to \nour forests, to respond to tribes' expressed desire for assistance with \nforest resource planning, management, and conservation with this \nlegislation. I would like to thank Senator Daschle, Senator Baucus, and \nSenator Wellstone for their support, and I urge the rest of my \ncolleagues to support these amendments as well.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to engage the \nmajority leader in a colloquy. As the majority leader knows, I have \nbeen working for nearly two years on legislation to deal with the \nnumerous problems associated with the gasoline additive MTBE. The use \nof MTBE as a fuel additive grew tremendously starting with the Clean \nAir Act's reformulated gasoline program that was implemented in 1995. \nToday, MTBE makes up approximately 3 percent of the total national fuel \nmarket.\n  Unfortunately, when leaked or spilled into the environment, MTBE can \ncause serious drinking water quality problems. MTBE moves quickly \nthrough land and water without breaking down. Small amounts of MTBE can \nrender water supplies undrinkable.\n  This contamination is persistent throughout the nation, and New \nHampshire is certainly a State that has been hard hit. According to \nState officials, up to 40,000 private wells may be contaminated with \nMTBE. Up to 8,000 of those wells may have MTBE contamination over the \nState health standards. Areas especially hard hit include both rural \nand urban areas. In the past few years I have visited, as well as \nreceived many calls and letters from, a number of the families whose \nwells are contaminated and they are extremely frustrated. When I was \nthe chairman of the Environment & Public Works Committee, I held a \nfield hearing in Salem, NH on this issue. Last Congress, I introduced \nlegislation to clean up this contamination and ban the further use of \nMTBE. The bill was reported out of the EPW Committee, however, \ncircumstances prevented the full Senate from considering that bill. \nAgain this year, I introduced MTBE legislation, and once again the EPW \nCommittee reported it out with a strong bipartisan vote. S. 950 will \nprovide for the clean up of MTBE contamination, ban the additive, and \nensure that environmental benefits of the clean gasoline program will \nbe maintained. This is a hardship in many communities, and it will \ncontinue to escalate unless it is dealt with soon. No American should \nhave to be concerned with the water they drink.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes, I do understand the problems associated with MTBE \nand I recognize your hard work in helping to bring about a resolution \nto this important issue. I also share the concerns of the Assistant \nMajority Leader, co-sponsor of S. 950, with regards to the devastating \ncontamination found in communities surrounding Lake Tahoe, NV.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Because this is such a vital issue to New \nHampshire and the nation, it is my intention to do all within my power \nto see that the Senate acts on this matter. I appreciate all of the \nefforts of the majority leader to work with me in bringing this bill to \nthe floor and would hope that the Senate will consider S. 950 in the \nnear future. Will the majority leader provide me an assurance that this \nwill happen?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I agree that the Senate should vote on MTBE legislation \nin the near future and have included S. 950 in the comprehensive energy \nbill that I introduced with Senator Bingaman last week. I can assure \nthe Senator from New Hampshire that it is my intention to bring up for \ndebate and votes before the full Senate that energy bill, including S. \n950, prior to the President's Day recess in February 2002.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/12/senate-section/article/S13041-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13041-S13042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT: A SIGNAL OF U.S. \n   COMMITMENT TO RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I am pleased to see that after a delay of \nseveral months, the House has acted on the Zimbabwe Democracy and \nEconomic Recovery Act of 2001, of which I am a co-sponsor, and that we \ncan finally send this bill to the President for his signature.\n  The Foreign Relations committee reported this bill in July, and it \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent on August 1. Since then, the \nsituation in Zimbabwe has deteriorated rapidly. Respect for human \nrights and the rule of law have been systematically subverted by \nZimbabwe's ruling party, and indeed by President Robert Mugabe himself. \nPresident Mugabe has supported the invasion of farms by so called ``war \nveterans,'' he has intimated judges, harassed the free press, forbidden \ninternational monitors to observe next year's presidential elections \nand packed the supreme court with cronies in a misguided attempt to \ngive his actions a patina of legitimacy.\n  Under Mugabe's leadership the economy of Zimbabwe has been driven \ninto the ground. The deployment of troops to the Democratic Republic of \nCongo was an expensive ill thought fiasco which has cost millions. The \nillegal farm invasions have resulted in the loss of income from the \ncountry's major cash crop. Unsound fiscal policies have resulted in a \nsuspension of aid from the international Monetary Fund, inflation is \nsoaring, international investment has dried up and unemployment is on \nthe rise.\n  The World Food Program has had to start a food distribution program \nin a country that should be exporting food to its neighbors. That in \nitself is bad enough. Worse, however, is the fact that the Zimbabwean \ngovernment has stated that private relief agencies are prohibited from \ndelivering food to the needy. Only the government can distribute food. \nGiven the current political climate this can mean only one thing: the \ngovernment will attempt to coopt the population by giving food in \nexchange for votes in the upcoming presidential elections.\n  The bill itself is very straightforward. It offers money for a \ncredible program of land reform, and plans for U.S. support for bi-\nlateral and multi-lateral debt relief if the President certifies to \nCongress that rule of law has been restored in Zimbabwe, including \nsubordination of law enforcement organizations to the civilian \ngovernment, that conditions for free and fair elections exist, that a \ncredible program of land reform has been put in place, and that the \ngovernment of Zimbabwe is adhering to agreements to withdraw its troops \nfrom the Democratic Republic of Congo. No new sanctions are imposed on \nthe government, but the legislation does very wisely ask the \nadministration to look into personal sanctions for high level members \nof the Zimbabwean government and their families, such as travel bans \nand visa restrictions.\n  The actions undertaken in the last two years by Robert Mugabe can be\n\n[[Page S13042]]\n\ncharacterized as nothing more, or less, than a shameless power grab. \nAccording to news reports current polls show that the leading \nopposition party has more support than Mugabe. No doubt this will cause \nan even more heinous crackdown on political opponents in the lead up to \nthe elections. While I sincerely hope that Mugabe comes to his senses \nand allows for the presence of international observers during the \nupcoming presidential elections, I doubt that he will. Perhaps passage \nof this bill will send a signal to the government of Zimbabwe that the \nUnited States is serious about its position on the rule of law, human \nrights and democracy. The tragedy that has unfolded in what was once a \nstable prosperous country must not be ignored.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/12/senate-section/article/S13042-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTRODUCING ADOLFO FRANCO\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, last week I had the privilege of \nintroducing Adolfo Franco, the President's nominee to be Assistant \nAdministrator for Latin America at the United States Agency for \nInternational Development, to the Committee on Foreign Relations. The \nPresident has made a wise choice for this important position, and I \ncommend him for it. I also commend Mr. Franco to all of my colleagues \nas they consider their vote on his nomination, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record, my statement introducing Mr. Franco \nbefore the Committee.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Introducing Adolfo A. Franco to the Senate Committee on Foreign \n                               Relations\n\n       Adolfo Franco was born in Cardenas, Cuba. His family \n     emigrated to the United States in 1961, when he was 5 years \n     old, and settled in Cedar Falls, IA.\n       Blessed with wonderful parents and the opportunities \n     afforded him in a free society, Adolfo has led an \n     accomplished life of public service. And the good and \n     faithful service he has given our country for nearly \n     seventeen years is a splendid tribute to his own fine \n     character, to his parents, and to the great civilization that \n     welcomes the genius and industry of all Americans, whether \n     native born or newly arrived.\n       He is a graduate of the University of Northern Iowa and the \n     Creighton University School of Law. He came to Washington in \n     1984 and in 1985 began work in the General Counsel's office \n     at the Inter-American Foundation, where he served with great \n     distinction for fifteen years as Deputy General Counsel, \n     General Counsel, Senior Vice President and, finally, \n     President of the Foundation.\n       For the last two years, Adolfo has served as a Professional \n     Staff Member on the House International Relations Committee \n     where, as Chairman Hyde will attest, he has provided \n     invaluable counsel on the full range of foreign assistance \n     programs including U.S.A.I.D. programs and operations.\n       He is uniquely well-qualified for the position the \n     President has selected him for, Assistant A.I.D. \n     Administrator for Latin America. And I am very confident that \n     in that capacity, Adolfo, with his characteristic energy, \n     intelligence and patriotism, will quickly prove himself an \n     invaluable asset to A.I.D., to the President and to the \n     country he has long served so well.\n       He is an exceptional person, a devoted and talented public \n     servant of exemplary character. I commend and thank the \n     President for nominating him, and I consider it an honor to \n     introduce him to the Committee.\n       America is among his parents' greatest gifts to Adolfo, a \n     gift he has more than earned as the kind of career public \n     servant all Americans can be proud of. I recommend him to the \n     Committee with the highest praise I can offer an American: he \n     is a credit to his country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/12/senate-section/article/S13042-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CHANGES TO H.

Madam President, three months ago, we experienced an \nunprovoked attack on our country. America took a terrible hit, but we \nhave rebounded and we have reminded the world of the strength of the \nAmerican people.\n  Three months ago, one industry in particular was stricken, and it \ncontinues to struggle to regain its footing. When our government shut \ndown our airlines and our airports, it also shut down our travel and \ntourism industry.\n  Under the headline, ``Travel Downtown Spreads More Woes,'' the \nDecember 11 Wall Street Journal reminded us that the industry remains \nin dire straits. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. KYL. The article focuses on the neighborhood around Los Angeles \nAirport, but it describes a scene all too familiar to many of us:\n\n       Today, planes are once again buzzing just 300 feet above \n     the head of the people of Lennox. But something even scarier \n     has befallen them. The meltdown in the travel and tourism \n     business has claimed thousands of their jobs.\n\n  Working together, the government and industry leaders can help the \nindustry recover. By now, my colleagues no doubt have seen the \ntelevision advertisements sponsored by the Travel Industry Association \nof America. Featuring President Bush, this privately supported \nadvertising campaign encourages Americans to travel, to see our great \ncountry again, and to enjoy our many blessings. Now that the industry \nhas stepped forward, it is time for us to do our part.\n  The time has come to enact a personal travel credit to get Americans \non the road and in the air again. I am pleased that travel-credit \nlegislation has broad, bipartisan support. Now is the time to translate \nthat support into action. With the slowest travel months of the year \nabout to begin, let's give the American public an incentive to travel. \nLet's get a credit enacted quickly. Let's bring families together and \nlet's get Americans enjoying the blessings of our country again. In \nshort, let's get America traveling again.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 11, 2001]\n\n                   Travel Downturn Spreads More Woes\n\n                          (By Eduardo Porter)\n\n       Lennox, Calif.--Something strange washed over this area \n     following the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11: quiet.\n       With planes grounded across the U.S., residents of this \n     crowded community abutting Los Angeles airport weren't \n     assaulted by the sound of jet engines for the first time in \n     anybody's memory. The sudden silence was so at odds with the \n     usual deafening roar that ``kids were scared'' by it, says \n     Maria Van Deventer, assistant principal at Jefferson \n     Elementary School.\n       Today, planes are once again buzzing just 300 feet above \n     the heads of the people of Lennox. But something even scarier \n     has befallen them. The meltdown in the travel and tourism \n     business has claimed thousands of their jobs.\n       As much as any place in America, this 1.3-square-mile \n     unincorporated area of Los Angeles County has been the victim \n     of post-Sept. 11 economic fallout. Because this is \n     practically a company town, with many of its 23,000 residents \n     employed at the third busiest airport in the world and \n     related businesses, Lennox has become a ground zero of sorts \n     for the devastated travel and tourism industry.\n       The impact of the near collapse in the industry has left a \n     broad footprint. Airline industry revenue should decline 30% \n     in the fourth quarter over the year-earlier period, estimates \n     Kevin C. Murphy of Morgan Stanley, and PKF Consulting \n     estimates that room revenue at hotels in major urban centers \n     will be down 17.5%. Other travel-dependent firms, from \n     airline caterers to airport concession owners, have also been \n     hit hard.\n       There is no precise count of how many Lennox residents, who \n     are overwhelmingly\n\n[[Page S13043]]\n\n     immigrants from Mexico and Central America, have been laid \n     off in the past 2\\1/2\\ months. But job losses--more than \n     8,000 at the airport alone and thousands more at area shops, \n     hotels and other companies that depend on travel--have shot \n     through the community. Isabel Gurdian lost her job cleaning \n     planes on Sept. 12. A few weeks later Gladys Barraza was laid \n     off as a cashier at the airport's City Deli, Margarita \n     Uriostegui, who washed dishes at airline caterer Dobbs \n     International Services, was let go, too. Alfonso Martinez, a \n     barman at the New Otani hotel, got lucky. His workweek--and \n     income--were cut by only two-thirds.\n       The impact has rippled through Lennox's dusty streets. \n     Sales are down about 30% at Daisy's Party Supply on Inglewood \n     Ave., Where a pinata of Osama bin Laden dangles from the roof \n     between a huge can of Modelo beer and Winnie the Pooh. And \n     they're off about a fifth at El Taco Macho, just across the \n     border in Hawthorne, even though $9 American flags have been \n     added to an eclectic menu of tacos and seafood cocktails. \n     Business also has plummeted at Noemy's Beauty Salon, which \n     doubles as remittance outlet that wires money from local \n     residents back to relatives in Latin America. On a recent \n     Friday, shop owner Margot Noemy Canizales waited all morning \n     for customers to show. None did.\n       The pain is felt as far away as Jiquilpan, in central \n     Mexico, which has dispatched workers to Lennox for decades. \n     ``The whole town depends on money sent from here,'' says \n     Martin Orejel, a Lennox resident who has had his work hours \n     slashed as a bartender and bus-boy at a Ramada hotel not far \n     from the airport. ``Now,'' he jokes, ``we need them to send \n     money here.''\n       At the second floor offices of local 814 of the Hotel and \n     Restaurant Employees International Union, the newly laid off \n     lined up to register for unemployment benefits. But many \n     Lennox residents are illegal immigrants and can't get such \n     financial assistance. Downstairs, union volunteers handed out \n     bags of food. Life in Lennox is pretty difficult to begin \n     with. With an average of nearly five people per household, it \n     is one of the most densely populated communities in \n     California. More than 94% of the students in the local school \n     district are in a program that provides free or reduced-cost \n     lunches to poor children, one of the highest rates in the \n     state.\n       Hispanic immigrants began coming here in the late 1960's, \n     sucked into the U.S. to help sate the explosive demand for \n     low-wage service workers. Now, hit by the first wave of \n     layoffs in a decade, ``it seems like the end of the world,'' \n     laments Ms. Uriostegui, a mother of three whose husband is \n     still hanging on to a job at a tortilla shop. Most days she \n     hits the road looking for work, leaving applications \n     everywhere from a factory for stamping T-shirts to a plant \n     making refrigerator parts.\n       To cope, some people are resorting to uncomfortable \n     measures. After losing her job, Gladys Barraza, her husband \n     and two children moved into her parent's two-bedroom home, \n     also in Lennox. Rosa Saldivar is facing starker options. Her \n     husband, Martin, who lost his job at a bakery that served \n     airport restaurants, is pressuring her to take their three \n     kids back to the family home in Durango, in northern Mexico.\n       They wouldn't be the only ones to go. Ms. Van Deventer, the \n     assistant principal, says that 50 to 60 children, out of a \n     student body of about 1,100, have dropped out of Jefferson \n     Elementary since Sept. 11. Some, she says, have gone back to \n     Mexico and El Salvador, where it's cheaper to be unemployed \n     and where extended families can provide support. Others have \n     left to look for work in other American cities, including Las \n     Vegas, where it is rumored there might be jobs.\n       For those who are staying, the stress is growing. Health \n     workers and parent-group coordinators at the schools are \n     detecting more alcohol abuse and depression. A few days ago, \n     Carmen Torres, a parent counselor at Jefferson Elementary, \n     saw a couple bickering. The wife was dragging in her recently \n     laid-off husband to register for English-language lessons. \n     The husband, crying in despair, complained that the classes \n     were beyond him.\n       But many are confident that the community will prove its \n     resilience. Yvonne Moreno, a counselor at a health program \n     run by the school district, notes that most of those in \n     Lennox have been working since they were six or seven years \n     old. Many crossed the desert on foot, eluding border \n     patrolmen, to get here. ``They are survivors,'' she says.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/12/senate-section/article/S13043-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CIVILIAN FEDERAL AGENCY USE OF REMOTE SENSING\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I commend to your attention a report \nentitled ``Assessment of Remote Sensing Data Use By Civilian Federal \nAgencies,'' which was prepared by Dr. Sherri Stephan of the \nGovernmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, \nProliferation, and Federal Services and the Congressional Research \nService. The report will be available on the Subcommittee's website.\n  In January 2001, I asked the CRS to conduct a survey of remote \nsensing data and technology use by Federal non-military agencies. \nSubcommittee staff used the CRS survey results, included in the report \nas an appendix, and collected agency responses to analyze how Federal \nagencies use remote sensing. It is my hope that this report will enable \nCongress to better understand the issues that arise in obtaining and \napplying the technology.\n  The widespread availability of detailed and accurate satellite \nimaging data has made the world increasingly transparent. Observational \ncapabilities that only a few decades ago were classified and strictly \nlimited are now owned and operated by both government and private-\nsector organizations. For example, Space Imaging, a private satellite \ndata company's web site contains satellite photos of the attack on \nKandahar.\n  Satellite images have also revolutionized the study of the natural \nenvironment and global hazards, agriculture, transportation and urban \nplanning, law enforcement, education, energy use, public health trends, \nand international policy. Researchers in my State of Hawaii, in \npartnership with NASA, NOAA and others, use remote sensing data for \nmany purposes, such as to monitor water temperature and climate \nvariability for tsunami early warning and evacuation planning, \nenvironmental impacts on fisheries, and volcanic activity monitoring.\n  There is now a national capability to provide remote-sensing data \nproducts and value-added information services directly to end users, \nsuch as farmers, foresters, fishermen, natural resource managers, and \nthe public. Just this fall, researchers demonstrated on the island of \nKauai how remote sensing data from unmanned aerial vehicles could be \nused to help determine precisely when a coffee crop is ready for \nharvesting.\n  New imaging technology and new data systems provide a rich \nopportunity for federal agencies to improve their services. The \nnineteen agencies included in this study span the roles of the federal \ngovernment from basic research centers to law enforcement. All but four \nreport some use of remote sensing data and technology. These agencies \nuse data for environmental and conservation purposes, early warning and \nmitigation of natural disasters; basic and applied research, mapping \nactivities, monitoring and verifying compliance with laws and treaties, \nagricultural activities, and transportation and shipping.\n  We also asked the agencies to share their concerns with remote \nsensing data. These concerns expressed their desire to use the data and \ntechnology more fully and efficiently. Many agencies had difficulties \ndue to cost and licensing of commercial data and value-added products \nand analysis, as well as other access concerns. Several agencies were \nconcerned about their capacity to exploit fully remote sensing data and \ntechnology, mostly due to a shortage of trained personnel within the \nagencies to analyze and interpret data.\n  This report offers several options to alleviate these concerns, but \nthese are not the only possible solutions. Nor are they suggestions for \naction. The Federal Government uses remote sensing data in many ways, \nand it is unlikely that a single solution will solve all the problems \nassociated with this use.\n  Since the first photographs of enemy troop positions from a hot air \nballoon in 1860, there have been military and intelligence applications \nof remote sensing data. Today, in this new age of terrorism and \nhomeland security concerns, users now include local first responders, \ncity planners, and State officials. This creates a new challenge for \ncommercial and government data providers to translate our impressive \nimagery technology into a capability that can be exploited by users \nquickly and easily.\n  I would like to thank the staff of the Congressional Research \nService, especially Marcia Smith, for her able assistance in preparing \nthis report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/12/senate-section/article/S13043-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13043-S13044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Madam President, I would like to submit for the Record a \nletter to our majority leader, Senator Daschle, regarding my request to \nhold all non-judicial nominations that come before the Senate until all \nholds are lifted on S. 1499, the American Small Business Emergency \nRelief and Recovery Act of 2001. I want to make sure that my colleagues \nare aware of what I am doing and why.\n  As I just mentioned, my actions have everything to do with emergency \nassistance for small businesses. They are literally dying in the \naftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11. They badly need \naccess to affordable financing and management counseling until business \nreturns to normal, and the administration's approach is not adequately \nhelping those who need it.\n  Senator Bond and I introduced S. 1499 on October 4 to address the \nneeds of small businesses trying to hold on in the aftermath of the \nterrorist attacks. For almost 2 months, emergency legislation with 63 \nsponsors has been blocked from being considered because the \nadministration and two Republican Senators have chosen to put holds on \nlegislation rather than debate the bill and cast a vote.\n  Today there is an article in the Miami Herald that says, ``. . \n.[there aren't] any objections to having the Kerry-Bond bill come to \nthe floor for a debate as long as the Administration's and the Small \nBusiness Administration's concerns were aired.'' That implies that we \nhaven't given them a chance to express their concerns and to work with \nus to pass this bill, when we have.\n  We went to great efforts to work with SBA, Senator Kyl and his staff, \nand the administration. This has gone on long enough. I have not placed \na hold on non-judicial nominees in haste. I do it because I have no \nalternative. Small businesses need assistance, the administration's \napproach isn't adequate to meet the needs of those businesses, and \nSenator Bond and I have a sensible approach to reach them. I ask my \ncolleagues to lift their holds on the bill, let us debate the bill, and \nlet us vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter to \nSenator Daschle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 12, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: As you know, Senator Bond and I have \n     introduced and are trying to gain Senate passage of S. 1499, \n     the ``American Small Business Emergency Relief and Recovery \n     Act of 2001.'' This legislation, supported by 63 Senators, \n     would provide emergency and immediate financial assistance to \n     small businesses around the country who are suffering \n     tremendous financial loss following the terrorist attacks of \n     September 11, 2001. More specifically, the bill would \n     leverage $860 million in federal dollars to make available \n     $25 billion in loans and venture capital to ailing small \n     businesses. The bill has widespread support in the business \n     community, and is endorsed by 36 groups concerned with the \n     financial health of small businesses including the US Chamber \n     of Commerce, the National League of Cities, the US Conference \n     of Mayors and the National Restaurant Association.\n       Despite the widespread and bipartisan support for this \n     legislation, Senator Kyl continues to block its consideration \n     by the Senate. Yesterday, Senator Kyl noted his concerns are \n     based in large part on objections raised by the \n     Administration. Senator Bond and I have attempted to \n     negotiate with Senator Kyl and the Administration so that an \n     agreement could be reached to move this legislation. However, \n     it has become increasingly clear that Senator Kyl and the \n     Administration are not interested in negotiating our \n     differences. Rather, they are interested in delaying \n     consideration of this important relief interminably--\n     ``running out the legislative clock'' at the expense of the \n     thousands of small businesses who are finding it more and \n     more difficult to keep their doors open without the relief \n     they so desperately need in these difficult economic times.\n       For this reason, and regrettably, I have come to the \n     conclusion that, having tried to negotiate in good faith, my \n     only remaining option is to demonstrate, conclusively, that \n     under no circumstances will we back away from our commitment \n     to small businesses. To bring Sen. Kyl and the Administration \n     back to the negotiating table in earnest, I would like to \n     place a hold on all non-judicial executive nominations that \n     may come before the Senate. It is my hope that this hold will \n     be short-lived, as it will lead to more serious negotiations \n     and ultimately Senate consideration of S. 1499. However, I am \n     prepared to keep this hold in place until the Senate \n     considers our bill. A simple yes or no vote on this important \n     relief for small businesses is not too much to ask, and I \n     hope that our Republican colleagues in the Senate will at \n     long last allow us the opportunity to make good on our \n     promise to help struggling businesses nationwide.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     John F. Kerry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/12/senate-section/article/S13044-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13044-S13045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I rise to offer some guidance to the \nSecretary of the Treasury on the regulatory authority assigned to him \nby the Congress with the recent enactment of H.R. 3162, ``The Patriot \nAct of 2001.''\n  As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, I authored an amendment \nto that legislation's anti-money laundering title, title III, the \n``International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism \nAct of 2001,'' which was included in the final legislation as signed by \nthe President at Sec. 311. My amendment directs the Secretary of the \nTreasury to promulgate regulations defining ``beneficial ownership of \nan account'' for purposes of Section 5318A and subsections (i) and (j) \nof Section 5318 of the Bank Secrecy Act. I would like to offer some \nguidance to the Secretary of the Treasury concerning the Secretary's \ndetermination of ``reasonable'' and ``practicable'' steps for domestic \nfinancial institutions to ascertain the ``beneficial ownership'' of \ncertain accounts as provided in Section 311 of the bill.\n  Section 311 of this legislation authorizes the Secretary of the \nTreasury to require domestic financial institutions and agencies to \ntake one or more of five ``special measures'' if the Secretary of the \nTreasury finds that reasonable grounds exist to conclude that a foreign \njurisdiction, a financial institution operating outside the United \nStates, a class of international transactions, and/or types of accounts \nis of ``primary money laundering concern.''\n  The second measure would require domestic financial institutions to \ntake such steps as the Secretary determines to be ``reasonable'' and \n``practicable'' to ascertain beneficial ownership of accounts opened or \nmaintained in the United States by a foreign person, excluding publicly \ntraded foreign corporations, associated with what has been determined \nto be a primary money laundering concern.\n  In both Section 5318A(b)(1)(B)(iii) and (b)(2), the Secretary is \ngiven the authority to require steps the Secretary determines to be \n``reasonable and practicable'' to identify the ``beneficial ownership'' \nof funds or accounts. Neither the phrase ``beneficial ownership'' nor \nthe phrase ``reasonable and practicable steps'' is defined in the \nlegislation, and there is no single accepted statutory or common-law \nmeaning of either phrase that the legislation is meant to incorporate.\n  During the 106th Congress, the issue was dealt with by the House \nBanking Committee, which favorably reported H.R. 3886, which contained \nprovisions nearly identical to those contained in Section 311 of H.R. \n3162, but without the mandatory rulemaking requirement which my \namendment added this year. Both in the 106th Congress and again this \nyear, the concern has been expressed that this lack of statutory \ndefinition conceivably could result in a rule or order under either \nSection 5318A(b)(1)(B)(iii) or (b)(2) that requires financial \ninstitutions to identify all beneficial owners of funds or of an \naccount, which in turn might result in some circumstances in clearly \nexcessive and unjustifiable burdens. As the\n\n[[Page S13045]]\n\nauthor of the amendment requiring the Secretary to undertake rulemaking \nin this area, I am sensitive to this concern, and I would expect the \nSecretary to address it when implementing this act, including when \nmaking determinations under the following provisions: (1) Section \n5318A(a)(3)(B)(ii), which requires the Secretary to consider, in \nselecting which special measure to take, ``whether the imposition of \nany particular special measure would create a significant competitive \ndisadvantage, including any undue cost or burden associated with \ncompliance, for financial institutions organized or licensed in the \nUnited States;'' and (2) those above-referenced provisions that permit \nonly those steps that the Secretary determines to be ``reasonable and \npracticable'' to identify the beneficial ownership of accounts or \nfunds, which provisions impose an enforceable constraint on the \nsubstance of any rule or order under either Section 5318A(b)(1)(B)(iii) \nor (b)(2).\n  In addition, Section 5318A(e)(3) requires the Secretary to \n``promulgate regulations defining beneficial ownership of an account'' \nfor purposes of Section 5318A and subsections (i) and (j) of Section \n5318. This is the Bennett amendment. Section 5318A(e)(4) gives the \nSecretary the authority, inter alia, to ``define . . . terms for the \npurposes of'' Section 5318A ``by regulation.'' I would strongly \nencourage the Secretary to define the meaning of the phrases \n``beneficial ownership'' as well as ``reasonable and practicable \nsteps'' for the purposes of Sections 5318A(b)(1)(B)(iii) and (b)(2), \nthrough formal rulemaking subject to notice and comment, taking due \nconsideration of the potential impact of such regulations on smaller \ninstitutions, and on all institutions, with an eye toward balancing \nregulatory burden, legitimate privacy interests, and the ability of \nUnited States financial institutions to compete globally. To the extent \nthe Secretary opts for informal guidance on ``reasonable and \npracticable steps,'' I would urge informal consultation with interested \nparties.\n  Specifically, I would note that several agencies have issued \nregulations or supervisory guidance defining the term ``beneficial \nowner'' or outlining what constitutes reasonable steps to obtain \nbeneficial ownership information, in each instance for the issuing \nagency's own purposes. See, e.g., 17 C.F.R. Sec. 228.403; 26 C.F.R. \nSec. 1.1441 1(c)(6); 28 C.F.R. Sec. 9.2(e); Letter re: Public \nSecurities Association (Sept. 29, 1995) (SEC staff ``no action'' letter \naddressing 17 C.F.R. Sec. 240.10b 10); Guidance on Sound Risk \nManagement Practices Governing Private Banking Activities, prepared by \nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York (July 1997); and Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency Bank Secrecy Act Handbook (September 1996). \nThese sources may be instructive for the Secretary in providing \ndefinitions of the phrases ``beneficial ownership'' and ``reasonable \nand practicable steps.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/12/senate-section/article/S13045-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDTIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      IN MEMORY OF STANLEY FOSTER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this moment to \nreflect on the life of my friend and well-known philanthropist, Stanley \nFoster.\n  Stan died of cancer on November 14, 2001 in San Diego, CA, at the age \nof 74. His death represents a great loss for the people of San Diego, \nthe State of California and the Nation, who benefitted immensely from \nhis extraordinary dedication and commitment to his community. His \nstrong passion to make a difference, particularly reflected in his work \nto prevent gun violence, has made a lasting impact on all our lives.\n  Stan Foster was the son of a scrap-dealer from Ukraine. After \ngraduating from the University of Washington, he owned a retail \nfurniture store in Portland before settling in San Diego in 1954.\n  A man from humble beginnings, Stan gradually rose to become a \nsuccessful businessman as the owner of the popular Hang Ten sportswear \nlabel. Throughout his career, he took great pride in reinvesting in the \ncommunity. He was actively involved in organizations including the \nChamber of Commerce, the United Way, the Jewish Federation and the \nCombined Arts Council. He also played a significant role in the \npolitical sphere, earning respect and admiration from legislators on \nboth sides of the aisle. But he is most well known for his unwavering \ncommitment to the fight against gun violence.\n  In the 1980s, Stan sold the Hang Ten company and shifted his \npriorities towards his civic work. Affected by an incident that \noccurred in his teenage life, Stan dedicated much of his time to help \ncombat gun violence. In pursuit of this mission, he founded San Diegans \nAgainst Handgun Violence in 1988 and also became national vice chairman \nof Handgun Control, Incorporated. As a leader of San Diegans Against \nHandgun Violence, he fought for gun safety and tougher gun laws. He was \na true national leader in this fight.\n  I will miss Stan Foster. He enriched many lives in California and \nthroughout our Nation. Although we mourn the loss of a great leader, we \nwill always remember his powerful voice for justice. His generosity and \ncompassion will remain in our hearts, inspiring us to follow his \nunforgettable legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/12/senate-section/article/S13045-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13045-S13046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMCAST CARES DAY AT ANACOSTIA SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on October 13, 2001, as part of \nComcast's nationwide Day of Service, and in conjunction with Greater DC \nCares, several hundred Comcast employees from the Washington, DC area \nvolunteered to clean, landscape, and paint Anacostia Senior High \nSchool. In the wake of the tragedy of September 11, the Comcast \nFoundation has contributed $100 to disaster relief efforts in New York \nCity and at the Pentagon for every employee and family member who \nparticipated in the clean-up. Comcast and every participating employee \nshould be commended for their outstanding dedication and commitment to \nimproving their community.\n  Nationwide, more than five thousand Comcast employees from twenty-six \nStates volunteered their time on Comcast Cares Day. Though it may have \nbeen the work of only one corporation and one group of employees, \nComcast's community service and the volunteer spirit of its employees \nrepresents the best of America.\n  The best of America can also be seen in other places around our \ncountry. Since September 11, Americans have risen to the occasion to \naid their fellow citizen. In every city and town across America, \nindividuals have taken the lead in community efforts like the one at \nAnacostia Senior High School. In my home State of Delaware, \ncorporations such as Daimler-Chrysler, MBNA Bank and the DuPont \nCorporation have lent a helping hand to assist those in need. \nFurthermore, fire companies, school children, and individuals from all \nwalks of life have come together providing assistance and comfort to \nthe victims of the horrible September 11 attack.\n  Not to overstate the case, but there seems to be a renewed spirit of \ncommunity in America where, not long ago, we seemed more divided by \ndifferences than united by common concerns and shared values. \nCorporations like Comcast and their employees have heard the call. They \nhave pulled together and responded where there is a need and, in the \nDistrict of Columbia, Anacostia Senior High School was the place. It \nwas not the work that was done there on October 13, or the time and \nsweat of all those who volunteered, that should inspire us the most, \nbut the overriding sense that all of us working together can make a \ndifference in our communities.\n  After the tragedy of September 11, Americans responded when we saw \nthe courage and dedication of New York police, firemen, and emergency \nworkers. From their example have come story after story of corporations \nlike Comcast reaching out, taking a lead in their communities, and \nmaking a difference. Comcast, The Comcast Foundation, and the dedicated \nemployees who participated in making a difference at Anacostia Senior \nHigh School should be commended by all of us in the United States \nSenate who know how much we can accomplish when we work together.\n  Yet, this sense of corporate responsibility is not new for the \nComcast Corporation. Comcast always has been an active participant in \nthe communities it serves. Whether it is their support of the Boys and \nGirls Clubs of America, the Red Cross, or the Easter Seals, Comcast has \ninsisted on excellence not\n\n[[Page S13046]]\n\nonly in all aspects of its operation, but in its record of public \nservice. This is a testament to the leadership of its founder and \nChairman, Ralph Roberts, President, Brian Roberts, and Vice President, \nJoe Waz. These men serve as role-models in their communities and are \ntrue heroes in every sense of the word.\n  If we learned anything from September 11 it was that the will and \nresolve of the American people cannot be shaken by those who would use \nterror as a weapon and religion as a shield. We are strongest and at \nour best when we are defending American values and the bedrock \nprinciples of democracy. If anything changed on September 11 it was a \nrenewed determination for all of us to reach out where and when we can, \nand to recognize that we are much more united by our common concerns \nand shared values than divided by our individual differences. Companies \nlike Comcast have recognized a community need, reached out, and made a \ndifference, and they deserve the recognition of a grateful \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/12/senate-section/article/S13046-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JAMES V.

A 66 year old native of Newark, Mr. Parrillo is \na man of integrity who has devoted his time and talents to making his \ncity a thriving urban center.\n  A graduate of East Side High School, Mr. Parrillo currently serves as \na community relations specialist at the Newark Housing Authority. In \nthis capacity he is responsible for coordinating special events, \nincluding an annual parade and senior citizen fashion show.\n  A grassroots coalition-builder and youth advocate, Mr. Parrillo is \nalso involved in strengthening the community and promoting the \ndevelopment of children. For the past fifteen years he has sponsored a \nlittle league baseball team in Newark's Ironbound section, providing a \nmuch needed recreational outlet for the city's young people. Most \nrecently, he was elected to serve as a member of the Newark Board of \nEducation and is chairman of its Community Development Committee.\n  In 1981, Jimmy, as he is affectionately known, established the Jimmy \nParrillo Civic Association, an organization comprised of \nrepresentatives from the business, educational, and political \ncommunities. Each year the association recognizes the achievements of \nindividuals who have contributed to promoting stable communities in the \ncity of Newark.\n  I want you to know that James V. Parrillo is a true American and \nbelieves that all people should have access to America's Promise. An \nunselfish man, he has the gift of bringing people together to work for \na common cause.\n  Jimmy believes that he can make a difference. The city of Newark is a \nbetter city today because of his dedication and leadership.\n  Lastly, I am proud to call Jimmy a friend and it is an honor for me \nto bring him to your attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/12/senate-section/article/S13046-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO VERNON ALLEY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, earlier this year our country was \ntreated to ``Jazz,'' the latest documentary by Ken Burns. The \nambitious, multi-part series traced the personalities, culture and, of \ncourse, music of jazz from its origins in turn of the century New \nOrleans until the present day. Like his critically acclaimed \ndocumentaries on the Civil War and baseball, Mr. Burns' production was \nas much a meditation on America and the nature of our democracy as it \nwas an overview of jazz itself. For those who have not yet had a chance \nto see this wonderful exploration, I highly recommend it.\n  Jazz is a distinctly American art form, born of many different \ninfluences and nurtured in a wide variety of contexts and communities. \nAlthough often over-shadowed by cities such as New Orleans, New York \nand Kansas City, San Francisco was and remains one such community. Over \nthe years, it has been home and played host to many of jazz's greatest \ntalents.\n  Perhaps no musician better personifies San Francisco's connection and \ncontributions to jazz than bassist Vernon Alley. Vernon Alley is a \nlongtime San Franciscan. He grew up in the City and has maintained a \nband here off and on since the mid-forties. As jazz vocalist Jon \nHendricks once remarked, ``[Vernon is] the dean of San Francisco \njazz.''\n  Mr. Alley began his lifelong association with San Francisco and jazz \nwhen he accompanied his parents to see a performance by the \nincomparable Jelly Roll Morton at Maple Hall. Thus inspired, Vernon \nwent on to dedicate his life to music. Arriving in New York as a young \nman at the high point of the swing era, he played with some of the \nbiggest names in the business, including both the Lionel Hampton and \nCount Basie Orchestras. Always a sought after accompanist, in later \nyears he would play with such other legends as Duke Ellington, Ella \nFitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Erroll Garner and more.\n  Although he may have been able to gain wider exposure or acclaim if \nhe remained in New York, Vernon returned to San Francisco after World \nWar II. Here he is beloved, not only for the power, warmth and lyrical \nquality of his music, but also for his great personal charm. I have had \nthe pleasure of meeting Vernon Alley and seeing him perform. He is a \ngifted and gracious man and certainly a Bay Area treasure.\n  Vernon was honored this year at the prestigious San Francisco Jazz \nFestival with the SFJAZZ Beacon Award for his achievements in music and \nas a stalwart in the community. Mayor Willie Brown declared October 30, \n2001 ``Vernon Alley Day.'' That evening Vernon joined 15 friends on the \nstage for a three and a half hour tribute concert. By all accounts it \nwas night filled with joy and an appreciation of how the gifts of one \nman can be gifts to us all.\n  I am greatly encouraged by what I see as a renewed sense of love for \nAmerica and respect for its traditions and achievements. In Jazz, we \nsee a reflection of ourselves at our finest. And in Vernon Alley we see \nthe embodiment of jazz at its finest. For keeping this art form alive, \nwe owe him our deepest thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/12/senate-section/article/S13046-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13046-S13047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:28 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nsection 3(b) of the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act of 2001 \n(Public Law 107-12), the Majority Leader appoints the following \nindividuals to the Medal of Valor Review Board: Mr. Oliver``Glenn'' \nBoyer of Hillsboro, Missouri and Mr. Richard ``Smokey'' Dyer of Kansas \nCity, Missouri.\n  The message also announced that the House has agreed to the \namendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 10) to provide for pension \nreform, and for other purposes.\n  The message further announced that the House has agreed to the \namendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2540) to amend title 38, \nUnited States Code, to make various improvement to veterans benefits \nprograms under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, \nand for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has agreed to the amendment \nof the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2716) to amend title 38, United States \nCode, to revise, improve, and consolidate provisions of law providing \nbenefits and services for homeless veterans.\n  The message further announced that the House has agreed to the \namendment of the Senate to the amendment of the House to the bill (S. \n1196) to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and for other \npurposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has agreed to the \namendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 1291) to amend title 38, \nUnited States Code, to increase the amount of educational benefits for \nveterans under the Montgomery GI bill, with an amendment; in which it \nrequests the concurrence of the Senate.\n  The message further announced that the House has passed the following \njoint resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.J.

A bill to amend the Mineral Leasing Act to encourage the \ndevelopment of natural gas and oil resources on Federal land; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nAcreage Chargeability Act of 2001. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 \nrestricts the interests a company can own in Federal oil and gas leases \nin any one State to 246,080 acres. This legislation alters the acreage \ncap for oil and gas leases on federal lands so that producing leases \nare not included in the existing Statewide acreage limitation. This \nprovides an incentive for producers to keep domestic acreage in \nproduction or to turn the leases over to another operator who will.\n  Historically, the acreage limitation in the Mineral Leasing Act \nresponded to public concern over a few major integrated oil companies \nlocking up potential supplies of crude oil from Federal lands in the \nWest. As originally enacted, the Act forbade any person from owning \nmore than three Federal oil and gas leases in any state and more than \none lease in an oil and gas field. In 1926, the restriction was \nconverted from leases into acres and the acreage limit was increased to \n7,680 acres in any state. The Congress, on three other occasions, has \nfurther expanded the number of acres a lessee may hold to 15,360 acres \nin 1946, to 46,080 acres per state in 1954, and to its present 246,080 \nacres in 1960. Under present-day conditions increased acreage and more \ntime are necessary to protect the huge investments now needed to \nmaintain rates of discovery.\n  Today, companies are able to administratively exempt Federal acreage \nfrom the 246,080-acre limit per state either through unitization or by \nthe creation of a development contract. At this time, the BLM only \nallows development contracts in situations where the acreage is \nconsidered wildcat. The BLM has been extremely cooperative in working \nwith companies that find themselves bumping up against or exceeding the \nacreage cap. However, the time has come to pass legislation that will \nencourage the sizeable capital investment that will be needed to \npromote orderly and environmentally responsible exploration, \ndevelopment, and production of natural gas and oil from the public \nlands of the United States.\n  In our modern economy, the acreage limitations of the Mineral Leasing \nAct appear as historical relics, ill suited to their original task of \npromoting competition. The acreage limitations of the Act are once \nagain inhibiting a company's ability to assemble sufficient blocks of \nacreage to efficiently explore promising natural gas and oil prospects. \nCompanies are also unable to adequately finance the development of \nthose prospects and related infrastructure such as pipelines. \nExacerbating the acreage situation further, is the trend toward mergers \nand acquisitions taking place in the oil and gas industry.\n  The Federal Acreage Chargeability Act of 2001 amends the acreage \nlimitation provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 in such a \nmanner that is truly reflective of today's exploration and production \ntechniques and economics. Given the uncertain natural gas and oil \nsupply situation that this country faces, it is even more critical to \nreform the outdated existing Federal acreage limitation provisions. The \nFederal Acreage Chargeability Act of 2001 amends the Mineral Leasing \nAct of 1920 by exempting oil and natural gas producing acreage from \nbeing counted against the Federal acreage cap.\n  Acreage limitations for other federal minerals such as coal and trona \nhave also been revised upward over the years. Last Congress, I authored \nlegislation that passed and was signed into law that raised the acreage \nlimits for both Federal coal and trona leases due to industry \nconsolidation and international competition. The domestic natural gas \nand oil industry is certainly facing these same concerns.\n  In recognition of the economics and technological advances of \nexploring for and producing domestic natural gas and oil on our public \nlands, and the national goal of increasing both domestic production and \nenvironmental efficiency, make now the right time to enact the Federal \nAcreage Chargeability Act of 2001.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S13053]]\n\n                                S. 1808\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ncredits for individuals and businesses for the installations of certain \nwind energy property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today I am pleased to introduce the Home \nand Farm Wind Energy Systems Act of 2001. At a time when the United \nStates clearly needs to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, and \nparticularly on imported oil, I offer legislation to spur the \nproduction of electricity from a clean, free and literally limitless \nsource, wind. My bill offers a tax credit to help defray the cost of \ninstalling a small wind energy system to generate electricity for \nindividual homes, farms and businesses. It is my hope that this credit \nwill help make it economical for people to invest in small wind \nsystems, thereby reducing pressures on the national power grid and \nincreasing America's energy independence one family or business at a \ntime.\n  Any serious attempt to create a national energy policy must include \ninnovative proposals for exploring and developing the use of \nalternative and renewable energy sources. I look forward to debating a \ncomprehensive energy policy for America in the next session of the \n107th Congress, and I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the Home \nand Farm Wind Energy Systems Act of 2001 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n          Summary of the Home and Farm Wind Energy Systems Act\n\n       The bill would provide a 30 percent federal investment tax \n     credit for homeowners, farmers and businesses when they \n     install small wind energy systems with a capacity of up to 75 \n     kilowatts (kW). The tax credit would be available for \n     installation occurring over the next ten years.\n       Investments in renewable energy provide many benefits, \n     including:\n       1. Enhancing the energy security and independence of the \n     United States;\n       2. Increasing farmer and rancher income;\n       3. Promoting rural economic development;\n       4. Providing environmental and public health benefits such \n     as cleaner air and water;\n       5. Improving electric grid reliability, thereby reducing \n     the likelihood of blackouts;\n       6. Providing farm and residential customers with insulation \n     from electricity price volatility resulting from electric \n     deregulation.\n       Small wind systems are the most cost-competitive home sized \n     renewable energy technology, but the high up-front cost has \n     been a barrier. Phil Funk, for instance, a farmer in Dallas \n     County, IA, invested $20,000 in a 20kW wind turbine system \n     that saves him $3000 dollars per year on his electricity \n     bill. Funk made use of an existing tower on his property to \n     reduce his total costs significantly. The simple return-on-\n     investment period for Funk, however, was still 7 years--too \n     long to interest many farmers. A 30 percent tax credit would \n     be a powerful incentive in its own right. It would also bring \n     down production costs for small wind systems by increasing \n     sales and production volume.\n       A typical rural residential wind system uses a 60 foot to \n     80 foot tower, has a 10 kW capacity and costs $30,000 to \n     $35,000 to install. It produces up to 13,000 kWh of \n     electricity per year, and offsets seven tons of carbon \n     dioxide per year. This could yield savings of $1000 or more \n     per year in energy costs, depending on prevailing commercial \n     rates. In addition, in most states, system owners whose homes \n     are connected to the power grid can sell excess electricity \n     back to the local power company, improving efficiency and \n     further reducing demands on local power grids.\n       While a few states offer incentives, the Federal Government \n     has not offered tax credits for small wind systems since \n     1985.\n       A recent USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup poll showed that 91 percent \n     of the public favors incentives for wind, solar, and fuel \n     cells. But, while there are tax credits for very large \n     commercial wind turbines, Production Tax Credit, there is \n     currently no federal program to support small systems.\n       According to the American Wind Energy Association, Illinois \n     ranks 16th in the contiguous states for wind energy \n     potential. A new map produced by the National Renewable \n     Energy Laboratory, NREL, for the U.S. Department of Energy \n     indicates that over 2/3 of Illinois has a ``class 3'' or \n     better wind resource, making rural areas and the higher \n     elevations in those areas appropriate for small wind turbine \n     siting.\n       Illinois has a strong wind energy heritage. Chicago and \n     Batavia were the leading centers of wind energy manufacturing \n     in the United States at the end of the last century, with \n     millions of farm water pumping windmills and battery-charging \n     wind turbines built in the area between 1870 and 1910. \n     Batavia is still known as ``The Windmill City''.\n       In 1999, the Danish large-wind-turbine manufacturer NEG \n     Micon chose Champaign for the site of its first American \n     assembly and servicing facility, continuing the wind energy \n     tradition in Illinois.\n       Only a handful of States provide incentives for small wind \n     systems.\n       Illinois currently offers a buy-down or rebate on the \n     purchase of wind energy systems of up to 50 percent or $2/\n     watt. Eligible applicants include associations, individuals, \n     private companies, public and private schools, colleges and \n     universities, not-for-profit organizations and units of State \n     and local government. Potential recipients must be located \n     within the service area of an investor-owned or municipal gas \n     or electric utility or an electric cooperative that imposes \n     the Renewable Energy Resources and Coal Technology \n     Development Assistance Charge. Grant payments under current \n     operating procedures are, however taxable, which reduces \n     their value significantly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \n        Lugar, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1811. A bill to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 \nU.S.C. App.) to streamline the financial disclosure process for \nexecutive branch employees; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I am introducing today the \nPresidential Appointments Improvement Act of 2001 on behalf of myself \nand Senator Lieberman, and Senators Akaka, Durbin, Lugar, and \nVoinovich. This proposal reflects multiple recommendations made by the \nmany commissions and organizations that have studied the Presidential \nappointments process. These include a number of national commissions, \nnon-profit organizations like the Presidential Appointee Initiative and \nthe Transition to Governing Project, and a 1993 study and \nrecommendations by the American Bar Association.\n  Clearly, we have a problem. The Presidential appointments process is \nunnecessarily long, burdensome, and complex. And although President \nBush has sent a notable number of nominees to Congress at this point in \nhis first year, major gaps remain in critical positions throughout \ngovernment. We are faced with responding to the events of September 11 \nwith a 25-percent vacancy rate in positions considered important to \nHomeland Security.\n  The time it takes for a new President to put his team in place \nexacerbates the human capital problems that our government faces. There \nis a growing recognition that we need to manage our people better. But \nwith the downsizing of the past decade and the impending wave of \nretirements, the time consuming nature of the appointments process will \nleave many federal departments and agencies hollow and headless.\n  While the appointments process is, collectively, a tangled mess, \nthere is no question that it has parts that are important and should be \npreserved. Conflict of interest statutes are critical, because a \nfundamental principle of government is one should not have a direct \nfinancial interest in the decisions that one is making. Likewise, \nbackground investigations are critical to ensure that the Government's \nhighest officials can be trusted with national security information. \nAnd, of course, the Congress has an obligation, enshrined in the \nConstitution, to provide its advice and consent for the President's \nnominees.\n\n[[Page S13054]]\n\n  This committee first took action to improve the Presidential \nappointments process when we passed the Presidential Transition Act of \n2000. In that legislation, we included a number of provisions to allow \na new President to hit the ground running once he takes office. In \naddition, that bill asked the Office of Government Ethics to report \nwithin six months on its recommendations to streamline the forms we \nrequire of Executive Branch nominees. The administration submitted \nthose recommendations and they are included in this legislation.\n  In addition to streamlining the financial disclosure form, our \nlegislation directs the Executive Clerk of the White House to provide a \nlist of appointed positions to each Presidential candidate, Republican \nand Democrat, after their respective nominating conventions. That way \nthe President, whomever he or she may be, can have an early start at \npicking his most trusted advisors. We also ask each Executive \nDepartment to recommend an elimination of Senate-confirmed positions, \nwhich would greatly shorten the entire process.\n  As I've said, this legislation is not the only action we are taking \nto improve the Presidential appointments process. Senator Lieberman and \nI earlier asked Senate Committees to work to simplify the forms they \nrequire of nominees, we have simplified the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee form, and I have written White House Chief of Staff Andrew \nCard, asking him to examine the need for all Presidential nominees to \nundergo a full-field FBI background investigation. Clearly, there are \nsome positions in the Federal Government that do not require the same \nbackground investigations as, say, the Secretary of Defense.\n  We will continue to look for ways to improve this process. The \nlegislation we are introducing today makes reasonable but overdue \nchanges to the Presidential appointments process. Whether in a time of \ncrisis or not, there is no question that the country benefits when the \nPresident's team, from either party, takes office as quickly as \npossible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Presidential Appointments Improvement Act of 2001--Section-By-Section \n                                Analysis\n\n       Section 1 of the bill. Sets forth the short title of the \n     bill.\n       Section 2 of the bill. Sets forth the purposes of the bill.\n       Sec. 3 of the bill. Sets forth the public financial \n     disclosure requirements for judicial and legislative \n     personnel by amending Title I of the Ethics in Government Act \n     to excise all current references in title which were \n     necessary to apply the title to the officers and employees of \n     the executive branch. No change to current financial \n     disclosure requirements for judicial and legislative \n     personnel have been made.\n       Sec. 4 of the bill. Sets forth the public financial \n     disclosure requirements for executive branch personnel by \n     enacting a new title II of the Ethics in Government Act. The \n     references below are to the sections of title II of the \n     Ethics in Government Act and not to the sections of this Act.\n     Section 201. Persons required to file\n       Subsection (a) establishes the filing deadlines for new \n     entrants to a filing position. This does not change current \n     requirements.\n       Subsection (b), Paragraphs (1) and (2) establish the filing \n     deadlines for Presidential nominees (and individuals whom the \n     President has announced his intent to nominate) to positions \n     requiring Senate confirmation (other than Foreign Service \n     Officers or certain uniformed service officers) and including \n     the requirement to update information regarding income and \n     honoraria to within 5 days of the confirmation hearing. This \n     does not change current requirements.\n       Subsection (c), paragraph (1) contains the current filing \n     requirements for candidates for President or Vice President. \n     This does not change current requirements.\n       Paragraph (2) requires that an individual who is sworn in \n     as President or Vice President and who did not hold either of \n     those two positions immediately before taking the oath of \n     office shall file a report within 30 days of taking the oath. \n     This is new. It is intended to make clear that a newly- \n     elected President or Vice President or an individual who \n     takes the oath of office of either of those two positions \n     outside the normal election cycle shall file a report within \n     30 days of taking the oath. A newly-elected President and \n     Vice President who are not incumbents have previously filed \n     as candidates. This amendment would clarify the change from \n     candidate to incumbent and give the public timely information \n     regarding these two officials. An individual who is re-\n     elected as President or Vice President would not be affected \n     by this provision and would continue to file annually on May \n     15.\n       Subsection (d) contains the requirements for annual \n     reports. This does not change current requirements.\n       Subsection (e) contains the requirements for termination \n     reports. It has been changed only to make clear that an \n     individual who moves from any covered position to an elected \n     position in the executive branch need not file a termination \n     report for the first position.\n       Subsection (f) contains the descriptions of the officers \n     and employees of the executive branch who must file a public \n     financial disclosure. This does not change current \n     requirements, except that paragraph (6) has been amended to \n     clarify which officers or employees of the Postal Service are \n     required to file by referencing the levels of the Postal \n     Career Executive Service rather than an amount of basic pay.\n       Subsection (g) contains the provisions for extensions for \n     filing. This does not change current provisions.\n       Subsection (h) contains a time-limited exception for filing \n     by persons who are not reasonably expected to serve in their \n     positions for more than sixty days in a calendar year. This \n     does not change current authority.\n       Subsection (i) provides OGE with waiver authority for the \n     filing requirements primarily for certain special Government \n     employees. This does not change current waiver authority.\n     Section 202. Contents of reports\n       Subsection (a), paragraph (1), subparagraph (A) requires \n     the reporting of the source, description and category of \n     amount of earned income including honoraria aggregating more \n     than $500 in value. For purposes of honoraria received \n     during Government service, the report must include the \n     exact amount and the date it was received. This provision \n     does not include the current requirements for reporting \n     exact amounts of earned income; exact amounts of any \n     income that are not dividends, rents, interest and capital \n     gains; contributions made to charitable organizations in \n     lieu of honoraria; and the corresponding confidential \n     reporting requirement of the recipients of the payments in \n     lieu of honoraria. It also changes the threshold from \n     ``$200 or more'' to ``more than $500'' to conform the \n     style of the threshold descriptions and raise the amount.\n       Subparagraph (B) requires the reporting of the source, \n     description and category of amount of investment income which \n     exceeds $500 during the reporting period. This change allows \n     all investment income to be reported by category of amount \n     rather than only dividends, rents, interest and capital \n     gains, and it raises the reporting threshold from $200 to \n     $500.\n       Subparagraph (C) sets forth the categories of amounts for \n     reporting earned and investment income. This provision \n     substitutes 5 categories for the current 11 categories used \n     for certain types of investment income.\n       Paragraph (2), subparagraph (A) requires the reporting of \n     gifts aggregating more than the minimal value established by \n     the Foreign Gifts Act (currently $260). This does not change \n     current requirements.\n       Subparagraph (B) requires the reporting of reimbursements \n     received for travel when valued at more than the minimal \n     value established by the Foreign Gifts Act. This changes \n     current requirements in that it eliminates the requirement to \n     report the ``itinerary'' of the trip but maintains the \n     requirement to report the dates and the nature of the \n     expenses provided.\n       Subparagraph (C) provides for a publicly available waiver \n     for reporting gifts. This does not change current authority.\n       Paragraph (3) contains the requirements for reporting \n     interests in property or in a trade or business, or for \n     investment or the production of income property held for the \n     production of income which has a fair market value in excess \n     of $5,000 except that deposit accounts in a financial \n     institution aggregating $100,000 or less and any federal \n     Government securities aggregating $100,000 or less need not \n     be reported. This changes the current requirements by raising \n     the general threshold reporting requirement to $5,000, by \n     raising the threshold reporting requirement for deposit \n     accounts from $5,000 to $100,000 and by creating a new \n     threshold for Government securities at over $100,000 where it \n     currently is treated as other personal property with a $1,000 \n     reporting threshold.\n       Paragraph (4) contains the requirements for reporting the \n     identity and category of value of liabilities which exceed \n     $20,000 at any time during the reporting period except that \n     revolving charge accounts need only be reported if the \n     outstanding liability exceeds $20,000 as of the close of the \n     reporting period. This changes the current requirements by \n     raising the threshold from $10,000 to $20,000.\n       Paragraph (5) contains the reporting requirements for real \n     property and securities that were: purchased, sold or \n     exchanged during the preceding calendar year; the value of \n     the transaction exceeded $5,000; and the property or security \n     is not already required to be reported as a source of income \n     or as an asset. This replaces the current requirements to \n     report the date and category of value of any purchase, sale \n     or exchange of real property or a security which exceeds \n     $1,000 and eliminates some redundant reporting required by \n     current law.\n       Paragraph (6), subparagraph (A) requires the reporting of \n     certain positions (e.g. officerships, directorships, \n     trusteeships,\n\n[[Page S13055]]\n\n     partnerships, etc.) held by the reporting official during the \n     period that encompasses the preceding calendar year and the \n     current calendar year in which the report is filed. This \n     changes the current requirement only in that it shortens the \n     look-back in the reporting period from two years plus the \n     current to one year plus the current.\n       Subparagraph (B) requires a non-elected new entrant to \n     report the sources of individual compensation for personal \n     services rendered by the reporting individual valued in \n     excess of $25,000 in the calendar year prior to or the \n     calendar year in which the first report was filed. It \n     specifically exempts from reporting those sources that have \n     already been reported previously as a source of earned \n     income over $500. It also contains a provision that allows \n     the reporting individual not to report any information \n     required by this provision if the information is \n     confidential as a result of a privileged relationship or \n     the person for whom the services were provided had a \n     reasonable expectation of privacy. This changes the \n     current requirements by raising the threshold from $5,000 \n     to $25,000; by shortening the look-back in the reporting \n     period from two years plus the current to one year plus \n     the current year; by deleting, through exception, the \n     current requirement to again report sources of earned \n     income required to be reported elsewhere; and by adding an \n     additional exception for reporting information where the \n     person for whom the services were provided (client) had a \n     reasonable expectation of privacy.\n       Paragraph (7) requires the reporting of a description of \n     the parties to and the terms of any agreements or \n     arrangements for future employment (including the date of any \n     formal agreement for future employment), leaves of absence, \n     continuation of payments by a former employer and continuing \n     participation in an employee benefits plan maintained by a \n     former employer. This changes the current requirements only \n     in that it eliminates the requirement that dates of all such \n     agreements must be included, requiring only the dates of \n     formal agreements for future employment.\n       Paragraph (8) specifies that a category of value shall be \n     used to report the total cash value of the reporting \n     individual in a qualified blind trust. This does not change \n     the requirement that the total cash value of a blind trust is \n     to be reported by category of amount, but it does eliminate a \n     reference to blind trusts executed prior to July 24, 1995 \n     where the trust document prohibited the beneficiary from \n     receiving this information. There are no such trusts that \n     would be qualified in the executive branch.\n       Subsection (b), paragraph (1) provides for reporting \n     periods for candidates, Presidential nominees and other new \n     entrants. For income, positions held and client-type \n     information the reporting period will be the year of filing \n     and the preceding calendar year. For assets and liabilities, \n     the reporting period is as of a date that is less than 31 \n     days before the filing date. For agreements and arrangements, \n     the reporting period is as of the filing date. This maintains \n     the current reporting periods except that it reiterates that \n     positions held and client-type information will only be \n     required to be reported for the preceding calendar year plus \n     the current calendar year.\n       Paragraph (2), subparagraphs (A) and (B) provides for \n     authority to allow a filer to use a format other than the \n     standard form developed by the Office of Government Ethics or \n     to provide exact amounts instead of reporting by category of \n     amount. This does not change current authority.\n       Subsection (c) provides for reporting periods for certain \n     first annual report filers and for those terminating \n     Government service. This does not change current \n     requirements.\n       Paragraph (1) provides OGE with regulatory authority to \n     expand a reporting period to cover days in which the filer \n     actually served the Government in a filing position, but \n     information for those days was not otherwise included on a \n     public financial disclosure. This is a new requirement \n     intended to allow OGE to define an additional reporting \n     period, by regulation, to fill a reporting gap that can occur \n     between a nominee or new entrant report and the first annual \n     report the individual is required to file. Typically the gap \n     appears for an individual who enters Government service in \n     November or December as a new appointee or as a regular new \n     entrant who filed a first report promptly before the end of \n     the year and whose next annual does not cover any of the \n     November/December time frame when they first entered \n     government service.\n       Paragraph (2) requires that reports filed at the \n     termination of Government service shall include that part of \n     the calendar year of filing up to the date of the termination \n     of employment. This does not change current requirements; it \n     is simply a renumbering.\n       Subsection (d), paragraph (1) sets forth the five \n     categories of value for reporting assets. This changes the \n     current eleven categories to five and eliminates the \n     requirement that liabilities and trusts be reported using the \n     same categories as assets.\n       Paragraph (2) sets forth the alternative methods for \n     valuing an asset. This does not change current alternatives.\n       Paragraph (3) sets forth the four categories of value for \n     reporting liabilities and qualified blind trusts. This is a \n     new provision that sets forth categories of value for \n     reporting liabilities and qualified blind trusts that are \n     different from the categories of value for reporting assets, \n     and provides for only four categories instead of the current \n     eleven.\n       Subsection (e), paragraph (1), subparagraph (A) requires \n     that a report include the sources (but not the amounts) of \n     earned income (including honoraria) earned by the spouse \n     which exceed $500 except that when the spouse is self-\n     employed, only the nature of the business need be reported. \n     This changes the current requirement by lowering the \n     threshold amount from $1,000 to match the $500 threshold for \n     filers, and eliminates the requirement that amounts of \n     honoraria earned by a spouse be reported.\n       Subparagraph (B) requires that the same information \n     regarding investment income required of a filer will be \n     required to be reported for the spouse or dependent child. \n     This changes the current requirement by requiring the \n     reporting of all reportable investment income rather than \n     specifying only income from assets that are required to be \n     reported.\n       Subparagraphs (C) and (D) set forth the reporting \n     requirements for gifts and reimbursements received by a \n     spouse or dependent child. These do not change current \n     requirements.\n       Subparagraph (E) sets forth the test for the certification \n     that would provide an exemption for reporting certain spousal \n     and dependent child's information. There is no change to the \n     longstanding OGE requirement regarding certification, \n     although there is a grammatical correction.\n       Subparagraph (F) specifies that reports filed by nominees, \n     candidates and new entrants need only contain information \n     regarding sources of income, assets and liabilities of a \n     spouse and dependent child. This does not change current \n     requirements.\n       Paragraph (2) provides for the non-disclosure of \n     information of a spouse living separate and apart from the \n     reporting individual with the intention of terminating the \n     marriage or providing for permanent separation or of \n     information relating to income or obligations arising from \n     the dissolution of a marriage or permanent separation. This \n     does not change current authority.\n       Subsection (f), paragraph (1) sets forth the general \n     requirement for reporting information regarding the holdings \n     of and the income from a trust in which the filer, spouse or \n     dependent child has a beneficial interest in principal or \n     income, and references the exceptions. This does not change \n     current requirements.\n       Paragraph (2) describes the three types of trusts for which \n     the holdings and income would not be subject to the general \n     reporting requirements set forth in subparagraph (1). This \n     does not change current descriptions.\n       Paragraph (3) sets forth the requirements for a qualified \n     blind trust. This does not change current requirements except \n     that a reference to trusts qualified prior to January 1, 1991 \n     has been eliminated as no longer necessary.\n       Paragraph (4) sets forth the requirements for a diversified \n     blind trust. This does not change current requirements.\n       Paragraph (5) sets forth the requirements for the public \n     documents that must be filed in relation to a trust. It does \n     not change current requirements except that it eliminates a \n     requirement that the filer file a public copy of a list of \n     the trust assets with the Office of Government Ethics upon \n     dissolution of the trust.\n       Paragraph (6) sets forth the restrictions applicable to the \n     trustee and the reporting individual with regard to \n     disclosing and soliciting certain information about a blind \n     trust and the penalties for violating those restrictions. \n     This does not change current restrictions or penalties.\n       Paragraph (7) sets forth the requirements for qualifying as \n     blind a pre-existing trust. This does not change current \n     requirements.\n       Paragraph (8) sets forth the exception for reporting the \n     financial interests held by a widely held investment fund. \n     This does not change the current exception.\n       Paragraph (9), subparagraph (A) sets forth the requirements \n     that must be met by a new entrant or nominee in order to not \n     disclose the assets of certain trust and investment funds \n     where reporting would result in the disclosure of financial \n     information of another not otherwise required to be report; \n     disclosure of the information is prohibited by contract or \n     the information is not otherwise publicly available; and the \n     reporting individual has agreed to divest of the interest \n     within 90 days of the date of the agreement.\n       This is a new provision included to address the reporting \n     requirements for investment vehicles such as limited \n     partnerships where the filer may not have specific \n     information about the underlying holdings of the fund \n     necessary to complete a financial disclosure form; where the \n     investment manager does not ordinarily disclose his \n     investments; or where other investors do not want the \n     identity of their investments disclosed. In these cases, the \n     filer's agreement to divest, and interim recusals when \n     necessary, adequately address conflict of interest concerns.\n       Subparagraph (B) sets forth the requirements that must be \n     met by annual and termination report filers in order not to \n     disclose the assets of certain trust and investment funds \n     acquired involuntarily during the reporting period and \n     otherwise described by subparagraph (A). This is new and is \n     complementary to subparagraph (A).\n       Subsection (g) provides that financial information \n     regarding political campaign funds is not required to be \n     reported in any report pursuant to the title. This does not \n     change current law.\n       Subsection (h) provides that gifts and reimbursements \n     received when the filer was not an officer or employee need \n     not be included on any report filed pursuant to the title. \n     This does not change current law.\n\n[[Page S13056]]\n\n       Subsection (i) provides that assets, benefits and income \n     from federal retirement systems or Social Security need not \n     be reported.\n       This does not change current law.\n       Subsection (j) provides that Designated Agency Ethics \n     Officers shall submit, on a monthly basis, a list of recently \n     granted criminal conflict-of-interest waivers to the Office \n     of Government Ethics. It further provides that the Office of \n     Government Ethics publish notice of these waivers and of the \n     waivers that has itself granted. This is a new requirement \n     designed to expedite public notice of waivers.\n       Paragraph (k) provides that waivers be included with the \n     filing for the year in which it was granted. This is a new \n     requirement designed to expedite public availability of \n     waivers.\n     Section 203. Filing of reports\n       Subsection (a) provides for the filing of most reports with \n     the agency in which the individual will serve. This does not \n     change current requirements.\n       Subsection (b) provides that the President and Vice \n     President shall file reports with the Director of the Office \n     of Government Ethics. This does not change current \n     requirements for these individuals although it eliminates the \n     reference to Independent Counsels and their staffs.\n       Subsection (c) provides that copies of certain forms that \n     are filed with an agency shall also be transmitted to the \n     Office of Government Ethics. This does not change current \n     requirements.\n       Subsection (d) requires that the reports filed directly \n     with the Office of Government Ethics shall be available \n     immediately to the public. This does not change current \n     requirements.\n       Subsection (e) requires that candidates for President and \n     Vice President shall file with the Federal Election \n     Commission. This does not change current requirements.\n       Subsection (f) requires that reports of members of the \n     uniformed services shall be filed with the Secretary \n     concerned. This does not change current requirements.\n       Subsection (g) provides that the Office of Government \n     Ethics shall develop the forms for reporting for the \n     executive branch. This does not change current requirements.\n     Section 204. Failure to file or filing false reports\n       Subsection (a) provides for civil actions and penalties for \n     knowing and willful falsification and willful failure to file \n     or report information. This does not change current law.\n       Subsection (b) directs OGE, agency heads and Department \n     Secretaries to refer to the Attorney General the names of \n     individuals for whom there is reasonable cause to believe \n     have willfully falsified or willfully failed to file \n     information required to be reported. This does not change \n     current law.\n       Subsection (c) provides for authority to take appropriate \n     administrative action for failure to file or falsifying or \n     failing to report required information. This does not change \n     current law.\n       Subsection (d), paragraph (1) provides a late filing fee of \n     $500. This raises the current fee from $200 to $500.\n       Paragraph (2) provides OGE with the authority to waive a \n     late filing fee for good cause shown. This changes the \n     standard of the test for a waiver from ``extraordinary \n     circumstances.'' Experience has shown a good cause test to be \n     more appropriate to meet the circumstances where OGE has felt \n     that the fee should be waived, particularly when the failure \n     to file on a timely basis has not been the fault of the \n     filer.\n     Section 205. Custody of and public access to reports\n       Subsection (a) sets forth the authority that allows \n     agencies to make the reports filed pursuant to the title \n     public and the authority to except from public release \n     certain reports filed by individuals engaged in intelligence \n     activities. This does not change current requirements.\n       Subsection (b), Paragraph (1) sets forth the requirements \n     for when the reports must become available to the public and \n     the authority to recover reproduction costs. This does not \n     change current requirements.\n       Paragraph (2) sets forth the requirement for a written \n     request in order to obtain a copy of an individual's report. \n     This does not change current requirements.\n       Subsection (c) sets forth the restrictions on obtaining or \n     using a report for specified purposes and the penalties for \n     such unlawful activities. This does not change current law.\n       Subsection (d) provides for the periods a report must be \n     retained and available for public inspection and for its \n     subsequent destruction. This does not change current law.\n     Section 206. Review of reports\n       Subsection (a) sets forth the time during which an agency \n     should review a report filed with it. This does not change \n     current requirements.\n       Subsection (b), paragraphs (1)-(6) set forth the procedures \n     to be followed by a reviewing agency including OGE in seeking \n     to certify a form including steps for assuring compliance \n     with applicable laws. This does not change current procedures \n     except that paragraph (b)(2)(A) clarifies that a reviewer may \n     request additional information if he believes it is necessary \n     for the form to be complete or for conflicts of interest \n     analysis. Current law is more general about why a reviewer \n     may request additional information.\n       Paragraph (7) gives OGE specific authority to render \n     advisory opinions interpreting this title and provides a \n     precedential standard for these opinions. This does not \n     change current law.\n     Section. 207. Confidential reports and other additional \n         requirements\n       Subsection (a) Paragraph (1) gives OGE the authority to \n     establish an additional financial disclosure system for the \n     executive branch. This does not change current authority.\n       Paragraph (2) provides that financial disclosure reports \n     filed pursuant to this authority will be confidential. This \n     does not change current authority.\n       Paragraph (3) makes clear that nothing in this authority \n     exempts an individual from filing publicly information \n     required to be reported elsewhere in the title. This does not \n     change current authority.\n       Subsection (b) provides that this authority shall supersede \n     any general requirement for filing financial information for \n     the purposes of conflicts of interest with the exception of \n     the information required by the Foreign Gifts and Decorations \n     Act. This does not change current law.\n       Subsection (c) makes clear that reporting any information \n     does not authorize the receipt of the reported income, gifts \n     or reimbursements or holding assets, liabilities or \n     positions, or the participation in transactions that are \n     prohibited. This does not change current law.\n     Section 208. Authority of the Comptroller General\n       This section provides the CG with access to any financial \n     disclosure report filed pursuant to this title for the \n     purposes of carrying out his statutory responsibilities. This \n     does not change current law with regard to the access to \n     forms. It does, however, eliminate a current requirement that \n     the CG conduct regular studies of the financial disclosure \n     system. Such elimination is consistent with efforts to \n     eliminate periodic Government reports, but does not in any \n     way affect the CG's authority to conduct such a study on an \n     as needed or requested basis.\n     Section 209. Definitions\n       The following terms are defined: (1) dependent child; (2) \n     designated agency ethics official; (3) executive branch; (4) \n     gift; (5) honoraria; (6) income; (7) personal hospitality of \n     any individual; (8) reimbursement; (9) relative; (10) \n     Secretary concerned; and (11) value. All terms retain their \n     current definitions except ``gift'' no longer includes an \n     exception for consumable products provided by home-State \n     businesses because of its primary relevance for Members of \n     Congress and includes an exception for gifts accepted or \n     reported pursuant to the Foreign Gifts Act; ``honoraria'' no \n     longer references a section of a law that has been ruled \n     unconstitutional and/or unenforceable for the executive \n     branch and instead is now defined as a thing of value for a \n     speech, article or appearance; and ``income'' now \n     specifically includes prizes and awards as a part of the \n     items that are considered income. This changes current law as \n     described above and eliminates individual terms that were \n     only required to be defined if the legislative and/or \n     judicial branch filing requirements were included.\n     Section 210. Notice of actions taken to comply with ethics \n         agreements\n       Subsection (a) sets forth the notification requirements \n     that must be followed by an individual who has agreed to take \n     certain actions in order to avoid conflicts of interest. \n     Notification must first be made no later than the date \n     specified in the agreement or no later than 3 months after \n     the date of the agreement. If all actions have not been \n     taken by the time the first notification is required, the \n     individual must thereafter, on a monthly basis, file such \n     notifications until all agreements are met. Current law \n     only requires one notification; this adds the continuing \n     monthly requirement to report the status of steps taken to \n     comply until all terms of the agreement have been met.\n       Subsection (b) describes the documentation required to be \n     filed for an ethics agreement that includes a promise to \n     recuse. This does not change current requirements.\n     Section 211. Administration of provisions\n       This provides OGE with clear authority to issue \n     regulations, develop forms and provide such guidance as is \n     necessary to implement and interpret this title. This \n     clarifies current law for the executive branch.\n       Sec. 5. Provides that the Executive Clerk of the White \n     House will transmit a list of Presidentially-appointed \n     positions to each presidential candidate following the \n     nominating conventions. This is a change to current law, \n     under which such a list could only be provided to the \n     President-elect after the November election. This section is \n     intended to speed the process of identifying and vetting \n     major Presidential appointees.\n       Sec. 6. Provides that the head of each agency will submit a \n     plan, within 180 days of enactment of the Act, that details \n     the number of Presidentially-appointed positions within the \n     agency and outlines a plan to reduce the number of those \n     positions. This is clearly a new requirement, one intended to \n     begin the dialogue of reducing the large number of appointees \n     and speeding up the process for positions that remain.\n       Sec. 7. Provides that the Attorney General will review the \n     Federal criminal conflict of interest laws and suggest \n     coordination and improvements that might be made. This \n     section is designed to aid in the decriminalization of such \n     laws, in the case when honest mistakes are made in the \n     process of recording extensive financial transactions.\n\n[[Page S13057]]\n\n       Sec. 8. Provides that the amendments made by Section 4 take \n     effect on January 1 of the year following the date of \n     enactment of the Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 1812. A bill to repeat the provision of the September 11th Victim \nCompensation Fund of 2001 that requires the reduction of a claimant's \ncompensation by the amount of any collateral source compensation \npayments the claimant is entitled to receive, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, today along with Senator Torricelli I \nam introducing legislation to ensure that the families who suffered \ntremendous losses in the terrorist attacks on September 11th receive \nthe compensation they deserve and need to move forward with their \nlives. The bill would eliminate provisions in current law that reduce \nthe compensation to which they are entitled because of contributions \nreceived from other sources.\n  New Jersey has been tragically affected by the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11. This past weekend, I met with over 400 family members who \nlost a loved one on the 11th. These people are dealing with \nunimaginable pain, and many are struggling as they try to provide for \nthe security of their families.\n  To obtain assistance, families are being forced to navigate through \nextensive paperwork burdens. They have filled out countless forms and \nmade countless calls seeking answers about the benefits to which they \nare entitled. Yet many fear that, notwithstanding their efforts, they \nwill be unable to secure the assistance that they need so badly.\n  The American people want to help these victims, and Congress has \nacted in an effort to make that happen. Soon after September 11, as \npart of broader legislation to support the airline industry, Congress \nestablished a fund to compensate the victims of the attacks, the \nSeptember 11 Victim Compensation Fund.\n  Under that legislation, victims and their families can choose to seek \ncompensation from the Fund, in return for relinquishing their right to \nfile suit against an airline. Those victims who opt-in are eligible for \nfull economic and non-economic damages, but not punitive damages. The \namount of compensation will be determined by a Special Master, Kenneth \nFeinberg.\n  The purpose of the Fund is to ensure that victims are fully \ncompensated without having to go to court, a process that could take \nmany years for families who urgently need assistance. I support this \ngoal. Unfortunately, in our desire to both aid the industry by limiting \ntheir liability and to provide compensation to the victims and their \nfamilies, we rushed the legislation to enactment without sufficient \nconsideration of how the Fund would operate.\n  As a result, the law contains a glaring flaw. It includes a \n``collateral source'' rule, which requires the Special Master to deduct \nthe amount of life insurance and pension payments from the amount of \ncompensation that would otherwise be available to victims and families \nunder the Fund. This rule, in my view, is a serious mistake, and \nthreatens to deny needed compensation for many of these victims.\n  It is wrong to treat victims of the disaster on September 11 any \ndifferently. Reducing their awards not only harms these families, it \nalso runs counter to the goals of the original legislation. After all, \nif families cannot obtain the compensation they need through the \nVictims Compensation Fund, some of them will be forced to go straight \nto court. That will delay the compensation they need, and subject \nairlines to costs and liability that Congress sought to protect them \nagainst.\n  I would note, that in addition to repealing the collateral source \nrule, my legislation makes clear that charitable donations should not \nbe considered collateral sources and should not count against \ncompensation awarded under the Fund. This no only ensures that families \nget the compensation they need, but its ensures that those who have \nmade charitable contributions are not treated unfairly. After all, \nthose who have generously sent checks to charitable organizations did \nnot think that their contributions would reduce Federal compensation. \nIn effect, such a reduction would be a tax on people who have \ncontributed their own funds in an effort to help. In addition, without \nsuch a clarification, charities may withhold funds for victims until \nafter they recover from the fund, in order to avoid an offset.\n  Recovery under the Victims' Compensation Fund is not the only relief \nthat these grieving families need. Although charities have provided \nsome assistance to families over the past three months, that funding \nhas only been a stopgap measure. These families need immediate tax \nrelief. I am pleased that just before Thanksgiving the Senate passed a \ncomprehensive victims' tax relief bill, but unfortunately the House has \nonly passed a more narrow version of the legislation.\n  These families need immediate relief so that they can plan and \nprovide for their families. They need: a waiver of federal income tax \nliability for this year and last year; payroll tax relief--this is \nparticularly important to low-wage workers, who are less likely to \nbenefit from the waiver of income tax liability, and are also less \nlikely to have left their families with life insurance and pensions; \nreduced estate taxes; exclusion of survivor, disability and emergency \nrelief benefits from taxation; and finally, we need to make it easier \nfor charitable organizations to make disaster relief payments to help \nvictims and their families with both short-term and long-term needs, \nsuch as scholarships for victims' children.\n  Many of these proposals are based on provisions in current law that \nprovide tax relief to soldiers who die in combat and government \nemployees who die in terrorist attacks outside the United States. \nExtending these provisions to the victims of the terrorist attacks is \nappropriate because the attacks of September 11 were attacks on our \nentire nation.\n  Last week some families came down here to meet with the New Jersey \ndelegation and House and Senate leadership to plead for immediate \nassistance, so that they can pay their mortgages, keep children in \nschool, and keep their heads above water. They made their case \npowerfully and effectively, and we in Congress must no let them down.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for these victims and support my \nlegislation. I asks unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no object, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1812\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and __________ (insert \n     name of State agency exercising jurisdiction over pesticide \n     registration and use) registers pesticides for that use. EPA \n     continues to examine registered pesticides to determine that \n     use of the pesticides in accordance with instructions printed \n     on the label does not pose unreasonable risks to human health \n     and the environment. Nevertheless, EPA cannot guarantee that \n     registered pesticides do not pose risks, and unnecessary \n     exposure to pesticides should be avoided. Based in part on \n     recommendations of a 1993 study by the National Academy of \n     Sciences that reviewed registered pesticides and their \n     potential to cause unreasonable adverse effects on human \n     health, particularly on the health of pregnant women, \n     infants, and children, Congress enacted the Food Quality \n     Protection Act of 1996. That law requires EPA to reevaluate \n     all registered pesticides and new pesticides to measure their \n     safety, taking into account the unique exposures and \n     sensitivity that pregnant women, infants, and children may \n     have to pesticides. EPA review under that law is ongoing. You \n     may request to be notified at least 24 hours in advance of \n     pesticide applications to be made and receive information \n     about the applications by registering with the school. \n     Certain pesticides used by the school (including baits, \n     pastes, and gels) are exempt from notification requirements. \n     If you would like more information concerning any pesticide \n     application or any product used at the school, contact \n     __________ (insert name and phone number of contact \n     person).'.\n       ``(B) Notification to persons on registry.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Except as provided in clause (ii) and \n     paragraph (5)--\n\n       ``(I) notice of an upcoming pesticide application at a \n     school shall be provided to each person on the registry of \n     the school not later than 24 hours before the end of the last \n     business day during which the school is in session that \n     precedes the day on which the application is to be made;

Madam President, this has been approved by the minority.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 271, S. 1789.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1789) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act to improve the safety and efficacy of \n     pharmaceuticals for children.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I congratulate my friend from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, \nand my friend from Ohio, Senator DeWine, for bringing us the Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act. Since 1977, we've had great success \nincreasing the number of studies of drugs in children, and it's \nimportant that we reauthorize pediatric exclusivity to continue this \nsuccess. One improvement in this reauthorization is that section 4 of \nyour bill will see to it that, when a drug company declines an FDA \nrequest to study its patented drug for children, the drug will \nnonetheless be studied for children.\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. You bill has these studies being conducted by, for \nexample, universities, hospitals, contract research organizations, and \npediatric pharmacology units. The studies will happen after referral to \nthe Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, which, if it has \nthe money to do so, provides money to the NIH for it to fund the \nstudies, or passes it on to the NIH to pay for the studies with money \nthat the bill itself authorizes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Yes, that's how the process works.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And after the research is conducted, the results are \nsubmitted to the Secretary of Health of Human Services. Once the \nSecretary has received the results, the Secretary, through the FDA, \nanalyzes the information from the studies and determines what is \nnecessary to provide appropriate pediatric labeling of the drug.\n  Mf. DODD. Yes, that is what we intend.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So, it is fair to conclude that pediatric research \nconducted by third parties, using a commercially available drug, and \npaid for by the Foundation of the National Institutes of Health or by \nNIH under your bill, will not infringe any patent on the drug and shall \nbe considered to be an activity conducted for the purpose of \ndevelopment and submission of information to the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Yes, I agree with that conclusion.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \nsupporting and passing the conference report on a bill that Senator \nDodd and I have been working on for some time. This bill, S. 1789, the \nBest Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, is reauthorization legislation \ndesigned to ensure that more medicines are tested for children and that \nuseful prescribing and dosing information appears on labels.\n  Before I say anything else, I'd like to thank Senator Dodd for his \ntireless efforts on behalf of children. He is a true champion for \nchildren. And, passage of our bill today, is just one more example of \nhow he has dedicated so much of his time and energy to protect our \nNation's kids, our Nation's future.\n  Our Best Pharmaceuticals bill is really vital in protecting our \nchildren when they are sick. This bill will make sure that we test \ndrugs for kids on kids. Right now, most drugs are designed and tested \non and for use by adults. Prescribing medicine for children is \ndifficult for a variety of reasons. Proper dosing depends on a child's \nweight and metabolisms. Furthermore, children's bodies grow and change \nquickly. Children also may not give doctors accurate information about \nhow medicines are affecting them, making diagnoses difficult, involving \na large-degree of guess work.\n  A recent six-week study in Boston, at two of its most well-respected \nhospitals, found that over that time, 616 prescriptions written for \nchildren contained errors. Of those, 26 actually harmed children. Of \nthe errors that were caught before the medication was administered, 18 \ncould have been fatal. And, a study in the a recent Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association, found that medication errors in hospitals \noccur three times more frequently with children than with adults.\n  Four years ago, Senator Dodd and I first learned that the vast \nmajority of drugs in this country that came on the market every week, \nin fact over 80 percent, had never been formally tested or approved for \npediatric use and therefore lacked even the most basic labeling \ninformation regarding dosing recommendations for children. When we \nfound that out, we began writing what is now referred to as the \npediatric exclusivity law. In the three years since that law went into \neffect, the FDA has issued about 200 written requests for pediatric \nstudies.\n\n[[Page S13071]]\n\n  Companies have undertaken over 400 pediatric studies, of which over \n58 studies have been completed, for a wide range of critical diseases, \nincluding juvenile diabetes, the problem of pain, asthma, and \nhypertension.\n  Thirty-seven drugs have been granted pediatric exclusivity. Some \nstudies generated by this incentive have led to essential dosing \ninformation. Take, for example, the drug, Luvox. Luvox is a drug \nprescribed to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder. Pediatric studies \nperformed pursuant to our law have shown inadequate dosing for \nadolescents, which resulted in ineffective treatment. The studies also \nhave shown that some girls between the ages of eight and 11 were \npotentially overdosed, with levels up to two to three times that which \nwas really needed.\n  Our Better Pharmaceuticals law has done a great deal of good. We are \nseeing more drugs for children on the market that have a label that \ntells how they can be used, and more basic information for \npediatricians. So when they look at that little child and they know the \nage of that child and they know the weight of that child, doctors can \nlook it up and see exactly what the prescription should be, what the \ndosage should be, what the indicators are for that child. They can do \nthat because we have given the pharmaceutical companies an incentive to \ndo the research, research they were doing in only 20 percent of the \ncases prior to passage of the Better Pharmaceuticals law.\n  Despite our progress, we have further to go. That's why we passed the \nBest Pharmaceuticals conference report today. Senator Dodd and I and \nthe other cosponsors knew that the Better Pharmaceuticals bill, could \nbe improved. We knew that it had some holes in it. We set out to fill \nthose gaps and address the outstanding issues, such as the testing of \noff-patent drugs, which the original law was never designed to include.\n  In the conference report we passed today, we have built upon the \nexisting law's basic incentive structure to further ensure that we will \nhelp improve the medication labeling process. Since our law has not \nbeen implemented for very long, many labels are still in the process of \nbeing requested and negotiated by the FDA. In our legislation, the new \ntimeframes established for labeling negotiations, together with the \nenforcement authority under the existing misbranding statute, will help \nensure that essential pediatric information generated from studies \nimplemented under this law, will result in necessary and timely \nlabeling changes. tested for children.\n  Our legislation creates a mechanism to ``capture'' the off-patent \ndrugs for which the Secretary determines additional studies are needed \nto assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug's use in the \npediatric population. In other words, our bill provides for the testing \nof some cases of these off-patent drugs.\n  By expanding the mission of the existing NIH Foundation to include \ncollecting and awarding grants for conducting certain pediatric \nstudies, we have provided a funding mechanism for ensuring studies that \nare completed for both off-patent drugs and those marketed on-patent \ndrugs that a company declines to study--and for which the Secretary \ndetermines there is a continuing need for information relating to the \nuse of the drug in the pediatric population.\n  By first seeking funding through the Foundation, we provide a \nmechanism for drug companies to contribute to the funding of mainly \noff-patent drugs and also to a narrow group of on-patent drugs, \nincluding those for neonates, for which companies have declined to \naccept the written request to pursue the six month market exclusivity \nextension.\n  Finally, to further ensure that the safety of children in clinical \ntrials is protected, our legislation requires that the Institute of \nMedicine, IOM, conduct a review of Federal regulations, reports, and \nresearch involving children and provide recommendations on best \npractices relating to research Senator Dodd and I included as part of \nthe Children's Health Act last year.\n  In conclusion, I again thank Senator Dodd for his efforts, along with \nSenators Frist, Kennedy, Bond, Collins, and Clinton. Their support and \ndedication to children is what is behind this legislation. Because of \nthem, we are sending this conference report to the President for his \nsignature. I thank them for their work and their commitment to \nchildren.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record, \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1789) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1789\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, mental illnesses inflicted by tragedies \nlike the assault on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon are a \nserious problem. Every American family is at risk, whether a loved one \nworked at the World Trade Center or the Pentagon, or whether the family \nsimply watched the attack on television from a continent away. Studies \nof other disasters teach us that the most vulnerable are those who are \nmost directly affected, but even those less directly touched by these \ntragedies are vulnerable.\n  The hearing on September 26 made it clear that Congress has an \nobligation to assure that these mental health needs are met and that we \nare better prepared for the mental health consequences of future \ntragedies. Our witnesses, as well as other experts in the field, \nidentified four key needs: better advance planning and preparedness, \ntraining of mental health professionals to treat the specific mental \nhealth needs arising from disasters, resources to identify and treat \nthose who will suffer long-term mental health problems as a result of \nthe September 11 attack, research on how to improve our responses to \nthe needs of disaster victims.\n  The legislation passed through the Senate today by unanimous consent \nintended to meet all four of these needs. This help is essential for \nthe individuals and families who were injured or lost a loved one, for \nthe brave public safety officers who put their lives on the line trying \nto rescue or recover victims, and for the many other Americans of all \nages in communities across the country who have suffered psychological \ntrauma as the result of these\n\n[[Page S13077]]\n\nattacks. The bill was developed in close collaboration with Senator \nWarner. Senator Frist, Senator Clinton, Senator Wellstone, and Senator \nGregg made important contributions and I thank them for their efforts.\n  It is my hope that it will be approved by the House, and that it will \nbe followed by an adequate allocation of funds to help all those who \nneed it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, yesterday marked the three month \nanniversary of one of the most tragic days in American history. While \nthe loathsome, cowardly acts of terrorism that took place on September \n11, 2001 have deeply wounded our country, they have not, and never \nwill, dull the spirit and resolve of the American people.\n  My thoughts and prayers continue to be with those who lost loved ones \non that horrific day. And, I continue to express my deepest \nappreciation to the thousands of individuals who stepped up on the face \nof danger to assist in the devastating aftermath at the Pentagon, the \nWorld Trade Center, and at the Pennsylvania crash site.\n  The Congress has come together, speaking with a unified bipartisan \nvoice, on several pieces of legislation. Members of Congress have \njoined together in support of our President and his determination to \npunish the perpetrators of these attacks. We have joined together on \nlegislation to help law enforcement prevent additional acts of \nterrorism and to help law enforcement bring terrorists to justice. We \nhave also come together to provide additional resources to bolster our \npublic health infrastructure to better prepare this country in the \nevent of a more widespread biological attack.\n  I rise today to express my gratitude for my colleagues' willingness \nto work in a bipartisan fashion on yet another piece of legislation in \nresponse to the September 11 attacks. On November 27, 2001, the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee reported out legislation to \nprovide assistance with the mental health needs of individuals affected \nby the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n  Today, I am pleased to report that this legislation, which I worked \nso closely on with Senators Kennedy, Frist, and Gregg, has passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent.\n  The legislation has three main components. First, it authorizes the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to provide grants to areas that \nare directly affected by the attacks of September 11, 2001, such as \nNorthern Virginia and New York City. Grants can be used by State and \nlocal governments to respond to the long-term mental health needs \narising from that disaster, particularly for the treatment of those \nindividuals who do not have mental health insurance coverage or who are \nunder-insured.\n  Second, the bill permits the Secretary to provide grants for training \nmental health professionals in the treatment of certain disorders, such \nas post traumatic stress disorder, that may result from disasters.\n  Finally, the legislation permits the Secretary to make grants to \nStates and localities to develop a coordinated mental health response \nplan in the event of a future disaster.\n  While the extent of the long term mental health consequences of \nSeptember 11, 2001 are not entirely known, the needs are certain to be \nserious. This legislation makes it clear that Congress is committed to \nmeeting the essential mental health needs of the individuals and \nfamilies who were injured or killed in the terrorist attacks on this \ngreat Nation.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; the \nbill, as amended, be read the third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action, and that \nany statements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2503) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1729), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/12/senate-section/article/S13077-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13077-S13078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION COMPLIANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to Calendar No. 256, H.R. 3323.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3323) to ensure that covered entities comply \n     with the standards for electronic health care transactions \n     and code sets adopted under part C of title XI of the Social \n     Security Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3323) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, today the Senate has passed H.R. 3323, a \nbill that waives the penalties for state health programs, health care \nproviders, and health plans that are unable to comply with the \ntransactions and code sets regulation of the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act by October 16, 2002. This bill is \ndifferent from the bill passed by the Senate on November 27, and \nfrankly, I would prefer that we simply provide the one-year extension \nto those entities that need it, as provided for in the Senate bill. \nHowever, the time remaining in this session of Congress is short, and \nthe House bill will offer a measure of help to those in our states.\n  The House bill would require that, in order to receive a waiver, \nthose entities needing more time to comply with the transactions and \ncode sets regulation would have to submit a plan to the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services explaining how they plan to come into \ncompliance by October 16, 2003. When Senator Craig and I first \nintroduced legislation on this issue more than six months ago, we are \nattempting to help alleviate a burden on covered entities. It is not \nour intention in passing this bill to place a significant new burden on \nhealth care providers, states, and health plans.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I share Senator Dorgan's concern that the \ncompliance plans called for in the House bill not be unduly burdensome. \nThe terrorist attacks of September 11th, and concern about \nbioterrorism, are putting an additional pressure on our already \novertaxed public health system, so imposing new burdens is something we \nshould try to minimize. Therefore, we strongly encourage Health and \nHuman Services Secretary Thompson to ensure that the requirement to \nfile a compliance plan imposes as little a burden as possible.\n  Mr. BAYH. I want to associate myself with the remarks of my \ncolleagues, Senators Dorgan and Craig. As a former governor, I also \nwant to raise a potential concern that has been brought to my attention \nby some states. The Medicaid program is explicitly covered by HIPAA, \nbut there are many other state programs with health components that may \nor may not be covered. Before states go through the potentially \nunnecessary work of submitting compliance plans that may not be needed, \nI feel strongly that HHS should provide guidance to states about what \nother plans are required. In addition, HHS should provide technical \nassistance as to what resources states can use for developing the \ncompliance plans called for by the House bill. States should submit \ntheir plans for the Medicaid program and receive guidance from the HHS \nbefore submitting state plans that deal with other programs. Only with \nthe appropriate and critical information can HHS and the states create \na successful partnership.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator for raising this important concern. I \nagree that HHS should provide states with the necessary guidance. I \nalso want to note that when Senator Craig and I first introduced \nlegislation on this issue it was our intention not to affect the \nimplementation of the medical privacy regulation. I'm pleased that this \nbill accomplishes that goal, and the medical records privacy rule will \nnot be delayed or affected in any way.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I, too, am glad that we have been able to protect the \nprivacy rule, and I want to make one final point in that regard. \nNothing in this\n\n\n[[Page S13078]]\n\nbill is designed to create any new covered entities under the privacy \nrule. Our intention in safeguarding the privacy rule was to keep it \nintact but not to expand the class of covered entities currently \ncontemplated by it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. In closing, I thank Senator Craig for his long and hard \nwork on this issue, as well as Senators Baucus, Grassley, Kennedy, and \nthe many cosponsors of our original legislation, for their help in \nreaching enactment of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/12/senate-section/article/S13078-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS\n\n  Mr. REID.
