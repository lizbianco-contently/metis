Madam President, it is a privilege for me to \ncall to the attention of the Senate that our guest Chaplain today is \nfrom Orlando, FL. He is quite a noteworthy individual, and that is why \nI had particularly requested of our leadership the opportunity that he \nmight come and be our guest Chaplain. Not only has Jim Henry been the \npastor of the largest church in the central Florida area since 1977, \nbut he rose to the rank of the president of the Southern Baptist \nConvention.\n  The reason I make note of that is that a schism among church \nleadership had occurred and they needed a leader of that convention, \nsomeone who could be a reconciler, a healer, who could bring people \ntogether in the midst of their differences.\n  We deal with that every day here, but we are dealing in the political \nworld\n\n[[Page S3338]]\n\nwhere, as the Good Book says, we should come and reason together, work \nout our differences, achieve consensus, and try to help govern the \nNation in a way that the people would want the Nation governed.\n  So, too, as many other things, including in the faith-based arena, we \nfind deep schisms and we find a difficulty in people coming together. \nWe have seen that, unfortunately, throughout the history of man. So \noften religion has been the dividing factor that has called people to \nwar, to hate, and to kill. We see that among a faith that ought to be a \nunifying case in Northern Ireland. Yet because one group calls \nthemselves Protestant and another Catholic, they have chosen the path \nof war. We see that now where the United States has so much interest in \ncentral Asia as a result of one religion playing off against another, \npeople attacking us because of religion.\n  In the Scriptures, from the ancient Scriptures in the Old Testament \nthrough to the New Testament, we find the true word of the Lord was \nthat He wanted people to love one another, to bring people together, to \nbe reconcilers instead of dividers. I share that little glimpse into \nhistory which was taught in the Old Testament. Clearly, the message of \nJesus of Nazareth was: Love God, and love others as yourself. That was \nthe sum of all the law that had been handed down.\n  I share this little religious history lesson as I proudly introduce \nmy friend, Jim Henry. He found himself in a position where he had to be \na reconciler, a healer, someone who brought people together in the \nmidst of a storm. I am very honored that our guest Chaplain today has \nbeen the Reverend Jim Henry from the First Baptist Church of Orlando.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3338-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF PERCY ANDERSON, OF CALIFORNIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n         DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, today, the Senate is voting on the 47th \nand 48th judicial nominees to be confirmed since last July when the \nSenate Judiciary Committee reorganized after the shift in the Senate \nmajority. With today's votes on Percy Anderson and Jack Walter to the \nU.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the Senate \nwill have confirmed its 38th and 39th district court judges in the less \nthan 10 months since I became chairman this past summer. This is \naddition to the 9 judges confirmed to the Courts of Appeals. So the \ntotal number of Federal judges confirmed since the change in Senate \nmajority will now be 48. Moreover, with the confirmations of these \nnominees, the Senate will have resolved 9 judicial emergencies since we \nreturned to session and helped fill 16 emergency vacancies since I \nbecame chairman this past summer. The confirmation of these nominees \ntoday demonstrates, again, the speed with which President Bush's \nnominees are receiving consideration by the Judiciary Committee and the \nSenate.\n  Percy Anderson, is a nominee to the U.S. District Court in the \nDistrict of California. He is filling a judicial emergency vacancy that \nhas been pending for more than 1,360 days. Mr. Anderson was nominated \nto fill the vacancy left by the elevation of Kim McLane Wardlaw in \n1998. I recall that President Clinton nominated Frederic Woocher to \nfill this judicial emergency vacancy on May 27, 1999. Mr. Woocher was \none of those who received a hearing before the Judiciary Committee but \nwas never placed on the agenda to receive a vote. He was one of the \nlucky judicial nominees who got a hearing, with the support of his \nhome-state Senators, but his nomination was ultimately frustrated by \nnever being considered by the Judiciary Committee. Like Allen Snyder of \nthe District of Columbia, Bonnie\n\n[[Page S3339]]\n\nCampbell of Iowa, Clarence Sundram of New York, Anabelle Rodriguez and \nothers, he was never allowed Judiciary Committee consideration and \nnever received a vote. After 19 months, his nomination was returned to \nPresident Clinton, without receiving a vote in the Judiciary Committee \nat the time the Senate adjourned at the end of 2000.\n  Jack Walter, a well-qualified nominee to the Central District of \nCalifornia with excellent federal court experience, is nominated to \nfill the vacancy left by the retirement of Judge John G. Davies in \n1998. That seat is a judicial emergency vacancy that has been vacant \nfor more than 1,370 days--almost 4 years. I recall that President \nClinton nominated Dolly M. Gee to fill this judicial emergency vacancy \non May 27, 1999. Her nomination was returned to President Clinton, \nwithout any action by the Senate, at the end of 2000. After 19 months, \nthat nomination, which was supported by both home-State Senators was \nreturned to the President without a hearing or any consideration and \nwas one of the scores of nominees on which the Senate did not take \naction over the 6\\1/2\\ years that preceded the shift in majority.\n  Federal court vacancies rose from 63 in January 1995 to 110 in July \n2001, when the Senate majority shifted back to the Democrats and the \nJudiciary Committee was reassigned Members for this Congress. For \nexample, the Central District in California currently has six \nvacancies. Today we are acting to fill two of those vacancies on this \nimportant Court. I can certainly understand the interest of Chief Judge \nMarshall of that District and why she attended the committee hearing on \nthese nominations 2 weeks ago to support these nominees. I say to Chief \nJudge Marshall, help should be on the way very soon. I commend Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Boxer for their efforts to get these vacancies \nfilled with qualified nominees.\n  I recall that in the 6\\1/2\\ years that preceded the shift in Senate \nextensive delays attended even those nominations that were ultimately \nsuccessful. That is, in spite of the strong support of the two Senators \nfrom California, judicial nominations for the District Court that \nserves Los Angeles, one of the fastest growing areas in the nation with \na staggering caseload, were greated delayed if considered at all. We \nare trying to change that practice. During the years of a Republican \nSenate majority nominees such as Judge Virginia Phillips, Judge \nChristina Snyder, and Judge Margaret Morrow were delayed for months and \nmonths.\n  Virginia Phillips was first nominated back in May 1998 to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the District Court and was not confirmed \nuntil November 1999. Christina Snyder was first nominated to the \nDistrict Court in May 1996 and was not confirmed until November 1997--\n542 days after her initial nomination. The case of Judge Margaret \nMorrow is particularly egregious--she was pending before the Senate for \n16 months, had to be reported favorably on two occasions by the \nJudiciary Committee, was held up by an anonymous hold on the Senate \nfloor calendar over a period of more than 7 months, and was not \nconfirmed until 644 days after the date of her initial nomination.\n  In contrast, the Democratic-controlled Judiciary Committee is moving \nexpeditiously to fill the judicial emergency vacancies in the Central \nDistrict of California. Mr. Anderson and Mr. Walter were not nominated \nuntil late January this year. They promptly received a hearing on their \nnominations on April 11, 2002, once the paperwork on their nominations \nwas received and within three weeks of the Committee having received \ntheir ABA peer review ratings. Had the Administration not taken action \nthat resulted in delaying the ABA peer reviews, the time might well \nhave been even faster.\n\n  Senator Hatch noted at their hearing that both of these nominees were \nfirst nominated in the last year of the Administration of President \nGeorge H.W. Bush and did not have hearings before the end of that \nSenate session in October 1992. I recall that 66 judges were confirmed \nduring the last year of the Bush administration, which set a record, \nbut I do not know why these nominations were not considered. For anyone \nto try to assert that these nominations have been pending for over 10 \nyears, however, would be extraordinarily unfair and wrong. They were \nnot confirmed in 1992, and not renominated for 10 years, until January \n2002. These nominations were not sent to the Senate until this January \nand the files were not completed until late March. Indeed, for them to \nhave been pending for 10 years the Republican Senate majority that \ncontrolled judicial nominations from January 1995 through July 2001 \nwould be at fault. I would not make that criticism of the Senate \nRepublicans of my predecessor as chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  The confirmation of these nominees today demonstrates our commitment \npromptly to consider qualified, consensus nominees. Mr. Walter and Mr. \nAnderson participated in bipartisan selection processes, and they are \nthe first two nominees who have emerged from a bipartisan selection \nprocess that Senators Feinstein and Boxer established last year with \nthe administration. Both Mr. Anderson and Mr. Walter received unanimous \nsupport from the bipartisan commission and appear to be well-qualified. \nBoth come to the Senate with more than 25 years' experience as trial \nattorneys. I would like to commend Senators Feinstein and Boxer for \ntheir efforts to establish the bipartisan commission which has produced \nsuch fine nominees.\n  The Senate's consideration of these nominations illustrates the \neffect of the reforms to the process that the Democratic leadership has \nspearheaded, despite the poor treatment of too many Democratic nominees \nin the past. There have been no anonymous holds and other \nobstructionist tactics employed with regard to these nominees even \nthough such tactics were employed with the nominations of Judge Morrow, \nJudge Snyder, Judge Phillips, Mr. Woocher and Ms. Gee.\n  As our action today demonstrates, again, we are moving at a fast pace \nand confirming conservative nominees. Since the change in Senate \nmajority, the Democratic majority has moved to confirm President Bush's \nnominees at a faster pace than the nominees of prior Presidents. The \nrate of confirmations in the past 10 months actually exceeds the rates \nof confirmation in the past three presidencies. It took 15 months for \nthe Senate to confirm 46 judicial nominees for the Clinton \nadministration. We have exceeded that number of confirmations today and \nin five fewer months. Also, in 1993, President Clinton had a Senate led \nby his own party, and we are considering Republican President George W. \nBush's nominees at a faster pace in the Democratic-led Senate. The pace \nat the beginning of the Clinton administration amounted to the \nconfirmation of 3.1 judges confirmed per month.\n  In the first 15 months of the George H.W. Bush administration, only \n27 judges were confirmed. The pace at the beginning of the George H.W. \nBush administration amounted to 1.8 judges confirmed per month. In \nPresident Reagan's first 15 months in office, 54 judges were confirmed. \nThe pace at the beginning of the Reagan administration amounted to 3.6 \njudges confirmed per month. By comparison, with today's confirmations, \nin the less than 10 months since the shift to a Democratic majority in \nthe Senate, President Bush's judicial nominees have been confirmed at a \nrate of 4.8 per month, a faster pace than for any of the last three \nPresidents.\n  During the preceding 6\\1/2\\ years in which a Republican majority most \nrecently controlled the pace of judicial confirmations in the Senate, \n248 judges were confirmed. Some like to talk about the 377 judges \nconfirmed during the Clinton administration, but forget to mention that \nmore than one-third were confirmed during the first two years of the \nClinton administration while the Senate majority was Democratic and \nSenator Biden chaired the Judiciary Committee. The pace of \nconfirmations under a Republican majority was markedly slower, \nespecially in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000.\n  During the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the Senate, judicial \nconfirmations averaged 38 per year--a pace of consideration and \nconfirmation that we have already exceeded under Democratic leadership \nin fewer than 10 months, in spite of all of the challenges facing \nCongress and the Nation during this period and all of the obstacles \nRepublicans have placed in our path. We have confirmed 48 judicial \nnominees in\n\n[[Page S3340]]\n\nless than 10 months. This is almost twice as many confirmations as \nGeorge W. Bush's father had over a longer period--27 nominees in 15 \nmonths--than the period Democrats have been in the Senate majority.\n  Our Republican critics like to make arguments based on false rather \nthan fair comparisons. They complain that we have not done 24 months of \nwork in the less than 10 months we have been in the majority. That is \nan unfair complaint. A fair examination of the rate of confirmation \nshows, however, that Democrats are working harder and faster on \njudicial nominees, confirming judges at a faster pace than the rates of \nthe past 20 years.\n  I ask myself how Republicans can justify seeking to hold the \nDemocratic majority in the Senate to a different standard than the one \nthey met themselves during the last 6\\1/2\\ years. There simply is no \nanswer other than partisanship. This double standard is most apparent \nwhen Republicans refuse fairly to compare the progress we are making \nwith the period in which they were in the Senate majority with a \nPresident of the other party. They do not want to talk about that \nbecause we have exceeded the number of judges they confirmed per year.\n  They would rather unfairly compare the work of the Senate on \nconfirmations in the less than 10 months since the shift in majority to \nfull, 2-year Congresses. I say that it is quite unfair to complain that \nwe have not done 24 months of work on judicial vacancies in the less \nthan 10 months since the Senate reorganized. These double standards \nasserted by the Republicans are wrong and unfair, but that does not \nseem to matter to Republicans intent on criticizing and belittling \nevery achievement of the Senate under a Democratic majority.\n\n  The Republican critics also refuse to recognize the fact that we are \nmaking progress with respect to Court of Appeals vacancies, as well. \nWith this week's vote on Jeffrey Howard to the Court of Appeals for the \n1st Circuit, the Senate confirmed its 9th judge to our Federal Courts \nof Appeals. In less than 10 months since I became Chairman this past \nsummer, the Senate has confirmed 9 judges to the Courts of Appeals and \nheld hearings on two others, with another circuit judge hearing \nscheduled for tomorrow. This is more circuit judges than were confirmed \nin all 12 months of 2000, 1999, 1997, and 1996, 4 of the 6 years of \nRepublican control of the Senate during the Clinton administration. It \nis triple the number of circuit judges confirmed in 1993, when a \nDemocratic Senate majority was working with a President of the same \nparty and received some cooperation from the Clinton administration. It \nexceeds the number of Court of Appeals judges confirmed by a Republican \nSenate majority in the first 12 months of the Reagan administration and \nit equals the number of circuit judges confirmed in the first 12 months \nof the first Bush administration.\n  The Republican-controlled majority averaged only seven confirmations \nto the Courts of Appeals per year. Seven. In the less than 10 months \nthe Democrats have been in the majority, we have already exceeded the \nannual number of Court of Appeals judges confirmed by our predecessors. \nIn an entire session of the 105th Congress, the Republican majority did \nnot confirm a single judge to fill vacancies on the Courts of Appeals. \nThat year has greatly contributed to the doubling of vacancies on the \nCourts of Appeals during the time in which the Republican majority \ncontrolled the Senate.\n  The Republican majority assumed control of judicial confirmation in \nJanuary 1995 and did not allow the Judiciary Committee to be \nreorganized after the shift in majority last summer until July 10, \n2001. During the period in which the Republican majority controlled the \nSenate and in which they delayed reorganization, the period from \nJanuary 1995 through July 2001, vacancies on the Courts of Appeals \nincreased from 16 to 33, more than doubling.\n  When members were finally assigned to the Judiciary Committee on July \n10, we began with 33 Court of Appeals vacancies. That is what I \ninherited. Since the shift in majority last summer, 5 additional \nvacancies have arisen on the Courts of Appeals around the country. With \nthis week's confirmation of Jeffrey Howard, we have reduced the number \nof circuit court vacancies to 29. Rather than the 38 vacancies that \nwould exist if we were making no progress, as some have asserted, there \nnow remain 29 vacancies. That is more than keeping up with the \nattrition on the Circuit Courts.\n  While the Republican Senate majority increased vacancies on the \nCourts of Appeals by over 100 percent, it has taken the Democratic \nmajority less than 10 months to reverse that trend, keep up with \nextraordinary turnover and, in addition, reduce circuit court vacancies \nby more than 10 percent overall, from 33 down to 29, or 12.1 percent. \nThis is progress. Rather than having the circuit vacancy numbers \nskyrocketing, as they did overall during the prior 6\\1/2\\ years--more \nthan doubling from 16 to 33--the Democratic-led Senate has reversed \nthat trend. The vacancy rate on the Courts of Appeals is moving in the \nright direction--down.\n  Despite claims to the contrary, under Democratic leadership, the \nSenate is confirming President Bush's Circuit Court nominees more \nquickly than the nominees of other Presidents were confirmed by \nSenates, even some with majorities from the President's own party. The \nnumber of confirmations to the Circuit Courts has exceeded those who \nwere confirmed over 10-month time frames at the beginning of past \nadministrations. With the confirmation of Jeffrey Howard, 9 Circuit \nCourt nominees will have been confirmed in less than 10 months. This \nnumber greatly exceeds the number of Court of Appeals confirmations in \nthe first 10 months of the Reagan administration (three), the first \nBush administration (three), and the Clinton administration (two). This \nis three times the number of Court of Appeals nominees confirmed in the \ncomparable 10-month periods of past administrations. With nine circuit \njudges confirmed in the less than 10 months since the Senate \nreorganized under Democratic leadership, we have greatly exceeded the \nnumber of circuit judges confirmed at the beginning of prior \npresidencies. Our achievements also compare quite favorably to the \ntotal 46 Court of Appeals nominees confirmed by the Republican majority \nin the 76 months during which they most recently controlled the Senate. \nTheir inaction led to the number of Courts of Appeals vacancies more \nthan doubling. With a Democratic Senate majority, the number of circuit \nvacancies is going down.\n  Overall, in little less than 10 months, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has held 16 hearings involving 55 judicial nominations and we \nwill have our 17th hearing this week. That is more hearings on judges \nthan the Republican majority held in any year of its control of the \nSenate. In contrast, one-sixth of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees--more than 50--never got a committee hearing and committee \nvote from the Republican majority, which perpetuated longstanding \nvacancies into this year. Vacancies continue to exist on the Courts of \nAppeals in part because a Republican majority was not willing to hold \nhearings or vote on more than half--56 percent--of President Clinton's \nCourt of Appeals nominees in 1999 and 2000 and was not willing to \nconfirm a single judge to the Courts of Appeals during the entire 1996 \nsession.\n  Despite the newfound concern from across the aisle about the number \nof vacancies on the circuit courts, no nominations hearings were held \nwhile the Republicans controlled the Senate last year. No judges were \nconfirmed during that time from among the many qualified circuit court \nnominees received by the Senate on January 3, 2001, or from among the \nnominations received by the Senate on May 9, 2001. Had the Republicans \nnot delayed and obstructed progress on Court of Appeals nominees during \nthe Clinton administration, we would not now have so many vacancies. \nHad the Republicans even reversed course just this past year and \nproceeded on the circuit court nominees sent to the Senate in January, \nthe number of circuit court vacancies today could be in the low 20's, \ngiven the pace of confirmation of circuit nominees since the shift in \nmajority last summer.\n  I do not mean by my comments to appear critical of Senator Hatch. \nMany times during the 6\\1/2\\ years he chaired the Judiciary Committee, \nI observed that, were the matter left up to us, we would have made more \nprogress on more judicial nominees. I thanked him during those years \nfor his efforts. I know that he would have liked to have\n\n[[Page S3341]]\n\nbeen able to do more and not have to leave so many vacancies and so \nmany nominees without action.\n  I hope to continue to hold hearings and make progress on judicial \nnominees. In our efforts to address the number of vacancies on the \ncircuit and district courts we inherited from the Republicans, the \nCommittee has focused on consensus nominees for all Senators. In order \nto respond to what Vice President Cheney and Senator Hatch now call a \nvacancy crisis, the Committee has focused on consensus nominees. This \nwill help end the crisis caused by Republican delay and obstruction by \nconfirming as many of the President's judicial nominees as quickly as \npossible.\n  Most Senators understand that the more controversial nominees require \ngreater review. This process of careful review is part of our \ndemocratic process. It is a critical part of the checks and balances of \nour system of government that does not give the power to make \nlifetime appointments to one person alone to remake the courts along \nnarrow ideological lines, to pack the courts with judges whose views \nare outside of the mainstream of legal thought, and whose decisions \nwould further divide our nation.\n\n  The committee continues to try to accommodate Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. The Court of Appeals nominees included at hearings \nso far this year have been at the request of Senators Grassley, Lott, \nSpecter, Enzi and Smith from New Hampshire five Republican Senators who \neach sought a prompt hearing on a Court of Appeals nominee who was not \namong those initially sent to the Senate in May 2001. Each of the \nprevious 46 nominees confirmed by the Senate has received the \nunanimous, bipartisan backing of the committee.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle have falsely charged that if a \nnominee has a record as a conservative Republican, he will not be \nconsidered by the Committee. That is simply untrue. Senator Hatch has \nemphasized that Mr. Anderson and Mr. Walter were nominated by the \nGeorge H.W. Bush Administration and the current Bush Administration. I \ndo not think that either President Bush thought he was nominating \nliberals to the bench. I do not think so either. These are two more \nexamples of conservative nominees being strongly supported by Democrats \non the Judiciary Committee and throughout the Senate.\n  Another recent example is the nomination of Jeffrey Howard. Just 2 \nyears ago, he campaigned for the Republican nomination for Governor of \nNew Hampshire and he has been a prominent figure in Republican politics \nin New Hampshire for many years. Thus, it would be wrong to claim that \nwe will not consider President George W. Bush's nominees with \nconservative credentials. We have done so repeatedly. The next time \nRepublican critics are bandying around charges that the Democratic \nmajority has failed to consider conservative judicial nominees, I hope \nsomeone will ask those critics about the many other conservative \nnominees we have proceeded to consider and confirm.\n  The nominees being voted on today participated in bipartisan \nselection processes and appear to be the type of qualified, consensus \nnominees that the Senate has been confirming expeditiously to help fill \nvacancies on our Federal courts. I am proud of the tremendous work we \nhave done since the change in the majority and the way the committee \nand the Senate have considered nominees fairly and promptly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to support the nomination of Percy \nAnderson to be U.S. District Judge for the Central District of \nCalifornia.\n  It should be noted that the first President Bush nominated Mr. \nAnderson to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia in 1992, but regrettably, the Democratic Senate did not hold \na hearing for him. After reviewing Mr. Anderson's distinguished legal \ncareer, I can tell you that he is a fine jurist who will add a great \ndeal to the Federal bench in California. Following graduation from UCLA \nSchool of Law in 1975, Percy Anderson served as a Directing Attorney \nand Staff Attorney with San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal \nServices, representing indigent clients in civil matters.\n  In addition, he helped less experienced lawyers with trial \npreparation and courtroom presentation in matters before the Superior \nand Municipal Court in Los Angeles. He then acted as a consultant for \nthe Legal Services Corporation in the District of Columbia, before \ntaking a position as an Assistant U.S. Attorney of the Criminal \nDivision in Los Angeles.\n  For the next 6 years, he served as First Assistant Division Chief, \nsupervising other attorneys and managing criminal division affairs in \nthe absence of the Division Chief. He joined the Bryan Cave law firm in \n1985, specializing in white collar criminal defense and aviation \nlitigation, particularly products liability. In 1996, Mr. Anderson \nbecame a partner with the Los Angeles firm of Sonnenschein Nath & \nRosenthal. He focuses his practice on trial and appellate litigation in \nthe areas of commercial matters, intellectual property, products \nliability, false claims, and white collar criminal defense work. Mr. \nAnderson has home State support and my support. He will make an \nexcellent Federal judge in California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, it is my pleasure to rise in support \nof the nominations of Percy Anderson and Jack Walter for the District \nCourt of the Central District of California.\n  Mr. Anderson and Mr. Walter are the first nominees to come out of \nCalifornia's new bipartisan Judicial Advisory Committee, which Senator \nBoxer and I established with the cooperation and agreement of the White \nHouse. It is testament to the qualifications of both Mr. Anderson and \nMr. Percy that each of these nominees was unanimously endorsed by the \nbipartisan advisory committee. Moreover, the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously approved their nominations.\n  The process that led to these nominations is representative of how \nthe system can work, and should work, to produce highly qualified \njudicial candidates. This process should serve as an example to other \nstates as they too, work with the White House to develop nominating \nsystems. Now, I would like to describe the nominees.\n  Mr. Anderson, a resident of Inglewood, CA, has spent his entire 25-\nyear legal career practicing law in southern California including a 6-\nyear stint as an Assistant U.S. Attorney and 15 years in private \npractice. He is currently a partner at the firm of Sonneschein, Nath, \nand Rosenthal, where he specializes in commercial litigation and \ncriminal defense. Judges and private practitioners in the Los Angeles \narea consistently praise Mr. Anderson for his legal acumen, high \nethical standards, and professionalism.\n  The other nominee we will vote on this morning is Jack Walter, a \nresident of Pacific Palisades, CA. Mr. Walter's credentials are equally \noutstanding. Since 1976, Mr. Walter has practiced criminal and civil \nlitigation in a firm he co-founded, Walter, Firestone & Richter in \n1976. Over the years, Mr. Walter has represented over 75 indigent \ndefendants who were charged with crimes in Federal court.\n  Mr. Walter has also served as a judge pro tempore in the Santa Monica \nMunicipal Court for over 5 years. Mr. Walter has legions of supporters \nin the legal community, including Customs Commissioner Robert Bonner.\n  The ABA rated Mr. Walter as ``Well-Qualified,'' its highest rating.\n  Before concluding, I want to stress to the Senate how urgent it is to \nfill these vacancies in the Central District of California. With six \nvacancies, the Central District has one of the most acute shortages of \nunfilled judgeships of any court in the country. The Administrative \nOffice of the U.S. Courts has designated four of these vacancies as \n``judicial emergencies.'' With the nominations of Percy Anderson and \nJack Walter, we are taking a much-needed step forward to alleviate the \nvacancy crisis in the Central District.\n  In conclusion, I want to thank Senator Leahy for his expedited review \nand fair handling of these nominees.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to support the nomination of John \nWalter to be U.S. District Judge for the Central District of \nCalifornia. It should be noted that in 1992 Mr. Walter was nominated to \nthe same position by the first President Bush, but regrettably, he was \nnot given a hearing by the Democratic Senate. Still, as was the case 10 \nyears ago, I have every confidence that John Walter will serve\n\n[[Page S3342]]\n\nwith distinction on the Federal District Court for the Central District \nof California. After reviewing Mr. Walter's distinguished legal career, \nI have no doubt that he will be an asset to the Federal bench.\n  Mr. Walter's solid experience in private practice and government \nservice deserves attention here. Upon graduation from Loyola University \nof Los Angeles School of Law in 1969, Mr. Walter joined the Los \nAngeles, CA, firm of Kindel & Anderson as a civil litigation associate. \nMr. Walter later served as an assistant U.S. Attorney in the Criminal \nDivision's Fraud and Special prosecutions Unit, where he prosecuted \nnumerous Federal criminal cases, including the then-largest bank \nburglary in the United States. He returned to Kindel & Anderson in 1972 \nand remained there as a civil litigator until 1976. Since that time, \nMr. Walter has been a partner at the Los Angeles firm of Walter, \nFinestone & Richter.\n  Mr. Walter exemplifies an attorney who gives back to the community. \nAs a member of the Federal Indigent Defense Panel, Mr. Walter has \nrepresented more than 75 indigent defendants charged with federal \ncrimes in Federal court and devoted thousands of pro bono hours to \nthese cases. He has served as a judge pro tempore in the Santa Monica \nMunicipal Court and as an arbitrator for the L.A. Superior Court \nJudicial Arbitration Program. He provides approximately 75 to 100 hours \na year in the latter position.\n  I am very proud of this nominee, and I know he will make a great \njudge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nreconsider is laid upon the table, and the President will be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3342-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand that under the unanimous \nconsent agreement, I am to call up my amendment No. 3311 at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is already pending.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like the clerk to read the \namendment, and after that I am going to yield briefly, without the time \ncoming off my time, to several colleagues who want to lay down some \namendments; also, that I would not lose my right to the floor, as they \nwill make clear when they speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have a problem. We are not going to \nbe able to finish this bill. We have a number of Senators in the queue \nwaiting to call up their amendments. I am concerned, and I would like \nto discuss this matter a little further. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the floor. Does the \nSenator object?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator does object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n[[Page S3343]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I tell my friend, under the UC agreement, \nI have agreed to yield--and, of course, Senators have the right to \nobject, but I agreed to yield next to Senator Corzine and then Senator \nDorgan, and then I go back to my amendment and we get this done. I \nwanted to be congenial to my colleagues because they have done that for \nme in the past.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator from California yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Reserving the right to object. I have already \nobjected. I had understood Senator Boxer was going to be next, although \nprevious conversation indicated Senator Murray was going to be next. We \nhave been going back and forth, and we want to continue going back and \nforth. Senator Kyl is prepared to go.\n  My concern is we are going to run out of time, and we want to \naccommodate Senators, but as we put new Senators into the queue, we are \ngoing to run into a situation with the finance aspect of this \nlegislation, on which I am sure Senator Baucus wants a reasonable \namount of time. We are going to have to come up with some solution.\n  I want to accommodate my friend from Florida. I wonder if he will \ngive us a few moments to try to work this out. If I may propose a \nunanimous consent request that the Senator from California may speak on \nher amendment now while we try to work this out.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we already have a unanimous consent \nagreement. I think it would be wise of my colleagues just simply not to \ninterrupt and to have a conversation with the Senator from Alaska while \nI begin.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am concerned about the time element involved with \neach Senator. I understand the Senator from California wants to speak \nfor about an hour.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, I do not want to speak for about an hour. I want to \nargue this, and I have 50 minutes remaining on my time. Other Senators \nwant to speak, if they come. I am not interested in stalling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from California yield to the \nSenator from Florida?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am delighted to yield to my friend, assuming we go \nright back to this amendment as we originally intended in our UC \nagreement; is that correct, that is what will happen under the UC \nagreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent agreement, the \nSenator from California was to yield to several Senators without losing \nher right to the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Florida or my \nfriend from Nevada, whomever.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield to me without losing her right to \nthe floor?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. It seems what we should do is what the Senator from Alaska \nsuggested. The Senator from California should speak on her amendment, \nand in the meantime, while she is doing that, we will try to work out \nsome process for these amendments to go forward. We are using a lot of \ntime on the bill that this afternoon will be vitally needed. There are \nimportant tax measures, as the Senator from Alaska indicated, that \nshould take a bit of discussion. There are other matters that may not \ntake much time. But the tax matters, in my brief review of them, are \nfairly complicated.\n  That is my suggestion: The Senator from California should go ahead \nand complete her statement and, in the meantime, we will try to work \nout the way the other amendments can come forward.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator from California yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I wish to speak on the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia. I do not want anything to get in the way of others who wish \nto speak to that amendment right after her.\n  Mr. REID. I respond through the Chair to the Senator from New York, \nthat is my suggestion: We get debate done on the Boxer amendment. In \nthe meantime, we have a number of people--Senator Corzine and Senator \nKyl are here--there are a number of people, including Senators Dorgan \nand Graham, who have amendments to offer, and we will try to work our \nway through those. That is my suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a point.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. What we are really trying to do is proceed without \nbasically having the exposure of Senators yielding to other Senators to \noffer amendments as opposed to other Senators wanting to speak on \nbehalf of an amendment offered. I think Senator Bingaman will agree \nthat is all we are trying to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this has been an interesting beginning to \nmy amendment. I am looking forward to getting to it, which I am going \nto do right now. I want to clarify that the time that was used did not \ncome off my 51 minutes, which is what I said in my UC request when I \nbegan: That none of the time would come off the time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was not the Chair's understanding. But \nwithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I did say it, but it may have been \nlost in the shuffle.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3311\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there is an extraordinary thing about the \nbill we are debating. For the first time in history, makers of a \nproduct are being given a waiver of all liability essentially, if \nsomething in that product goes wrong in the future. For anyone who \ncares about consumers and communities, this is a terrible situation \nbecause we do not know what is going to happen with ethanol.\n  Now, I am not in the least bit hostile to ethanol. I think it is an \nexciting possibility that we can help our farmers and we can have a \ngood additive that cleans the air. I know it opens up an opportunity, \nfor example, for my rice growers that they can make ethanol from rice. \nSo I am not at all hostile. In fact, most of my friends know, in the \npro-ethanol caucus, as I call them, that I am the one who led the fight \nto ban MTBE because it is so damaging to the water supply.\n  What concerns me is giving the makers of this product carte blanche \nto walk away if in the future we find out there is a problem.\n  When I brought this issue up to the ethanol folks in the Senate, they \nsaid: Well, Senator, we are mandating ethanol in this bill and, \ntherefore, if the Government is mandating ethanol, then we should give \nthem a waiver from being held accountable if something goes wrong.\n  That reasoning is faulty and it is not borne out by the way we do \nbusiness in this country. For example, we mandate that there be \nseatbelts in all cars, but we do not exempt car companies from being \nheld accountable if they make a defective seatbelt. They are held \naccountable. We mandated seatbelts, but they are held accountable for \nthe safety of the product.\n  We mandated that there be airbags in all cars, but we do not exempt \ncar companies from being held accountable if there is a defective \nairbag.\n  We mandated that all mammographer machines meet certain safety \nstandards. Even though we had a mandate that they meet certain \nstandards in terms of the radiation that can leak from them, we did not \nsay they cannot be held accountable.\n  In the 1990 Clean Air Act, we mandated that either MTBE or ethanol be \nused in gasoline, but neither was let off the hook for any damage they \ncaused.\n  So the first argument that the Government is mandating this so there \nshould be no liability for the people who make ethanol does not hold \nup.\n  The second time I came back and made the argument, I was told: In the \nbill, the Government will pick up all costs if there is a problem.\n  So I said, that is interesting. So my wonderful staff went back and \nread every page of the bill. They could not find anyplace in the bill \nwhere the Government picks up the tab. So they spoke to everyone they \ncould and said, well, did we miss something? There is nothing in the \nbill that says the liability will be shifted from the people who make \nthe product to the Federal Government.\n\n[[Page S3344]]\n\n  I have scratched my head and said, is there any precedent at all? I \nthought, maybe the Price-Anderson Act, which by the way I have never \nsupported--the bottom line is it says if there is an accident in a \nnuclear powerplant, the taxpayers will pick up the tab. But even there \nthe nuclear powerplants have to pay an insurance premium over to the \nFederal Government so at least they are paying part of the tab if, God \nforbid, there should be an accident at a nuclear powerplant.\n  There is no premium being paid by the people who make ethanol. So \nthat is the second place where this myth is exploded. There is nothing \nin the bill that says the Government will pick up the tab.\n\n  There is a third myth. They say we are only providing a safe harbor \nfrom one type of lawsuit: defective products. So I went to my lawyerly \nstaff, and I said: They are saying no problem, they are only exempting \nthese companies from a very narrow provision of law.\n  Well, the defective product argument is the only one that will hold \nup in court. It is the one that people are using as they seek to get \ndamages for MTBE. So very cleverly, the way this bill is crafted, I \nassure everyone, by the attorneys for the oil companies--I can assure \neveryone that--it is crafted in a way so the liability is waived in a \nway so people can never be held accountable.\n  Why is this so important? Because if one looks back at what happened \nwith MTBE, they see the argument that did carry weight was the \ndefective product argument.\n  Why is it important to everyone? Because in the beginning everyone \nthought MTBE was safe, and now even though the people who want to \nsupport this mandate are saying the product is safe, there are studies \nin the bill to find out if it is really safe. We do not know.\n  Senator Feinstein, who I see in the Chamber, has gone into this \nmatter in great detail. We do not know what can happen. What we do know \nis it cleans the air but it makes smog worse. We know that but we \nreally do not know what is going to occur when the components break \ndown.\n  The city of Santa Monica had to sue because they paid over $200 \nmillion to try to clean up the damage from MTBE. We hope they will be \nable to recover because they sued under this defective product \nprovision.\n  Myth four: Ethanol is safe; no need to worry about liability. I was \nnot born yesterday, as everyone can tell, and if there is no need to \nworry about liability then why have the waiver for liability? It does \nnot make sense. Obviously, somebody is worried about it. The oil \ncompanies are worried about it, I can say that. One does not give a \nspecial exemption from liability--and one does not work to get it in \nthe bill and, by the way, fight for it, because I have tried to get \nsome agreement on it and the oil companies do not want to give an inch \non it--if you are 100-percent convinced that it is safe.\n  As the Washington Post points out in its April 16 editorial, the safe \nharbor liability protection is ``hardly a sign of confidence in \nethanol's environmental merits.'' We cannot have it both ways. One \ncannot stand up and say this is safe and then fight to protect their \nproduct. Consumers should be outraged, and that is why we have every \nconsumer group that I know of supporting this amendment. That is why we \nhave every environmental group that I know of supporting this \namendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If it comes off the time of the Senator. I have very \nlittle time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I did not know I had time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, the Senator has an hour under cloture. Every Senator \ndoes. If the Senator takes it on his time, that is fine.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that time for the colloquy in \nwhich I am about to engage be taken from the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I say to the Senator from California--and she knows \nthis very well--I come from the heart of ethanol country. I have been \nsupportive of the ethanol program throughout my congressional career. \nAt times I have been chairman of the alcohol fuels caucus in both the \nHouse and the Senate. I believe ethanol has been proven over and over \nagain to be a safe fuel. It is simply alcohol. It does not have the \ncarcinogenic and dangerous qualities of MTBE and other chemicals. We \nhave used it successfully in the State of Illinois for years. About a \nthird of our gasoline supply is blended with ethanol and is used \nsafely.\n  So I say to the Senator from California, speaking only for myself, I \naccept her challenge. I believe we can establish across the Nation that \nethanol is a safe fuel, not only safe for those who would handle it and \nthose who would use it in their cars but safe for our environment.\n  I see no reason for us to put language in this bill creating any kind \nof exemption from liability for ethanol or renewables fuels.\n  The Senator from California has suggested our fuels be held to the \nsame standards as every other fuel in America in terms of public health \nand safety. I completely endorse that approach. I would like to be \nshown as a cosponsor to the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. Senator Dayton was here yesterday, \nfrom ethanol country, supporting this amendment. I think it takes guts \nto do it, but the Senator is right.\n  The people we have been meeting with from the Corn Belt--the \nproducers, the farmers--do not like this. Frankly, they do not like the \nliability waiver. I believe it is the oil companies that came to the \ntable that were fighting for this.\n  I am pleased the Senator is a cosponsor. I ask unanimous consent that \nJohn Kerry be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have been hit with several myths. Another myth is ETBE \nis not included in the safe harbor. We are glad it isn't. ETBE is only \none form of ethanol and not the most prominent form. Most ethanol will \nbe exempted and will have this safe harbor.\n  I state for the record who supports this Boxer-Feinstein-Durbin-\nKerry-Schumer amendment: the National Resources Defense Council, the \nSierra Club, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the League of \nConservation Voters, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, \nthe American Lung Association, Earthjustice, Friends of the Earth, \nPhysicians for Social Responsibility, the American Water Works \nAssociation, the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, the \nAssociation of California Water Agencies, and the South Tahoe Public \nUtility District.\n  It is true that even the groups that support the ethanol mandate \nagree with our amendment on liability--for example, the American Lung \nAssociation and the Blue Water Network. Even among the supporters of \nethanol--such as Senator Durbin and Senator Dayton--supporters have no \nqualms about going forward with this amendment. They realize the double \nstandard is wrong.\n  When Senator Feinstein began the debate on why California is leery of \nthis mandate, she made several points. One dealt with the issue of \nprice. Again, we were told over and over again, the Department of \nEnergy says, yes, there will be a 9-cent increase per gallon in certain \nplaces and 7 elsewhere. That was wrong; it would only be a penny.\n  Senator Feinstein made the point we have had some bad experiences \nwith collusion in the area of our electricity. If there are only four \nor five people who make the product, we could have problems.\n  Yesterday there was a San Francisco Chronicle article: ``Memos show \npossible ethanol price-fixing.'' I ask unanimous consent this article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, Apr. 24, 2002]\n\n                Memos Show Possible Ethanol Price-Fixing\n\n            (By Zachary Coile, Chronicle Washington Bureau)\n\n       Washington, Apr. 24.--The Senate backed a plan yesterday to \n     triple the amount of ethanol in gasoline, which opponents \n     argued will lead to more expensive prices at the pumps for \n     Californians.\n\n[[Page S3345]]\n\n       As lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol debated the \n     ethanol requirement, a Sacramento congressman who opposes the \n     plan revealed possible price manipulation among ethanol \n     producers.\n       Rep. Doug Ose, the Republican chairman of the energy \n     subcommittee of the House Government Reform Committee, \n     released internal memorandums from ethanol suppliers at a \n     hearing about a proposal to ban MTBE as a gasoline additive \n     and require three times as much ethanol, a corn-based \n     additive. The proposal is part of the energy bill scheduled \n     for a Senate vote tomorrow.\n       ``These memos show a disturbing trend of potential market \n     manipulation by ethanol producers,'' Ose said.\n       William Kovacic, the general counsel for the Federal Trade \n     Commission and a witness at Ose's hearing, said the full \n     commission could initiate an investigation of the ethanol \n     suppliers.\n       Kovacic said that he could not tell whether the documents \n     were evidence of possible industry collusion but that the \n     memos were ``not simply provocative, but perhaps alarming as \n     well.''\n       ``Direct communications between rivals that suggest such \n     behavior are a matter of keen concern to the enforcement \n     community,'' Kovacic said, adding that he would alert \n     antitrust investigators at the Justice Department.\n       A spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association, the \n     ethanol industry's trade association, said his group had not \n     seen any of the document and could not comment on Ose's \n     allegations.\n       ``I am very suspect of the timing and motivation of this \n     charge,'' Bob Dinneen, the group's president, said in a \n     statement. ``Congressman Ose called today's hearing at the \n     request of the MTBE industry, and no one from the ethanol \n     industry was called to testify. It strikes me as more than a \n     coincidence that Mr. Ose raised this issue at the eleventh-\n     hour on the day the Senate is debating the renewable fuels \n     standard.''\n       The release of the documents came on a day of often bitter \n     debate that split the Senate along regional lines, pitting \n     Midwestern lawmakers who support the ethanol requirement \n     against senators from California and New York, who strongly \n     oppose it.\n       The Senate last night defeated, by a 68-to-31 vote, an \n     amendment by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., that would have \n     stripped the ethanol requirement from the energy bill.\n       Earlier in the day, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein \n     temporarily delayed the bill until senators could debate \n     proposals to alter the ethanol requirement.\n       Feinstein, a Democrat, said the requirement could sharply \n     raise gas prices for California consumers because much of the \n     ethanol will have to be transported by rail from the Midwest, \n     where 98 percent of ethanol plants are located.\n       In releasing the memos, Ose said the documents appear to \n     show a pattern by ethanol suppliers to discuss what prices \n     they intended to bid for supplies before ethanol auctions \n     took place--with the goal of assuring that suppliers got the \n     prices they wanted.\n       In one of the memos, an executive at an Orange County \n     ethanol supplier, Western Ethanol Co., wrote to a competitor \n     in Costa Rica on Sept. 29, 2000: ``I expect that the winning \n     bid for the 25 percent volume will be somewhere in the upper \n     $1.30's to low $1.40's. We are prepared to stop bidding \n     should the price drop below $1.38 per gallon.''\n       In another memo, an executive at another Orange County \n     company, Regent International, wrote to an official at Archer \n     Daniels Midland, the nation's largest ethanol producer, on \n     Nov. 20, 1995, to discuss a proposed deal with a London-based \n     ethanol producer, ED & F Man Alcohols, to jointly bid on fuel \n     from France.\n       ``Therefore (ED & F) Man will be bidding on the 75,000 hl \n     out of France at a price of 5.02,'' the memo read. ``I would \n     suggest that ADM underbid at a price of 4.85. This will serve \n     as a safety net in the event Man's bid is rejected for any \n     reason.''\n       ADM officials could not be reached for comment. Messages \n     left at the offices of the Orange County companies yesterday \n     afternoon were not returned.\n       The release of the memos was part of a last-ditch attempt \n     by ethanol opponents to derail the plan to phase out MTBE as \n     a gasoline additive and triple the use of ethanol by 2012.\n       California and a dozen other states have moved to ban MTBE, \n     which has been implicated in groundwater contamination. Gov. \n     Gray Davis last month delayed the state's MTBE ban by a year, \n     to Jan. 1, 2004; after a report by the California Energy \n     Commission said replacing MTBE with ethanol could cut the \n     state's gas supply by 5 to 10 percent and drive up prices to \n     $2 to $3 a gallon.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Essentially, it shows Congressman Ose from California got \nahold of memos that show, if you are doubtful, they are already talking \nabout how they will get the highest price possible for this product.\n  I add that because it is important that when we voted on some of the \nother ethanol issues, everyone said: Don't listen to the people from \nCalifornia.\n  Now it is time to listen to us. We have been through some troubles in \nour State because there wasn't transparency; there was manipulation of \nsupply and electricity. We don't want to see that happen to any other \nState. We don't want to see it happen to gasoline.\n  When the people who objected to points made by Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Schumer, saying they were wrong, there would be no problem, \nthis article shows possible ethanol price fixing.\n  This is just the beginning. I don't want to see, in 2 years, \ncommunities in trouble because it turned out ethanol was not as safe as \nthey said and we had problems in our communities and there is no way to \nrecuperate from the manufacturers of ethanol.\n  I diverted into the issue of possible price fixing; I hope people \nlisten. I am not here because I am hostile to ethanol. I would like to \nsee it move a little slower. I want to see the health studies. I am not \nhostile to using ethanol. We are going to use it in a lot of our \ngasoline. It may turn out to be the panacea. We don't know. I am \nsaying: Be cautious and do not give anyone a blanket waiver of \nliability from the one area of the law--defective product--that people \nmay have at their disposal.\n  I ask my colleague, does she want me to yield for questions?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I very much appreciate the Senator from California \nmaking that offer. I would like to add to what the Senator has said. I \nam firmly in support of the Senator's amendment. I ask this question. \nShe made the case about the health and environmental unknowns of \nethanol. That was somewhat contested. She is absolutely right.\n  I ask the Senator if she knew about the EPA blue-ribbon panel on \noxygenates which found ``ethanol may retard biodegradation and increase \nmovement of benzene and other hydrocarbons around leaking tanks''?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my colleague and friend and partner in this \neffort, we are aware of it. I am glad the issue has been raised. This \nhas been an education for everyone as we looked into the study. The \nunderlying bill does a study on the safety of ethanol, which is an \nadmission that they don't know. Therefore, to have a study in the bill, \nand yet at the same time, before we have the facts from the study, \nwaive this liability is terrible for consumers and States.\n  I am happy the Senator asked the question and I continue to yield.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I wonder if the Senator from California heard that a \nreport by the State of California entitled ``Health and Environmental \nAssessment of the Use of Ethanol as a Fuel Oxygenate'' points out there \nare valid questions about the impact of ethanol on ground and surface \nwater. The report points that there will be a 20-percent increase in \npublic drinking water wells contaminated with benzene if a significant \namount of ethanol is used. Of course, benzene is a known carcinogen.\n  What is interesting in the study, it points out that ethanol causes \nthe components of gasoline to break apart and therefore more easily \nseep into ground water from leaking tanks. We all know gasoline leaks. \nIt is saying it aids in the release of benzene, a component of \ngasoline.\n  I wonder if the junior Senator from California heard of that \nCalifornia report.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my senior Senator, I have. In addition to the \nbenzene, I make the point there are other dangerous areas--not only \nbenzene but ethyl benzene, toluene, xylene. We believe ethanol may \ninhibit the breakdown of these toxic materials.\n  Yes, we have a blue-ribbon panel, the State. That is why I think we \nare disturbed at the liability waiver.\n  I say to my friend, it is incredible because everyone said MTBE was \nwonderful, too.\n  Now we have more warning about ethanol than we had about MTBE, and \nthey put in a liability waiver.\n  I am encouraged that Senator Durbin, for example, and Senator \nDayton--from ethanol country--are with us on this issue. It means a \ngreat deal.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am sorry I could not be here at the beginning of the \ndebate, but I have a couple of questions. Just let me get this \nstraight.\n  We are banning MTBEs because we know they are harmful--in this bill.\n\n[[Page S3346]]\n\nSome of our States have done it already. And we are forcing States that \nmay not use ethanol to buy ethanol, which will raise gas prices and cut \nthe amount that goes into the trust fund. At the same time, we are \nsaying: But, if your soil is polluted--and we have a big problem in New \nYork because on Long Island we have one aquifer, one place where all \nthe drinking water occurs and the MTBEs are sinking in--if your soil is \npolluted and even if it was done knowingly, that you cannot sue the \npolluter? Is that what we are saying here?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, this is exactly what the liability safeguard \nprovision does. I repeat, the corn people to whom we have spoken really \ndo not like this particularly. They are unhappy with it. But the oil \ncompanies are pushing for it.\n  It seems to me, when you hear that Senator Durbin and Senator Dayton, \nfrom corn-growing places, support us, that is hopeful. But my friend is \nright. We are banning MTBE because it is harmful. We do not really know \nthe end result of ethanol. And before we even know the end result, we \nare waiving liability. He is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I know the Senator has been a leader and expert in these \nissues of suits and liability, far more than I have. How often have we \ndone this? How often have we taken some substances that we know are \ndangerous already, some substances that might be dangerous, and put in \na whole safe harbor so you cannot sue no matter what happens? Have we \ndone this for other substances?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, this is a precedent-setting waiver. \nEven in the case of the Price-Anderson Act where we waived liability \nfor the nuclear power industry, they must pay a premium into a fund, so \nthey are on the hook for billions of dollars. This has never been done. \nI say further to my friend, when we talk to some of my ethanol-\nsupporting friends, they say: But the Government is mandating this, so \ntherefore they should waive liability. We mandate seatbelts, but if \nthere is a defective seatbelt, a person can sue; airbags, mammograms--\nyou could go through the list. This is precedent setting, and it is \nterrible law.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I might ask a question or two more?\n  So we are saying the Government is mandating it, but we are not \nputting in any Government backstop?\n  Mrs. BOXER. We are not.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If you are a small community and you have a couple of \nschools in your community and your ground water is polluted, costing \nyou millions of dollars--and that means the property taxes have to go \nway up--and you know some oil company or refiner, or whatever, polluted \nthat soil knowingly, and the MTBEs leaked in, you have no recourse \nagainst the company and there is no Government backstop as in Price-\nAnderson, so the local taxpayers would be stuck; is that correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct. As a matter of fact, the first time I \nraised it, some of my friends from the ethanol areas said there was a \nGovernment backstop in the bill. So I went back. We searched the bill, \npage after page, and could not find it.\n\n  We called the people who put together the compromise. As you know, \nthe Senators from California and New York were not in that group when \nthere was a compromise. No one has come up with anything that shows us \nthere is anything in the bill.\n  The bottom line is that a city such as Santa Monica--and you could \npick out your cities--that had a horrible problem with MTBE is \ncurrently suing to recover $200 million from the oil companies. If that \nwas not allowed, the consumers, our taxpayers, have to pick up the tab. \nThis is the classic case of, in my view, turning away from ``polluter \npays'' and going to ``taxpayer pays.''\n  If ethanol is so safe, then I would say: Why do they have a study on \nsafety in the bill? Why are they seeking this waiver? And why are they \nignoring the two studies my friend from California, Senator Feinstein, \nis going to have printed in the Record, the blue-ribbon committee from \nEPA, and the State study, that show there is really a problem?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Just another question: So when the Senator is saying \n``taxpayers pay,'' in this case it is not even the Federal taxpayer--\nwhich we do in other areas--it would be the local property taxpayer who \nwould be left holding the bag?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It will be the biggest unfunded mandate. Not only are \nthey mandating ethanol, and at a very fast pace--and it is very hard \nfor us to be able to accept that much--but they are also saying: Local \ncommunities, you are on your own.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It seems to me--and I wonder about the Senator's \ncomments as to this--this is like piling on. First you mandate ethanol \nand raise the gasoline prices in New York, California, and so many \nother parts of the country. We can dispute how much. We think a modest \nestimate is 4 cents to 10 cents, depending on the State. Then we cut \nmoney from the trust fund, so you are getting a gas tax but not the \nmoney to build the roads. And now we are saying pollution--where it is \ncaused by ethanol, we don't know it; but things we know are poisonous \nand polluting are exempt from any lawsuit at all. It seems to me that \nis just piling on. I have never seen anything like it.\n  I ask my friend from California, has she? She has more experience in \nthese areas than do I. Have you seen anything that has such an amalgam? \nIt is almost like an evil brew. They put in all these bad ingredients \nand sneak them in the bill.\n  I appreciate very much the leadership of the Senator from California, \nstanding up to this provision. We tried to knock out the whole thing. I \nwas surprised we got as many as 31 votes, given the power of the \nethanol lobby. But now we are looking at one piece of it, perhaps one \nof the most egregious pieces of it, and asking people just to knock out \nthat part.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I agree.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Have you seen anything of such an amalgam this way, that \nhits you right, hits you left, hits you center?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is an amazing situation for those of us on the east \ncoast or the west coast. We know we are outnumbered here. But as my \ncolleague from California has told me many times, we must make the case \nand the record on this, because I can tell you right now, after living \nthrough the crisis we lived through in electricity, where we saw what \nhappens when a supply is manipulated--the story in today's San \nFrancisco Chronicle says:\n\n       These memos show a disturbing trend of potential market \n     manipulation by ethanol producers. . . .\n\n  And the ink hasn't dried on this bill as it becomes law.\n  Did you say a witch's brew? Is that what you said?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I can't remember. I think I said an evil brew.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If you look at the components of ethanol--and we all hope \nand pray the health studies in the bill come out that it is terrific \nand there is no problem--just look at what ethanol does to another \nwitch's brew. It may spread blooms of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, \nand xylene because ethanol may inhibit the breakdown of these toxic \nmaterials.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Just to clarify, what is in the bill doesn't just apply \nto ethanol and its potential dangers but to some things that we know \nare dangerous such as MTBEs, such as benzene, and other things. Is that \nfair to say?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The safe harbor does not apply to MTBE.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It does not? Just to the ethanol?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is just ethanol minus ETBE, which as I understand it \nis about 2 percent--a very small percentage of the ethanol. Those are \nthe only two.\n  There is another point I want to make to my friend.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter \nfrom the Association of California Water Agencies, American Water Works \nAssociation, and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3347]]\n\n\n         Association of California Water Agencies, American Water \n           Works Association, Association of Metropolitan Water \n           Agencies,\n                                                   April 16, 2002.\n     Re: Energy Policy Act of 2002: MTBE and Ethanol provisions\n\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: The Association of California Water \n     Agencies (ACWA), American Water Works Association (AWWA) and \n     the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies (AMWA) \n     strongly support language in the current Energy Policy Act of \n     2002 to end the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and \n     expedite states' requests for waivers from the Clean Air \n     Act's oxygenate requirement. The phase-out will protect \n     increasingly scarce water supplies from additional \n     contamination by MTBE, which was blended into gas without \n     regulators' consideration of its impact on groundwater.\n       Unfortunately, however, the energy bill would also require \n     that states use a new fuel additive, ethanol, in even greater \n     quantities than were required for MTBE. Replacing MTBE with \n     ethanol runs the serious risk of repeating costly \n     environmental mistakes, once again without evidence of the \n     benefits for clean air or the risks to human health. A 1999 \n     study by the University of California concluded that the \n     state could meet its clean air, goals without oxygenated \n     fuel, a point corroborated by the U.S. EPA's Blue Ribbon \n     Panel in July 1999. Putting ethanol in gasoline, at any \n     levels would almost certainly result in higher prices at the \n     pump and new instances of possible water contamination.\n       The problems don't end there. The ethanol provision \n     features language creating a ``renewable fuels safe harbor'' \n     that gives product liability protection to ethanol marketers. \n     This is especially troubling in view of the real possibility \n     that it will have its own environmental problems.\n       Members of the above organizations supply safe drinking \n     water to more than 200 million people in North America. We \n     recognize the need for the U.S. to invest in renewable fuel \n     sources, and are cognizant of the benefits they offer. But \n     ethanol doesn't need a federal mandate to help meet U.S. \n     energy needs. Your fellow Senators have spoken at length on \n     this provision creating market volatility and price spikes \n     for the benefit of a few ethanol producing states, and our \n     organizations support efforts by Senators Feinstein and Boxer \n     to amend the bill.\n       Senator Daschle, water agencies sincerely appreciate the \n     language phasing-out MTBE in S. 517. But the bill's call for \n     renewable fuels must not be pitted against the safety of \n     drinking water. We oppose the ethanol mandate and safe harbor \n     language in the bill, and we urge instead your support for \n     waivers from the Clean Air's outdated oxygenate requirement.\n       Thank you for your consideration, and please contact our \n     offices if we may provide further information.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here is what it says. It is a letter addressed to Senator \nDaschle.\n\n       Senator Daschle, water agencies sincerely appreciate the \n     language phasing-out MTBE that is in the bill. But the bill's \n     call for renewable fuels must not be pitted against the \n     safety of drinking water. We oppose the ethanol mandate and \n     safe harbor language in the bill, and we urge instead your \n     support for waivers from the Clean Air Act's outdated \n     oxygenate requirement.\n\n  That is of course the larger picture.\n  But the point is these water agencies have had to deal with the real \nproblems of MTBE. Mr. President, 120 million people are served by these \nwater agencies.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank Senator Boxer for her support and leadership \non this issue, as Senator Schumer said. One of the things that has \nstruck me is the belief that there is no harm from ethanol when in fact \nstudies on this issue have not been done to a great extent.\n  I would ask the Senator if she has comments about yesterday's hearing \non the House side. Yesterday, Professor Gordon Rauser of the University \nof California commented on the potential harm of ethanol on ground \nwater. This was before a House committee.\n  He said that research now strongly suggests that the presence of \nethanol in gasoline not only delays its degradation of benzene but also \nlengthens the benzene plumes which run out by between 25 and 100 \npercent.\n  I think it is very important that the Record shows there is \nscientific evidence that benzene plumes can go up as much as 100 \npercent and travel 100 percent more in distance because of ethanol.\n  That suggests ethanol may not be as safe as its proponents would have \nyou believe.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. That is exactly the point of the blue-ribbon panel \nof the EPA. That is exactly what MTBE does as well.\n  We are dealing with the potential that we could really have problems. \nNo one hopes more than I do that in the end it is all going to be safe; \nthat would be a winner. But we cannot stand here and say that.\n  If we don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it. We went \nthrough the electricity crisis. We know what happens when supply is \nmanipulated.\n  Unfortunately, what my friend said on the floor may become true. \nManipulation is already being discussed on what to charge for ethanol.\n  We lived through the MTBE tragedy. I was one of the leaders; I had \nthe first bill to ban MTBE. In fact, a long time ago we got over 56 \nvotes to ban MTBE.\n  No one can say I have been reluctant to do that. As I said, I am not \nhostile to ethanol; I am very open to it, but at the same time we need \nto know what we are doing here. We need to be careful about the amount \nwe are mandating so it isn't overwhelming but also difficult for people \nto charge exorbitant rates. We have to be careful that there are not a \nfew suppliers and there is price manipulation. We have to be careful \nwith that. We have to be careful that we have the infrastructure we \nneed to bring in the ethanol. We must be careful so we are not giving a \nwaiver of liability to the oil companies and give them safe harbor so \nthey will not be held responsible, if, in fact, it turns out that this \nblue-ribbon panel and the scientist who Senator Feinstein quoted proves \nto be correct.\n  We already know that ethanol makes the air cleaner, but it makes smog \nworse. We know these things. What we don't know is the long-range \nimpact of what happens when we use it in the types of quantities in \nwhich we want to use it.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Seventeen minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a very short \nquestion?\n  Mrs. BOXER. On your time. I want to reserve my time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. My question has to do with the terminology ``Big Oil'' \nand the responsibility for ethanol. The Senator from Alaska understands \nthat Big Oil does not make ethanol.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We understand that the oil companies are at the table \nwith the ethanol people. They manufacture products. So everyone is at \nthe table with the oil companies.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will leave the question out there. It is not my \nunderstanding that Big Oil makes ethanol.\n  Mrs. BOXER. They blend it into the oil. We understand that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. They blend it because it is mandated.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right now it is not mandated. We will wait and see what \nhappens.\n  But my argument is, if this bill becomes law, I don't want to see the \noil companies--the makers of ethanol--get off the hook if there is a \nproblem. It would be unprecedented. It would be the first time in \nAmerican history that it would happen. And it would be coming at a time \nwhen we know that all the environmental and health questions have not \nbeen answered.\n  Before some of my colleagues arrived, I went through all of the myths \nthat I have been told relating to my case. To try to say we are just \nmandating it, and we must, therefore, waive liability--we don't do that \nto automobile manufacturers with seatbelts, airbags, or anything else.\n  That is why I am very proud to have Senator Durbin's support and \nSenator Dayton's support because these Senators come from ethanol \nStates. They understand that if they have this waiver in this bill, it \nclouds this whole issue. If anyone says to you they have the safest \nproduct in the world and they want a liability waiver, what does that \nmean? It means in their hearts that they are not so sure. Again, anyone \nwho wasn't born yesterday knows that is not a good thing to do.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time--probably 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President. We would like to schedule a vote \nin the next hour or so on the amendments of the Senators from \nCalifornia. It is my\n\n[[Page S3348]]\n\nunderstanding that on the Boxer amendment, Senator Grassley wishes to \nspeak for 5 minutes and Senator Hagel for 10 minutes. I will use a \ncouple of minutes.\n  We have to move this along. How much longer does the Senator from \nCalifornia wish to speak?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I could just close in 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on this amendment, the Boxer amendment, I \nask unanimous consent that I be recognized for 5 minutes to speak in \nopposition to the amendment, that Senator Boxer close with 5 minutes, \nthat Senator Grassley be recognized for 5 minutes in opposition to the \namendment, and that Senator Hagel be recognized to speak for 10 minutes \nin opposition to this.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that, upon completion of debate on the \nBoxer amendment, sometime prior to 12:30 today, I be recognized to \noffer a motion to table on behalf of the majority leader.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object for one \nmoment, I didn't realize the Senator from Nevada was speaking against \nmy amendment. Therefore, because of his eloquence, I ask that I be able \nto speak for 8 minutes instead of 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator modify his request?\n  Mr. REID. That would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from \nCalifornia need on her very important amendment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. One-half hour.\n  Mr. REID. We will arrange a vote, and I assume a few Members will \nwish to speak in opposition to the amendment. I don't have the amount \nof time figured out.\n  If the Senator from California would agree to 25 minutes, and 15 \nminutes in opposition----\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I agree to that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on the \nFeinstein amendment No. 3225----\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The 1 year.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. We would have a vote first on the Boxer amendment and \nsecond on the Feinstein amendment at 12:30, with the times I have \nmentioned. I ask unanimous consent that be the order, and that both \nvotes be on or in relation to the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator please restate the request \nwith respect to the Feinstein amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, I cannot hear the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator please restate the debate \ntime with respect to the Feinstein amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. Senator Feinstein would have 25 minutes to speak on \nher amendment, and the opposition would have 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. And the vote would occur at 12:30, with no second-degree \namendments prior to that time being in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The deputy majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader is in the most important \nagricultural conference, which supposedly--I have heard this before--is \nin its waning minutes, and he can't be in the Chamber. He is one of \nfour Democratic conferees. So he has asked me to speak on his behalf \nrelating to the Boxer amendment.\n  First, Mr. President, the chart I have shows the amount of cases that \nthe Senator from California is talking about. Of all the cases we have \nin our court system, the defective product liability cases amount to \n.002 percent. On behalf of the majority leader, I indicate that this is \na very small number of cases, and it relates to this bill. It is my \nunderstanding that the language in this bill certainly gives the proper \nopportunity for people to go forward in litigation.\n  What the amendment of the Senator from California could be construed \nto be is, in effect, giving strict liability, meaning that you do not \nhave to prove any negligence. The majority leader has indicated that \nthis simply is not fair, that there is no reason to have strict \nliability in this instance when there are so few cases in our judicial \nsystem where strict liability is allowed. So the majority leader has \nasked me to indicate that this amendment should be opposed by all \nSenators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I had the good fortune of listening to \nthe exchange between the junior Senator from California and the senior \nSenator from New York. The senior Senator from New York is not in the \nChamber now. But I would like to point out that there is a lack of \nunderstanding of this legislation, particularly as it relates to that \nexchange they had over whether or not you can sue with regard to MTBE.\n  For all the pollution we have had from that product, there is nothing \nin this legislation that is going to restrict any lawsuits in regard to \nMTBE. So when there was an implication that if we did not adopt the \namendment before us, that people who have been harmed would not be able \nto seek legal redress, that is totally false. It is misleading if \nanybody says that for MTBE, and damage done from it, there cannot be \nlegal redress.\n  It is very important we make that clear because the water of \nCalifornia, the water of New York, and other States--there is even a \nlittle bit in my State--has been damaged because of this product, MTBE. \nIf you drink MTBE, it will kill you. If you drink ethanol, it will not.\n  For the future--and this legislation is prospective--if there is any \nviolation of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, if there is any \nviolation by any product, the Environmental Protection Agency has the \npower to make that determination. If that determination is made, then \nthere is not a safe harbor under this legislation. So I think, as the \ndistinguished Democratic whip has stated, there is ample opportunity \nfor redress in this legislation.\n  I also point out another misstatement from the other side: that \nsomehow you are not going to be able to hold big oil companies \nresponsible involving anything to do with ethanol. You do not have to \nworry about holding them responsible anyway. The big oil companies are \nnot producing ethanol.\n  Then, I remind the junior Senator from California, as I have said, I \nthink on two other occasions during this debate over the last week, \nthat we were proud of her and willing to work with her on a resolution \nin 1999 that she authored, to declare MTBE as something that should be \noutlawed, and that the reason it should be outlawed is the Clean Air \nAct requirements could be met because the oxygenate requirements of \nthat act could be fulfilled because of the availability of ethanol.\n  Well, it is the same ethanol in the year 2002 as we were mixing with \ngasoline in 1999, or for the last 20 years, as far as that is \nconcerned. The Senator from California, at that particular time, was \ngiving accolades to ethanol as a substitute for MTBE.\n  Then, lastly, since I am a Republican, I might be suspect from the \nother side of the aisle, but about 6, 7 years ago, Senator Harkin, my \ncolleague from Iowa, had a hearing on ethanol versus MTBE in relation \nto its safety, its use, et cetera, and Senator Harkin gave a \ndemonstration for all of the Senate that was involved in that \ncommittee.\n  He had a small glass of ethanol, and he drank it. You can talk all \nyou want about the dangers of ethanol, but Senator Harkin is very much \nalive and well, years after he took that small amount of ethanol. He \nalso had some MTBE there with the skull and crossbones on the can that \nsaid how poisonous it was. So I think we need to get the facts straight \nbefore this Senate.\n  Again, the exchange that went on a few minutes ago from the senior \nSenator from New York to the junior Senator from California was \nmisleading in relation to people not having legal redress in this law \nagainst damage from MTBE.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 5 minutes.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the\n\n[[Page S3349]]\n\namendment offered by my colleague from California. As the Senators from \nIowa and Nevada, who have just preceded me, have stated very clearly, \nthis latest attempt to undermine the energy bill's renewable fuel \nstandard--one of the few provisions of the bill that is truly \nbipartisan--is not in the best interest of this country's energy needs. \nAnd it deserves, as the senior Senator from Iowa has just said, some \nexplanation as to what it does and does not do--this renewable fuel \nstandard amendment, reached by a bipartisan group of Senators, that is \nin the present energy bill.\n  It is claimed that it will provide a sweeping liability exemption for \ndamage to public health or the environment resulting from the use of \nrenewable fuels. This is a clear misrepresentation of this section of \nthe energy bill.\n  A few months ago, Majority Leader Daschle reached out to a number of \nSenators from both sides of the aisle to help craft the renewable fuel \nprovision in the current energy bill that we debate today. The result \nis a historic agreement which has been endorsed by a majority of \nGovernors, the Bush administration, agricultural organizations, the oil \nindustry, and, yes--and yes--environmental and public health groups.\n  The talks that produced this bipartisan compromise included \nrepresentatives from the EPA, the American Lung Association, and the \nNortheast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, among many others.\n  I know--and I am sure my colleagues from California and other \nSenators in this body know--that the majority leader of the Senate has \na strong commitment to the environment and to the health of all \nAmericans. I suspect he would not agree to a provision he thought might \nultimately harm the public's health or environment. None of us would.\n  The safe harbor provision in this bill is there for one reason: to \nprotect the public and the environment while at the same time not \nexposing manufacturers and distributors to frivolous lawsuits for \nsimply complying with a Federal requirement, a Federal requirement that \nwe imposed aimed at improving our air and water quality.\n  This language in this bill is fair. It is reasonable. It is right.\n  Yesterday, the Renewable Energy Action Project, REAP, a California-\nbased coalition of environmental groups, public agencies, and renewable \nenergy producers, placed a full-page ad in the Washington Post. The \nheadline in the ad read: ``Renewable fuels mean cleaner air, cleaner \nwater, and less dependence on foreign oil.'' And the ad went on to talk \nabout the health benefits.\n  The ad strongly supports the renewable fuels standard provision and \ncalls the provision an important environmental victory that will \nprotect America's drinking water and improve our air quality. This \ncoalition also warned readers to remember the facts and not be \nsurprised when they hear inflammatory and misleading information \nattacking the renewable fuel standard.\n\n  We have heard the misleading information. We have heard it clearly. \nLet's review the facts.\n  The facts are, this bill has solid safeguards. It requires, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to conduct studies of the long-term \nhealth and environmental effects of renewable fuels. Under this bill, \nthe EPA Administrator has the authority, the jurisdiction, the control \nto either prohibit or allow the sale of renewable fuels that could \nadversely affect air or water quality or the public health. There is no \nsafe harbor if the Administrator rules that the law has been broken or \nlaws are violated.\n  The safe harbor provision is very limited. It applies only to claims \nthat a renewable fuel is ``defective in design or manufacture''--I know \nsome in the legal business find that difficult to accept--and that \nmeets the requirements of the Clean Air Act. This is very important. \nThe Clean Air Act is still the law of the land. All must comply with \nthe law of the land. These requirements include compliance with \nrequests for information about a fuel's public health and environmental \neffects as well as compliance with any regulations adopted by the EPA. \nIf these requirements are not met, the safe harbor protection does not \napply.\n  This provision does not affect claims based on the wrongful release \nof a renewable fuel into the environment. Anyone harmed by a release of \nthat kind would retain all the rights to sue, all the rights they now \nhave under current law. If we change or strike the safe harbor \nprovision in this bill, we will unravel the entire bipartisan \nagreement. We will, in fact, be taking several steps backward because \nthe result will be the continued use of MTBE, which we know has health \nand environmental consequences. I do not think that is what my \ncolleagues from California or any other colleague wants or intends.\n  Just let me recap for a moment what the senior Senator from Iowa said \nabout compliance and who is protected, which is very important. There \nis no safe harbor protection under this amendment, if the EPA \nAdministrator rules that a manufacturer or any entity is not in \ncompliance with the Clean Air Act. The language is very clear. I shall \nread briefly from that language in the bill:\n\n       If it does not violate a control or prohibition imposed by \n     the administrator under section 211 of the Clean Air Act, as \n     amended by this act, and the manufacturer is in compliance \n     with all requests for information under section 211(b) of the \n     Clean Air Act, as amended by this act, in the event that the \n     safe harbor under this section does not apply, the existence \n     of a design defect or manufacturing defect shall be \n     determined under otherwise applicable law.\n\n  This is very clear.\n  As I summarize, let me point out an article that appeared today in \nthe Washington Post. This article is headlined ``Link Seen Between \nCooking, Cancer . . . Frying, Baking Starches Creates A Carcinogen.'' \nIt goes on to say:\n\n       The process of frying and baking starchy foods such as \n     potatoes and bread causes the formation of potentially \n     harmful amounts of a chemical listed as a probable \n     carcinogen. . . .\n\n  It goes on.\n  What much of this is also about is downstream, future technologies. \nNo one can predict what is ahead. We now have a story questioning \nstarchy foods and how we prepare them. I think there is some historical \nevidence that people have actually been baking bread for centuries and \neating potatoes cooked many ways and have done quite well actually.\n  Let's bring some common sense back to this debate. Let's bring some \ncommon sense to what we are trying to do here and apply the law based \non common sense.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time remains on the side of \nthe opponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes in opposition on the Feinstein \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have 8 minutes to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question was on the time in opposition.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is fair to reflect on this safe \nharbor Boxer amendment which will be stricken if the amendment \nprevails.\n  The bill, we all know, contains this safe harbor provision regarding \nthe liability of manufacturers and distributors in renewable fuels that \nare subject to the bill's mandate. The principle is relatively simple: \nNo one should be subjected to tort liability simply for manufacturing \nor selling a product that was mandated by this Congress. That is what \nwe are talking about, a product mandated by Congress. Maybe Congress \nshould bear the liability.\n  In any event, it is fair to say the provision is very limited. It \napplies only to claims that a renewable fuel mandated by the act is \ndefective in design or manufacture, and it applies only so long as the \napplicable requirements of section 211 of the Clean Air Act have been \nmet. These requirements include both compliance with requests for \ninformation about a fuel's public health and environmental effects and \ncompliance with any regulations adopted by the Administrator.\n  If these requirements are not met, then the safe harbor protection \nwill not be available, and liability will be determined under otherwise \napplicable law.\n  This provision does not affect claims based on wrongful release of a \nrenewable fuel in the environment. Anyone harmed by a release of that \nkind would\n\n[[Page S3350]]\n\nretain all rights he or she has under current law.\n  It also applies only prospectively. So it does not affect any claims \nthat have already been filed as of the effective date.\n  There is some uncertainty regarding the long-term health and \nenvironmental risks associated with renewable fuels. Questions have \nbeen asked about ETBE, an ether derivative from ethanol, even ethanol \nitself. The major strength of the bill is its provisions requiring EPA \nto conduct studies of those effects.\n  Those studies show that if additional regulations are necessary, then \nthe Administrator simply has authority under the rulemaking provision. \nLiability protection under the bill would depend on full compliance \nwith any rules the Administrator may adopt. The balanced approach, \nwhich I think it is, will protect the public from any adverse health \nand environmental impacts from renewable fuels while not exposing \nmanufacturers and distributors to tort lawsuits for complying with the \nrenewable fuels mandated in the bill.\n  Some have contended that this provision could give polluters sweeping \nliability for damage to public health or the environment resulting from \nrenewable fuels or their use, in the sense of conventional gasoline. \nNothing could be further from the truth.\n  In the first place, the safe harbor provision doesn't affect claims \nbased on the wrongful release of the renewable fuel into the \nenvironment. Those responsible for releases to the environment receive \nno protection whatsoever, nor should they. Moreover, the safe harbor \nonly applies if the maker or seller of a renewable fuel complies with \nEPA regulations to protect the public health and environment.\n  Under this bill, the Administrator has the authority to control, or \neven prohibit, the sale of renewable fuels that may adversely affect \nair or water quality or the public health. There is no safe harbor if \nthe Administrator's rules are violated.\n  In my opinion, the amendment would simply promote litigation and \nincrease our dependence on imported oil, which we have already talked \nabout a great deal in this debate on the energy bill.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, understanding is that all time in \nopposition to my amendment has been used; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The time in opposition to the Senator's \namendment has expired.\n  The Senator from California has 8 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to be told when I have used up 7 minutes of \nmy 8.\n  Mr. President, it is such a simple point. People try to complicate \nsimple matters around here. If ethanol is so safe, why have the \ncompanies involved in its production pressed for the liability \nexemption in the bill? I have to say, with respect to my friends from \nethanol country, if this chart that my friend from Nevada talked about \nwere submitted as an answer to a question in a bar exam, the person \nwould fail the bar exam because they have mixed up the causes from the \nremedies. You cannot show all of this and say each one of these is a \ncause. Compensatory damages is a remedy. Punitive damages is a remedy.\n  The cause of action they are going after here happens to be a very \nsmall one, it is true. It is only used in a small number of all civil \ncases, it is true. But defective product liability is the only cause of \naction that will hold up in a court of law when you seek to get damages \nfrom an additive to gasoline.\n  How do I know this? Because we have done this with MTBE, and every \nother cause of action that was recommended was thrown out by the court. \nThe only one left standing was defective product.\n  So then my friends say: But we are only eliminating defective \nproduct, and it is just a little narrow sliver. Again, they don't pay \nthese oil company attorneys $500 an hour to come up with some \noverarching thing that people will notice. They pay them to come up \nwith a very narrow exemption that they hope will slip through. Thank \ngoodness, people who have read this bill understand the ramifications \nof this liability waiver, because this could have slipped through.\n\n  The fact of the matter is that they have exempted themselves in this \nso-called ethanol compromise--the compromise where Senator Feinstein \nwasn't at the table, nor was I, nor were the New York Senators. They \ncompromised it themselves. The oil companies and the ethanol producers \ncame up with this liability waiver.\n  So it is a simple point. If it is meaningless, why won't they take it \nout? If it only applies to .002 percent of civil cases, then it is \nmeaningless, so why won't they take it out?\n  The other question is, I believe, this is precedent setting. We \nmandate many things. The Senator from Alaska says we are mandating \nthis. We cannot expect these companies to pick up the tab if it is \ndefective. We mandate seatbelts. If there is a defective seatbelt, auto \ncompanies are held responsible. We mandate regulations on a lot of \nproducts, such as airbags. We mandate that products be safe and that \ncertain rules and regulations be followed in mammography and many other \nproducts. Yet if there is a defective product, there is no waiver of \nliability.\n  One of my friends who is with the ethanol caucus said: Well, we did \nit in Y2K, Mr. President; we waived the liability for the computer \nindustry in Y2K. That is a laughable comparison. We gave a waiver of \nliability for 1 year on the Y2K problem because we knew it would be \ncomplicated. That set a precedent for every thousand years--every \nthousand years. We won't be around for the next one.\n  But that is not what this is about. You have heard the expression \n``solidarity forever.'' This is liability forever--liability from a \nproduct on which there are some problems already proven and there are \nperhaps more problems yet to be known. That is why there is a study in \nthe bill.\n  I think anyone in this body who cares about consumers, and about \nhealth, and about the children, and who cares about the environment, \ncares about our States and localities that will have to pick up the tab \nif there is a problem, will vote with us.\n  I will be happy to yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think what the Senator has said is \nvery important. I hope Members of the Senate will listen because what \nshe pointed out was the central flaw in this safe harbor provision.\n  As I understand it, what the Senator is pointing out is that the safe \nharbor provision eliminates the one cause of action anyone has that is \nable to be successful, and that relates to a defective product. So this \nbill eliminates any cause of action which is brought around the product \nbeing defective.\n  Let me give an example, if I understand this. If it is shown--as I \nbelieve it can be shown--that ethanol breaks down gasoline to allow its \ncomponent parts to plume into the air, spread into the ground, and then \nit enables benzene to move faster and longer and harder, no one can sue \nunder a defective product liability cause of action; is that right?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My colleague is absolutely correct. If I might tell her \nthat, in the Lake Tahoe case against MTBE, the only cause of action the \ncourt allowed was the very one they are trying to do away with, as she \npointed out, the defective product liability. It was $45 million to \nclean up the mess at Lake Tahoe, an area of our Nation that my \ncolleague and I, Senators Reid, and others have worked so hard to \nprotect. The fact is, they had a horrible problem because of the boats \nusing the gasoline with MTBE, which is now banned on Lake Tahoe. They \nwent to court to try to get the $45 million. We still don't know. The \njury did come back, and they found for the good guys, the plaintiffs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The jury ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. It was made \nunder the defective product cause of action. Had they not had that \navailable to them--which is exactly what this bill would do, eliminate \nthat--they would not have had a case; the people of Lake Tahoe would be \nstuck paying $45 million. This is a small area.\n  So, in closing, let me say this: I say to my friends here, please, \nrise above all of this special interest politics and think about what \nis good for your people. We know what is good for your\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\npeople is to make sure they are protected--protected from a product \nthat may cause them and their community harm. If we don't vote for this \namendment, I worry and fear for the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time? If no one yields time, time will be charged equally.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, would you repeat that statement? What is \nthe status with regard to time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one uses time, time will be charged \nequally to both sides. Senator Feinstein has 25 minutes remaining in \nsupport of her amendment, and there are 10 minutes in opposition to the \nFeinstein amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Under the unanimous consent agreement, Senator \nFeinstein's 25 minutes begins to run at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes in opposition. Senator Feinstein \nhas 25 minutes, and the time is equally divided in both the support and \nopposition.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3132 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendment No. 3132.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3225\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3225, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the amendment I call up is a very \nmodest amendment to the renewable fuels provision in the Senate energy \nbill. It will simply delay the implementation of the ethanol mandate \nfor 1 year. That would move it from 2004 to 2005.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to give States more time to make \nessential infrastructure refinery and storage improvements. This \namendment will provide the Senate with the opportunity to make an \nessential modification to the current bill since virtually every State \noutside of the Midwest will have to grapple with how to bring in more \nethanol over the next several years.\n  Although the ethanol industry says they can meet future demand, \nvirtually every expert has told me that delivery interruptions and \nshortfalls are likely, if not inevitable, and yet we are tied to bring \nin a specific amount. In 2004, the Nation will be forced to use 2.3 \nbillion gallons of ethanol. There is insufficient transportation \ninfrastructure to ship large amounts of ethanol to the east and west \ncoasts, and a temporary reprieve is essential to develop the \ninfrastructure, especially when the infrastructure demands for ethanol \nare far more complex for ethanol than for MTBE.\n  Here is why infrastructure is so important. Moisture causes ethanol \nto separate from gasoline. So the fuel additive cannot be shipped \nthrough traditional gasoline pipelines. Ethanol needs to be transported \nseparately by truck, boat, barge, rail, and then blended into the \ngasoline at the refinery site after it has arrived.\n\n  Yet it will not be so easy to transport ethanol by truck, boat, or \nrail from the Midwest and blend it once it is transported, unless \nadequate facilities can be built.\n  According to the California Energy Commission, the adequacy of \nlogistics to deliver large volumes of ethanol is not consistent. A \nrecent report sponsored by the California Energy Commission predicts \nthere will be future logistical problems since the gasoline supply \nsystem is currently constrained with demand exceeding the existing \ninfrastructure capacity.\n  In fact, inadequate infrastructure recently led the Governor of \nCalifornia to push back the start date of the State's ban on MTBE to \n2004 from 2003. California does not have the ethanol infrastructure in \nplace to meet the oxygenate requirement under current law once MTBE is \nbanned. The Governor had little choice because California's predicted \ngas prices at the pump would double if the MTBE ban went into effect as \nplanned in 2003.\n  This is due in part to the lack of infrastructure. It is also because \nonce MTBE is removed, California needs 5 to 10 percent more gasoline \nwith ethanol. Here is why.\n  MTBE helps reduce the amount of gasoline needed to make a gallon. \nEthanol, however, does not go as far as MTBE, so it increases the \namount of gasoline needed to make a gallon. Once we have phased out \nMTBE, the difference is estimated by experts to require 5 to 10 percent \nmore gasoline in every gallon of gasoline that is produced with \nethanol--5 to 10 percent more.\n  California's refining capacity is at capacity. It is 98 percent, \nwhich is capacity. Therefore, we cannot refine 5 to 10 percent more \ngasoline under the present refining conditions. Therefore, not only are \nthere going to have to be massive improvements in the ability to bring \nethanol into the State, but there have to be massive changes made in \nthe refineries themselves, and this is going to take time. Somehow we \nare going to have to bring online additional refining capacity to \nhandle the tripling of ethanol that is required over the next 10 years \nby this bill.\n  This is one of the reasons, from a California perspective, the \nethanol mandate is worse for California than for any other State, and \nfor California it is going to spike the cost of gasoline.\n  Let there be no doubt, we have troubles even the way things are with \ngasoline supply. As a matter of fact, gas in California is going up. \nOne of the reasons is refinery outages, the shortage of gasoline. That \nis a very real problem.\n  This additional year, from 2004 to 2005, will give all States, and \nespecially the east coast and west coast States, an additional year to \nsolve some of these problems.\n  Before forcing three times the amount of ethanol we currently produce \nin our fuel supply, I sincerely urge the Senate to adopt this amendment \nto allow those States that have problems, of which ours is prime, to be \nable to develop the terminals, the trucks, and the barges to bring in \nethanol and the refinery changes that are going to be necessary to \nproduce more gasoline, as well as to absorb ethanol into the situation.\n  Let me summarize. In the past days, we have made the following \npoints: That the Senate bill requires 5 billion gallons of ethanol by \n2012. The mandate will force California to use 2.68 billion gallons \nmore of ethanol than we need to meet clean air standards.\n\n  We have proven, I think, that this is a hidden gas tax of anywhere \nfrom 4 to 10 percent, and the infrastructure shortfalls in California \nwill most likely put the gas tax hike above that. We have shown there \nare transportation and infrastructure problems. We have shown there is \na dangerously high market concentration.\n  We point out Archer Daniels Midland has a 41 percent market share. \nThe Wall Street Journal this morning contains a very interesting \narticle on this very subject entitled ``ADM Used European Wine For \nEthanol.'' It shows how recent evidence has been uncovered to suggest \nthat ADM engaged in bid rigging, which is a form of price fixing, with \nrespect to European ethanol brought into the United States.\n  So giving any company a large concentration of market share can also \nproduce exactly what we went through with Enron. We have shown that \nethanol has mixed environmental and health benefits. It does decrease \ncarbon monoxide. However, it increases nitrogen oxide emissions, or \nNOx, which will increase smog in my State and in other \nStates.\n  We have demonstrated there will be less revenue to the highway trust \nfund because gasoline is taxed at 18.4 cents to provide funds for our \nroads and bridges, but fuel blended with ethanol is only taxed at 13.1 \ncents. Therefore, this mandate will create an unbelievable $7 billion \nshortfall in the highway trust fund, and it will provide every State in \nthe Union less dollars to build roads, bridges, and transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  We have shown, and Senator Boxer did this eloquently, that the safe \nharbor provision of the bill prevents legal redress if ethanol and \nother fuel additives harm the environment, because it\n\n[[Page S3352]]\n\nremoves the unsafe product liability cause of action. That is the one \ncause of action that sustained the cases in California brought on MTBE, \nand this bill removes it for ethanol.\n  Why is this in there? Because the oil companies wanted liability \nprotection or they would not go along with the deal that was cut. So \nthey were given liability protection and no one can bring an unsafe \nproduct cause of action against ethanol.\n  We have shown that ethanol is not a renewable fuel because some \nscientists believe it takes 70 percent more energy to make ethanol than \nit saves using it, and we have shown that the ethanol mandate will \nlargely benefit producers, not farmers.\n  Producers will get 70 percent of the benefit; farmers, 30 percent \naccording to one report. We have shown what this amounts to is a \nmassive transfer of wealth.\n  The bottom line is the ethanol provisions of this bill are a very bad \ndeal and that mandating 5 billion gallons of it, a tripling of it, by \n2012, which never had a hearing in the Energy Committee, never saw the \nlight of day before the deal was put together in secret and apparently \na majority of the Senate is going to support it, we ask one thing, and \nthat is that California and other States that need it, on the east \ncoast and on the west coast especially, be given one more year to \nincrease the refining capacity, to improve the infrastructure, to see \nthat the terminals are in place and that we can, in fact, triple \nethanol and have enough gasoline to supply our need.\n  It is my understanding the junior Senator from California would like \nto ask a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do want to ask a question, but first I want to thank my \ncolleague for this very modest amendment. I am stunned that our friends \nin the ethanol caucus have so far not acceded to it. This is my \nfeeling, and I ask my friend if she agrees with me. As she has so \neloquently pointed out, we need to build an infrastructure to receive \nthis ethanol. We have to make sure we know what we are doing and we do \nnot rush this. If we rush this and the Senator's amendment is not \nadopted, I think it is possible there could be huge hostility toward \nthe use of ethanol, and when the people of our country get upset about \ntaxation without representation--and that is how they are going to feel \nbecause, as my friend has pointed out, this is like a tax on gasoline \nfor us--there is no telling what is going to happen in this country in \nplaces where they are hit.\n  If we put that together with this terrible article that ran \nyesterday, ``Memos Show Possible Ethanol Price-fixing,'' with the \nlegitimate issues of building an infrastructure, together with the fact \nwe do not know the health impacts, if they rush this there could be an \nexplosion of resentment in the country.\n  There is a 2-year study on the health effects in the bill. Until that \nis done, until that is analyzed, this could take us into 2005. If we \nfind out, for example, there is a way to mitigate some of the problems, \nwe would have time to fix the infrastructure in a way to contain the \nproblem.\n  My question to my friend, in addition to thanking her for her \nleadership on this, is, does she not believe if we are all really on \nthe level and we are being sincere, that this is a friendly amendment \nto both sides because it would, in fact, give us more time to \naccommodate for the use of the ethanol, would give us more information \non the impacts of the ethanol, and it would allow us to do this in an \norderly way without great disruption to the marketplace and at the \npumps.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I respond to the junior Senator by saying she is \nabsolutely right. She has phrased it in a very kind and gentle way. I \nam afraid I feel more adamantly about it, because I am 100 percent \ncertain this is a big gas tax increase for our people.\n  We have the longest commutes in the Nation now with people commuting \nas much as 2\\1/2\\ hours to get to work from Stockton to the Bay Area. \nThis is going to be a real hardship. Our State is complicated because \nwe do not have the refining capacity to refine the additional gasoline \nthat ethanol is going to require. We talked about this yesterday. I \nwent back and checked the figures, and our state will require 5 to 10 \npercent additional gasoline once we ban MTBE, but to force ethanol down \nour throats at the same time is a recipe for disaster.\n  Therefore, we will not have the refining ability to refine that \nbecause our refineries are at capacity.\n  So the infrastructure need of our State is much greater because it is \ngoing to mean additional refining capacity. That is not cheap or easy \nto produce, because you have to go through zoning, you have to go \nthrough local governments, you have to conduct environmental reports, \nto increase the refining capacity of our refineries.\n  Additionally, our refineries are old and they break down. We have had \ntwo breakdowns of major refineries, as the junior Senator knows, and \nthat spikes the price of gasoline. The Senator is right. All this \namendment says is, give us another year. Instead of 2004, make it 2005. \nGive us and other states a chance to produce our additional refining \ncapacity and to meet the additional infrastructure needs.\n  The Senator from New York is in the chair. She knows the hardship \nthat New York is going to occasion because of this. It gives New York \nan additional year to be able to make substantial infrastructure \nchanges.\n\n  Neither California nor New York have much by the way of ethanol \nplants. Everything has to come in from the Midwest. Weather is going to \nimpact it. It has to come in by truck or rail or boat. Then it has to \nbe transported to a refinery and injected into the gasoline.\n  We are saying: Please, you have the votes out there. You know it will \npresent considerable hardship to some. At least be generous enough to \ngive an extra year to be able to get ready for it.\n  I thank the Senator for her question, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, obviously, I am against this \namendment. The rest of the country is trying to help California get \nthrough their oxygenate standards and to get over the business of \npolluting water with MTBE which their oil companies wanted to use and \ngot a mandate for in the last Clean Air Act.\n  Somehow, notwithstanding all this help, the Senators from California \ndo not realize how good the agricultural States and even other States \nare trying to be to California to get through this problem. For \nexample, a lot of farmer cooperatives have helped invest $1.4 billion \nin small ethanol plants and ethanol expansion in order to provide the \nproduct needed to help California to meet the requirements of the Clean \nAir Act.\n  We already have the Governor of California sticking it to the \nfarmers--particularly the farmers who have created the small co-ops to \nproduce ethanol--by delaying one year, the MTBE ban that he said 3 \nyears ago would take effect at the end of this year. So now farmers \nhave to wait through 2003 before they get the market created by the \nMTBE ban. It is putting the investment of these small co-ops in danger.\n  The Senators from California can talk all they want about helping \nADM. ADM will survive. The financial investments of the small co-ops \nwill be harmed.\n  So now, in addition to the damage the Governor of California has been \ndone by delaying the MTBE ban by 1 year, now the Senators want to delay \nanother year.\n  The Senators will help ADM and hurt the farmers who have been trying \nto build the smaller plants so there is more competition in ethanol and \nalso more value-added benefits of ethanol go to the individual family \nfarmer, instead of ADM.\n  So I make it clear, this 1 more year delay, in addition to the year \ndelay caused by the Governor of California, is doing damage to the \npeople that Senators say they want to help. Senators say they do not \nwant dependence upon ADM, but they will make themselves more dependent \non ADM.\n\n  And now to clear up something about the mixture of ethanol with \ngasoline. The senior Senator from California said you bring ethanol to \nthe refinery and it is injected. Let me tell how simple it is to mix \nethanol and gasoline together. In the tanker, you put the 10-percent \nmix of ethanol in the tanker and add the other 90 percent of gasoline. \nThis can be done at the terminal, not at the refinery. You go down the\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\nroad and it is splash blended. It is not a technologically complicated \nprocess of mixing ethanol with gasoline to create what we call gasohol.\n  The other thing I think the Senate should be reminded of regarding \nnot having refinery capacity, how long has it been since you built a \nrefinery in California? It has been decades. That is not our problem; \nthat is your problem that you don't have this refinery capacity because \nof the attitude ``not in my backyard.''\n  Now, key points regarding this amendment: The bill before the Senate \nprovides for a gradual phase-in of the use of renewable fuels beginning \nwith 2.3 billion gallons in the year 2004 and growing to 5 billion \ngallons over an additional 8-year-period of time. So there is plenty of \ntime to meet the needs under this legislation.\n  The gradual phase-in of the renewable fuels standard provides a very \norderly transition allowing ethanol capacity and infrastructure \nmodifications to expand to meet market demand.\n  Nevertheless, we have this delaying tactic before the Senate. It is \nbeing presented out of fear of disruptions of supply and price. The \nfacts show there is no need to delay our fuel standard and there is no \nfear of disruptions. The original agreement implemented the renewable \nfuels provisions beginning 2003 in an effort to assure all parties that \nethanol capacity expansion and infrastructure modifications needed to \nmeet demand would be completed, and we made the renewable portfolio \nstandards delayed by 1 year, until the year 2004.\n  The U.S. ethanol industry has the capacity to produce 2.3 billion \ngallons of ethanol per year. Right now we produce 1.8 billion gallons \nper year. Plants currently under construction will increase capacity to \n2.7 billion gallons by the end of this year. Clearly, there is more \nthan enough ethanol capacity to meet the needs of the first year of the \nprogram, beginning 2 years from now.\n  Ethanol producers have expanded capacity to meet demands. In response \nto State calls for the removal of MTBE from gasoline, America's farmers \nresponded, investing in ethanol plants and adding 1 billion gallons of \nnew capacity in just these 2 years. Delaying the renewable fuels \nprovision will result in significant oversupply in the ethanol market, \nharming new entrants in the ethanol market. Predominantly, these are \nfarmer-owns facilities, likely resulting in some plant shutdown.\n  A delay will wreak havoc on the fuel supply markets as ethanol plants \nshut down as a result of delay. The petroleum industry will lose \npotential sources of supply necessary to meet renewable fuel \nrequirements the following year when the program begins, disrupting \nmarkets and actually raising the potential for price increases to \nconsumers.\n  By the way, I want to respond to the so-called tax on consumers. \nThere is not any place I have been in my State that you have to pay one \npenny more for gasoline with ethanol in it. Most times you get it for 2 \ncents cheaper, sometimes 3 cents cheaper. Most of the time it is priced \nexactly the same. Don't talk to me about a tax on consumers because \nethanol is in gasoline.\n  Today, oil refineries are operating at near full capacity, leaving no \nroom in the system for unexpected shutdowns, fires, or pipeline \ndisruptions.\n  Delaying the renewable fuels provision by a year will further \nconstrain domestic supply, leaving consumers vulnerable to price hikes.\n  Last, I think we also have to remember there is a certain amount of \ncamaraderie around this body that has to be respected. That is that we \ndo have some very basic agreements put together in regard to getting a \nbipartisan energy bill through this body.\n  The historic bipartisan compromise on fuels issues in this bill \nrepresents a carefully crafted agreement among oil industry, ethanol \nproducers, agricultural groups, environmental and public health \ninterest groups, including the American Lung Association, the Union of \nConcerned Scientists, and Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use \nManagement, among others.\n  So let's keep this carefully crafted agreement together so we can get \na bill passed and maintain a bipartisan approach to the energy problems \nof this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to respond to the \nSenator. I found his comments really quite amazing. On the one hand, he \nwas saying how generous he was being to California; on the other hand, \nhe was saying: Tough, if it spikes your cost of gasoline; tough, if you \ndon't have enough refinery capability, that is your fault. I am for the \nfarmers in the Midwest, and all the rest of you be damned.\n  I don't appreciate that very much. I will tell you something: When \nthe price of gasoline does spike and people are calling, I will refer \nthem to your office, Senator, and be happy to do so. We are being \nforced to use something we do not need. It would be one thing if we \nneeded it to meet clean air standards. We are being forced to use 2.68 \nbillion gallons of ethanol we do not need in California to meet clean \nair standards. I resent that.\n  I resent that the policy of the United States Senate mandates that we \nhave to use something we do not need that is going to cost us more, \nthat is going to prevent us from getting highway money and \ntransportation money because it is going to cut the highway trust fund \nby $7 billion.\n  I resent the fact that I am on the Energy Committee and this bill was \nnot even run by the committee; that there has been no public hearing \nheld on any part of it. I resent that fact.\n  I resent the fact that you don't care whether my State has the \nrefining capacity or not to meet this in time. We have tried to be nice \nall during this debate, but I resent the fact that this is a deal cut \nin secret, when nobody who is affected adversely has a chance to weigh \nin.\n  I resent the fact that we have no chance to get experts before a \ncommittee, to say what we do and do not know about ethanol.\n  I resent the fact that everybody says it is just great, when \nscientists have said it may have real problems attributed to it and we \ncannot even have a hearing to listen to those problems. I resent that. \nI do not think it is good public policy. It might be good in a \npolitical campaign.\n  I resent the fact that I had the refiners, the ethanol people and the \ncorn farmers, in my office for 8 months trying to negotiate something \nthat California could live with, and then both Presidential candidates \nannounced their support of ethanol and the corn growers reversed and \nsaid: Forget you, we are not going to negotiate with you; now we can \nget much more. And the ``much more'' has resulted in a tripling of an \nadditive we do not need.\n  Senator Boxer and I are standing here like two lone sheep trying to \nmake an argument when the deal has already been cut, when we have never \nbeen consulted. The Senator from New York, what is she going to do when \nher gasoline price spikes--because it is going to--because we did not \nhave that opportunity?\n  I resent that as public policy. I have every right to. I represent \n34.5 million people, the fifth-largest economic engine on Earth, and we \nare being told: It is good for corn farmers, so, you guys, lay down and \ntake it. I am being told: Oh, we have a credit trading system. But the \nfact of the matter is, if you really read the fine print: Use it or pay \nfor it.\n  I have a problem with that public policy. And I have every right to \nstand on this Senate floor and say I have a problem with it, and say I \nthink this is unfair, and say I think it is done in the dark of night, \nand say I do not think anybody who is really affected by it has been \nlet into that secret, dark room.\n\n  Yes, you have all cut your deal, and both coasts are going to suffer \nbecause of it.\n  I talk to Senators who I was surprised were in on the deal. What they \ntold me was: We had to, or they would not let us stop using MTBE. We \nhad to, or they would not let us stop using MTBE. That is the way \npublic policy is made.\n  It is wrong. I am sorry, it is wrong. We lose today, but guess what, \nwe will watch this thing. We will watch this with the eyes of a hawk. \nYou can be sure we will have more to say about it\n\n[[Page S3354]]\n\nbecause it is bad public policy. To mandate States to use something \nthey don't need, when they can meet clean air standards with \nreformulated fuel except for a small part of the year, in a certain \nmarket--it is wrong. It is bad public policy.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be happy to yield because my adrenaline will \nthen drop and my blood pressure will as well.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my colleague, she had every right to exhibit the \nfeelings she did, when we are told on the floor: Don't come and tell us \nabout price increases.\n  Our State has gone through the proverbial nightmare with electricity \nprices because they were manipulated, because the supply was \nmanipulated, because there was no transparency, because a few companies \ngot together and did it to us. Now we are walking into this situation \nbecause of our colleagues who have a special interest in this. I \nunderstand it, but don't stand on the floor and say: Don't tell me \nabout price increases.\n  Your administration, the administration in charge, the Bush \nadministration, has put out a chart. What I want to ask my colleague is \nthis: Didn't Spencer Abraham put out a chart that showed us that this \nadministration believes the price of gasoline in California will go up \n9 cents? This is not something we are making up. Is that not a fact?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 30 more seconds so she can respond.\n  Mr. REID. There is no time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May she have 30 seconds to respond to my question, \nplease?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. The Senator from Nevada has 2\\1/2\\ minutes. I yield 2 \nminutes of that to the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, one of the questions raised \ncontinuously throughout this debate, and it continues to be a question, \nis: Will there be enough volume, will there be enough production \ncapacity to handle these requirements? Let me refer to the chart we \nhave here that shows there are 61 plants today, plants that are in \noperation; 14 are under construction--and they claim 82 percent of \ncapacity is in production. We can do better. Biodiesel is estimated to \nprovide another 100 million gallons of ethanol equivalent.\n  As you begin to see the capacity and production, you see that we have \nthe additional capacity in excess of the production we have at the \npresent time. So the whole question about whether or not we will have \nenough production, will there be enough ethanol, I think should be put \nto bed.\n  The other point that needs to be made is, will this raise the price \nof gasoline because of the cost of ethanol? Frankly, by reducing the \namount of gasoline used, because of the additive, it will drive down \nthe supply of gasoline, which I think will also, if you will--and the \nuse of ethanol as a part of that--not increase the cost of gasoline but \nwill in fact decrease the cost of gasoline. The evidence really exists \nthat this is what the marketplace has been doing over the last 10 to 20 \nyears in many States across the country.\n  I can understand the concern that has been raised. But I think we \nhave to deal with the facts. If we are going to deal with concerns, the \nbest way to deal with them is with facts. I think the facts have shown \ncapacity, have shown prices, and haven't gone up. I think we can \nconclude that there will be enough capacity and that the prices will \nnot go up as has been suggested.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I yield the final 30 seconds to the \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is yielded the \nfinal 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, once again, this is just a very \nmodest amendment. It delays the implementation of this mandate by 1 \nyear, until 2005. It gives both coasts of the United States the \nopportunity to do what they need to do to increase refining capacity, \nto develop the terminals, to develop the truck fleet, and to get ready \nfor what is going to be a massive infusion of a product that can't be \nshipped by pipe. It has to be shipped by truck or by rail or by barge.\n  I hope the Senate will allow us this additional year to get ready for \nthis unfortunate mandate.\n\n\n  Amendments Nos. 3332, 3333, 3370, 3372, 3239, As Modified, 3146, As \n          Modified and Further Modified, 3082, 3355, and 3335\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 88, I voted no. It \nwas my intention to vote aye. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe permitted to change my vote since it would not affect the outcome.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have approximately 2 hours until all time \nruns out on this legislation as a result of the postcloture rules. The \nfollowing amendments are about all we are going to have time to work on \nbefore 3:30. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin be allowed to \noffer amendment No. 3342, with 10 minutes equally divided; Senator \nHarkin, amendment No. 3195, 20 minutes equally divided, and that \nSenator Dorgan be granted 10 minutes of that 20 in opposition; Carper \namendment No. 3198, with 40 minutes equally divided; amendment No. \n3326, the Murray amendment, 10 minutes equally divided; Kyl amendments \nNos. 3332 and 3333, 20 minutes total for the two amendments equally \ndivided.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the completion of the debate \non these amendments there be a series of votes in stacked sequence with \nno intervening second-degree amendments.\n  The votes would be on or in relation to the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This does not waive points of order on the amendments?\n  Mr. REID. It waives no points of order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. One other issue. There are other amendments at the desk, \nincluding one in which I am interested.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I will work on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reserving the right to object, and I will probably not \nobject, but we have an amendment on climate change issues that I did \nnot hear made mention of. I inquire of the assistant majority leader \nwith regard to that amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Kansas, we have taken these \namendments in the sequence they are now listed. Sadly, is the best way \nI can say it, there are eight amendments to which we are simply not \ngoing to have time to get. The reason I have asked these people to take \nless time than they are entitled is so we can get to as many of them as \npossible.\n\n[[Page S3365]]\n\n  I say to my friend, if we are able to complete this unanimous consent \nagreement, what we are going to do is ask unanimous consent as to all \namendments that are in order, that are on this list, Senators would \nhave 2 minutes for and 2 minutes against each amendment. Other than \nthat, that is the best we can do because that is 4 minutes more than \nthe amendments are entitled to under the rule.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could inquire, does that include, then, the \namendment we have put forward?\n  Mr. REID. It will include that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is my understanding we do not need a vote on the Durbin \namendment, that a voice vote would be adequate, if that is all right \nwith the author of the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. We hope that is the case. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Fine. That is what we believe can be done over on this \nside.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Idaho, if we get lucky, there may \nbe one or two others that may not require a vote. If that is the case, \nI say to my friend from Kansas, we will try to move down the list a \nlittle more. But 3:30 is the drop dead time under the rule.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is correct. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3336 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside temporarily in order to call up amendment No. \n3336 for Senator Levin. This has been cleared on the other side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I do not know that it has been cleared on \nthe other side.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, it has been. It has not been cleared for acceptance. \nThis unanimous consent agreement has been cleared.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The unanimous consent agreement?\n  Mr. REID. To allow the amendment to be listed.\n  Mr. CRAIG. To have it listed, is that the unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I withdraw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Levin, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3366 to amendment No. 2917.\n\n  Mr. REID.

I call for regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3342\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday I had reported by the clerk \namendment No. 3342 and it was laid aside. I do not know if it is \nnecessary for the clerk to report it again. I will speak briefly to the \namendment. Is it necessary for the clerk to report?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will be brief because I believe this \namendment is going to be agreed to by a voice vote. I thank all those \nwho are involved in that: Senator Bingaman, Senator Murkowski, as well \nas Senator Nickles, Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, and others who \nhave followed this matter.\n  We clearly need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, \nparticularly on imported oil. We should focus on sources of energy that \nare clean, free, and literally limitless. One of those sources is wind. \nWind power is now creating opportunity for the generation of \nelectricity across the United States. I introduced legislation last \nyear to create a tax credit to help defray the cost of installing a \nsmall wind energy system to generate electricity for homes, farms, and \nbusinesses. I hope this legislation will ultimately become the law of \nthe land.\n  Today, with this amendment, we take an important step forward in \nproviding for equal treatment of wind energy used in business and \nnonbusiness applications. It certainly would apply to our quest to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil. This is extremely important.\n  A recent USA Today poll showed 91 percent of the public favors \nincentives for wind, solar, and fuel cells. We think this amendment is \none that will give us an opportunity to use wind power across America, \nto generate electricity, particularly in applications for farms and \nranches and businesses.\n  This map I have illustrates the areas of the United States where \nthere are wind resources that could generate electricity. I am \nsurprised, in looking at the map, that there is no indication that \nWashington, DC, is a source of wind, but those who visit Capitol Hill \nmight argue otherwise.\n  I think if we take a look at this map, though, we can see we have \nample opportunities across the United States for a clean, literally \nlimitless, source of electricity.\n  I urge adoption of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Illinois.\n  The amendment (No. 3342) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3195\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on the \nHarkin amendment, the next in order as I understand it, start running \nagainst that amendment.\n\n[[Page S3366]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, I didn't understand the \nrequest.\n  Mr. REID. The Harkin amendment has 20 minutes evenly divided, and I \nthink the time should start running against that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the Harkin amendment, \nalong with Senator Grassley and Senator Lincoln. This amendment was \noffered last night. We had a discussion of the amendment at that time. \nThe issue presented by this amendment is whether the bill, as taken up \non the floor of the Senate as it relates to energy-efficient ratios of \nair-conditioning units, should be adopted by the Senate or another \nratio that would provide virtually the same amount of efficiency but at \na lower ratio and leave in place production plants that are producing \ncoils for air-conditioning units on the market today and the entire \nair-conditioning units to continue to function.\n  Let me give a parochial example of the implications of this issue for \nmy State of Mississippi. There are over 7,000 workers employed in \nfacilities that produce either components for or total air-conditioning \nunits. One plant employs 2,500 people in Grenada, MS. Our amendment \nallows the use, sale, manufacture, and use by citizens of air-\nconditioning units with an energy efficiency ratio of 12. These are \nnumeric. The bill before the Senate requires a ratio of 13. If the \ncommittee bill is adopted, or the bill before the Senate--the committee \ndidn't have a whole lot to do with writing this bill, incidentally--if \nthe bill before the Senate is adopted without amendment to this \nsection, that plant at Grenada, MS, will shut down and those 2,500 \nworkers will be out of work. This will be replicated not only \nthroughout my State and other manufacturing facilities but throughout \nthe country.\n  So you need to check to see what the results will be in your State \nbefore you vote on this amendment.\n  The other side of the story is, the cost of air-conditioning units is \ngoing to skyrocket. I mean that seriously. An additional $700 per air-\nconditioning unit is going to be added to the cost to those who want to \nbuy an air-conditioning unit. Think about that. If you have a State \nwhere people work for the minimum wage or low salaries, they can forget \nabout buying an air-conditioning unit. They are not going to be able to \nafford air-conditioning.\n  One of the main purposes of this legislation is to improve energy \nefficiency. We are for that. The current energy efficiency ratio for \nair-conditioning units is at the level of 10. This amendment raises \nthat by 20 percent to 12. We are suggesting--the Senators from Iowa, \nthe Senator from Arkansas and I--with this amendment, that the ratio of \n12 is the correct level.\n  We are not a regulatory body. Think about this. This bill is \nrequiring the Senate to choose a regulatory standard. A rulemaking was \nin process at the Department of Energy. This legislation preempts that \nprocess and arbitrarily sets a limit that is going to unreasonably \nraise costs of air-conditioning units and put a lot of people out of \nwork for no really good, justifiable reason.\n  I urge the Senate to think carefully about the implications of this \namendment and its consequences. We urge Members to vote for the level \nthat is more appropriate, that we think the Department of Energy would \nmove toward and establish by its rulemaking power--which it should have \nbeen allowed to do. This bill preempts that process, stops the \nrulemaking in its tracks, and imposes a new energy efficiency standard. \nIt is too high. It is too high for the reasons I stated.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt the Harkin-Cochran-Grassley-Lincoln \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time is available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was not available when Senator Harkin \nintroduced the amendment last evening, but I want to come to the floor \nto support the standard that exists in the energy bill we are now \nconsidering.\n  This issue is in many ways complicated, but it is also the issue that \ndeals with energy efficiency. We are talking about increased \nproduction, conservation, efficiency, as well as the promotion of \nlimitless, renewable sources of energy. This issue is called the \nSeasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. Almost no one knows what it is. It is \ncalled the SEER standard. The standard in the bill is established at 13 \nSEER, which is a standard that was published in the Federal Register \nalmost a year and a half ago, January 2001. It would increase \nresidential air-conditioner efficiency by 30 percent over the prior 10 \nSEER standard.\n  The Goodman Manufacturing Company, for example, said in testimony \nthey have given at hearings: There have been claims that the 13 SEER \nstandard would cost consumers substantially more money than the \nproposed rollback to a 12 SEER standard. According to the Department of \nEnergy, the average difference in cost between a 13 SEER unit and a 12 \nSEER unit is approximately $122. That is what I am told the Department \nof Energy says is the difference.\n  The Department of Energy also indicates that cost will be recovered \nin a very short period of time, because of the added efficiency in a 13 \nSEER standard. According to the Goodman Company, which is the second-\nlargest manufacture of air-conditioners in the country, and who \nsupports the 13 SEER standard in the bill, the incremental cost to the \nmanufacturer to produce a 13 SEER unit is about $100. They say: We \nbelieve the most efficient technology should be available to people of \nall income levels at an affordable price. Not all manufacturers may \nhave this same marketing philosophy. Some may seek a protection of \nhigher profit margins on their more efficient equipment. A 13 SEER \nstandard would force all manufacturers to be truly competitive and \nprovide all consumers with the most affordable energy-efficient \ntechnology for air-conditioners that is available today.\n  This issue deals with a mix of things we have to do in a successful \nenergy policy. We are talking about production, conservation, \nefficiency, and limitless, renewable sources of energy. This is the \nefficiency piece that deals with air-conditioners.\n  Most of us understand that at peak loads at certain times of the \nyear, the use of air-conditioners consumes a substantial amount of the \nenergy in our country. Much has been said about it. Let me show a \ncouple of charts that describe a couple of other alternatives.\n  Pat Wood, former chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission \nsaid:\n\n       Such a significantly strengthened standard to SEER 13 would \n     have the triple benefits of improving electric system \n     reliability, reducing air pollution, and cutting cooling \n     costs for our customers.\n\n  The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners--of the \nvarious States--say:\n\n       Keeping the SEER 13 standard for residential air-\n     conditioners is a crucial component for curbing future demand \n     growth while retaining consumer needs for affordable cooling.\n\n  And the EPA says:\n\n       A 13 SEER standard will do more to stimulate energy savings \n     that benefit the consumer, reduce fossil fuel consumption and \n     limit emissions of air pollutants.\n\n  All of those represent the benefits of the 13 SEER standard as \nopposed to the 12 SEER standard.\n  History has shown us, on virtually all of these areas of technology, \nthat once a standard is implemented, the markets drive prices down and \nmake the more efficient equipment even more affordable for all \nconsumers. The incremental cost to the manufacturer to produce the 13 \nSEER standard, according to the Goodman Manufacturing Company, the \nsecond largest air-conditioning manufacturing company in the country--\nand, incidentally, a supporter of the 13 SEER standard--is about $100. \nThe Goodman Manufacturing company, the EPA, and others say that will be \nrecouped in lower electricity costs by a more efficient air-conditioner \nin a very short period of time.\n  I mentioned Pat Wood from Texas in a chart. The Texas electric rates \nwere 27th in the Nation compared to other States. One of the primary \nuses of electricity in Texas is air-conditioning. Approximately 90 \npercent of the homes in Texas have air-conditioning, and Texans spend \nmore on air-conditioning than on space heating.\n  If the 13 SEER standard is implemented, for example, Texas electric\n\n[[Page S3367]]\n\ncompanies will save $241 million by the year 2010. It is estimated in \n2020 they will have saved $785 million in electric costs.\n  Consumer organizations and low-income advocacy organizations support \nthe 13 SEER standard.\n  It seems to me, at a time when we want to ensure energy security, \nincreasing the efficiency of our appliances makes good sense. We have \ntestimony not only from one of the large air-conditioning \nmanufacturers, but also from smaller air-conditioning manufacturers, \nthat they support this. This can be done and can be done in a manner \nthat is helpful to all Americans.\n  Goodman Manufacturing, the second largest manufacturer, a couple of \nsmall manufacturers--Goettl of Arizona and Aaon, Inc. of Tulsa, \nOklahoma--also support the 30-percent increase in efficiency.\n  I know there is not the time to adequately discuss a number of these \nissues in the energy bill. As I indicated when I began, these are \ncomplicated issues. I know there are disagreements about them within \nthe manufacturing sector on air-conditioning units. But with respect to \nlegislation that deals with a range of issues in a comprehensive energy \npolicy, on the efficiency side, the 13 SEER standard makes sense.\n  The 13 SEER standard will save energy. It will promote a substantial \nmovement by the manufacturing base to produce these at an affordable \ncost. It will save money and also be friendly to our environment. All \nof this make sense as part of an energy policy.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 4 minutes 18 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I was going to speak on behalf of the \namendment, but I will defer to Senator Harkin. He controls the time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair corrects the time. There remain 5 \nminutes 32 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will my colleague proceed now. I am going to take 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Whatever the Senator wants.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will yield to the Senator the remaining time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment strikes the mandate for \na 13 SEER standard for residential air-conditioners and heat pumps. As \nwe know, the DOE would be required to issue a new 12 SEER efficiency \nstandard within 90 days. This would result in the same standard as \nrecommended by the DOE staff during the previous administration, and \nconstitute a 20-percent increase in efficiency, which is not a rollback \nby any means, as some would indicate.\n  Here we are again in the situation, just as in the CAFE debate, where \ncertain Senators want you to believe they know better. Instead of \nletting the agency, in this case the DOE, act on a reasonable \nefficiency and cost standard, the number 13 was picked out of the air \neven though it meant higher costs and fewer choices for consumers.\n  To give some idea, the nonpartisan Energy Administration estimates \nthe 12 SEER standard saves consumers money. The 13 SEER standard is a \nnet cost, that is, about $600 million over 10 years. To give some idea, \nthe 12 SEER saves $2.3 billion over the 10-year period.\n  During the last rulemaking in 2000, DOE staff considered a wide range \nof possible efficiency standards. Based on a review of all factors, DOE \nstaff proposed a new 12 SEER standard--a 20 percent increase in energy \nefficiency. However, Secretary Richardson arbitrarily decided--without \nany further study--to issue a new 13 SEER rule in the final days of the \nClinton Administration. This rule was placed under further review.\n  This higher level was not supported by the rulemaking--and it \ncertainly is not economically justifiable. To justify the last minute \n13 SEER standard, DOE in the prior Administration disregarded the \nindustry data that it had used throughout the entire rulemaking. The \ncost of an air conditioner will increase by $712--nearly 30 percent--if \na 13 SEER standard is imposed. For most consumers in the Midwest and \nnorthern regions of the country the ``payback'' time for recovery of \nthe additional costs is well over 10 years. For these consumers--the \nextra cost of the more efficient unit just simply isn't worth it over \nthe life of the equipment.\n  This dramatic increase in the cost of a new air conditioner under a \n13 SEER standard will make air conditioning unaffordable for many \nseniors, working families, and low-income consumers, many of whom own \nsingle family homes and many of whom rely on air conditioning for their \nhealth and well being.\n  For small and manufactured homes, the expense is even greater. The \nsize of an air conditioner under a 13 SEER standard is substantially \nlarger than under a 10 or 12 SEER standard. This creates enormous \nretrofitting problems and much higher cost, particularly in \nmanufactured housing. The larger cooling coils simply cannot fit in the \nspace made for the smaller unit.\n  Because of the substantial increase in cost, many consumers will \nchoose to fix older units that are less energy efficient instead of \nmake a new purchase. This would defeat the purpose of higher \nstandards--to save energy and reduce heating and cooling expenses.\n  A 13 SEER standard would have tremendously negative impacts on \nindustry competition and small businesses: 84 percent of all central \nair conditioning models would be suddenly obsolete; as would 86 percent \nof all heat pump models; redesign and retooling of manufacturing \nfacilities would cost the industry $350 million--reducing profits and \njobs.\n  Nearly half of the original equipment manufacturers selling air \nconditioners in the U.S. today do not offer 13 SEER products. The \nDepartment of Justice and the Small Business Administration have both \nexpressed concerns over the loss of competition and the closure of many \nsmall manufacturers.\n  But most of all--the 13 SEER standard is not economically justifiable \nas is required under existing law. Industry figures show that both the \n12 and the 13 SEER standards will cost consumers billions after \nelectricity savings are factored in, and the non-partisan Energy \nInformation Administration estimates that the 12 SEER standard saves \nconsumers money; while the 13 SEER standard is a net cost.\n  These are the reasons DOE staff initially recommended the 12 SEER \nstandard as the ``economically justifiable'' level of efficiency, and \nthis is why the DOE has proposed a 12 SEER standard as a final rule \nafter its further review of the record. We should respect the expertise \nof the DOE--and let them carry out their duties under existing law.\n  A 13 SEER standard would have a devastating effect on the industry, \neliminate competition, and cost thousands of jobs. By contrast, a 12 \nSEER standard will benefit consumers, preserve jobs and competition, \nand truly save energy. I support the amendment to strike the 13 SEER \nstandard, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska for his comments. I support him in favor of a 12 SEER standard \ninstead of a 13. I join with my friend from Mississippi. I thank him \nfor his strong support of this amendment.\n  It always sounds nice. You do a 13, you are going to save a lot of \nenergy and can quote from EPA and that stuff. But the fact remains, No. \n1, the Department of Justice in the last Administration had real \nconcerns about a 13 standard and this administration said this would be \nharmful to small businesses, this would not be competitive.\n  No. 2, the professionals in the Department of Energy in both the past \nadministration and in this one have said a 12 standard is the best \nstandard.\n  What happens if you go to a 13? The cost of these air-conditioners \nwill be higher. The elderly, modest-income people, people who live in \nmanufactured homes, will be less able to afford them.\n\n[[Page S3368]]\n\n  What they will do is they will keep their old air-conditioners, and \nthose are less energy efficient. They will not move to the new ones.\n  The cost of going from 10 to 13 will be more than $700 per air-\nconditioner. To go to a 12, it is about $407.\n  Keep in mind, under the rules the Department of Energy has to abide \nby, they have to look not just at the energy use, they have to look at \nthe impact it has on certain subgroups, such as those of modest means. \nUnder the 13 that is in this bill, it will mean a lot of low-income \npeople in this country are going to be harmed. It will mean the elderly \nwho need air-conditioning, when it really gets hot, their health and \ntheir well-being, will be unable to have the air-conditioning they \nneed. Is this what we want to do around here?\n  When Senators come to vote on this issue, I hope this is not some \nkind of a knee-jerk reaction: 13 is higher than 12 and we want to have \na higher energy efficiency standard, so we will vote for 13, without \nthinking about what the implications will mean, what it will mean to \nconsumers, the elderly, the low-income people all over this country.\n  Last, what is it going to mean to jobs? We have thousands of jobs in \nmy State of Iowa that are in jeopardy, dire jeopardy if the standard of \n13 stays in this bill. These are companies that produce good quality \nequipment. You have all heard of Lennox. It is a great company. But I \ncan tell you right now, if it goes to 13, Lennox will be squeezed and \njobs will be lost in my state of Iowa.\n  Any way you cut it, the 13 standard that is in the substitute \namendment now before this body is not going to achieve the goals of \nlower electric energy use people hope for. Instead, it is going to hurt \nour elderly, our low income, and especially the jobs of the people who \nwork in these industries today.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, however much it might be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to this \namendment, which would leave it to the Secretary of Energy to decide \nwhat efficiency standard should be applied to residential air \nconditioners and heat pumps. This is an attempt to reduce by at least \n10 percent the energy efficiency requirement proposed in this bill, \nwhich reflects the standard promulgated by the Department of Energy in \nJanuary 2001--the result of a comprehensive rulemaking effort and \nmultiple years of hearings and analysis.\n  The new standard, called SEER 13, seasonal energy efficiency ratio, \nwas supposed to take effect last February, but it was delayed by the \nBush administration's suspension of a long list of Clinton era \nenvironmental rules in what's come to be known as the ``Card Memo''--\nthe legality of which is still subject to litigation.\n  My colleagues may be aware of a number of other rules that came under \nthe Bush administration's scrutiny as a result of this freeze on \nenvironmental protections. The list is long and includes: the attempt \nto roll back the arsenic standard for drinking water; suspension of the \nroadless rule, designed to protect more than 60 million acres of \nuntouched national forests from road building and logging; and even the \nClinton administration's New Source Review policy, restricting harmful \nemissions from power plants.\n  Given this laundry list of environmental reversals, it should \nprobably not surprise us that the Bush administration also took steps \nto undermine the air conditioning efficiency standard. After merely 2 \nmonths of review--compared to the 8-year rulemaking process of the \nClinton administration--the Department of Energy last April proposed \nlowering the air conditioning efficiency standard to SEER 12, or by at \nleast 10 percent relative to the Clinton rule. What is more, the Bush \nstandard wouldn't even go into effect until 2006.\n  And so, the fix is in. If we leave this important standard to the \ndiscretion of this administration's Department of Energy, we will \nneedlessly lower the bar for the efficiency of appliances that use as \nmuch as 28 percent of all the electricity consumed in this nation on \nhot summer days. Thus, this amendment would adversely impact our \nenvironment, the reliability of our transmission grid and our Nation's \nconsumers.\n  I also think it's interesting to note that the Bush administration's \nproposed standard has been vigorously challenged--not just by consumer \ngroups, environmental and energy efficiency organizations, but also by \nutilities themselves, State utility regulators, some of the same large \nand small appliance manufacturers that this amendment purports to help, \nand even the Bush administration's own Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Indeed, in comments on the Department of Energy's rulemaking, the \nDeputy Administrator of the EPA wrote that ``the EPA believes there is \na strong rationale to support a 13 SEER standard,'' put in place by the \nClinton rule, and further alleged that several DOE's arguments in \njustifying its proposed rollback contained ``overestimates,'' \n``underestimates,'' and ``misinformation.''\n\n  Now, why this fight over a seemingly obscure requirement? What is the \ndifference between a 12 SEER and 13 SEER standard?\n  By 2020, the Bush administration's proposal--which this amendment \nwould render a foregone conclusion--would increase by nearly 14,500 \nMegawatts the peak electricity demand across this country. That is \nroughly the same as the output from 48 new power plants.\n  It would, every year, add 2.5 million metric tons of carbon emissions \ninto our air;\n  It would cost American consumers $1 billion dollars on their \nelectricity bills.\n  And it would degrade the reliability of our already strained \ntransmission grid.\n  I believe these alone are compelling facts. But I also want to talk \nabout a benefit of the 13 SEER standard--the standard that is now in \nthis bill--that became obvious to us in Washington State during the \nheight of the Western energy crisis.\n  Now, in my State, we don't have a lot of air-conditioning load during \nthe summer because our major population centers are located in a \ntemperate climate where temperatures eclipse 80 for only a few days a \nyear. In fact, our peak energy usage occurs during the winter--for \nheating purposes. But this is an important issue for ratepayers in my \nState nonetheless, because we are upstream from--and interconnected, \nthrough Oregon, to--California. And in California, air conditioners \naccount for as much as 30 percent of peak energy demand on hot summer \ndays. That is, during the business hours when our economy requires the \nmost energy to function--during the day, when temperatures are also at \ntheir height--air conditioning alone uses almost a third of all the \nenergy consumed in that State.\n  Now, a very painful lesson was driven home up and down the west coast \nlast year. That is, when supply is tightest--during periods of peak \ndemand--the grid is also the most constrained and wholesale power \nprices are the most volatile. When supply is tight, utilities switch on \ntheir so-called ``peaker'' plants--plants that are usually the most \nobsolete, least efficient, environmentally damaging and run for only a \nfew hours a year. And as my colleagues are aware--because of the unique \nnature of electricity as a commodity that cannot be stored--that very \nlast megawatt of electricity needed to meet demand is by far the most \nexpensive. It can have an almost exponential effect on power supply \ncosts across a market. And it's a primary driver in price spikes and \nvolatility.\n  So by increasing the efficiency of air conditioners--by 30 percent \nunder the Clinton administration standard that this bill contains--we \nwould essentially be helping to drive down peak demand in a way that \nwill also lessen volatility in electricity markets, enhance the \nreliability of the grid and spare our environment emissions from these \npeaker plants.\n  I believe the efficiency standard contained in this bill is right for \nconsumers and it is right for the environment. Contrary to what some of \nmy colleagues may assert, it is also imminently achievable for \nindustry. All manufacturers already make air conditioning models that \ncomply with the 30 percent savings standard contained in this bill--so \nclearly, the technology already exists. And the Department of\n\n[[Page S3369]]\n\nEnergy concluded in its 8-year rulemaking that the standard would \nactually increase--not reduce--manufacturing jobs in this sector.\n  So I think the choice is clear. The evidence supports the standard \ncontained in this bill. This is an opportunity for this body to resist \nyet another Bush administration environmental rollback. So I ask my \ncolleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time remains for the opponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 2 minutes 17 seconds.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, to just put this in perspective, this is \nanother one of these amendments that we have seen a few of during this \ndebate over the last several weeks--the sky is falling, don't try \nrequiring anything that is onerous.\n  The truth is the provision in the bill says that by the year 2006 we \nbelieve the air-conditioners sold in the country ought to meet this \nSEER standard. Lennox, the manufacturer which is the one the Senator \nfrom Iowa referred to today, has over 19 models of air-conditioners, \nand 130 of those models already meet the standard in 2002. We are \nsaying that 4 years from now we would like for the others to meet the \nstandards as well.\n  Carrier lists 1,000 models that they make available. Of those, fewer \nthan 100 have a SEER standard of less than 13. They don't have any air-\nconditioners on the market with a SEER standard of less than 12.25. So \nwe are saying, 4 years from now let's move to the higher standard.\n  The EPA--not just the EPA of the prior administration but the EPA of \nthis administration--agrees with our position.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, we have printed in \nthe Record a letter dated October 19 from Linda Fisher, Deputy \nAdministrator of EPA, saying that EPA believes there is a strong \nrationale for the 13 SEER standard we have in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, it is clear to me there are a great many \nbenefits to be achieved for our country, for consumers, and for the \nenvironment, in lower electricity bills, by going ahead and maintaining \nthe provision we have in the bill, the 13 SEER standard. My colleague \nfrom Iowa says it is going to cost a tremendous number of jobs. The \nDepartment of Energy itself--this Department of Energy--says this will \ncreate jobs and it will not lose jobs. It requires a few more workers \nto produce these air-conditioners with this higher standard. Instead of \nlosing jobs in 2006 when this new mandate will be effective, we will be \ncreating jobs.\n  If this is an effort to protect jobs for manufacturers in this \nindustry, it is a misguided effort. I believe strongly that the \nprovision we have in the bill is the right provision.\n  I urge my colleagues not to support the amendment that is offered by \nthe Senator from Iowa.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                       United States Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 2001.\n     Ms. Brenda Edwards-Jones,\n     U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and \n         Renewable Energy, Energy Conservation Program for \n         Consumer Products: Central Air Conditioners and Heat \n         Pumps, Docket No. EE-RM/STD-98-440, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Edwards-Jones: On behalf of the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency, I am pleased to submit the attached \n     comments to Docket No: EE-RM-98-440, the Department of \n     Energy's Proposed Rule: Energy Conservation Program for \n     Consumer Products; Central Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps \n     Energy Conservation Standards.\n       DOE has proposed a change to its previously issued standard \n     that decreases energy efficiency requirements for residential \n     air conditioners and heat pumps. DOE proposes to withdraw its \n     previously issued 13 SEER standard and replace it with a 12 \n     SEER standard. These comments affirm EPA's support for DOE's \n     original 13 SEER standard.\n       EPA believes there is a strong rationale to support a 13 \n     SEER standard. A 13 SEER standard represents a 30% increase \n     in the minimum efficiency requirements for central air \n     conditioners and air source heat pumps. In contrast, a 12 \n     SEER standard represents only a 20% increase. The \n     Administration's National Energy Policy stresses the \n     important role that energy efficiency plays in our energy \n     future. A 13 SEER DOE standard will do more to stimulate \n     energy savings that benefit the consumer. DOE has quantified \n     these savings at approximately 4.2 quads of energy over the \n     2006-2030 period, equivalent to the annual energy use of 26 \n     million households and resulting in net benefits to the \n     consumer of approximately $1 billion by 2020. In comparison, \n     DOE projects that only 3 quads of energy would be saved over \n     that same period with a 12 SEER standard.\n       A 13 SEER standard will also do more to reduce fossil fuel \n     consumption and more to limit emissions of air pollutants. \n     For example, by avoiding the construction of 39 400 megawatt \n     power plants, a 13 SEER standard will reduce nitrous oxides \n     (NOx) emissions by up to 85 thousand metric tons \n     versus up to 73 thousand metric tons that would be reduced \n     with a 12 SEER standard. A 13 SEER standard will also result \n     in cumulative greenhouse gas emission reductions of up to 33 \n     million metric tons (Mt) of carbon. This is in contrast to a \n     12 SEER rule which will reduce up to 24 Mt of carbon \n     equivalent by avoiding the construction of 27 400 megawatt \n     power plants. At a time when many areas across the nation are \n     struggling to improve their air quality, the additional \n     emissions reductions achieved by a 13 SEER standard are \n     especially important.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to provide these written \n     comments. Should you have any questions, please contact Dave \n     Godwin in EPA's Office of Air and Radiation at 202-564-3517 \n     or via e-mail at godwin.dave@epa.gov.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Linda J. Fisher,\n     Deputy Administrator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Comments of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the Proposed \n Rule, Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products, Central Air \n Conditioners and Heat Pumps Energy Conservation Standards, Docket No. \n                     EE-RM-98-440, October 10, 2001\n\n\n                        Overview of EPA Comments\n\n       The Environmental Protection Agency welcomes the \n     opportunity to comment on the Department of Energy's Proposed \n     Rule setting forth energy conservation standards for \n     residential central air conditioners and central air \n     conditioning heat pumps. EPA recognizes that the new proposed \n     DOE rule represents a 20% increase in minimum efficiency \n     standards for central air conditioning and heat pumps. \n     However, we instead support the previous final rule of a 30% \n     increase.\n       EPA has issue with several of the arguments DOE used to \n     justify the withdrawal of the previous final rule as outlined \n     within the Federal Register Notice of July 25, 2001 and the \n     Technical Support Document. In summary, EPA believes that the \n     information in the Federal Register Notice of July 25, 2001:\n       overstates the regulatory burden on manufacturers due to \n     HCFC phase-out and concludes that the industry is under \n     greater financial pressure from a 13 SEER standard than it \n     is,\n       understates the savings benefits of the 13 SEER standard,\n       over and underestimates certain distributional \n     inequalities,\n       mischaracterizes the number of manufacturers that already \n     produce at the 13 SEER level or could produce at the 13 SEER \n     level through modest changes to the products, and thereby \n     mischaracterizes the availability of 13 SEER product.\n       EPA believes there is a strong rationale to support a 13 \n     SEER standard. EPA also believes that the more stringent \n     standard will be more representative of the long term goals \n     of the administration's energy policy and will do more to \n     reduce both the number of new power plants that need to be \n     constructed, as well as the emissions resulting from these \n     plants. EPA's more detailed comments are provided below.\n\n\n           overstated regulatory burden due to hcfc phaseout\n\n       EPA analysis indicates that the Department of Energy's \n     (DOE) projected cost for manufacturers to transition from \n     HCFT-22 to a substitute for residential central air \n     conditioners and heat pumps is likely to be a significant \n     overestimate. Both EPA's own analyses, and estimates from at \n     least one large manufacturer indicate that the DOE estimates \n     in their Technical Support Document (TSD) are at least twice \n     as high as warranted based on prior industry transitions and \n     more recent trends.\n       The attached analysis from EPA's contractor, ICF \n     Consulting, suggests a more reasonable estimate of the cost \n     to be around $20 to $30 million per company, rather than the \n     $50 million estimated by DOE, for the following reasons (see \n     Exhibit 1):\n       The costs to retool a facility to accept new compressors is \n     estimated at only $2 million.\n       The capital cost for converting from CFC-12 to HFC-134a for \n     the entire U.S. refrigerator industry was estimated to range \n     from $7 million to $23 million.\n       Projects approved under the Multilateral Fund of the \n     Montreal Protocol for conversion of refrigerator \n     manufacturing plants from use of CFCs to both HFC-134a \n     refrigerant, and HCFC or hydrocarbon foam processes, show \n     incremental cost estimates of $200,000 to $1 million.\n       These estimates are based on the expectation that the \n     industry will transition to one or both of the two \n     refrigerant HFC blends\n\n[[Page S3370]]\n\n     that have emerged as likely replacements for HCFC-22 (as \n     cited in the TSD), R-407C and R-410A, and appear to provide \n     roughly equivalent or better energy efficiency.\n       Furthermore, many manufacturers can produce 13 SEER units \n     with only minor modifications to their facilities. DOE \n     already acknowledges in the TSD that using ``407C lowers the \n     efficiency of unmodified R-22 systems by 5-10 percent under \n     the SEER test conditions.'' (TSD, page 4-49). Thus, an \n     unmodified R-22 system of 13.7 to 14.4 SEER, charged with R-\n     407C, would achieve a 13 SEER. Of the seven manufacturers \n     listed in the TSD, six (Carrier, Goodman, Rheem, Lennox, \n     Trane and York) currently offer certified products with a \n     SEER of 14.4 or greater, Nordyne makes units up to 14 SEER. \n     Furthermore, it can only be assumed that minor design changes \n     accounting for the use of R-407C would lower or eliminate the \n     5-10% efficiency loss.\n       With respect to R-410A, the TSD states that ``manufacturers \n     can preserve system capacity by reducing tube diameter (and \n     tube costs). Furthermore, 410A can provide a slight \n     efficiency boost at the SEER testing points.'' (TSD, page 4-\n     49). Thus, the use of R-410A, while likely requiring more \n     redesign of equipment, may actually increase efficiencies. \n     This increase would eliminate the need to take some of the \n     steps outlined in the TSD necessary to comply with a 13 \n     SEER rule while using HCFC-22 refrigerant. The TSD \n     necessary to comply with a 13 SEER rule while using HCFC-\n     22 refrigerant. The TSD notes that ``Carrier introduced a \n     line of products based on 410A in 1998 and most other \n     major manufacturers have since followed suit.'' (TSD page \n     4-50).\n       Carrier, the manufacturer with the largest (31%) share of \n     the residential central air conditioner market (TSD, page 8-\n     60), already offers efficient R-410A units. ARI lists over \n     1000 models manufactured by Carrier that use R-410A, ranging \n     in cooling capacity from 23,200 Btuh (less than 2 tons) to \n     60,000 Btuh (5 tons). Of these, only a few dozen have a SEER \n     of less than 13, and all have a SEER of at least 12.25. The \n     maximum SEER listed is 18. While these models do not \n     represent all of Carrier's products, it is apparent that \n     switching to R-410A and achieving SEER ratings of 13 is very \n     much possible. Carrier may now be in a position to increase \n     its manufacturing capacity of these R-410A lines by the 2006 \n     DOE deadline, thus meeting a 13 SEER standard with little or \n     no additional regulatory burden. To the extent that Carrier \n     cannot increase its production of R-410A by 2006 to meet \n     demand, it can supplement production with high-efficiency \n     HCFC-22 units until 2010.\n       Goodman, the manufacturer with the second largest share \n     (19%) of the market, had already expressed support for the 13 \n     SEER. Goodman has analyzed the costs associated with \n     switching refrigerants and meeting a 13 SEER standard and \n     expects the combined cost for both will be on the order of \n     half of DOE's $50 million estimate for just the refrigerant \n     transition. They feel that this $25 million per company is \n     representative of the vast majority of the industry.\n       Many other companies offer or are well into the development \n     of equipment using alternatives to HCFC-22. For instance, \n     Lennox offers products with R-410A, ranging from 11.35 to 15. \n     15 SEER. Of 199 models listed, with capacities ranging from \n     23,600 to 61,000 Btuh, 130 models meet or exceed 13 SEER.\n       As we look forward over the next decade, there are a number \n     of paths that companies can take to keep these costs low as \n     they work to comply with the EPA regulations banning the \n     shipping of new equipment charged with HCFC-22 starting \n     January 1, 2010 and work to comply with the DOE efficiency \n     rule (whether 12 SEER or 13 SEER) by 2006. One example would \n     be:\n       Step up current production of high efficiency HCFC-22 \n     equipment;\n       Meanwhile, phase out production of lower efficiency HCFC-22 \n     units by 2006;\n       By 2010, switch these high-efficiency production lines to a \n     new refrigerant while ensuring the efficiency standards are \n     still met.\n       Another example would be:\n       Move directly to producing R-407C and/or R-410A units that \n     meet the new DOE efficiency regulations;\n       Increase the production of these units to meet customer \n     demand by 2006;\n       Meanwhile, phase out all HCFC-22 units by 2006.\n       Of course, some combination of these strategies is more \n     likely to be taken and seems to offer the most opportunity \n     for manufacturers to reduce regulatory burden.\n       The TSD states ``To the extent that manufacturers can \n     introduce new products utilizing the new refrigerant and \n     meeting the new efficiency standard, the cumulative burden \n     will be reduced.'' (TSD page 8-62). EPA believes that there \n     is ample opportunity to meet both a 13 SEER efficiency \n     standard and a ban on HCFC-22 in new equipment with limited \n     regulatory burden.\n\n\n         underestimates of savings in the cost benefit analysis\n\n       DOE's analysis of the benefits of the withdrawn 13 SEER \n     rule are significantly underestimated. DOE's analysis is \n     based on summer 1996 electricity prices, adjusted downward \n     based on EIA projections of future annual electricity prices. \n     Changes in the electricity market due to utility deregulation \n     has resulted in increased electricity prices overall. DOE did \n     not consider this trend in its analysis.\n       According to Synapse Energy Economics' wholesale \n     electricity price data, DOE analysis underestimates the cost \n     of electricity for residential air conditioning by an average \n     of approximately $0.02/kWh. In addition, the California \n     Public Utilities Commission raised some residential rates by \n     as much as 37%, affecting more than 10% of the U.S. \n     electricity market and thereby, raising the national average \n     electricity prices above DOE's projections. Adjusting DOE's \n     analysis to include more recent electricity prices will \n     definitely and drastically alter the results indicating that \n     a DOE minimum standard of 13 SEER represents the better \n     decision for the nation.\n\n\n         over and under estimates of distributional inequities\n\n       EPA sees distributional inequalities that DOE has not \n     adequately considered. One results from the fact that the \n     residential price of electricity does not capture the \n     complete cost for running systems that largely run at peak \n     times. That is, except in select circumstances, residential \n     customers purchase electricity based upon averages rates, not \n     ``time-of-use'' rates. The actual costs of electricity at \n     peak times are dramatically more and therefore, higher peak \n     rates drive up the average costs. Less efficient equipment \n     operating at peak times drives up the cost of electricity \n     for all customers, including those of low income, who are \n     less likely to have central air conditioning. According to \n     1997 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) \n     microdata (the same data set used by DOE in their \n     analysis), of the total 101 million households \n     represented, approximately 46% have central air \n     conditioning, but among poor households, only 25% have \n     central air conditioning; just half the rate of presence \n     among non-poor households (See Exhibit 2).\n       Also related to distributional equities and according to \n     the RECS data, among households below the poverty level, \n     about 60% rent their housing units. This is in contrast to \n     27% of above poverty level households that rent (See Exhibit \n     2). Therefore, low-income consumers, or those defined as \n     ``poor'' in TSD Table 10.1, are not the ones to buy a central \n     A/C or heat pump product, but they would be the one to pay \n     the utility bill (or likely face increased rents if utilities \n     were included in their rent) for the use of that product. \n     Instituting a higher minimum efficiency standard will \n     actually ensure that low-income consumers have lower utility \n     bills, providing a benefit to this population.\n\n\n                 misinformation on product availability\n\n       DOE justifies a lower SEER rule because the higher \n     efficiency levels would put manufacturers out of business. \n     However, according to the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration \n     Institute (ARI) database of model combinations, many \n     manufacturers already produce models that meet the 13 SEER \n     requirements. This technology has been available for many \n     years to large and small manufacturers alike. Although \n     confidential ARI shipment information may not reflect large \n     sales of high efficiency equipment, the publicly accessible \n     ARI database of models shows extensive product availability. \n     Over 7,000 air source heat pump model combinations and over \n     14,000 central air conditioner model combinations currently \n     meet or exceed the 13 SEER level as listed by ARI.\n       The TSD (TSD page 8-2) describes a group of manufacturers \n     that ``offer more substantial customer and dealer support and \n     more advance products. To cover these higher operating \n     expenses, this group attempts to ``sell-up'' to more \n     efficient products or products with features that consumers \n     and dealers value.'' With a higher standard, these \n     manufacturers would not go out of business, but would rather \n     continue to sell-up, to even higher efficiency levels or \n     additional valued features.\n       Furthermore, results and upcoming plans for utility \n     programs around the country also document the availability of \n     13 SEER and above products, as well as the demand for such \n     products. Austin Energy's Residential Efficiency Program \n     2000-2001 gave rebates to single family existing homes for \n     installation of split systems and heat pumps with \n     efficiencies of 12 SEER and above. Rebates were staged: $150 \n     for 12.0-12.9 SEER; $250 for 13.0-13.9 SEER; $400 for 14.0-\n     14.9 SEER; and $500 for 15.0 and above. In total, 4,000 \n     rebates averaging $312 were given to consumers. These numbers \n     illustrate that a significant portion of the rebates given \n     were for 13 SEER and above units.\n       In New Jersey, a 3-year rebate structure began in 2000 with \n     a $370 rebate given for the installation of 13.0 SEER \n     equipment and a $550 rebate given for 14.0 SEER equipment. A \n     total of 14,000 rebates were given in the year 2000. As of \n     August 2001, 8000 rebates were given out with approximately \n     6,000 of these units at the 14.0 SEER level. Overall results \n     in New Jersey show that 27% of the market (1998-2000) are 13 \n     SEER or higher with 60% of those being at the 14 SEER or \n     higher levels.\n       The Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) instituted a program \n     similar to the one in New Jersey offering rebates for \n     installation of 13.0 and 14.0 SEER equipment. Results to date \n     show that LIPA is on target to reach their goal of \n     approximately 3,500 rebates for 13 SEER equipment. \n     Approximately 80% of these rebates are for SEER 14 equipment. \n     LIPA is expecting to ramp up to 5000 rebates in 2002. \n     Overall, 17% of LIPA's market in 2000 is at 13 SEER or \n     higher, with the market share for existing homes even higher \n     at 22%.\n       Program plans for 2002 in Texas and California are geared \n     toward equipment at 13 SEER and above. Reliant Energy in \n     Southeast Texas is planning an incentive program\n\n[[Page S3371]]\n\n     to target 13 SEER and above matched systems. California's two \n     large municipal utilities (Sacramento Municipal Utility \n     District and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power) and \n     four investor owned utilities (San Diego Gas and Electric, \n     Southern California Gas, Southern California Edison, and \n     Pacific Gas and Electric), serving over 30,000,000 consumers, \n     are planning rebate programs to assure California residents \n     receive energy efficient equipment, measures, and practices \n     that provide maximum benefit for the cost. These programs all \n     revolve around 13 SEER equipment or higher. Actual incentive \n     amounts are not yet available.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Oral Statement for Doug Marty, Executive Vice President, on behalf of \n Goodman Global Holdings Company, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of \n                 Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy\n\n\n public hearing regarding energy efficiency standards for central air \n            conditioners and heat pumps--september 13, 2001\n\n       Assistant Secretary David Garman, and other members of the \n     Department of Energy Staff . . . thank you for the \n     opportunity to speak here today.\n       My name is Doug Marty and I am the Executive Vice President \n     of Goodman Global Holdings out of Houston, Texas. Let me \n     start by giving you a brief background of our company: \n     Goodman is the second largest residential air conditioning \n     and heating manufacturer in the United States. Founded in \n     1975 by the late Harold Goodman, Goodman remains entirely \n     family-owned. We produce a complete line of residential and \n     light commercial air conditioning and heating equipment with \n     facilities in Houston, Texas as well as Dayton and \n     Fayetteville, Tennessee. Name brands sold by Goodman include \n     Amana, Goodman, GmC, and \n     Janitrol.\n       As the nation's second largest manufacturer, my goal here \n     today is to provide you with accurate information regarding \n     the continuing debate to rollback the energy efficiency \n     standard for air conditioners and heat pumps from a level of \n     13 SEER to 12 SEER. This debate has been fueled by \n     inaccuracies and in some cases outright wrong information. \n     Stronger energy efficiency standards do not place a major \n     burden on manufacturers or limit consumer choice. They do not \n     cause enormous increases in the size of the equipment. \n     Finally, they do not impose unreasonable costs on consumers \n     or hurt the elderly and low-income families. Let me explain.\n       Given recent events and for purposes of national security, \n     we now face a time when it is imperative to explore \n     alternatives that help to improve the efficiency of our \n     energy use and build our domestic energy infrastructure. As \n     we seek alternatives, it is important to consider options \n     that strike a balance between both environmental and energy \n     needs. One simple option is energy efficiency and \n     conservation; specifically, energy efficiency standards for \n     air conditioners should be strengthened to a level that \n     provides consumers the most efficient technology available \n     today at an affordable price and helps to strengthen our \n     domestic resources. That level is 13 SEER.\n       Many opponents of the 13 SEER standard have argued that \n     moving to the higher level would be a hardship on small \n     manufacturers and that not all manufacturers have the \n     capability to produce the more efficient equipment, thus \n     limiting consumer choice. In fact, the 13 SEER technology has \n     been available to both large and small manufacturers for \n     approximately 15 years. The Air Conditioning and \n     Refrigeration Institutes' own data shows that virtually all \n     manufacturers produce 13 SEER equipment today. In reality, \n     the only difference between a 10 SEER unit, a 12 SEER unit \n     and a 13 SEER unit is a little more copper and aluminum used \n     in manufacturing different sized coils. Given the fact that \n     the units have equivalent technologies, at Goodman we run \n     all of our equipment through the same facilities and \n     assembly lines. Since Goodman and most other manufacturers \n     currently produce the 13 SEER air conditioner, moving to \n     the higher SEER will simply mean producing a higher \n     volume. This will also mean more jobs at the industry \n     level, thus improving the economy.\n       There has also been some confusion about the size of the 13 \n     SEER equipment versus the 12 SEER equipment. It has been said \n     that there is an enormous difference in the size of the units \n     and with that a tremendously higher related cost for \n     installation. It is clear that an increased efficiency \n     standard will be established at least at a level of 12 over \n     the current 10 SEER standard. If the decision is made to \n     adopt the 12 SEER standard, the unit size will be slightly \n     bigger and will require some structural modifications to \n     install the indoor portion of the system including ductwork \n     during installation of the unit. Once we acknowledge that \n     there will be a standard that will likely require some \n     structural modification, one must compare the 12 SEER unit to \n     the 13 SEER unit. The difference between our 13 SEER and 12 \n     SEER external equipment is only 3-5 inches in height. The \n     internal equipment size for the 12 and 13 are similar, and \n     there is almost no difference in the installation costs \n     associated with a 13 SEER unit and a 12 SEER unit.\n       There have also been claims that the 13 SEER standard would \n     cost consumers substantially more money than the proposed \n     rollback to a 12 SEER standard. According to the DOE, the \n     average difference in cost between a 13 SEER unit and a 12 \n     SEER unit today is approximately $122. The difference in \n     costs for Goodman units is comparable to this estimate. Since \n     a 13 SEER unit is 8 percent more efficient that a 12 SEER \n     unit, consumers will save more on their electric bills each \n     and every month for the life of the unit. Thus, over an \n     average life of a home cooling unit, the savings will easily \n     cover the increase in cost, between a 12 SEER and a 13 SEER \n     unit.\n       Moreover, history has shown us time and time again that \n     once a standard is implemented, the market will drive prices \n     down and make the more efficient equipment even more \n     affordable for all consumers. How do we know this? From \n     experience. In 1992, when the government implemented the \n     efficiency standard at 10 SEER, the cost of the 10 SEER air \n     conditioning unit dropped dramatically across the nation. The \n     reason for the change in price is simple. Once the standard \n     is set, more sales of that type of unit will occur and more \n     volume is manufactured, thereby allowing the manufacturers to \n     run their plant more efficiently and pass the savings on to \n     the consumer. Since most consumers purchase units that \n     perform at the minimum standard, it makes it that much more \n     important to establish the standard at the correct level, 13 \n     SEER.\n       Finally, in our opinion, Goodman has a marketing philosophy \n     of selling in volume. The incremental cost to the \n     manufacturer to produce a 13 SEER unit is only about $100 and \n     we feel that the most efficient technology should be \n     available to people of all income levels at an affordable \n     price. Unfortunately, all manufacturers may not have this \n     same marketing philosophy. Instead some manufacturers may be \n     seeking protection of higher profit margins on their more \n     efficient equipment. A 13 SEER standard would force all \n     energy manufacturers to be truly competitive and provide all \n     consumers with the most affordable energy efficient \n     technology for air conditioners that is available today.\n       Just as the Administration has been supportive of energy \n     efficiency and conservation measures, Goodman too supports \n     the use of more energy-efficient appliances, specifically air \n     conditioners and heat pumps. However, rather than rolling the \n     energy efficiency standard back to 12 SEER, a 20 percent \n     increase in efficiency, we support a 13 SEER standard, a 30 \n     percent increase in efficiency.\n       A 13 SEER standard is achievable today and will certainly \n     be achievable in 2006. A 13 SEER standard will significantly \n     reduce energy consumption, cut utility costs for consumers \n     and improve air quality by reducing the amount of air \n     pollutants and greenhouse gases emitted from fossil-fueled \n     electric power generating facilities.\n       In closing, Goodman strongly urges you to consider \n     establishing a 13 SEER standard for residential air \n     conditioners and heap pumps beginning in 2006. Again, it is \n     the right thing to do for both the consumer and the \n     environment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3198\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are now going to \nmove to the debate on the Carper amendment. Is that a valid statement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my two colleagues--the Senator from \nDelaware and the Senator from Michigan--if there is any way to pare \nthat time down. We are very close to being able to include another \namendment in the order prior to the votes. We are now scheduling 40 \nminutes. Is there any way we can do that in 30, 35, or 25?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would be willing to accept whatever \nSenator Carper is willing to make.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am willing to \ngo with 20 or 15.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \nthe Carper amendment be taken from 40 minutes to 30 minutes evenly \ndivided.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is a \nvery brief period of time, 40 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, amendment No. 3198, which is at the desk, \nI believe is now in order under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Today, the United States of America will consume some 7.8 million \nbarrels of oil to power our cars, trucks, and vans. Between now and the \nyear 2015, we are told by the Secretary of Energy that 7.8 million \nbarrels of oil per day consumption for our cars, trucks, and vans will \nrise by some 36 percent to\n\n[[Page S3372]]\n\nover 10\\1/2\\ million barrels of oil per day. My own view is that it \nwould be better for our country if we had no increase.\n  The amendment Senator Specter and I offer today is one that seeks to \nreduce by one-third--1 million barrels of oil per day--the amount of \noil we are going to consume in 2015 to power our cars, trucks, and \nvans.\n  There are a variety of ways to achieve those savings. Earlier in this \ndebate on the energy bill, Senator Levin and Senator Bond offered an \namendment that sought to conserve oil with respect to our cars, trucks, \nand vans. I voted for it, as did Senator Specter. I voted for that \namendment because I like a number of aspects of it. I will mention a \nfew of those aspects.\n  No. 1, it has been said that we should use the Government's \npurchasing power to commercialize new technologies and provide tax \ncredits to consumers to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles, and that the \nauto industry be given a reasonable lead time. There were a number of \nvery positive aspects to the Levin-Bond amendment.\n  One thing that was missing in the Levin-Bond amendment was a \nmeasurable objective. During the time I served as Governor of Delaware \nfor 8 years, we worked often with measurable objectives--job creation, \nimproving credit rating, getting people off welfare, and reducing the \nrate of teen pregnancies. In setting the objectives, we tried not to \nmicromanage the process. We set a measurable objective and tried to \nhold ourselves accountable to that measurable objective.\n\n  Today, in offering this amendment, we set a measurable objective. We \ndon't change the Levin-Bond amendment. It is all there in place. We \ndon't change the amendment offered earlier by the Senator from Georgia, \nMr. Miller, with respect to pickup trucks; that remains where it is.\n  But we say that in 2015 we want the consumption of oil for our cars, \ntrucks, and vans consuming at that time 1 million barrels less than \nwhat it otherwise would be without this amendment.\n  Senator Specter, in joining me in this amendment, I thought offered a \nvery constructive change. He suggested that in order to meet these \nsavings, rather than just having the Secretary of Transportation issue \na regulation to change the CAFE standard, why don't we ask the \nSecretary of Transportation to take into consideration a number of \nother factors, including the use of alternative forms of fuel.\n  The amendment, as amended by Senator Specter, does just that. The \nSecretary of Transportation, in issuing his regulations in the future, \ncan require so much savings from CAFE changes, so much savings from \nalternative fuels, including biodiesel, soydiesel, ethanol, even diesel \nfuel derived from coal waste.\n  I think our obligation here is to set the objective. The \nresponsibility of the Congress and the President is to say--and we now \nrely for almost 60 percent of our oil from abroad. We have a $400 \nbillion trade deficit, and it is growing, and one-third of that is \nattributable to oil, which is troublesome, and the notion that we have \nglobal warming, and one-quarter of the carbon dioxide that goes up into \nthe air which comes from cars, trucks, and vans--we have an obligation \nto set measurable objectives in terms of slowing growth and reserving \noil.\n  This amendment does so in a flexible way. It says to the Secretary of \nTransportation very clearly: We expect you to rely on working with the \nauto industry on issuing a regulation that may involve CAFE changes. We \nalso want to make sure we rely on alternative fuels.\n  For a State such as Delaware, we have a heavy reliance on the raising \nof soybeans. We like the idea of encouraging soydiesel.\n  For those who come from States where there is a lot of corn, there is \nthe notion that the Secretary of Transportation can issue regulations \nto encourage the consumption of ethanol to help power our cars, trucks, \nand vans in the future.\n  For those who come from States with a fair amount of coal and coal \nwaste, there is the notion that you can use that waste product to \nactually create a cleaner diesel fuel that can be used for reducing our \nreliance on oil, and particularly foreign oil.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 4 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. CARPER. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Delaware.\n  Mr. President, I support the Carper amendment because I think it is \nvitally important that the United States take affirmative steps to free \nourselves from dependence upon OPEC oil. This amendment is a modest \nstep in that direction.\n  While we are using 7.8 million barrels of oil a day to drive our \nvehicles--the estimate by the Department of Energy is that it will grow \nto 10.6 million barrels by the year 2015--the Carper-Specter amendment \nproposes to limit that growth to 9.6 million barrels. We are still \ngoing to use about 2 million barrels more. But this amendment makes the \nmodest step of slowing the rate of increase by 1 million barrels of \noil.\n  It is an intolerable situation, for us to be dependent upon OPEC oil. \nToday's New York Times carries a report about Crown Prince Abdullah of \nSaudi Arabia's proposed statement to the President concerning using \nSaudi oil as an ``oil weapon'' against the United States to demand that \nthe United States change our policy in the Mideast. That is blackmail, \npure and simple. And the United States ought not to put up with it and \nought not to be in the position to have to put up with it.\n  Then the New York Times article goes on to point out that the Saudi \nposition is that they are prepared to ``move to the right of bin \nLaden'' if necessary to make the United States capitulate on our \npolicy.\n  Now, how much more arrogant and inflammatory can a comment be? Saudi \nArabia produced bin Laden. Fifteen of the nineteen terrorists who \nattacked the United States on 9-11 were from Saudi Arabia. Now the \nSaudis are telling us they are not only embracing bin Laden but are \nprepared to move to the right of him if the United States does not \nyield to their demands on changing our policy in the Mideast.\n  In 1973, we faced lines at the gas station, and I think it would have \nbeen a blessing--perhaps a blessing in disguise--if we had not had \nrelief from the oil embargo at that time, so that the United States, in \n1973, would have been compelled to find alternative sources of energy. \nBut we went back to our old ways, and the old ways were the easy ways \nand the ways of consuming vast quantities of OPEC oil.\n  I have opposed the CAFE standards; that is, for Congress to set a \nmandatory limit of so many miles per gallon, and earlier in this debate \nI voted against those CAFE standards.\n  I recall, about a decade ago, being asked to oppose CAFE standards \nfor 1 year. Well, that year turned into another year, and yet another \nyear. And, finally, it has been a decade or more, and we are still \navoiding the imposition of CAFE standards, which is right because \nCongress ought not to micro-manage how much gasoline is used.\n  But where you have a broad policy consideration, as the Carper-\nSpecter amendment proposes, modestly, to reduce the rate of increase--\nand bear in mind, again, the statistics are that we use a little over 7 \nmillion barrels a day, and we will go to more than 10 million barrels a \nday by 2015--this amendment simply requires the Department of Energy \nand the Department of Transportation to find a formula to limit it to \n9.6 million barrels a day.\n  American ingenuity can find the solution to the alternative fuel \nissue if we are put to the test we always have. After all, we put a man \non the Moon. We invented and placed predators--robots--on the \nbattlefield in defense of our troops. We have plans for a strategic \ndefense initiative. The opportunities for scientific advances that will \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil are virtually limitless in our \ninventive society.\n  Back in 1973, when we had the long gas lines, there was blame \nattached to Israel and there was the undercurrent of anti-Semitism in \nthe United States. Today, we see the outburst of anti-Semitism in \nEurope and in many parts of the world as a result of the Israeli policy \nand as a result of the United States backing Israeli policy.\n\n[[Page S3373]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator has used 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask for 1 more minute.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I yield another minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. And this issue I raise with some reluctance. But there \nis no doubt that if we face an embargo and if we face the Saudis \njoining Iraq in using oil as a weapon, Israel will be blamed and anti-\nSemitism, which now bubbles just a little below the surface in many \nparts of the world, will rise to the surface and exceed it.\n\n  I think it is vital that the Congress establish a policy to be \nindependent of OPEC oil. Today, in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, there is a \nplant which converts sludge into diesel fuel. If we set our minds to \nit, we can use the billions of tons of coal to find an alternative \nsource of oil and not put up with the arrogance and the chutzpah of the \nSaudis telling us to change our policy in response to their blackmail. \nA strong statement to follow, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Madam President, in March, the Levin-Bond amendment regarding \nincreased fuel standards for cars and trucks was adopted by the Senate \nwith a strong bipartisan vote of 62 to 38. The purpose of the Levin-\nBond amendment was explicit. No. 1, we said we want to increase fuel \neconomy. It was specified that way. As a matter of fact, we directed \nthe Department of Transportation, in its rulemaking, to increase fuel \neconomy. It is very explicit.\n  The other provisions of the bill that we adopted were aimed at \nprotecting the environment, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, but \nto do this in a way which would not harm the domestic manufacturing \nindustry.\n  We believe, those 62 of us who voted for it, you could accomplish all \nof these goals: You could reduce our dependence on foreign oil, you \ncould reduce the amount of oil we use, you could increase fuel economy, \nyou could protect the environment, and you could do that without \nundermining our economy. That was the purpose of the amendment, and \nthat is the way we explicitly stated it.\n  The way we accomplish those goals becomes vitally important. That is \nwhat gets to the heart of the debate this afternoon. The amendment we \nadopted did it in two essential ways: First, we included some positive \nincentives. We provided that there would be joint research and \ndevelopment to a greater extent among Government, industry, and \nacademia than there had been previously or than was proposed by the \nadministration. And we provided for Government purchases of hybrids, \nrequiring those purchases. Just the way we had previously done for the \nDefense Department in the Defense authorization bill, we did for the \ngeneral Government in the Levin-Bond amendment.\n\n  We also indicated an interest in trying to provide greater tax \nincentives. And there will be an effort later on this afternoon to do \nexactly that: To increase the tax incentives that would be available to \nlead us to the advanced technologies, the advanced hybrids, and the \nfuel cells.\n  But then we also did it in a second way. We said there also should be \nincreased CAFE requirements but--and this was central to the Levin-Bond \namendment--those requirements should be set after an analysis by the \nDepartment of Transportation of all of the factors which should go into \nthat decision--not just what is theoretically, technologically capable \nregardless of cost, but what are the technological capabilities, what \nare the costs, what are the impacts on safety, because we had the \nNational Academy of Sciences say there is an impact on safety, that you \nlose lives when you reduce the weight of the vehicle.\n  We had additional factors. If I could just read through some of these \nfactors: Economic practicability, the need of the United States to \nconserve energy, the desirability to reduce U.S. dependence on imported \noil, the effects of average fuel economy on other standards, such as \nrelative to passenger safety and air quality. These are all \ninterrelated criteria. And then: What are the adverse effects on the \ncompetitiveness of domestic manufacturers? What are the effects on the \nlevel of employment in the United States, the costs and lead time? What \nis the potential of advanced technologies, such as hybrids and fuel \ncells, to contribute to the achievement of significant reductions in \nfuel consumption? And a very important one, No. 12: The extent to which \nthe necessity for vehicle manufacturers to incur near-term costs to \ncomply with average fuel economy standards adversely affects the \navailability of resources for the development of advanced technology in \nthe future, for leap-ahead technologies.\n  We listed 12 factors that we said should be considered by the \nDepartment of Transportation prior to concluding what the new standard \nshould be. We said: You have to increase it, but we want you to look at \n12 factors.\n  What the Carper amendment does is it wipes out, it eliminates all of \nthose factors. It sets a mandatory amount. You must reduce by 1 million \nbarrels per day above what is the predicted use of gasoline for those \nyears--by another agency, by the way--and that is what it does. It cuts \nthe heart out of the Levin-Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. LEVIN. When the Senator from Delaware says it doesn't change \nLevin-Bond, I am afraid he is mistaken. He fundamentally changes the \nLevin-Bond amendment, which we adopted a month ago. The change he makes \nis that he says, forget the consideration of all those other factors. \nYou have to reduce it by 1 million barrels a day regardless of the \nimpact on safety, regardless of the effect on long-term investments by \nthese short-term investments for near-term advances, forget economic \npractical ability, forget cost, forget all the other factors that we \ndirected the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration to \nconsider. Even though he leaves them--he does not strike them \ntechnically; he doesn't go out and cancel them; the words still \nremain--the heart of the matter is gone because the heart of the \nregulatory matter in Levin-Bond is that we say to the Department of \nTransportation, you have 15 months. You adopt standards increasing fuel \neconomy. If you don't do it in 15 months, we are going to have an \nexpedited procedure in the Senate and in the House to consider \ndifferent proposals. If you do adopt standards, they, of course, would \nbe subject to legislative review under a generic statute. Either way, \nwe will have an expedited process to look at the recommended number of \nthe Department of Transportation after they go through a regulatory \nprocess, not before.\n  This amendment prejudges the outcome of the very regulatory process \nwhich Levin-Bond put into law, if this law is ever signed.\n  I hope we will defeat this amendment for all those reasons.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the vote in relation \nto amendment number 3198, which was offered by my friend and colleague \nfrom the State of Delaware, Senator Carper. The vote by the Senate is \non a motion to table the amendment. I believe that Senator Carper \nshould be given a straight up-or-down vote on his amendment, and for \nthat reason, I shall vote against the motion to table.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper. This amendment would add a \nnew section to the conclusion of the fuel economy provisions previously \nadopted by the Senate, which I supported, and which were offered by my \ncolleague from Michigan, Mr. Levin. The new section would require the \nSecretary of Transportation to issue, within 15 months, regulations to \nreduce the amount of oil consumed in passenger cars and light trucks in \n2015 by 1,000,000 barrels per day compared to consumption without such \nregulations in place.\n  I understand and support the desire to reduce the use of oil in the \ntransportation sector. Proponents of this amendment have argued that \nthis amendment is flexible and would allow the Department of \nTransportation to take other actions, not necessarily through \nadjustments in the fuel economy program, to achieve oil savings. In\n\n[[Page S3374]]\n\nfloor debate on this amendment, however, proponents have failed to \nclearly identify any other means of achieving oil savings other than \nfuel economy standards. I think there is broad consensus that new fuel \neconomy standards would be the principle tool to achieve oil savings.\n  I have supported a new rulemaking on fuel economy with my vote in \nsupport of the Levin amendment. But the Senate has also passed an \namendment on this bill, sponsored by the Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nMiller, which I opposed. The Miller amendment weakens current law and \nexempt pickup trucks from any future increases in fuel economy \nstandards. I feel that a new rulemaking on fuel economy should examine \nthe possibility of fuel economy improvements in all motor vehicles, \nrather than exempt certain types of vehicles.\n  I considered the Carper amendment in light of the amendments we have \nalready passes. Had the Carper amendment been included as part of the \noriginal Levin amendment, I might have felt differently on this matter. \nBut now that the Senate has already passed the Levin amendment and the \nMiller amendment, supporting the Carper amendment is no longer a sound \npolicy decision. To include an oil savings requirement, while excluding \na whole category of vehicles from making fuel economy improvements, \nwould be a poor policy decision and inconsistent. Certain vehicles \nshould not have to achieve greater fuel efficiency because we chose to \nexempt a particular category of vehicles.\n  Fuel efficiency is a critically important issue for our country, and \nfor Wisconsin. I am committed to achieving significant improvements in \nautomobile and light truck fuel efficiency. I look forward to having \nmany of those efficient vehicles built in Wisconsin. I will look \nforward to a bill in conference that strongly encourages the Department \nof Transportation to make those improvements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve and a half minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. What we have here is an amendment that would reverse \nthe decision on CAFE. Make no mistake about it. While I am sympathetic \nwith the appeal, particularly from my friend from Pennsylvania, \nrelative to how history is repeating itself as far as our increased \ndependence on imported oil, I can't help but look back at what we did \nin 1973. In 1973, we had the Yom Kippur War. We had a situation where \nour supply from the Mideast was interrupted. We had gas lines around \nthe block. We were blaming each other. We set up the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve to ensure that we would never, ever have a situation \nwhere we would became so vulnerable.\n  We thought at the time that, good heavens, if we ever increased 50 \npercent imports, that would be beyond the consideration of this country \nfrom the standpoint of national defense.\n  The problem with the Carper amendment specifically is it has no teeth \nin it. We are looking at a situation in the Mideast today where clearly \noil is a weapon. We have seen statements suggesting they are going to \nstand behind bin Laden's theory. They are going to stand behind brother \nSaddam Hussein.\n  We had an opportunity a few days ago to debate this issue about \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil. It was called ANWR. It was \nsubstantial. It was defeated. Now we are talking about a smoke-and-\nmirrors issue where we have no enforcement mechanism.\n  As a consequence, the Carper amendment would have the same negative \nimpacts on consumer safety, on vehicle costs, auto jobs, as the Kerry-\nMcCain amendment. It would increase the cost of cars. Consumers choice \nis gone, thousands of jobs, reductions in the rate of growth and \nseveral thousand additional deaths and tens of thousands of injuries.\n  Make no mistake about one thing: We made a decision on CAFE. It was \nbased on consideration of lives being saved by heavier automobiles. You \ncan increase CAFE dramatically by smaller automobiles, but you pay the \nprice. The decision that was made in this body on that issue was very \nclear. It was an overwhelming vote to reject Kerry-McCain based on \nconsideration for the loss of human lives and injuries.\n  We are in the same position today. Make no mistake about it. Our \nvulnerability continues. It has been over a month since we voted 62 to \n38 to adopt the Levin-Bond amendment on fuel economy standards. We \nchose at that time to leave the decisions on fuel economy to the \nexperts.\n  This group is not an expert group. We choose to let the experts \nbalance the need for increased fuel economy with safety and the needs \nof the American driving public. The Senate was right once not to pick a \nfuel economy number out of thin air. Let's not make that mistake now.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Carper amendment. Let's preserve \nAmerican jobs and save lives on the Nations's highways. That was the \nbasis for our last decision when we visited this issue.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, how much time on both sides remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight and a half to the sponsors and 9 to the \nopponents.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today to oppose the Carper-\nSpecter amendment. I join with my colleagues in opposition. I note this \nissue is of great importance to my colleague from Delaware. We have had \na lot of conversations about the best approach to increasing fuel \nefficiency and decreasing our dependence on foreign oil. While I \nappreciate his effort and the amendment he is bringing forward, I \nbelieve the Carper-Specter approach has the same major flaws as the \nKerry-Hollings amendment and sets, in fact, an arbitrary CAFE number. \nIt just does it in a different way. It is not called CAFE, but it has \nthe same effect.\n  The Carper-Specter amendment sets, in fact, an arbitrary number which \nis exactly what we were debating before. We wanted a process; we wanted \nNHTSA to have the opportunity to have a number of months to take into \nconsideration all of the factors and not set an arbitrary number.\n  Our opponents, the makers of the amendment, say this is, in fact, not \na CAFE number and that the amendment creates a modest and measurable \nobjective for reducing vehicle gasoline consumption. Unfortunately, it \nis a mandate. It is a fuel economy mandate in the form of millions of \nbarrels saved that is no less arbitrary than the Kerry-Hollings \nprovision that was replaced in this bill.\n  Currently, the only regulatory authority that is available to the \nDepartment of Transportation to pursue such regulations through \npassenger and light truck fleets is the CAFE program. No matter what we \ncall it, it is still CAFE. In essence, the amendment would impose this \narbitrary oil reduction number as an additional requirement to the \nDepartment of Transportation as it sets the CAFE levels, thereby \nundermining and distorting the rulemaking considerations and the \nprocess that we put together through the Levin-Bond proposal.\n  I am particularly concerned because now that we have essentially \neliminated pickup trucks from the equation, it puts even more pressure \non the other light trucks and SUVs that are made in the United States, \nwhich involve the employment of literally hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican workers. So it is even more distorted, given the amendment \nthat passed in the prior discussion.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment undermines the Levin-Bond proposal, and \nI urge us to maintain our position of supporting the process set up in \nthe Levin-Bond amendment, which passed by such a wide margin, because \nthis sets up a positive, new set of rules and guidance from Congress \nand requires us to address CAFE's impact on a wide variety of issues in \norder to increase our fuel efficiency standards.\n  We have to look at safety, jobs, the environment, which is very \nimportant to all of us--particularly those of us in Michigan. It makes \nsure we don't have a discriminatory impact on the U.S.\n\n[[Page S3375]]\n\nautomakers--I know that is of concern to all of us--so that we set the \nstandard given all of these criteria.\n  By requiring an overriding oil reduction number, the amendment sets a \nhard target, on top of the other considerations, that the rulemaking \nwould otherwise try to balance.\n  So I believe this amendment puts the cart before the horse. We have \nan excellent approach in front of us--I believe the best approach. We \nare not arguing that we should continue the freeze on CAFE. In fact, we \nare saying let's put in process the way to get to the new technologies. \nWe have a combination of market incentives and investments in new \ntechnologies and tax incentives. We have in place the package of \nincentives, a requirement by NHTSA of deadlines in terms of numbered \nmonths and the criteria to look at. We direct them in a very specific \nway.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and leave in place our \ncommitment to the process for raising fuel efficiency standards that \nhave already been established in this bill through the Levin-Bond \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Connecticut \n3 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to support the Carper-Specter \namendment.\n  We come today to offer America a clear path away from foreign oil \ndependency and toward a newly energized economic future, and that is a \nnew goal for fuel efficiency of cars and trucks.\n  America can start engineering itself out of its oil dependency if we \nmake it a priority. This amendment would do just that by setting a bold \nbut realistic goal of reducing our projected dependence on oil by one \nmillion barrels a day by 2015, thereby reducing our reliance on \nimported oil.\n  There's no debate that we must change the status quo. According to \nthe Energy Information Administration, in 2001, the U.S. consumed 18 \nmillion barrels of oil per day. Automobiles and light trucks used 68 \npercent of the total, or 12.25 million barrels per day. The EIA \nestimates total U.S. consumption of between 25 and 28 million barrels \nper day by 2020.\n  The majority of that oil comes from other nations. In 2001, the U.S. \nimported 9.1 million barrels of oil per day. Approximately 1.65 million \nbarrels per day came from Saudi Arabia and 0.82 million barrels per day \ncame from Iraq.\n  The question before us today is, Do we keep our blinders on and \nbarrel along doing business as usual, knowing full well that we're \nheaded in the wrong direction, or do we have the foresight to change \ncourse?\n  President Bush and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know \nwe have no choice but to change course. On February 25 of this year, \nthe President said, ``It's important for Americans to remember . . . \nthat America imports more than 50 percent of its oil--more than 10 \nmillion barrels a day. And the figure is rising . . . This dependence \nis a challenge to our economic security, because dependence can lead to \nprice shocks and fuel shortages. And this dependence on foreign oil is \na matter of national security. To put it bluntly, sometimes we rely \nupon energy sources from countries that don't particularly like us.''\n  We consume a quarter of the world's oil and have about three percent \nof its reserves--so even if we allowed drilling in the Arctic Refuge, \nthe Rockies, and right here beneath the Capitol dome, the nations from \nwhich we import oil would still have us over a barrel. Please indulge \nmy oil-dependent puns; in the spirit of this amendment, I am trying to \nget as much mileage out of them as possible.\n  In contrast, Mr. President, the fuel efficiency gains we're proposing \ntoday cannot be exhausted, they cannot run dry, and they will begin to \nshift our economy away from its usage of oil. These steps are the best \nway to substantially reduce our reliance on foreign oil.\n  To quote again from the President, ``It's also important to realize \nthat the transportation sector consumes more than two-thirds of all the \npetroleum used in the United States, so that any effort to reduce \nconsumption must include ways to safely make cars and trucks more fuel \nefficient.''\n  I couldn't agree more. Compared to proposals to open precious places \nto oil exploration, this measure would achieve more at a monumentally \nsmaller price to America. In fact, the entrepreneurship, creativity and \ningenuity that would be unleashed when companies strive to hit this \ntarget would create jobs. They would spur economic growth. And, of \ncourse, they would help repair the environment in the process--rather \nthan continue to contribute to air pollution, global warming, and the \ndegradation that often goes along with drilling for oil in natural \nplaces.\n  These proposals, Mr. President, are also more than feasible. Earlier \nthis year, the National Academies of Science concluded that current \ntechnology was available to achieve efficiency gains that far exceed \nthose required in this amendment, and that was even excluding \nconsideration of the hybrid technology that is on the market right now. \nWe must put our faith in the innovative genius of American industry to \nmeet the challenge that this amendment poses.\n  Mr. President, this amendment also provides the lead-time and \nflexibility our industry needs to achieve these goals. It does not \nmicromanage where or how these savings should occur, but rather would \nprovide maximum flexibility to the appropriate agencies in achieving \nthe objective of using, and therefore importing, less oil. It leaves \nintact all of the provisions that are now included in the underlying \nbill.\n  In short, this proposal has been carefully crafted to address the \nconcerns raised by Senators in both parties regarding the previous CAFE \namendment. I hope that the Senate finds this to be a much-improved \namendment that can be broadly embraced.\n  Mr. President, the importance of reducing our reliance on foreign oil \nhas been echoed throughout this chamber again and again over the last \nfew weeks. I could quote from scores of my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle who have decried the problem and put the highest priority on \nfinding a solution.\n  But when it comes down to it, we have failed to prove that we're \nwilling to lead America to a better way. This must end. We must re-\nenergize our commitment to reach bi-partisan consensus on weaning our \neconomy off of fossil fuels. The process will by definition be a \ngradual one--so we must start now.\n  Mr. President, there are 99 barrels of oil on the wall, 99 barrels of \noil. Most of them, no matter how much we explore, come from overseas. \nIf just one of those barrels should happen to fall, we'll still need \nall 99 barrels of oil on the wall, and they'll still mostly come from \noverseas. But if we as a nation can change our craving for that oil--\nget on the efficiency wagon, so to speak--so that we only need 90 or 80 \nor 70 and shrinking barrels of oil, we can alter that repetitive \nrefrain.\n  The question is: Do we have the drive to get there? Do we have the \nwill? If we have the will, American ingenuity can and will find the \nway. No one should have any doubt about that. But it takes leadership \nfrom Washington, and that is what I hope we in the Congress are willing \nto provide, beginning with this amendment.\n  Madam President, again, I think we all agree on the problem. The \nproblem is that America is dangerously dependent on foreign oil. No \nmatter how great our military might is, how strong our economy is, that \ndependence upon foreign oil makes us vulnerable.\n  The only way to break our dependence on foreign oil is to diminish \nour dependence on oil. We just don't have enough of it in reserve. One \nof the most tried and true American ways to deal with problems of this \nkind is through thrift, efficiency, conservation, and a better use of \nresources.\n  I grew up with a slogan, as I bet a lot of Members did, which is \n``waste not, want not.'' We are using fuel in a wasteful way.\n  This amendment is, in my opinion, not in contradiction to the Levin-\nBond amendment. Nothing in the Levin-Bond amendment would be undermined \nor distorted by the rulemaking considerations that are effected by this \nCarper-Specter amendment. The language is respectful of Levin-Bond and \nsimply adds the oil-saving target of reducing America's use of oil by 1 \nmillion barrels a day by 2015. You remember the movie ``Field of \nDreams,'' where it was\n\n[[Page S3376]]\n\nsaid, ``if you build it, they will come.'' We are saying affirmatively, \nif we set a standard America will meet that standard, and probably go \nbeyond it.\n  If we do not, we will continue to make ourselves vulnerable by being \ndependent on a source of fuel that we do not control. We consume a \nquarter of the world's oil. We have about 3 percent of its reserves. So \neven if we allowed drilling in the Arctic Refuge, the Rockies, and \nperhaps right here beneath the Capitol dome, the nations from which we \nimport oil would still have us--if you will allow an oil-dependent \npun--over a barrel.\n  In contrast, the fuel efficiency gains proposed in this amendment \ncannot be exhausted, cannot run dry, and will begin to shift our \neconomy away from its dependency on oil. We have the technological \ncapacity to do it if law drives that technology.\n  Earlier this year, the National Academy of Sciences concluded that \ncurrent technology was available to achieve the efficiency gains that \nfar exceed those required in this amendment. That even excluded \nconsideration of the hybrid technology on the market right now, which \nthe automakers cannot produce fast enough for the consumers who want to \nbuy them.\n  We have to put our faith in the innovative genius of American \nindustry to meet the challenge that this amendment poses, and I am sure \nthey will not only meet it, they will surpass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes remain on each side.\n  Who yields time? If neither side yields time, time will be charged \nequally.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I voted for the Levin-Bond amendment on \nthat 68-to-32 vote. But the Carper-Specter amendment is not \ninconsistent with that at all. We simply establish a consistent \nstandard. We are not establishing a CAFE standard. We are just asking \nthat there be a national policy to limit U.S. dependence on foreign \noil.\n  Today, this week, this month is not the first time that I have \nexpressed my concern about our undue dependence on foreign oil. I ask \nunanimous consent that my letter to President Clinton, dated April 11, \n2000, and my letter to President Bush, dated April 25, 2001, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2000.\n     President William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In light of the very serious problems \n     caused by the recent increase in oil prices, we know you will \n     share our view that we should explore every possible \n     alternative to stop OPEC and other oil-producing states from \n     entering into agreements to restrict oil production in order \n     to drive up the price of oil.\n       This conduct is nothing more than an old-fashioned \n     conspiracy in restraint of trade which has long been \n     condemned under U.S. law, and which should be condemned under \n     international law.\n       After some considerable research, we suggest that serious \n     consideration be given to two potential lawsuits against OPEC \n     and the nations conspiring with it:\n       (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust \n     law.\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the \n     Hague based, perhaps, upon an advisory opinion under ``the \n     general principles of law recognized by civilized nations,'' \n     which includes prohibiting oil cartels from conspiring to \n     limit production and raise prices.\n       (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust \n     law. A case can be made that your Administration can sue OPEC \n     in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust law. OPEC is \n     clearly engaging in a ``conspiracy in restraint of trade'' in \n     violation of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1). The \n     Administration has the power to sue under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 4 \n     for injunctive relief to prevent such collusion.\n       In addition, the Administration should consider suing OPEC \n     for treble damages under the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. \n     15a), since OPEC's behavior has caused an ``injury'' to U.S. \n     ``property.'' After all, the U.S. government is a major \n     consumer of petroleum products and must now pay higher prices \n     for these products. In Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330 \n     (1979), the Supreme Court held that he consumers who were \n     direct purchasers of certain hearing aides who alleged that \n     collusion among manufacturers had led to an increase in \n     prices had standing to sue those manufacturers under the \n     Clayton Act since ``a consumer deprived of money by reason of \n     allegedly anticompetitive conduct is injured in `property' \n     within the meaning of [the Clayton Act].'' Indirect \n     purchasers would appear to be precluded from suit, even in a \n     class action, under Illinois Brick v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 \n     (1977), but this would not bar the United Sates Government, \n     as a direct purchaser, from having the requisite standing.\n       One potential obstacle to such a suit is whether the \n     Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (``FSIA'') provides OPEC, a \n     group of sovereign foreign nations, with immunity from suit \n     in U.S. courts. To date, there has been a ruling on this \n     issue in only one case. In International Association of \n     Machinists v. OPEC, 477 F. Supp. 553 (1979), the District \n     Court for the Central District of California held that the \n     nations which comprise OPEC were immune from suit in the \n     United States under the FSIA. We believe that this opinion \n     was wrongly decided and that other district courts, including \n     the D.C. District, can and should revisit the issue.\n       This decision in Int. Assoc. of Machinists turned on the \n     technical issue of whether or not the nations which comprise \n     OPEC are engaging in ``commercial activity'' or \n     ``governmental activity'' when they cooperate to sell their \n     oil. If they are engaging in ``governmental activity,'' then \n     the FSIA shields them from suit in U.S. courts. If, however, \n     these nations are engaging in ``commercial activity,'' then \n     they are subject to suit in the U.S. The California District \n     Court held that OPEC activity is ``governmental activity.'' \n     We disagree. It is certainly a governmental activity for a \n     nation to regulate the extraction of petroleum from its \n     territory by ensuring compliance with zoning, environmental \n     and other regulatory regimes. It is clearly a commercial \n     activity, however, for these nations to sit together and \n     collude to limit their oil production for the sole purpose of \n     increasing prices.\n       The 9th Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling in \n     Int. Assoc. of Machinists in 1981 (649 F.2d 1354), but on the \n     basis of an entirely different legal principle. The 9th \n     Circuit held that the Court could not hear this case because \n     of the ``act of state'' doctrine, which holds that a U.S. \n     court will not adjudicate a politically sensitive dispute \n     which would require the court to judge the legality of the \n     sovereign act of a foreign state.\n       The 9th Circuit itself acknowledged in its Int. Assoc. of \n     Machinists opinion that ``The [act of state] doctrine does \n     not suggest a rigid rule of application,'' but rather \n     application of the rule will depend on the circumstances for \n     each case. The Court also noted that, ``A further \n     consideration is the availability of internationally-accepted \n     legal principles which would render the issues appropriate \n     for judicial disposition.'' The Court then quotes from the \n     Supreme Court's opinion in Banco Nacional de Cuba v. \n     Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398 (1964).\n       ``It should be apparent that the greater of codification or \n     consensus concerning a particular area of international law, \n     the more appropriate it is for the judiciary to render \n     decisions regarding it, since the courts can then focus on \n     the application of an agreed principle to circumstances of \n     fact rather than on the sensitive task of establishing a \n     principle not inconsistent with the national interest or with \n     international justice.''\n       Since the 9th Circuit issued its opinion in 1981, there \n     have been major developments in international law that impact \n     directly on the subject matter at issue. As we discuss in \n     greater detail below, the 1990's have witnessed a significant \n     increase in efforts to seek compliance with basic \n     international norms of behavior through international \n     courts and tribunals. In addition, there is strong \n     evidence of an emerging consensus in international law \n     that price fixing by cartels violates such international \n     norms. Accordingly, a court choosing to apply the act of \n     state doctrine to a dispute with OPEC today may very well \n     reach a different conclusion than the 9th Circuit reached \n     almost twenty years ago.\n       You should also examine whether the anticompetitive conduct \n     of the international oil cartel is being effectuated by \n     private companies who are subject to the enforcement of U.S. \n     antitrust laws (for example, former state oil companies that \n     have now been privatized) rather than sovereign foreign \n     states. If such private oil companies are determined to in \n     fact be participating in the anticompetitive conduct of the \n     oil cartel, then we would urge that these companies be named \n     as defendants in an antitrust lawsuit in addition to the OPEC \n     members.\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the \n     Hague based upon ``the general principles of law recognized \n     by civilized nations,'' which includes prohibiting oil \n     cartels from conspiring to limit production and raise prices. \n     In addition to such domestic antitrust actions, we believe \n     you should give serious consideration to bringing a case \n     against OPEC before the International Court of Justice (the \n     ``ICJ'') at the Hague. You should consider both a direct suit \n     against the conspiring nations as well as a request for an \n     advisory opinion from the Court through the auspices of the \n     U.N. Security Council. The actions of OPEC in restraint of \n     trade violate ``the general principles of law recognized by \n     civilized nations.'' Under Article 38 of the Statute of the \n     ICJ, the Court is required to apply these ``general \n     principles'' when deciding cases before it.\n       This would clearly be a cutting-edge lawsuit, making new \n     law at the international\n\n[[Page S3377]]\n\n     level. But there have been exciting developments in recent \n     years which suggest that the ICJ would be willing to move in \n     this direction. In a number of contexts, we have seen a \n     greater respect for and adherence to fundamental \n     international principles and norms by the world community. \n     For example, we have seen the establishment of the \n     International Criminal Court in 1998, the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1994, and the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 1993. Each of \n     these bodies has been active, handing down numerous \n     indictments and convictions against individuals who have \n     violated fundamental principles of human rights. For example, \n     as of December 1, 1999 the Yugoslavia tribunal alone had \n     handed down 91 public indictments.\n       Today, adherence to international principles has spread \n     from the tribunals in the Hague to individual nations around \n     the world. Recently, the exiled former dictator of Chad, \n     Hissene Habre, was indicted in Senegal on charges or torture \n     and barbarity stemming from his reign, where he allegedly \n     killed and tortured thousands. This case is similar to the \n     case brought against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet \n     by Spain on the basis of his alleged atrocities in Chile. At \n     the request of the Spanish government, Pinochet was detained \n     in London for months until an English court determined that \n     he was too ill to stand trial.\n       The emerging scope of international law was demonstrated in \n     an advisory opinion sought by the U.N. General Assembly in \n     1996 to declare illegal the use or threat to use nuclear \n     weapons. Such an issue would ordinarily be thought beyond the \n     scope of a judicial determination given the doctrines of \n     national sovereignty and the importance of nuclear weapons to \n     the defense of many nations. The ICJ ultimately ruled eight \n     to seven, however, that the use or threat to use nuclear \n     weapons ``would generally be contrary to the rules of \n     international law applicable in armed conflict, and in \n     particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law.'' \n     The fact that this issue was subject to a decision by the \n     ICJ, shows the rapidly expanding horizons of international \n     law.\n       While these emerging norms of international behavior have \n     tended to focus more on human rights than on economic \n     principles, there is one economic issue on which an \n     international consensus has emerged in recent years--the \n     illegitimacy of price fixing by cartels. For example, on \n     April 27, 1998, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development issued an official ``Recommendation'' that all \n     twenty-nine members nations ``ensure that their competition \n     laws effectively halt and deter hard core cartels.'' The \n     recommendation defines ``hard core cartels'' as those which, \n     among other things, fix prices or establish output \n     restriction quotas. The Recommendation further instructs \n     member countries ``to cooperate with each other in enforcing \n     their laws against such cartels.''\n       On October 9, 1998, eleven Western Hemisphere countries \n     held the first ``Antitrust Summit of the Americas'' in Panama \n     City, Panama. At the close of the summit, all eleven \n     participants issued a joint communique in which they \n     expressed their intention ``to affirm their commitment to \n     effective enforcement of sound competition laws, particularly \n     in combating illegal price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market \n     allocations.'' The communique further expresses the intention \n     of these countries to ``cooperate with one another . . . to \n     maximize the efficacy and efficiency of the enforcement of \n     each country's competition laws.'' One of the countries \n     participating in this communique, Venezuela, is a member of \n     OPEC.\n       The behavior of OPEC and other oil-producing nations in \n     restraint of trade violates U.S. antitrust law and basic \n     international norms, and it is injuring the United States and \n     its citizens in a very real way. Consideration of such legal \n     action could provide an inducement to OPEC and other oil-\n     producing countries to raise production to head off such \n     litigation.\n       We hope that you will seriously consider judicial action to \n     put an end to such behavior.\n     Arlen Specter,\n     Herb Kohl\n     Charles Schumer,\n     Mike DeWine,\n     Strom Thurmond,\n     Joe Biden\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2001.\n     President George Walker Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In light of the energy crisis and the \n     high prices of OPEC oil, we know you will share our view that \n     we must explore every possible alternative to stop OPEC and \n     other oil-producing states from entering into agreements to \n     restrict oil production in order to drive up the price of \n     oil.\n       This conduct is nothing more than an old-fashioned \n     conspiracy in restraint of trade which has long been \n     condemned under U.S. law, and which should be condemned under \n     international law.\n       After some research, we suggest that serious consideration \n     be given to two potential lawsuits against OPEC and the \n     nations conspiring with it:\n       (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust \n     law.\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the \n     Hague based upon ``the general principles of law recognized \n     by civilized nations.''\n       (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust \n     law. A strong case can be made that your Administration can \n     sue OPEC in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust law. \n     OPEC is clearly engaging in a ``conspiracy in restraint of \n     trade'' in violation of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1). \n     The Administration has the power to sue under 15 U.S.C. Sec. \n     4 for injunctive relief to prevent such collusion.\n       In addition, the Administration has the power to sue OPEC \n     for treble damages under the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. \n     15a), since OPEC's behavior has caused an ``injury'' to U.S. \n     ``property.'' After all, the U.S. government is a consumer of \n     petroleum products and must now pay higher prices for these \n     products. In Reiter v. Sonotone Corp, 442 U.S. 330 (1979), \n     the Supreme Court held that the consumers of certain hearing \n     aids who alleged that collusion among manufacturers had led \n     to an increase in prices had standing to sue those \n     manufacturers under the Clayton Act since ``a consumer \n     deprived of money by reason of allegedly anticompetitive \n     conduct is injured in `property' within the meaning of [the \n     Clayton Act].''\n       One issue that would be raised by such a suit is whether \n     the foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (``FSIA'') provides \n     OPEC, a group of sovereign foreign nations, with immunity \n     from suit in U.S. courts. To date, only one Federal court, \n     the District Court for the Central District of California, \n     has reviewed this issue. In International Association of \n     Machinists v. OPEC, 477 F. Supp. 553 (1979), the Court held \n     that the nations which comprise OPEC were immune from suit in \n     the United Stats under the FSIA. We believe that this opinion \n     was wrongly decided and that other District courts, including \n     the D.C. District, can and should revisit the issue.\n       This decision in Int. Assoc. of Machinists turned on the \n     technical issue of whether or not the nations which comprise \n     OPEC are engaging in ``commercial activity'' or \n     ``governmental activity'' when they cooperate to sell their \n     oil. If they are engaging in ``governmental activity,'' then \n     the FSIA shields them from suit in U.S. courts. If, however, \n     these nations are engaging in ``commercial activity,'' then \n     they are subject to suit in the U.S. The California District \n     court held that OPEC activity is ``governmental activity.'' \n     We disagree. It is certainly a governmental activity for a \n     nation to regulate the extraction of petroleum from its \n     territory by ensuring compliance with zoning, environmental \n     and other regulatory regimes. It is clearly a commercial \n     activity, however, for these nations to sit together and \n     collude to limit their oil production for the sole purpose of \n     increasing prices.\n       The 9th Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling in \n     Int. Assoc. of Machinists in 1981 (649 F.2d 1354), but on the \n     basis of an entirely different legal principle. The 9th \n     Circuit held that the Court could not hear this case because \n     of the ``act of state'' doctrine, which holds that a U.S. \n     court will not adjudicate a politically sensitive dispute \n     which would require the court to judge the legality of the \n     sovereign act of a foreign state.\n       The 9th Circuit itself acknowledged in its Int. Assoc. of \n     Machinists opinion that ``The [act of state] doctrine does \n     not suggest a rigid rule of application,'' but rather \n     application of the rule will depend on the circumstances of \n     each case. The Court also noted that, ``A further \n     consideration is the availability of internationally-accepted \n     legal principles which would render the issues appropriate \n     for judicial disposition.'' The court then quotes from the \n     Supreme Court's opinion in Banco Nacional de Cuba v. \n     Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398 (1964):\n       ``It should be apparent that the greater the degree of \n     codification or consensus concerning a particular area of \n     international law, the more appropriate it is for the \n     judiciary to render decision regarding it, since the courts \n     can then focus on the application of an agreed principle to \n     circumstances of fact rather than on the sensitive take of \n     establishing a principle not inconsistent with the national \n     interest or with international justice.''\n       Since the 9th circuit issued its opinion in 1981, there \n     have been major developments in international law that impact \n     directly on the subject matter at issue. As we discuss in \n     greater detail below, the 1990's have witnessed a significant \n     increase in efforts to seek compliance with basic \n     international norms of behavior through international courts \n     and tribunals. In addition, there is strong evidence of an \n     emerging consensus in international law that price fixing by \n     cartels violates such international norms. Accordingly, a \n     court choosing to apply the act of state doctrine to a \n     dispute with OPEC today may very well reach a different \n     conclusion than the 9th Circuit reached almost twenty \n     years ago.\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at The \n     Hague based upon ``the general principles of law recognized \n     by civilized nations.'' In addition to such domestic \n     antitrust actions, we believe you should give serious \n     consideration to bringing a case against OPEC before the \n     International Court of Justice (the ``ICJ'') at The Hague. \n     You should consider both a direct suit against the conspiring \n     nations as well as a request for an advisory opinion from the \n     Court through the auspices of the U.N. Security Council. The \n     actions of OPEC in restraint of trade violate ``the general \n     principles of law recognized by civilized nations.'' Under \n     Article 38 of the Statute of the ICJ, the Court is\n\n[[Page S3378]]\n\n     required to apply these ``general principles'' when deciding \n     cases before it.\n       This would clearly be a cutting-edge lawsuit, making new \n     law at the international level. But there have been exciting \n     developments in recent years which suggest that the ICJ would \n     be willing to move in this direction.

The Federal lawsuit, Prewitt v. OPEC, establishes an \nantitrust violation by OPEC, and my letters to Presidents Clinton and \nBush set forth legal mechanisms for dealing with OPEC where they engage \nin a conspiracy in restraint of trade and conspiracy to limit \nproduction and raise prices.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Harrisburg Patriot \nbe printed in the Record. It sets out in some detail a way that the \nsludge can be turned into fuel to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Patriot-News, Jan. 4, 2002]\n\n                     Coal-to-Diesel Idea Promising\n\n       Whatever else it has meant for America, the Sept. 11 \n     terrorism underscored the folly of U.S. dependence on Middle \n     Eastern oil.\n       And while some people believe it mandates drilling for \n     petroleum in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other \n     environmentally sensitive areas, others see the logic in \n     developing legitimate alternative fuels, utilizing the kind \n     of ingenuity and entrepreneurial skills on which America was \n     built.\n       Unfortunately, expanded oil drilling and alternative fuel \n     development are tied together in the energy package that \n     remains bottled up in the U.S. Senate, where drilling in ANWR \n     is a key item of debate. Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., \n     who sets the agenda, opposes ANWR drilling, which is \n     supported by the president and included in the energy bill \n     approved by the House last summer.\n       What that means for Pennsylvania in particular is that \n     construction of a $450 million plant in Schuylkill County to \n     convert coal waste into diesel fuel is on hold.\n       John W. Rich, Jr., scion of a family that made its fortune \n     in mining coal, wants to apply proven South African \n     technology to produce 5,000 barrels a day of sulfur-free \n     diesel fuel and eliminate 1 million tons a year of \n     environmentally damaging coal waste from Pennsylvania's coal \n     regions.\n       Rich's proposal has won political support and tax credits \n     from the state and a $7.8 million startup grant from the \n     federal government. He hopes that the energy bill, if it ever \n     passes, will provide up to $100 million more, completing a \n     financial package that includes investments from Chevron-\n     Texaco and a Bechtel affiliate.\n       America's oil resources are so limited and difficult to tap \n     that some foreign oil will always be required here. On the \n     other hand, coal-waste conversion to diesel, a proven \n     technology, would make use of a ready supply of coal and coal \n     waste in Pennsylvania that, in oil equivalent, exceeds the \n     known petroleum reserves of Iraq.\n       Not only would this technology cut into the need for \n     foreign oil, but its cost, in comparison to the expense of \n     drilling in ANWR and piping the crude oil south to the Lower \n     48, quite likely would underscore the folly of that proposal.\n       The Senate needs to settle on a compromise and pass an \n     energy bill to make practical alternatives to Middle Eastern \n     oil a reality.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I think if every one of our colleagues \nread the story on the front page of the New York Times today, there \nwould be no doubt about the insistence of this body to reduce our \ndependence on OPEC oil. To have Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia \nrelease through a spokesman what he intends to say to the President of \nthe United States--that Saudi Arabia will use oil as an oil weapon, as \nSaddam Hussein has done is outrageous. The spokesman is quoted as \nsaying that Saudi Arabia is prepared to go to the right of bin Laden, \nand that Saudi Arabia is prepared to fly to Baghdad and embrace Saddam \nHussein like a brother.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article ``Saudi To \nWarn Bush of Rupture Over Israel Policy'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the article was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                [From The New York Times, Apr. 25, 2002]\n\n            Saudi To Warn Bush of Rupture Over Israel Policy\n\n                         (By Patrick E. Tyler)\n\n       Houston, Apr. 24.--Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia is \n     expected to tell President Bush in stark terms at their \n     meeting on Thursday that the strategic relationship between \n     their two countries will be threatened if Mr. Bush does not \n     moderate his support for Israel's military policies, a person \n     familiar with the Saudi's thinking said today.\n       In a bleak assessment, he said there was talk within the \n     Saudi royal family and in Arab capitals of using the ``oil \n     weapon'' against the United States, and demanding that the \n     United States leave strategic military bases in the region.\n       Such measures, he said, would be a ``strategic debacle for \n     the United States.''\n       He also warned of a general drift by Arab leaders toward \n     the radical politics that have been building in the Arab \n     street.\n       The Saudi message contained undeniable brinkmanship \n     intended to put pressure on Mr. Bush to take a much larger \n     political gamble by imposing a peace settlement on Israeli \n     and Palestinians.\n       But the Saudi delegation also brought a strong sense of the \n     alarm and crisis that have been heard in Arab capitals.\n       ``It is a mistake to think that our people will not do what \n     is necessary to survive,'' the person close to the crown \n     prince said, ``and if that means we move to the right of bin \n     Laden, so be it; to the left of Qaddafi, so be it; or fly to \n     Baghdad and embrace Saddam like a brother, so be it. It's \n     damned lonely in our part of the world, and we can no longer \n     defend our relationship to our people.''\n       Whatever the possibility of bluster, it is also clear that \n     Abdullah represents not just Saudi Arabia but also the \n     broader voice of the Arab world, symbolized by the peace plan \n     he submitted and that was endorsed at an Arab summit meeting \n     in March.\n       Those familiar with the prince's ``talking points'' said he \n     would deliver a blunt message that Mr. Bush is perceived to \n     have endorsed--despite his protests to the contrary--Prime \n     Minister Ariel Sharon's military incursion into the West \n     Bank.\n       Abdullah believes Mr. Bush has lost credibility by failing \n     to follow through on his demand two weeks ago that Mr. Sharon \n     withdraw Israeli troops from the West Bank and end the sieges \n     of Yasir's compound in Ramallah and of the Church of the \n     Nativity in Bethlehem.\n       If those events occur and Mr. Bush makes a commitment ``to \n     go for peace'' by convening an international conference, as \n     his father did after the Persian Gulf war, to press for a \n     final settlement and a Palestinian state, the Saudi view \n     would change dramatically.\n       But those close to the Saudi delegation said there was no \n     expectation that Mr. Bush is prepared to apply the pressure \n     necessary to force such an outcome.\n       ``The perception in the Middle East, from the far left to \n     the far right, is that America\n\n[[Page S3379]]\n\n     is totally sponsoring Sharon--not Israel's policies but \n     Sharon's policies--and anyone who tells you less is insulting \n     your intelligence,'' the person familiar with Abdullah's \n     thinking said.\n       Western analysts see the prince as a blunt Bedouin leader \n     whose initiative is regarded by many Arabs as a gesture \n     worthy of the late Egyptian leader Anwar el-Sadat, who flew \n     to Jerusalem in 1973 to sue for peace with Menachem Begin. \n     Abdullah's offer, now the Arab world's offer, calls for \n     recognition of Israel and ``normal relations'' in return for \n     a Palestinian state on lands Israel occupied in 1967.\n       The Saudi assessment was apparently being conveyed through \n     several private channels.\n       On Tuesday President Bush's father had lunch with the Saudi \n     foreign minister, Saud al-Faisal, and the kingdom's longtime \n     ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar bin Sultan. Their \n     specific message could not be learned, but in the familial \n     setting, where Barbara Bush was also the hostess for Princess \n     Haifa, Prince Bandar's wife, the strong strategic and \n     personal ties of the Persian Gulf war that characterized \n     Saudi-American relations a decade ago was a message in \n     itself.\n       Abdullah, in a luncheon today with Vice President Dick \n     Cheney, was to convey the seriousness with which he regards \n     the Thursday meeting with President Bush as a ``last chance'' \n     for constructive relations with the Arab world.\n       Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and Gen. Richard B. \n     Myers, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, also flew to \n     Houston to join in last-minute discussions before the summit \n     meeting. A senior official in Washington said Mr. Rumsfeld \n     and General Myers were dispatched to brief the prince \n     personally on the American accomplishments in Afghanistan and \n     in the broader war on terrorism.\n       ``The idea was, if he thought we were strong in Desert \n     Storm, we're 10 times as strong today,'' one official said. \n     ``This was to give him some idea what Afghanistan \n     demonstrated about our capabilities.''\n       United States military commanders in the Persian Gulf \n     region have been building up command centers and equipment \n     depots in Qatar and Kuwait in recent months in anticipation \n     of a possible breach with Riyadh.\n       Saudi officials assert that American presidents since \n     Richard M. Nixon have been willing to speak more forcefully \n     to Israeli leaders than the current president when American \n     interests were at stake.\n       ``If Bush freed Arafat and cleared Bethlehem, it would be a \n     big victory, show a stiffening of spine,'' the person close \n     to Abdullah said. ``But incremental steps are no longer valid \n     in these circumstances,'' meaning that Mr. Bush would have to \n     follow up with a major push to fulfill the longstanding \n     expectation of the Palestinians for statehood.\n       The mood in the Saudi camp was that of gloom and anxiety in \n     private even as Saudi and American officials went ahead with \n     preparations for a warm public encounter with the Bush \n     family.\n       On Friday, after his meeting with President Bush at his \n     home in Crawford, Abdullah is to take a long train ride to \n     College Station, the central Texas town where the former \n     President Bush will be host at his presidential library. On \n     Saturday, Saudi's Arabia's state oil company is gathering the \n     luminaries of the international energy industry to dine with \n     Abdullah and his party.\n       But the person close to the prince said that if the summit \n     talks went badly, Abdullah might not complete his stay in \n     Texas. Instead, he might return directly to Riyadh and call \n     for a summit meeting of the Organization of the Islamic \n     Conference, to report to its 44 leaders, who represent 1.2 \n     billion Muslims.\n       ``He wants to say, `I looked the president of the U.S. in \n     the eye and have to report that I failed,'' this person said. \n     His message to the Arabs will be, ``Take the responsibility \n     in your own hands, my conscience is clear, before history, \n     God, religion, country and friends.''\n       The person close to Abdullah pointed out that Saudi \n     Arabia's recent assurances that it would use its surplus oil-\n     producing capacity to blunt the effects of Saddam Hussein's \n     30-day suspension of Iraqi oil exports could quickly change.\n       That Saudi pledge ``was based on a certain set of \n     assumptions, but if you change the assumptions, all bets are \n     off,'' he said. ``We would no longer say what Saddam said was \n     an empty threat, because there come desperate times when you \n     give the unthinkable a chance.''\n       Abdullah is reported to be bitter over the White House's \n     assertion that the president is taking a balanced approach to \n     the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and he wants to evaluate in \n     person whether Mr. Bush understands how his actions are being \n     perceived in the Arab world.\n       ``This is not a mistake or a policy gaffe,'' the person \n     close to Abdullah said, referring to Mr. Bush's approach. \n     ``He made a strategic, conscious decision to go with Sharon, \n     so your national interest is no longer our national interest; \n     now we don't have joint national interests. What it means is \n     that you go your way and we will go ours, economically, \n     militarily and politically--and the antiterror coalition \n     would collapse in the process.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. We are heading for a cataclysm. We are headed for a \ncataclysmic, destructive process. When the oil industry in Iran was \nnationalized in the early 1950s and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was \nevicted by an act of the Iranian parliament, Great Britain decided \nagainst the use of force and submitted the dispute to the International \nCourt, which decided it had no jurisdiction. But if we are starved from \noil, we should attempt to figure out some way to denationalize what the \nOPEC countries have done, in taking the property of the seven sisters, \nthe oil companies--BP and others--without compensation, or without \nadequate compensation.\n  But the demands and the blackmail and the extortion that is contained \non the front page of the New York Times today concerning what OPEC has \nin mind for us should drive the U.S. toward independence from OPEC oil, \nnot only as a matter of self-respect, but as a matter of national \ndefense and continuing economic development in this country.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time remains, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 54 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 4 minutes to Senator Bond.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by \nmy colleague from Delaware, Mr. Carper. This amendment to the energy \nbill would substantially raise Corporate Average Fuel Economy, CAFE, \nstandards with negative impacts on jobs, safety and the health of our \ndomestic economy.\n  On March 13, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan amendment \nI wrote with my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin. The Levin-Bond \namendment mandates that the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, NHTSA, increase CAFE standards for cars and light \ntrucks to the maximum feasible levels. The Bond-Levin amendment \nreplaced a provision in the original energy bill which called for \nsignificant increases in CAFE based only on a political number, not \nscience. The Senate wisely rejected that underlying provision as being \nbad for American jobs, bad for highway safety and bad for consumer \nchoice.\n  Unfortunately, the Carper-Specter amendment on oil consumption would \nresult in CAFE increases similar to the Kerry provision. It must be \ndefeated. While Senator Carper's goal may be to reduce American \ndependence on foreign oil, the effect of his amendment would be lost \nfactory jobs, more highway fatalities and reduced vehicle choice. Don't \nbe fooled by arguments that Senator Carper's proposal is not a CAFE \nincrease. The only way to meet the target under the amendment is for \nNHTSA to increase fuel economy standards beyond the maximum feasible \nlevel. And why would NHTSA only look at the CAFE program? Because it is \nthe only regulatory authority currently available to pursue the \nmandated oil reductions under the Carper amendment!\n  The debate on the Levin-Bond amendment was only a few short weeks ago \nbut let me refresh your memories as to the details of this proposal \nwhich passed on a 62-38 vote. Specifically, the Levin-Bond amendment \ndirects the Department of Transportation to increase fuel economy \nstandards for cars and light trucks based on consideration of a number \nof factors including the desirability of reducing U.S. dependence on \nforeign oil. I agree with the sponsor of the amendment that a goal of \nour national energy policy should be a reduction in the amount of \nimported oil. That is why I included language in my amendment last \nmonth requiring NHTSA to include it in the regulatory process to set \nnew CAFE standards.\n  Other factors that NHTSA must consider include: technological \nfeasibility; economic practicability; the effect of other government \nmotor vehicle standards on fuel economy; the need to conserve energy; \nthe effect on motor vehicle safety; the effects of increased fuel \neconomy on air quality; the adverse effects of increased fuel economy \nstandards on the relative competitiveness of manufacturers; the effect \non U.S. employment; the cost and lead-time required for introduction of \nnew technologies; the potential for advanced\n\n[[Page S3380]]\n\ntechnology vehicles--such as hybrid and fuel cell vehicles--to \ncontribute to significant fuel usage savings; and the effect of near-\nterm expenditures required to meet increased fuel economy standards on \nthe resources available to develop advanced technology.\n\n  The Department of Transportation shall complete the rulemaking for \nlight trucks within 15 months of enactment and shall give automobile \nmanufacturers sufficient lead-time to comply with the new standards. \nThe rulemaking for passenger cars shall be initiated within 6 months of \nenactment and shall be completed within 24 months. Each rulemaking \nshall be multiyear for a period not to exceed 15 model years. If DOT \nfails to act within the required time frame, it will be in order for \nCongress to consider, under expedited procedures, legislation mandating \nan increase in fuel economy standards, consistent with the \nconsiderations set forth above.\n  These are the details of what the Senate adopted last month on a \nbipartisan vote. It is a carefully balanced proposal with firm \ndeadlines and clear criteria. Unfortunately, the Carper amendment \nbefore us today would undermine and distort the rulemaking \nconsiderations by NHTSA. The Carper amendment returns to the notion of \nsetting an arbitrary target--in this case, to reduce the amount of oil \nthat can be consumed in our passenger car and light trucks in 2015. Not \nonly would this lead to CAFE increases similar to those proposed in the \noriginal bill, but it would also force the Department of Transportation \nto disregard the careful balancing of criteria in its rulemakings. \nIndeed, DOT would have to impose a overriding element (saving a \nspecific amount of oil) on top of the considerations that the \nrulemaking would otherwise try to balance.\n  If you get nothing else out of my statement today, please simply \nremember that this proposed amendment will absolutely hurt consumers \nwho choose to drive minivans and SUVs. Because the Senate adopted a \nmeasure excluding pick-up trucks from the CAFE increases, the burden on \nthe rest of that light truck category is increased dramatically. This \neffect would be magnified with the adoption of the Carper-Specter \namendment today.\n  Oh, and has anyone besides me taken the time to ask NHTSA or the \nDepartment of Transportation if this amendment is even feasible? I \ntalked to Secretary Mineta yesterday, and 2 days ago I spoke with Dr. \nRunge, the NHTSA Administrator. Both indicated to me that it is not \nfeasible to guarantee specific fuel savings through CAFE standards. \nThere are simply too many variables and assumptions preventing any \nguarantee of this sort.\n  Many of the Senators who supported the Bond-Levin amendment agreed \nthat the CAFE program is complex with many tradeoffs. That's why the \nexperts at NTHSA are best qualified to determine future CAFE levels \nbased on sound science and dependable data. Rather that CAFE increases \nbased on nothing more than a political number which would have negative \nconsequences for American jobs, highway safety and economic growth, \nNHTSA can determine the appropriate standard after extensive review and \nstudy.\n  Given the complexities of the issues, there are great advantages to \nallowing a rulemaking process to resolve these issues rather than pre-\nselecting an arbitrary outcome as the Carper oil consumption amendment \nwould do.\n  One of the most useful reports in the entire fuel economy debate is \nthe National Academy of Sciences study on the Effectiveness of CAFE. As \nI did last month, let me share with you a key finding about the safety \nand higher standards:\n\n       In summary, the majority of the committee finds that the \n     downsizing and weight reduction that occurred in the late \n     1980s most likely produced between 1,300 and 2,600 crash \n     fatalities and 13,000 and 26,000 serious injuries in 1993.\n       If an increase in fuel economy is effected by a system that \n     encourages either downweighting or the production and sale of \n     more small cars, some additional traffic fatalities would be \n     expected.\n\n  I believe that NAS report offers all of us in the Senate clear \nguidance and expert, scientific analysis as we debate fuel economy \nlevels. I also point out that the NAS panel was extremely careful to \ncaution its readers that its fuel economy targets were not recommended \nCAFE goals, because they did not weigh other considerations such as \nemployment, affordability, and safety.\n  I urge you to join me, along with numerous business and labor groups, \nin opposing the Carper amendment which only complicates NHTSA's effort \nto set appropriate CAFE standards under the mandates of the Bond-Levin \namendment.\n  If you want appropriate CAFE standards for cars and light trucks that \nwon't harm jobs, highway safety and vehicle choice, vote ``no'' on the \nCarper amendment.\n  Madam President, we have been here before. We have had this debate. \nWe have done the bill. We got the T-shirt. Unfortunately, we are back \non the floor with this again.\n  Let me be clear: This amendment totally negates the careful direction \nthat we put in law in the Levin-Bond amendment that the National \nHighway Transportation Safety Administration must use the best science \nand technology available to increase standards to get more fuel-\nefficient cars, vans, and trucks on the road.\n  Setting an arbitrary standard which comes out of somebody's hip \npocket does nothing for sound science. I have talked to NHTSA. They say \nthere is no way we can guarantee it. There would have to be a wild \nestimate that would come out somewhere around where the original \nproposal in the underlying bill was.\n  Do my colleagues know what we found out when we took a look at that? \nWe have the National Academy of Sciences saying the mandated fuel \nefficiency previously done has resulted when we could not meet those \ngoals through technology in cars that weighed roughly 1,000 pounds \nless. What happens? Thousands and thousands of people have been killed \nin unsafe cars.\n  Despite what some of my friends on the other side of this issue say, \nyou cannot mandate by law that technology will come out of thin air. We \nhave asked the experts at NHTSA to use the National Academy of Sciences \nand find out what technology is available. If we can make diesel out of \nsludge in Pennsylvania, great, we will do it. That will be available to \nthe National Academy of Sciences.\n  We are changing in Missouri and Arkansas. We are using poultry waste \nand turning it into power. Good. Let's use all those things we can, but \nlet us not go back on the carefully agreed upon construct that was \ndeveloped in the Levin-Bond amendment and overwhelmingly supported \nwhich says: Yes, we need more fuel-efficient minivans and cars, and it \nis going to be based on how much science can move forward, not how much \nan arbitrary limitation--in terms of saving gallons which cannot be \ncontrolled solely by fuel efficiency standards--would do.\n  There is technology. There will be increases, but it should not be \narbitrary. We do not want to deprive people of the opportunity to buy \nthe cars and minivans they need. We have talked in the past about \nforcing people into purple-people eaters and golf carts. Frankly, that \nis where you go when you have an unrealistically high CAFE standard.\n  We need to give people the choices of vehicles that fit their needs \nthat incorporate the new technology which is designed to save as much \nfuel as possible. We need to keep the jobs in the United States. We \nneed to keep our economy going. We need not compromise safety, as would \nbe done by this amendment.\n  This amendment is not merely a refinement. This amendment is simply a \nbad shot at setting a standard that is not based on science but is \nbased on an arbitrary figure that is infeasible, unworkable, destroys \nconsumer choice, costs us jobs in the United States, and risks more \nlives on highways. I urge my colleagues not to support the Carper-\nSpecter amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, how much time remains on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsors have 1 minute 41 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. CARPER. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 48 seconds.\n  Mr. CARPER. I would like to have the opportunity to close, if I can. \nWill the Senator be willing to accommodate me?\n\n[[Page S3381]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will be happy to accommodate my friend \nfrom Delaware.\n  Madam President, let us be real clear. The Levin-Bond amendment had \npositive incentives. We need tax incentives, joint research and \ndevelopment money, Government purchasing, to a much larger extent than \nthe administration proposed. They are in the Levin-Bond amendment.\n  Also in the Levin-Bond amendment, which this would totally, in \neffect, abrogate, is a regulatory process: 15 months for the Department \nof Transportation to look at 12 different criteria in upping the CAFE \nstandard. This does not wait. This prejudges the outcome of that \nprocess and says 1 million barrels a day. That is the mandate. This is \nnot some objective, this is a mandatory amount specifically in this \namendment, and it is not the way we should be legislating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, in listening to the comments against the \nCarper-Specter amendment, I am not sure they have fully read the Levin-\nBond amendment. I know they have not read the amendment we offer today. \nSenator Specter and I both voted for the Levin-Bond amendment. It is a \ngood amendment. It has a number of positive features that make common \nsense for our country.\n  In a moment or two, a budget point of order will be brought against \nour amendment. None was brought against the Levin-Bond amendment. The \nreason is because in the Carper-Specter amendment, we are looking for a \nreal reduction in oil consumption. We do not vitiate the Levin-Bond \namendment. The whole language stays in the bill.\n  The Levin-Bond amendment directs the Secretary of Transportation to \npromulgate regulations, essentially CAFE regulations, in order to meet \nhigh fuel efficiencies. We do not change that, but we do say in order \nto reduce the consumption of oil for our cars, trucks, and vans by \n2015, not only should the Secretary of Transportation have the \nopportunity to consider changes in CAFE, but they should also consider \nhow it can reduce oil consumption through alternative fuels.\n  Alternative fuels could be biodiesel or soy diesel. It could include \nethanol, diesel created from coal waste in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, \nOhio, or other States.\n  Four things are different than when we voted a month ago on the \nLevin-Bond amendment. The Middle East today is in turmoil. Venezuela is \nin turmoil. We voted last week not to drill in ANWR, and we voted last \nweek to cut off oil imports entirely from Iraq. That is 1 million \nbarrels a day. Those things are different.\n\n  We need to put into this legislation meaningful objectives, \nmeasurable objectives. This amendment would do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on this amendment. The \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, is it in order at this time to move to \ntable the Carper amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is in order, but the vote will \noccur later.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to table the Carper amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3326\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3326.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending pursuant to the \norder.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the amendment that is now before us is \na minor tax amendment that has been cosponsored by my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Cantwell. I know debate on this bill is limited, so \nI will be very brief.\n  The tax provisions in this bill provide important tax credits to \nencourage the use of energy-efficient fuel cells that are 1 kilowatt or \ngreater. I note that the tax credit applies only to fuel cells of 1 \nkilowatt or greater because there are a number of important fuel cell \napplications that are less than 1 kilowatt. It is important that we \nsupport the development of fuel cells that are less than 1 kilowatt.\n  This amendment would expand the tax credit to include fuel cells that \nare greater than a half a kilowatt, but would keep the per kilowatt \namount of the tax credit the same. Fuel cells that are between a half \nand 1 kilowatt are used as emission-free power supplies for a number of \nnoteworthy applications, including cellular phone tower repeaters, home \ndialysis machines, railroad signaling and switching equipment, and \nrecreational vehicle and camping powering equipment.\n  Fuel cells are an emerging technology that hold the promise of \nhelping to dramatically reduce world pollution. This promising \ntechnology could eventually shift our dependence from fuels like \ngasoline and diesel fuel to hydrogen. This important tax credit is \nintended to provide an incentive for research, develop, design, and use \nfuel cell technologies.\n  We need to encourage the use of all types of fuel cells because as we \ngain more experience in the design and construction of fuel cells, it \nwill allow the technology to advance to the point where it is \ncompetitive with other power sources.\n  Some may say this amendment is too costly, but the current market for \nfuel cells is very small. We have estimated the cost of this amendment, \nover the period of the tax credit, is less than $3 million. That is a \nsmall price to pay for encouraging the development of this promising \nnew technology.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the development of a broader scope of \nfuel cell technology by supporting this amendment.\n  I know Senator Cantwell from my State wanted to be present as well, \nbut she is unavailable at this time. I understand this amendment has \nbeen accepted on both sides and would be willing to move quickly to a \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask that the Senator from Washington \nyield.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Finance Committee has examined this amendment, and we \napprove it. I think it is a good idea to encourage greater research \ninto fuel cell development. It is clearly a technology of the future. \nThe sooner we begin, the better. This is a very modest amendment, but \nit is an important amendment, and I urge the Senate to adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today as a cosponsor of this \namendment, and ask my colleagues to vote in its favor. I also want to \nthank my friend, Senator Murray, for her work on this amendment.\n  I think there is broad bipartisan support for further development of \nthe fuel cell as one of the solutions to our Nation's 21st century \nenergy needs. The number of potential applications for the fuel cell is \nalmost limitless. In this regard, I was pleased to join with Senator \nDorgan in sponsoring an amendment to this energy bill that will require \nthe Secretary of Energy to develop a program to ensure 100,000 hydrogen \nfuel-cell vehicles will be available for sale by 2010, and 2.5 million \nvehicles will be available by 2020. Fuel cell vehicles are three times \nmore efficient than internal combustion engines, and they produce none \nof the harmful emissions associated with fossil fuels.\n  The fuel cell vehicle is a concept that has recently been embraced by \nthe President, and I believe the broad bipartisan support for this \ntechnology is already reflected in the tax credit included in this bill \nfor other, stationary fuel cell applications. Currently, this credit is \navailable for fuel cells of one kilowatt or more. What this amendment \nwould do is simply lower the floor to half a kilowatt, or 500 watts.\n  I believe this is an important change, because we should also extend \nthis credit to fuel cells that can be used in numerous business \napplications. Fuel cells smaller than one kilowatt are already \nproviding power for remote cell phone towers, backup power for certain \nmedical technologies, and even used to light some types of railroad and \ntraffic\n\n[[Page S3382]]\n\nsignals. Expanding the tax credit already in this bill will help \nfurther demonstrate the commercial applicability of this technology.\n  This is an important component of any 21st century energy policy, and \nI ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. All time is yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3326.\n  The amendment (No. 3326) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have been able to save a little bit of \ntime. I ask unanimous consent that we move down the amendment list and, \nprior to the votathon starting, we allow Senator Graham of Florida to \nbring up amendment No. 3370. He has agreed there would be 15 minutes \nequally divided on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. This would be under the same rules as the prior unanimous \nconsent agreement: No seconds, and the vote would take place at the end \nof the votes on other amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. As I understand it, it is now in order for me to bring up \namendment No. 3333. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may consider amendments Nos. 3333 \nand 3332 concurrently.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3333\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I will first discuss amendment No. 3333.\n  As a member of the Senate Finance and Energy Committees, I have had \nthe opportunity to witness first-hand the contradictions in Federal \nenergy and tax policy, specifically policy for the electricity \nindustry. One glaring example is the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the \nprivate use rules of the Internal Revenue Code, which pre-date the \nEnergy Policy Act and are applicable, as you know, to public power \nutilities.\n  While our Federal energy policy since 1992 has been to open electric \nmarkets to wholesale and even retail competition, our Tax Code contains \nrestrictions dating back to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that make it \ndifficult, and in some cases impossible, for publicly-owned utilities \nto comply with that deregulation policy.\n  In an attempt to remove the tax-code impediments to participation in \nthe newly restructured electric industry, the publicly-owned and \ninvestor-owned utilities labored for several years to develop a package \nof tax-law changes that would provide the necessary flexibility to \ncomply with the new energy policies being implemented by the Federal \nand State governments while, at the same time, not fundamentally \nchanging the competitive balance between the private and public sectors \nof the energy industry.\n  The fruit of those efforts was S. 972, introduced last year by \nSenators Murkowski, Thompson, Breaux, and Jeffords. I joined as a \ncosponsor of this bipartisan bill. In the House, H.R. 1459 was \nintroduced by Congressman J.D. Hayworth and was cosponsored by 16 other \nmembers of the Ways and Means Committee. These bills were successful in \naccommodating widely divergent views of public-power and investor-owned \nutilities on a whole score of Federal tax issues. They represent years \nof negotiations between the private and public sectors of the industry, \nand as such, reflect a delicate, equitable balancing of interests.\n  There are four provisions in these companion bills that are designed \nto help modernize our Tax Code for investor-owned utilities. I want to \naddress these provisions in light of the subsequent House-passed bill, \nH.R. 4, and the bill marked out of the Senate Finance Committee that we \nare now considering. Both of these latest incarnations represent a \nsignificant departure from the original texts of H.R. 1459 and S. 972.\n  The first provision addresses the transmission tax problem that has \noccurred as the result of FERC Order 2000. This order strongly \nencourages, some would say ``directs,'' all transmission-owning \nelectric companies, subject to FERC jurisdiction, to join a regional \ntransmission organization, RTO. However, many proposals to form RTOs \nwould force these utilities to sell or spin off their transmission \nassets to form independent transmission companies, Transcos, resulting \nin a substantial Federal income-tax liability.\n  The solution to this problem, as stated in S. 972 and H.R. 1459, is \nto amend section 1033 of the Tax Code to permit sales of transmission \nassets on a tax-deferred basis if these sales occur in conformity with \nOrder 2000, and the proceeds of the sale are reinvested in certain \nutility assets. Section 355(e) would also be amended to permit a non-\ntaxable spin-off of transmission assets even if they are combined with \nneighboring transmission assets in conformity with Order 2000. Amending \nthe Federal Tax Code to allow formation of Transcos will further \ndiminish tax barriers to wholesale and retail competition by creating \ntruly independent transmission organizations.\n  H.R. 4 includes this provision, but unfortunately, the bill reported \nout of the Senate Finance Committee does not. Before this bill is \nsigned by the President, I hope that the transmission-relief provision \nwill be included in the legislation.\n  The second provision concerns the equitable tax treatment of nuclear \ndecommissioning funds, and it is the only provision of the four that is \naddressed in all of the aforementioned bills. Under current law, owners \nof nuclear power plants must make mandatory contributions to external \ntrust funds to ensure that monies are available to decommission plants \nwhen they are retired. Congress added section 468A to the tax code in \n1984 to permit owners of nuclear plants to deduct a portion of the \ncontributions made to these external funds. Section 468A, when enacted, \nwas designed to operate within the existing structure of regulated \nrates. The ability to deduct the contributions as permitted in section \n468A is currently dependent on the local public service commission's \nformal approval of the decommissioning expenses that an electric \nutility can charge its customers. Both the House and the Finance \nCommittee have adopted changes to section 468A to adapt to the \nstructure of competitive markets while preserving the Section's \noriginal intent. These changes will facilitate the transfer of nuclear \nfacilities to new owners in compliance with State and Federal \ndirectives.\n  A third provision, included in S. 972, H.R., 1459, and H.R. 4, but \nnot in the Finance Committee bill, has to do with the reimbursement of \nutilities for construction costs. Under current law, the costs of \nbuilding new transmission and distribution lines for new generating \nplants, homes, commercial properties, and industrial sites, indeed, any \nkind of property where construction costs are paid by a developer or \ninterconnecting party to a utility, are treated as contributions in aid \nof construction--CIACs--and are considered as taxable income to the \nutility. The result is that developers or interconnecting third parties \nmust reimburse a utility for construction costs plus a Federal tax of \nover 30 percent. The proposed solution is to treat the reimbursement of \nthese costs as non-taxable, therefore facilitating new generation, \ntransmission, and distribution facilities by making it less costly to \nprovide these services. This would certainly help increase the supply \nof power and improve electric reliability, and I am hopeful that \nCongress will resolve this issue in conference.\n  The fourth provision concerns the public power utilities only. This \nprovision effectively relaxes the private use restrictions on existing \nbonds if the issuing municipal or State utility elected to terminate \npermanently its ability to issue tax-exempt debt to build new \ngeneration facilities. Publicly-owned utilities, as entities of State \nand local governments, have used tax-exempt debt to finance their \nutility infrastructure in much the same way as cities finance schools, \nroads, and bridges. Without this provision, public power systems cannot \nissue stock to raise capital and have no alternative source of \nfinancing for these large capital projects other than municipal bonds.\n\n[[Page S3383]]\n\n  In exchange for the use of tax-exempt debt, public power systems are \nrequired to adhere to a strict set of Federal tax rules and regulations \ndesigned to limit the amount of power they can sell to private \nentities. These rules limit a public power entity's ability to \nnegotiate contracts with exiting customers, to resell excess power \nresulting from competition, ``lost load'', and to discourage the \nopening of transmission lines that were financed with tax-exempt debt.\n  The truth is, the current private use laws and regulations are no \nlonger suitable for today's energy market. S. 972 and H.R. 1459 \nsuccessfully incorporated what both the investor-owned and the \npublicly-owned utilities agree would constitute an effective \nmodernization of the current Tax Code. The Finance Committee bill did \nnot meet that test, and H.R. 4, although it attempted to do so, failed \nthat test as well.\n  What happened was that H.R. 1459 sustained damage during the process \nof House passage. The bill, as approved by the Committee on Ways and \nMeans--H.R. 2511, ``The Energy Policy Act of 2001''--and as \nsubsequently passed by the House--H.R. 4, ``Securing America's Future \nEnergy Act of 2001''--contains substantial, material modifications to \nthe original legislation that make it impossible to vote for. In fact, \ncertain modifications are even more restrictive than existing law and \nIRS regulations. As a result, H.R. 4, overall, works absolutely counter \nto national energy policy and the efficient operation of our country's \nelectric infrastructure. The various conditions set forth in the bill \nwill unfortunately discourage utilities from taking the necessary steps \nto advance open access. Examples of the most problematic provisions:\n  Provisions that eliminate public power's ability to elect to forego \nissuance of future tax-exempt bonds for generation from refunding \noutstanding tax-exempt generation bonds, even though this can result in \nsavings to the utilities' customers and the U.S. Treasury. The bill \nalso prohibits these electing utilities from utilizing tax-exempt \nfinancing to fund limited repairs and environmental improvements, \nincluding those which may be government-mandated.\n  In the context of sales of energy, there are provisions that restrict \nor eliminate public power's ability to use long-standing statutory and \nregulatory exceptions to the private use rules, and provisions that \nconstrain new rules designed to enable public power to participate in a \nderegulated environment. As an example, language in the bill \neffectively precludes sales to rural electric cooperatives that were \none of the exceptions to the private use rules. The bill seems to \nprovide that the expansion of an existing generation facility can \nresult in loss of eligibility of the entire facility for permitted \nexception treatment for long-term take or pay requirement contracts, \neven if the cost of the expansion was financed with taxable debt or \nequity. Furthermore, a public power company that owns no transmission \nwill qualify for the bill's clarifications to the private use rules \nonly if all transmission providers who provide transmission to that \nmunicipal utility's customers provide open access to all of their \ntransmission facilities. These types of restrictions reduce or \neliminate many of the benefits intended in the bill.\n  There are new restrictions on tax exempt bonds for transmission \nfacilities that will prevent municipal utilities from using tax-exempt \nbonds to finance new transmission facilities to connect new power \nplants to their service areas. In addition, new restrictions in the \nbill require that, to qualify for private use relief, public power \ntransmission facilities must be owned, directly connected to customers, \nand necessary to serve those customers. Thus, the bill ignores the need \nfor investment in new transmission for maintenance of grid reliability, \nthe multiple legal forms of ownership and use of transmission \n(including the different forms of RTOs and related organizations, \nleasehold and operational arrangements), and the fundamental physics \ninvolved in transmission network operation.\n  The new exception to the private use rules for sales of certain lost \nload is revised so as to require proof that the load loss was \n``attributable to open access'' in order to take advantage of this \nexception, which was designed to ensure that our nation's energy \ncapacity is fully utilized.\n  I had hoped that these problems could have been resolved in the \nFinance Committee by my colleagues and myself, but the revenue \nconstraints imposed on us have prevented us from rectifying these \nproblems. So the Finance Committee, rather than correcting the errors \nas reported in the final version of H.R. 4, chose not to provide any \nprivate use relief at all. Instead, we directed the Treasury to conduct \na study to examine the problem and propose a solution.\n  That said, I think more immediate assistance can and should be \nprovided by the Treasury Department.\n  During the Finance Committee's mark-up of the tax title of the \npending energy bill, I asked the Treasury Department to look into an \nallocation proposal related to the private use restrictions of the \nInternal Revenue Code. The proposal would provide a limited safe harbor \nunder which issuers of tax-exempt bonds could allocate private use \nfirst and foremost to the portion of an output facility that is not \nfinanced with outstanding tax-exempt bonds. For certain bonds, the \nproposal would permit issuers to use reasonable methods to allocate \nvarious funding sources among their assets.\n  The Treasury Department has examined this proposal and believes that \nmany of the issues raised therein could be addressed under current law. \nTreasury officials say we could, under a different time frame than the \npending energy bill, issue regulations to that effect. In the meantime, \nhowever, I would strongly support a provision in the tax title of the \nbill incorporating this proposal.\n  In addition, various members of the Finance Committee, including the \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, have asked that \nthe Treasury Department finalize various temporary output regulations \nthat relate to the use of tax-exempt financing by public power as \nquickly as possible. I expect that the Treasury Department will make \nfinalizing these regulations a top priority and will endeavor to be \nresponsive to the many public comments that it has received. I look \nforward to their findings.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters dated \nMarch 8, 2002 and March 20, 2002.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2002.\n     Hon. Mark A. Weinberger,\n     Assistant Secretary, Tax Policy, Department of the Treasury, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am following up with you directly on \n     certain items that were raised during the Senate Finance \n     Committee's consideration of the tax title to the pending \n     Senate energy bill. Although I continue to believe that a \n     broader, more expansive solution is necessary to more fully \n     address the tax issues presented by the restructuring of the \n     electric utility industry, I raised question at the mark-up \n     with respect to two narrower items.\n       The first item concerns our discussion during the mark-up \n     about an allocation proposal related to the private use \n     restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code. You will recall \n     that I asked if you would examine this proposal. The proposal \n     generally would provide a limited safe harbor under which \n     issuers of tax-exempt bonds could allocate private business \n     use first to the portion of an output facility that is not \n     financed with outstanding tax-exempt bonds. For certain \n     bonds, the proposal would permit issuers to use reasonable \n     methods to allocate various funding sources among their \n     assets.\n       The second item is the temporary output regulations. As you \n     know, the Finance Committee, as part of its report, asked \n     that the Treasury Department finalize the temporary and \n     proposed output regulation as quickly as possible, providing \n     flexibility in those regulations, to foster participation of \n     public power in a rapidly changing electric industry, without \n     adversely affecting public power investors and customers.\n       I look forward to a letter from the Treasury Department on \n     both of these issues. I am hopeful that you will find that \n     many of the issues raised by the allocation proposal could be \n     addressed under present law, and that, under a different \n     timeframe than the pending energy bill, you would issue \n     administrative guidance to that effect. It would be helpful, \n     in the meantime, however, if you would also indicate your \n     support for a provision in the tax title of the Senate bill \n     incorporating this proposal.\n       With respect to the temporary and proposed regulations, I \n     hope that you will be able to state in that letter that you \n     will make the finalization of these regulations a\n\n[[Page S3384]]\n\n     top priority and will endeavor to use your regulatory \n     authority to the greatest extent possible to be responsive to \n     the numerous public comments you have received and to further \n     public power's participation in the restructuring of the \n     industry.\n       Naturally, I do not expect you to take any action that \n     would be inappropriate or contravene normal agency rules and \n     regulations. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                          Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2002.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: Thank you for your letter dated March 8, \n     2002 concerning certain items that were raised during the \n     Senate Finance Committee's consideration of the tax title to \n     the pending Senate energy bill. In particular, your letter \n     refers to two matters relating to electric facilities \n     financed with tax-exempt bonds: (1) temporary and proposed \n     Treasury regulations that define private use of output \n     facilities, including generation, transmission and \n     distribution facilities (temporary regulations; and (2) a \n     proposal that, in general, would allow issuers to allocate \n     private use first to the portion of an output facility that \n     is not financed with tax-exempt bonds.\n       Your letter requests that the Treasury Department finalize \n     the temporary regulations expeditiously, in a manner that \n     fosters participation by public power systems in electric \n     industry restructuring. We understand that providing \n     certainty in this area is necessary for the industry to \n     evolve. Thus, we are making the finalization of these \n     regulations a top priority. We intend to craft regulations \n     that take into account the current dynamic environment in the \n     electricity industry and the policy objective of facilitating \n     public power's participation in the restructuring of the \n     industry. In finalizing the regulations, we will, of course, \n     carefully consider all of the public comments we have \n     received.\n       Treasury is examining your proposal regarding the proper \n     allocation of private use of an output facility. We believe \n     that the issues raised by your proposal can be addressed \n     under present law. The proposal raises policy and \n     administrative questions that require careful consideration. \n     As we work to finalize the temporary regulations, we intend \n     to address the issues raised by your proposal. In doing so, \n     we must craft an administrable set of rules that are \n     consistent with the policy objective of a competitive \n     electricity market.\n       We hope this information is helpful to you. Please contact \n     me if you have any additional questions.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Mark A. Weinberger,\n\n                                               Assistant Secretary\n                                                     (Tax Policy).\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, this first amendment is a very simple \namendment that would save a little over a billion dollars, according to \nthe calculations of the committee, but probably would save closer to $3 \nbillion by striking that section of the Finance Committee portion of \nthe bill that is called the clear act provisions; more specifically, \nthose provisions that provide tax credits for Americans who purchase \nfour specific kinds of motor vehicles; specifically, a new qualified \nalternative fuel motor vehicle, a new qualified fuel cell motor \nvehicle, a new hybrid motor vehicle, and then it extends the present \nlaw which provides a credit for electric vehicles.\n  I know this provision was inserted in the Finance Committee with the \nbest of intentions, but for the reason I will point out, I think this \nhas not been as carefully thought out and prepared as it should be. \nBased on the experience of my home State of Arizona trying to do the \nsame thing, it would be premature for us to move forward with this \nparticular program at this time. I will illustrate specifically what is \ninvolved and then get to the Arizona experience.\n  Under the bill pending before us, there would be provided a maximum \nincome tax credit of $40,000 per taxpayer for the purchase of these \nkinds of motor vehicles, the fuel cells, the alternative fuel, and the \nelectric vehicles. The fact is that is for a very large vehicle; the \naverage for the usual passenger car type of vehicle would be in the \nneighborhood of from $3,500 to $6,000.\n  The part I am particularly interested in is the alternative fuel \nvehicle. According to the committee staff, the average tax credit in \nthis case would be about $5,000. It is determined by a very complicated \nformula based upon the weight of the vehicle and some other factors, \nbut it is about a $5,000 subsidy per taxpayer buying this particular \nkind of vehicle.\n  I am concerned about this because Arizona decided to try to do this \nsame thing, provide a taxpayer subsidy for the purchase of these \nalternative fuel vehicles as a way of trying to clean up our \nenvironment and to reduce reliance upon pure oil or gasoline. It \nprovided a subsidy, calculated a little bit differently, for the \npurchase of these vehicles; in fact, for the retrofitting of the \nalternative fuel system for a vehicle that had already been \nmanufactured.\n  I will read some headlines, or excerpts, from some of the Arizona \nnewspapers after this program was put into effect. I might begin by \nsaying this has been a fiasco in Arizona. The program has since been \nterminated. Politicians' careers have been destroyed because of it. \nThey did not think it through carefully enough before they implemented \nit. It was about to bankrupt the State, so the State decided to \nterminate the program prematurely before it ended up costing them as \nmuch as it was going to cost.\n  These are a few quotations:\n\n       The rebate program was originally projected to cost the \n     State about $3 million but has since spiraled to a dizzying \n     $483 million.\n\n  That is from the Arizona Daily Star.\n\n       Bad legislation, bad policy and no benefit to air quality.\n\n  That is a quotation from the Arizona Republic. That is October 30, \n2000.\n  From that same editorial:\n\n       There has been no environmental study of the alternative-\n     fuel program by any State agency, just as no one ever \n     completed an incisive cost analysis of the legislation.\n\n  Another quotation from the Arizona Republic:\n\n       The law allowed thousands of people to buy expensive sport-\n     utility vehicles with the State picking up nearly half the \n     costs of the trucks and their bifuel conversions to either \n     propane or compressed natural gas.\n\n  One final quotation from the Arizona Daily Star says:\n\n       The Arizona Republic shows that 13 percent of the \n     applications for cleaner-running vehicles came from rural \n     areas without a pollution problem.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remainder of these statements be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Arizona's Experience With Alternative Fuels and Tax Credits.\n\n       ``The law in question . . . provided tax incentives and \n     rebates for up to 50 percent of the cost of a car equipped to \n     burn alternative fuels. One of the startling loopholes in \n     this poorly written law was a failure to require any \n     accountability from consumers. Vehicles equipped to run on an \n     alternative fuel are also equipped with regular gas tanks. A \n     person could buy a new vehicle, have half of it paid for by \n     the state, and never use an ounce of the cleaner burning fuel \n     system.'' (AZ Daily Star, Editorial, Oct. 31, 2000)\n       ``The rebate program was originally projects to cost the \n     state of about $3 million but has since spiraled to a \n     dizzying $483 million.

(AZ Daily Star, Oct. 30, 2000)\n       ``The law allowed thousands of people to buy expensive \n     sport-utility vehicles with the state picking up nearly half \n     of the costs of the trucks and their bifuel conversions to \n     either propane or compressed natural gas.''(AZ Republic, Oct. \n     30\n       ``Just 12 days after it was implemented, the state's \n     alternative-fuels rebate program has already blown its worst \n     cost estimate by 13 percent.''(AZ Repub, Nov. 2, 2000)\n       ``The Arizona Republic shows that 13 percent of the \n     applications for cleaner-running vehicles came from rural \n     areas without a pollution problems.''(AZ Daily Star, Oct. 30, \n     2000)\n       ``The Republic's analysis of the state's rebate program to \n     convert gasoline-powered cars and trucks to alternative fuel, \n     mainly propane and natural gas, is based on preliminary data \n     obtained from the Commerce Department, the administrator of \n     the program.\n       ``The analysis included only the 5,512 applications in \n     which a rebate amount was contained in the computer database \n     obtained this week from the Commerce Department.

For example, if a sport-\n     utility vehicle originally cost $25,000 plus $7,000 to \n     convert it to also run on compressed natural gas, its owner \n     would be reimbursed the entire conversion cost plus $9,600--\n     30 percent of the total vehicle cost of $32,000.'' (AZ Repub, \n     Nov 2, 2000).\n       ``It sounded irresistible: buy a car that burns something \n     other than gasoline and the state pays up to 50 percent of \n     the cost; convert an existing gas-burner to alternative fuels \n     and the state pays 100 percent of the cost of the conversion. \n     No alternative fuel depot at home? Not to worry. The state \n     will cover that $7,000 as well, or up to $400,000 for a \n     commercial alternative-fuels depot. It is all courtesy of a \n     measure proposed and adopted in Arizona at the last minute of \n     a legislative session in April. Sound too good to be true? \n     More than 22,000 Arizonans did not think so, and since July \n     they have filed applications for an average of $21,966 each, \n     which would cost the state nearly $500 million from a program \n     that was supposed to cost less than $5 million a year. State \n     officials now say the eventual costs could reach $800 million \n     once applications being processed are counted.\n       ``The premise of the program was simple. According to a \n     state-issued summary, the law allows the users of \n     alternative-fuel vehicles bought or converted after Jan. 1, \n     2000, to qualify for cash rebates or tax credits worth 30 \n     percent of the vehicle's cost. Eligible vehicles can use an \n     alternative fuel solely or, as with `bifuel' vehicles, run on \n     either gasoline or some other fuel, such as natural gas. If a \n     $25,000 vehicle cost $7,000 to convert to propane, for \n     example, a program participant would be reimbursed the \n     conversion cost plus $9,600, 30 percent of the total $32,000 \n     cost.\n       ``Some found the legislation laughable from the beginning. \n     `The legislation had so many loopholes you could drive a Ford \n     Excursion through it,' said Sandy Bahr, outreach director for \n     the Phoenix-based Grand Canyon chapter of the Sierra Club. \n     Ms. Bahr said that, because the bill does not require owners \n     to actually use alternative fuels, many are using the bifuel-\n     vehicle incentives to take advantage of the program. `You've \n     got people putting little four-gallon propane tanks in sports \n     utility vehicles and getting 50 percent back on a $40,000 \n     car.'' Ms. Bahr said. `Four gallons of propane goes less far \n     than four gallons of gasoline, so all they do is use their \n     regular engines because propane is hard to find. That \n     actually creates more emissions because they're driving a \n     bigger car than they would ordinarily buy.'\n       ``Moreover, there are only six refueling stations for \n     alternative fuels in the Phoenix area, and none in the rest \n     of the state.'' (NY Times, Nov. 2, 2000)\n\n  Mr. KYL. What we can see is, like the system that is being proposed \nby the Senate, there was no cost-benefit analysis. There was not a very \nclear idea of what the ultimate costs were going to be, and the \nexperience with the program not only showed fraud or potential fraud \nbut runaway expenses.\n  Under the program that has come out of the committee, one of the \nconcerns is that nonprofits will be able to utilize credits by selling \nthem, which, of course, opens up the possibility that there could be a \nsecondary market or abuses could occur in selling these large tax \ncredits.\n  There has been very little evaluation of whether or not the vehicles \ncould be altered after their purchase, after the tax credit has been \nreceived, so that they could run in fact on gasoline or diesel. There \nis no data whatsoever to show that we would have a better environment \nas a result. In fact, there has been no cost-benefit analysis.\n  Pursuant to an amendment I offered in the committee, there will be a \nstudy after the fact that will tell us how successful the program has \nbeen, but there has been no study in advance of that. In fact, the \ncommittee report language does not cite a single study or report \njustifying the credits under the reason for change.\n  The report says, and I am quoting:\n\n       The committee believes further investments in alternative \n     fuel and advanced technology vehicles are necessary to \n     transform automotive transportation in the United States to \n     be cleaner, more efficient and less reliant on petroleum \n     fuels.\n\n  The committee language also prognosticates, and I am quoting again:\n\n       That it expects hybrid motor vehicles and dedicated \n     alternative fuel vehicles are the near-term technological \n     advancement that will replace gasoline- and diesel-burning \n     engines with alternative powered engines.\n\n  The revenue estimates are $1.1 billion, but since many of the credits \nexpire after 2006, I think it vastly understates the true cost. I \nsuspect this will be extended before they expire, so that the cost is \nmore likely going to be maybe $3 billion or so over a 10-year period. \nObviously, the automobile industry is the primary beneficiary of these \ncredits since they can simply increase the cost of the vehicles, and \nthen the credits obviously go to the taxpayer to offset that increase \nin cost.\n  I make this point--and I don't expect members of the committee are \ngoing to agree with this proposition--I wish we could go a little \nslower. I advised the committee of the experience in Arizona. To the \ncredit of the committee and the chairman of the committee, his staff \nwas very careful to talk to people in Arizona and do their best to \nremove the kinds of problems we experienced in Arizona. I commend the \nchairman of the Finance Committee for that effort. It was a useful \neffort.\n  I am concerned we are going to find a lot of problems in this program \nafter it begins. It will be too late then. We will find it will cost a \nwhole lot more than we predicted and the benefits will not pan out in \nterms of cost-benefit analysis.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time on this amendment. If anyone \nwishes to respond, I will briefly discuss the other amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, on the face of it, everyone would agree, \nthis is to give a stimulus, a boost, to alternative fuels, alternative \nfuel vehicles, and alternative fuel vehicle infrastructure. About two-\nthirds of the petroleum we consume today in America is consumed in the \ntransportation sector--cars, trucks, railroads, and so forth.\n  Clearly, we are trying as Americans to wean ourselves a bit from our \noverreliance on OPEC. That is the whole point of this energy bill. We \nwill not make ourselves completely self-reliant. No one claims that. At \nleast on the margin, we are making a step or two difference to become \nmore energy self-sufficient. Clearly, helping alternative fuel \ndevelopment and alternative fuel vehicle development, alternative fuel \nvehicle infrastructure development--pumps and so forth--will help.\n  It is also important we not act precipitously, that we act \nmeasurably, thoughtfully. Through the very able assistance of my good \nfriend from Arizona, we have worked closely with the Arizona Department \nof Transportation. Unfortunately, in the State of Arizona, which \nattempted something similar a year or two ago, there were people who \ntook advantage of the situation to such a degree that it became a bit \nof an outrage. We don't want to repeat those mistakes. I don't think \nanyone in this body wants to repeat those mistakes.\n  As the Senator said, our staff spent quite a bit of time talking with \nthe Arizona Department over what problems and recommendations they have \nso the problems do not recur in the provisions enacted here. As a \nconsequence of those discussions, we have dramatically tightened up \nthis bill regarding credits. They cannot be used in the aftermarket by \npeople who alter vehicles. They cannot be used for vehicles that use \nconventional fuels. This credit is only available to vehicles dedicated \nto alternative fuels. We made that clear.\n\n  I add the primary sponsors of this amendment are Senators who worked \nhard: Senators Hatch, Rockefeller, Kerry, and Snowe. They are the \nprimary sponsors of this provision. It has the support of both the auto \nmanufacturing industry and the conservation community, the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, the Union of Concerned Scientists support \nthis amendment, NRDC, Ford Motor Company, Lance Auto Manufacturing, and \nothers too numerous to name.\n  The main point is, we are trying to wean ourselves from OPEC. This \nprovision is a step, a start. It helps. We have tailored the amendment \nbased upon the experience in Arizona to help assure this works. It will \nprobably not work as well as many think, and it may work better than \nsome Members think, but we are undertaking a good effort to make this \nright. I appreciate the concerns of my friend from Arizona. They are \nlegitimate concerns and concerns we all have. We have attempted to \naddress these concerns. I thank the good State of Arizona for helping \naddress these matters.\n  I urge not adopting the amendment that strikes, but to work together \nto\n\n[[Page S3386]]\n\nsee what works and what doesn't work and change or modify or delete as \nthe case in Arizona. I thank my good friend for helping draw out what \nis going on in this debate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona. As I understand it, this \namendment would strike the portions of the energy tax provisions that \nwould provide tax incentives for the purchase of alternative fuels and \nadvanced technology vehicles such as hybrid electric and fuel cell \nautomobiles.\n  The provisions that this amendment would strike are almost identical \nto the provisions in the bipartisan CLEAR ACT, which stands for Clean \nEfficient Automobiles Resulting from Advanced Car Technology, which I \nintroduced last year along with Senators Jeffords, Rockefeller, Chafee, \nKerry, Collins, Gordon Smith, Crapo, and Lieberman.\n  The CLEAR ACT is the product of a carefully crafted, delicately \nbalanced, and politically unusual alliance between auto manufacturers, \ntruck engine manufacturers, environmental groups, fuel suppliers, and \nother stakeholders. I might add that these provisions, which provide \nstrong incentives for energy conservation, are an integral part of the \nPresident's energy plan. The CLEAR ACT provisions create a fair and \nbalanced playing field for all the advanced technologies and \nalternative fuel vehicles that offer the promise of both clean air and \nless dependency on foreign fuel.\n  Transportation accounts for about two-thirds of the oil consumption \nin the United States, and we are 97 percent dependent on oil for our \ntransportation needs. When we consider the role transportation plays in \nour economy and our way of life, it is hard to believe that we rely on \nforeign sources for more than one-half of our oil supply. If our nation \nis going to have a strategy for energy security, that strategy must \nbegin with transportation fuels. The Kyl amendment would take away our \nbest opportunity to provide a balanced approach to achieve this \nstrategy.\n  Advances in alternative fuels and new vehicle technologies have been \nsignificant in recent years. However, three basic obstacles stand in \nthe way of a broad shift toward their adoption. These are the higher \ncost of the vehicles, the higher cost of alternative fuels, and the \nlack of an infrastructure of alternative fueling stations.\n  The CLEAR ACT provisions that this amendment would strike would lower \nthe barriers that stand in the way of widespread consumer acceptance of \nthese advanced technology and alternative fuel vehicles by providing \ntax credits to consumers who purchase hybrid electric, fuel cell, \nbattery electric, and dedicated alternative fuel vehicles. They would \nalso provide incentives for the purchase of alternative fuels and the \ndevelopment of an alternative fuel infrastructure.\n  Without imposing any new mandates, the CLEAR ACT provisions in this \nenergy bill focus on the very best emerging technologies to help our \ncitizens to enjoy the health benefits of cleaner air sooner, to help \nour communities to enjoy the economic benefits of attaining clean air \nstandards sooner, and to help us reduce our consumption of foreign oil \nsooner than would otherwise be possible.\n  With the clear benefits of these provisions to less dependency on \nforeign oil and to cleaner air, which I might add come at a very \nreasonable cost in terms of revenue loss to the Treasury, it is hard to \nsee why anyone in this body would want to strike them. Moreover, the \ntax credits the CLEAR ACT offers are performance based, which is to say \nthat they are based on the principle that every dollar of tax \nexpenditure should produce substantive air quality and energy security \nbenefits. The greater the benefits a particular vehicle achieves, the \nlarger the tax incentive for purchasing it.\n  While I do not want to assume I know the motivations of the Senator \nfrom Arizona for offering this amendment, part of it might be based on \nan unfortunate experience in his home state. Not long ago, a well-\nintentioned program to promote alternative fuel vehicles by the Arizona \nlegislature experienced extreme cost overruns and failed to provide the \npromised energy and environmental benefits. I want to assure the \nmembers of this body that we have studied the Arizona experience, we \nhave identified the inherent weaknesses of that model, and we have been \ncareful to avoid each one of them in this legislation.\n  With the CLEAR ACT provisions, until a new advanced vehicle is \npurchased, until new infrastructure has been installed, or until \nalternative fuel is placed in the tank of a dedicated alternative fuel \nvehicle, there will be no cost to the Treasury. And when a cost is \nincurred, it will be a small cost relative to the resulting \nenvironmental benefits and energy savings.\n  To me it is inconceivable that this Senate would pass an energy \npolicy bill without addressing the issue of how to increase the \npublic's adoption of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. \nAlthough gasoline vehicles are 90 percent cleaner today than thirty \nyears ago, the significant increase in the total number of vehicles on \nthe road and the miles traveled per year by each vehicle means that \nlittle progress has been made in reducing the contribution of motor \nvehicle emissions to air pollution.\n  Similarly, despite improvements in fuel economy compared to thirty \nyears ago, more petroleum than ever is used in motor vehicles and U.S. \ndependence on imported oil is at a record high and increasing. \nAlternative fuel vehicles and advanced technology vehicles, such as \nhybrids and fuel cells, significantly reduce the use of gasoline and \ndiesel and have dramatically reduced emissions. Each dedicated natural \ngas vehicle displaces 100 percent of the gasoline or diesel that \notherwise would be used in that vehicle.\n  Conventional gasoline and diesel motor vehicle technology has come \nabout as far as it can in terms of fuel economy and emissions. The \nfurther gains that are needed to allow the U.S. to achieve energy \nsecurity and clean air require nonpetroleum vehicles and hybrid and \nfuel cell vehicles. The nation simply cannot achieve its goals in these \nareas with these conventional vehicles. Striking these provisions would \nbe a big mistake, and I urge my colleagues to vote against the Kyl \namendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I oppose Senator Kyl's amendment to \nstrike the wind energy tax credit extension provisions in this bill. It \nis unwise from an energy policy standpoint and would be harmful to \nAmerican agriculture. Therefore, I oppose it vigorously.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I supported the amendment offered by \nthe junior Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl. I did so even though I \nsupport the underlying policy that amendment sought to strike from the \nbill, namely the alternative fuels vehicle tax credit. I regret, \nthough, that this provision, along with many other tax provisions in \nthe bill, were included without adequate offsetting savings. The result \nis a measure that will make our budget deficits even larger.\n  We must return to the fiscally responsible budgeting that was so \nbeneficial to the economy, and which brought our budget, however \nbriefly, to balance, and even a slight surplus. If Congress does not \npay for additional tax cuts, we will only make matters worse.\n  Mr. KYL. How much time remains for me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3332\n\n  Mr. KYL. It is my intention to use the remainder of the time on the \nsecond amendment, numbered 3332, after which I presume a Member on the \nother side will move to table amendment No. 3333, to get the yeas and \nnays, and I would be happy to accept a voice vote on 3332, which I will \ndescribe at this point.\n  This is an amendment that eliminates the credits for wind energy. \nAccording to the industry itself, they are now competitive and they no \nlonger need the subsidy we provide to them. As a matter of fact, \nquoting from their own material from the American Wind Energy \nAssociation: The state-of-the-art wind power plants are generating \nelectricity at costs as low as 4 cents per kilowatt hour, a price \ncompetitive with many conventional energy technologies. This is without \nthe production tax credit that would be extended under this \nlegislation.\n  The AWEA further projects by the year 2005 the costs will be in the \narea\n\n[[Page S3387]]\n\nof 2.5 to 3.5 cents per kilowatt hour, just about exactly the range of \nthe cost of production by coal or nuclear or other generation, or \nnatural gas. This is a tax credit that is simply no longer needed.\n  Since the Department of Energy Information Administration has \nanalyzed that the RPS mandate in this legislation will only be \nfulfilled through additional wind energy capacity, we are just \nbasically giving a huge gift to the producers of wind energy that would \nhave essentially a monopoly on this new renewable power we are \nmandating.\n  I will not name the particular companies, but the companies that are \ngoing to benefit from this are some of the largest production companies \nin the country, all good companies, but certainly companies that are \nmultibillion-dollar companies and hardly need this particular kind of a \ncredit.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record brochures from \nthe industry itself.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  What Are the Factors in the Cost of Electricity From Wind Turbines?\n\n       The cost of electricity from utility-scale wind systems has \n     dropped by more than 80% over the last 20 years.\n       In the early 1980's, when the first utility-scale wind \n     turbines were installed, wind-generated electricity cost as \n     much as 30 cents per kilowatt-hour. Now, state-of-the-art \n     wind power plants are generating electricity at costs as low \n     as 4 cents/kWh, a price that is competitive with many \n     conventional energy technologies. Costs are continuing to \n     decline as more and larger plants are built and advanced \n     technology is introduced.\n       Aside from actual cost, wind energy offers other economic \n     benefits which make it even more competitive in the long \n     term:\n       Greater fuel diversity and less dependence on fossil fuels, \n     which are often subject to rapid price fluctuations and \n     supply problems. This is a significant issue around the world \n     today, with many countries rushing to install gas-fired \n     electric generating capacity because of its low capital cost. \n     As world gas demand increases, the prospect of supply \n     interruptions and fluctuations will grow, making further \n     reliance on it unwise and increasing the value of diversity.\n       Greatly reduced environmental impacts per unit of energy \n     produced, compared with conventional power plants. \n     Environmental costs are becoming an increasingly important \n     factor in utility resource planning decisions.\n       More jobs per unit of energy produced than other forms of \n     energy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    New Corporate Players Could Power Stronger Growth in Wind Energy\n\n       As the U.S. Senate continues consideration of national \n     energy legislation, the American wind energy industry is \n     poised to continue building on 2001--its most successful year \n     in history--and is the focus of growing interest by major \n     players in the energy field, according to the American Wind \n     Energy Association (AWEA).\n       The industry is receiving a boost not only from the recent \n     two-year extension of the federal wind energy production tax \n     credit (PTC), which was signed into law March 9, but from a \n     series of announcements by utilities, oil companies, and \n     other firms that they see wind energy in their future. Wind \n     energy supporters are hopeful that with a further three-year \n     extension of the PTC included in the Senate energy bill, the \n     industry will at last have a stable financial environment and \n     the serious corporate participation needed to put it on the \n     road to steady long-term growth.\n       Among recent industry developments, AWEA said, are the \n     following:\n       American Electric Power (AEP), one of the nation's largest \n     utilities, spent $175 million in late December to buy the \n     160-megawatt (MW) Indian Mesa wind plant in West Texas. \n     Previously, AEP had invested $160 million to build its own \n     150-MW wind farm at Trent Mesa, also in West Texas. Dwayne L. \n     Hart, senior vice president of business development for AEP \n     subsidiary AEP Energy Services, commented, ``The addition of \n     Indian Mesa furthers our goal of enhancing the renewable \n     portion of our overall generation portfolio.'' Ward Marshall \n     of AEP Energy Services is President-Elect of AWEA.\n       BP and ChevronTexaco announced in mid-January that they \n     will build and operate a 22.5-MW wind plant at their jointly-\n     owned Nerefco oil refinery near Rotterdam in The Netherlands. \n     Bob Dudley, BP's group vice president, Gas and Power and \n     Renewables, said, ``This project is an excellent opportunity \n     in line with BP's strategy to add value to our business, \n     lower emissions, and demonstrate our commitment to clean \n     energy,'' while James Houck, ChrevronTexaco President Power \n     and Gasification, said, ``Wind power is an increasingly \n     viable source of power generation and this project fits with \n     our objectives to manage carbon emissions and invest in new \n     technologies that minimize environmental impact.''\n       Entergy, a major utility based in New Orleans, La., \n     purchased a majority interest in the 80-MW Top of Iowa wind \n     farm from Houston, Tex.-based Zilkha Renewable Energy and its \n     partner, Midwest Renewable Energy Corp. Geoff Roberts, \n     president and CEO of Entergy's independent power development \n     business unit, commented on the transaction, ``This project \n     provides Entergy with an attractive entry vehicle into \n     the wind energy business.''\n       FPL Energy, a subsidiary of FPL Corp., which also owns the \n     large utility Florida Power & Light, announced January 7 that \n     it had added 844 MW of wind power to its power generation \n     portfolio during 2001. The company, America's largest wind \n     plant operator, now operates 1,830 MW of wind, of which it \n     owns 1,439 MW. Dean Gosselin, FPL Energy vice president of \n     wind development, said, ``We know there are many more \n     opportunities for wind energy throughout the country and \n     great support in many regions for new wind power \n     facilities.''\n       GE Power Systems said in late February that it has signed \n     an agreement to purchase the manufacturing capability of \n     Enron Wind Corp., the largest U.S.-based utility-scale wind \n     turbine manufacturer. ``The acquisition of Enron Wind \n     represents GE Power Systems'' initial investment into \n     renewable wind power, one of the fastest growing energy \n     sectors,'' said John Rice, president and CEO of GE Power \n     Systems. GE Power Systems said it expects the wind industry \n     to grow at an annual rate of about 20%, with principal \n     markets in Europe, the U.S., and Latin America.\n       Pacificorp Power Marketing (PPM), affiliated with \n     Pacificorp, a large utility based in Portland, Ore., is \n     playing a major role in building the market for wind in the \n     Northwest. The company is purchasing and marketing power from \n     three wind plants in the West, including the 261-MW Stateline \n     Project, and has said it plans to add substantial wind \n     capacity to its portfolio over the next few years. ``This is \n     wind power on a grand scale,'' said PPM president Terry \n     Hudgens of Stateline, adding, ``Stateline is a watershed \n     event for our company and for the region. With Stateline, \n     wind is no longer just a small niche in our supply, but has \n     taken a position as a very real and significant part of the \n     new electric resources the region badly needs.''\n       Shell Subsidiary Shell WindEnergy, Inc., announced in late \n     January that it had purchased an 80-MW wind plant near \n     Amarillo, Tex. ``We are delighted to have moved so quickly in \n     making a second major investment in the U.S. wind power \n     market,'' said David Jones, Director of Shell WindEnergy, \n     Inc. ``Wind energy is not only the fastest-growing area of \n     power generation worldwide but it is also one of the cleanest \n     sources of energy.'' Shell WindEnergy also owns a 50-MW wind \n     project in Wyoming, and Shell is developing or operating more \n     than 1,000 MW of wind in the U.S. and Europe.\n       TXU, a large utility based in Dallas, Tex., announced in \n     early January that it plans to purchase a 40% equity stake in \n     two wind farms under construction in central Spain. TXU is \n     already one of the largest U.S. purchasers of wind-generated \n     electricity, buying the output of several Texas wind plants.\n       Utilicorp United, based in Kansas City, Mo., commissioned a \n     110-MW wind plant near Montezuma, Kans., in December. \n     Commented Keith Stamm, president and chief operating officer \n     of UtiliCorp's Global Networks Group, ``This wind farm \n     demonstrates UtiliCorp's commitment to providing its \n     customers with renewable and reliable energy supplies . . . \n     While this is the first major wind power project in Kansas, \n     the state has the potential to be a U.S. leader in wind \n     energy.''\n       ``This string of announcements by major energy corporations \n     is rapidly changing the face of the wind energy business,'' \n     said Randall Swisher, AWEA executive director. ``Coming on \n     the heels of the industry's most successful year, in the U.S. \n     and worldwide, it signals that wind energy is moving into the \n     big leagues. AWEA estimates that with continued government \n     encouragement and broad utility support, wind energy will \n     provide at least six percent of the nation's electricity by \n     2020.\n                                  ____\n\n\n FPL Energy Places Order for 175 Vestas Wind Turbines, With Option for \n                          650 Additional Units\n\n       FPL Energy, LLC, the independent power production \n     subsidiary of FPL Group Inc. (NYSE: FPL), today announced an \n     agreement with Vestas Wind Systems A/S of Denmark for \n     delivery of approximately 175 wind turbines and an option for \n     an additional 650 turbines.\n       Delivery of the 660-kilowatt turbines will begin in 2002 \n     and will support the planned expansion of wind-driven \n     electricity generation projects underway at FPL Energy.\n       ``Wind projects will be a major element of our expansion \n     activity in 2002 and 2003,'' said Ron Green, president of FPL \n     Energy. ``We expect to add 1,000 to 2,000 megawatts of wind \n     power to our portfolio by the end of next year.''\n       FPL Energy is the largest generator of electricity form \n     wind turbines in the United States. It currently owns and \n     operates wind farms in eight states with more than 1,400 \n     megawatts of capacity.\n       ``As the leading U.S. developer of wind power, it is \n     important for FPL Energy to secure a reliable source of wind \n     turbines for use in projects we are developing today and into \n     the future,'' said Mr. Green.\n       Approximately 80 percent of FPL Energy's electric \n     generation is fueled by renewable\n\n[[Page S3388]]\n\n     sources or clean-burning natural gas. Wind power represents \n     nearly 28 percent of the company's 5,063-megawatt portfolio.\n       Last month, Congress extended the production tax credit for \n     operating wind projects. Projects that become operational by \n     the end of 2003 will receive a 1.7-cent per kilowatt-hour tax \n     credit, adjusted for inflation, for a ten-year period.\n       ``We continued our wind project development activities \n     during the first part of this year, and the extension of the \n     production tax credit in March gave us the green light to \n     quickly advance these important projects to construction.\n       ``Wind power is an important component of our nation's move \n     toward energy independence as we harness our natural \n     resources for production of electricity. It is a clean, \n     renewable source of energy that can be sited, built and in \n     operation much more rapidly than conventional fossil fuel \n     facilities,'' Mr. Green said.\n       ``Typically, wind farms can be constructed in six to nine \n     months, and they are profitable from the first day of \n     operation,'' said Mr. Green. Last year, FPL Energy built \n     nearly 850 megawatts of wind-powered generating facilities, \n     approximately half of what was built in the United States.\n       ``A large percentage of our current wind facilities are \n     equipped with Vestas turbines,'' said Mr. Green. ``We are \n     pleased to move forward with such a reliable supplier for our \n     future expansion.''\n       FPL Energy is the nation's leader in wind energy \n     generation, with 24 wind farms in Iowa, Kansas, Texas, \n     Minnesota, Wisconsin, Washington, Oregon and California. The \n     company is a leading independent producer of clean energy \n     from natural gas, wind, solar and hydroelectric. Its \n     portfolio includes 73 facilities in operation, under \n     construction, or in advanced stages of development in 17 \n     states.\n       FPL Group, with annual revenues of more than $8 billion, is \n     nationally known as a high quality, efficient, and customer-\n     driven organization focused on energy-related products and \n     services.

Amendment No. 3370 is the business before the \nSenate. The Senator's amendment is before the Senate.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I would like to take up first amendment \nNo. 3372.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I could reserve my right to object, the \nSenator has two amendments. We do not care which one he brings up, but \nhe cannot bring up both.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to bring up No. 3372.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the unanimous consent agreement that is now standing \nbe modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Is that \namendment germane postcloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it is not.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Is the amendment out of order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A point of order would lie at the appropriate \ntime.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, for the information of my colleague, I \nam happy for him to discuss it, but I will make a point of order at the \nappropriate time.\n\n[[Page S3389]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I will object to the unanimous consent \nrequest by the Senator from Nevada, and we will proceed on the \namendment that was the original subject of the unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, in February the Finance Committee \nreported out legislation which has become the tax provisions for the \nenergy bill. This set of provisions includes a number of incentives \nprovided to traditional energy production, conservation, and the use of \nalternative fuels.\n  In reporting this set of proposals, the Finance Committee made the \ndecision to defer the inclusion of an appropriate offset for the cost \nof these tax incentives until the bill was considered on the floor. We \nof course are now at that point.\n  The committee did not make the decision that such an offset was \nunnecessary. In fact, the budget which was adopted by the Congress last \nyear for the 1st session of the 107th Congress, as well as the one \nwhich is currently under consideration by the Senate Budget Committee, \nrequires that this legislation be budget neutral.\n  The amendment I had hoped to offer, and to which our friend and \ncolleague from Oklahoma has just indicated his intent to offer a point \nof order that it was not germane, and therefore was not available, \nwould have met that obligation. It would have said, simply, that before \nthese tax provisions went into effect either through spending or \nthrough revenue from other sources, it would be our obligation to make \nthis a budget-neutral program.\n  I am personally very disappointed that we are proceeding with these \ntax provisions, which as of now have a 10-year cost estimate of \napproximately $13 billion, without any effort to offset.\n  I strike the word ``any.'' We did, in fact, adopt a package of \nproposals earlier today which were stated to be a partial offset. But \nwhen you look at the cumulative number of those provisions, the total \namount of additional revenue over 10 years would be $37 million, as \nagainst $13 billion of revenue loss in this program.\n\n  The President of the United States outlined very clearly in his State \nof the Union Message that there were three priorities for this Nation, \nall of which have strong bipartisan support. These three priorities \nwere what he said could be considered without the fiscal discipline \nrequiring that there be a method of paying for these. Those three were: \nWinning the war on terrorism, defending our homeland, and reviving our \neconomy.\n  Congress has in fact followed the President's direction. In March we \npassed the Job Creation Worker Assistance Act, which included several \ntax incentives designed to stimulate the economy. That legislation was \nenacted without an offset. In a few weeks, Congress is likely to \nconsider a supplemental appropriation to provide $37 billion for the \nwar in Afghanistan, and that will be without an offset.\n  But wherever we go outside these three areas of the war, homeland \nsecurity, or stimulating the economy, the effect of not providing an \noffset is to ask our children and grandchildren, by the reduction in \nthe Social Security trust fund, upon which their security in retirement \ndepends, that trust fund now becomes the means by which we pay for our \ncurrent appetite.\n  Therefore, the amendment that is before us is an amendment which will \nstrike one of the provisions in the tax measure. It is division H, \nrelating to energy tax incentives, striking section 2308.\n  Frankly, that is an arbitrary selection and a strike. In a world in \nwhich we were prepared to pay for these various energy tax measures, I \nmight well be prepared to support them. But in a world in which we are \nsaying it is not important enough for us to pay for these measures, we \nare going to ask the next generations to pay by reducing the security \nupon which their retirement depends. I think that is an immoral act. I \nbelieve it is another step on the slippery slope down the mountain from \nfiscal discipline which this Congress worked so hard over the last \ndecade to achieve.\n  We already have converted an almost $6 trillion projected 10-year \nsurplus into a series of deficits. We have acted at a level of fiscal \nirresponsibility almost unknown in the history of this country. I wish \nwe had been able to adopt the amendment that I wanted to offer, which \nwould have said let's put aside all of these tax measures until we have \ndeveloped--as a Finance Committee indicated it was the intention--a \nmeans of paying for them before they go into effect. That is not \navailable.\n  Therefore, I am taking a second option to propose that we strike this \nand other of the provisions that have gone into the bill so we will not \nbe in the position of having to find an offset because we have made the \ndecision that we are going to be fiscally responsible.\n  I urge my colleagues to take this opportunity to say enough is \nenough. We are already committed to paying without offsets for the war, \nfor homeland security, and for economic stimulation. But beyond those \npriorities, I think on a broad, bipartisan consensus we should ask is \nthis issue important enough for us to do and important enough for our \ngeneration of Americans to pay for it.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first say that the general \nsentiment that the Senator from Florida has expressed is one I agree \nwith--which is that I am disappointed that we have not come up with a \nproposal to offset the cost of the various tax provisions in this bill. \nI hoped we could do that in the Finance Committee.\n  I think that clearly would be the better course to follow, and \nperhaps, if we could get the support from the administration, we could \nmove in that direction. But that has not been possible.\n  I am constrained to oppose the amendment of the Senator from Florida.\n  This amendment would simply pick out the tax provisions in the bill, \nand the particular provision that he finds objectionable, which is \nintended to maintain domestic production when world oil prices are \nlower. We have several provisions in the bill which are so-called \ncountercyclical provisions, which basically say that when the oil price \ngoes down below certain levels, there is a tax incentive for companies \nto stay in the business and not to shut down production in this \ncountry.\n  This is one of several provisions intended to maintain reasonable \ncashflows to keep the service sector in the oil economy working. The \nprovision would stimulate the economy and producing areas in our \ncountry.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Graham amendment \nthat has been presented to the Senate at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to inform my friend from Florida \nthat I will make a couple of comments and then move to table. But if he \nwishes to speak before the tabling motion, I would be happy to let him \ndo so.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I was going to close on the amendment \nbefore we take up the tabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it had not been my intention to dwell on \nspecifics of a particular tax measure because, as I indicated, if we \nhad provided the offset for this, I would have voted for it.\n  The issue for our colleagues and for the American people is that this \nprovision would further deplete the Social Security trust fund. That is \nwhere it is coming from. This is not revenue eligible.\n  As desirable as this may be, I do not believe it meets that test. It \ndoes not meet the President's test. It does not justify going into the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  I share his position and urge that our colleagues use this as a line \nin the sand for fiscal discipline.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, my colleague and good friend is on the \nFinance Committee, as am I. We had an opportunity to offset it if we \nwanted to in committee. We didn't do it.\n  I don't know why this particular amendment is picked out. But I think \nit is a mistake to try to strike this language. This language says you \ncan't expense over 2 years' payments that are made to keep a lease \nongoing. Sometimes a person or a company may have a lease to drill or \nto explore. For whatever reason, they can't initiate exploration. It \nmay be because of political problems. Maybe they can't get a particular \npermit. Maybe the price has\n\n[[Page S3390]]\n\ndropped so low that it is not feasible. But they want to keep the lease \nopen. So they make payments.\n  Under the provision in the bill, we say those payments are expensed \nover 2 years. Frankly, they should be expensed in the year made.\n  I might note we passed countless amendments that said let us give a \ntax credit for this. We will reduce taxes substantially; in other \nwords, have the taxpayers subsidize it. In this case, we are not \nlooking for subsidies. If somebody writes a check, we are asking that \nthey be able to expense that check.\n  Frankly, the provision in the Senate bill is over 2 years. It should \nbe 1 year. When you write the check ``for lease payment,'' you could \nhave an example where somebody has a lease to drill someplace, and a \npolitical obstruction has arisen--maybe State, maybe Federal, maybe \nwhatever--and they are not able to commence exploration. But if they \ndon't make payments, they would lose the lease. They should be able to \nexpense those payments in the year made.\n  The bill before us says they should be able to expense it in 2 years. \nThat is more than defensible.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the motion to table the \nGraham amendment.\n  I move to table the Graham amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have dealt with this before. We are going \nto push for higher standards and fuel efficiency, but only to the \nextent technologically feasible to require an arbitrary figure pulled \nout of the air to be substituted for the procedure in the Levin-Bond \namendment. It makes no sense.\n  I urge all our colleagues who voted for the Levin-Bond amendment to \nsupport the motion to table for jobs, for safety and for consumer \nchoice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the Levin-Bond amendment language which is \nin this bill requires the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate \nregulations increasing fuel efficiency standards. Our amendment changes \nnothing in the Levin-Bond amendment.\n  Our amendment says that in establishing those fuel efficiency \nstandards, we direct the Secretary of Transportation to also consider \nreducing oil consumption through alternative fuels--ethanol, biodiesel, \nand energy from coal waste.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan has \n34 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment before us would fundamentally \nchange the Levin-Bond amendment. What it does is, in effect, prejudge \nthe outcome of the very process that we put in place, a process that we \nwant to use to consider all of the factors that are involved, including \nsafety factors, including the availability of alternative fuels. All of \nthose factors ought to be considered in the regulatory process, not \nprejudged with an artificial mandate that we have to save 1 million \nbarrels per day.\n  I hope this will be tabled and that we will then go back to the \nregulatory process in the Levin-Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 3198. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3333\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided on the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I made a motion to table the amendment, \nand the Senator from Utah will use the minute to argue for that \nposition.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will take my 1 minute to speak in favor of \nmy amendment first. Then Senator Hatch will speak in favor of the \nmotion to table.\n  This amendment strikes the alternative fuels tax credit portion of \nthe bill. The savings would be at least $1 billion, probably closer to \nabout $3 billion. That is not my reason for doing it. Arizona had a \nsomewhat similar program in our State government that would have \nbankrupted the State and ruin political careers. It was a fiasco and it \nwas finally terminated. It was full of loopholes and problems and costs \nthat were never thought through.\n  My reason for offering the amendment is, frankly, to send a warning \nto all of my colleagues that we really should have thought it better \nthrough in our own Federal version. To their credit, the staff of the \nFinance Committee did take the advice of a lot of people at the \ndepartment of transportation in Arizona and fixed a lot of the \nproblems. My concern is they didn't fix enough and we will rue the day \nwe voted for this provision--at least without the care that I think \nshould have gone into it. My motion strikes the provision from the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of \nthe Senator from Arizona, for three reasons. First, the Finance \nCommittee passed these tax incentive provisions through by a wide \nmargin. Second, we have solved the problems that arose during the \nArizona experience. Third, this is probably the most important \nenvironmental bill that will go through our Congress this year, and \nmaybe in a long time, because it provides for incentives for \nalternative fuels, alternative vehicles, and alternative fuel stations.\n  It is about time we start approaching these problems in an \nintelligent way that will take us away from being so dependent upon \nforeign oil. The provisions the Senator from Arizona's amendment would \nstrike will do more toward that end than anything I know and in the end \nwill save us money.\n  The provisions that this amendment would strike are almost identical \nto the provisions in the bipartisan CLEAR ACT, which stands for Clean \nEfficient Automobiles Resulting from Advanced Car Technology, which I \nintroduced last year along with Senators Jeffords, Rockefeller, Chafee, \nKerry, Collins, Gordon Smith, Crapo, and Lieberman.\n  The CLEAR ACT is the product of a carefully crafted, delicately \nbalanced, and politically unusual alliance between auto manufacturers, \ntruck engine manufacturers, environmental groups, fuel suppliers, and \nother stakeholders. I might add that these provisions, which provide \nstrong incentives for energy conservation, are an integral part of the \nPresident's energy plan. The CLEAR ACT provisions create a fair and \nbalanced playing field for all the advanced technologies and \nalternative fuel vehicles that offer the promise of both clean air and \nless dependency on foreign fuel.\n  Transportation accounts for about two-thirds of the oil consumption \nin the United States, and we are 97 percent dependent on oil for our \ntransportation needs. When we consider the role transportation plays in \nour economy and our way of life, it is hard to believe that we rely on \nforeign sources for more than one-half of our oil supply. If our Nation \nis going to have a strategy for energy security, that strategy must \nbegin with transportation fuels. The Kyl amendment would take away our \nbest opportunity to provide a balanced approach to achieve this \nstrategy.\n  Advances in alternative fuels and new vehicle technologies have been \nsignificant in recent years. However, three basic obstacles stand in \nthe way of a broad shift toward their adoption. These are the higher \ncost of the vehicles, the higher cost of alternative\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\nfuels, and the lack of an infrastructure of alternative fueling \nstations.\n  The CLEAR ACT provisions that this amendment would strike would lower \nthe barriers that stand in the way of widespread consumer acceptance of \nthese advanced technology and alternative fuel vehicles by providing \ntax credits to consumers who purchase hybrid electric, fuel cell, \nbattery electric, and dedicated alternative fuel vehicles. They also \nwould provide incentives for the purchase of alternative fuels and the \ndevelopment of an alternative fuel infrastructure.\n  Without imposing any new mandates, the CLEAR ACT provisions in this \nenergy bill focus on the very best emerging technologies to help our \ncitizens to enjoy the health benefits of cleaner air sooner, to help \nour communities to enjoy the economic benefits of attaining clean air \nstandards sooner, and to help us reduce our consumption of foreign oil \nsooner than would otherwise be possible.\n  With the clear benefits of these provisions to less dependency on \nforeign oil and to cleaner air, which I might add come at a very \nreasonable cost in terms of revenue loss to the Treasury, it is hard to \nsee why anyone in this body would want to strike them. Moreover, the \ntax credits the CLEAR ACT offers are performance based, which is to say \nthat they are based on the principle that every dollar of tax \nexpenditure should produce substantive air quality and energy security \nbenefits. The greater the benefits a particular vehicle achieves, the \nlarger the tax incentive for purchasing it.\n  While I do not want to assume I know the motivations of the Senator \nfrom Arizona for offering this amendment, part of it might be based on \nan unfortunate experience in his home State. Not long ago, a well-\nintentioned program to promote alternative fuel vehicles by the Arizona \nlegislature experienced extreme cost overruns and failed to provide the \npromised energy and environmental benefits. I want to assure the \nMembers of this body that we have studied the Arizona experience, we \nhave identified the inherent weaknesses of that model, and we have been \ncareful to avoid each one of them in this legislation.\n  With the CLEAR ACT provisions, until a new advanced vehicle is \npurchased, until new infrastructure has been installed, or until \nalternative fuel is placed in the tank of a dedicated alternative fuel \nvehicle, there will be no cost to the Treasury. And when a cost is \nincurred, it will be a small cost relative to the resulting \nenvironmental benefits and energy savings.\n  To me it is inconceivable that this Senate would pass an energy \npolicy bill without addressing the issue of how to increase the \npublic's adoption of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. \nAlthough gasoline vehicles are 90 percent cleaner today than 30 years \nago, the significant increase in the total number of vehicles on the \nroad and the miles traveled per year by each vehicle means that little \nprogress has been made in reducing the contribution of motor vehicle \nemissions to air pollution.\n  Similarly, despite improvements in fuel economy compared to 30 years \nago, more petroleum than ever is used in motor vehicles and U.S. \ndependence on imported oil is at a record high and increasing. \nAlternative fuel vehicles and advanced technology vehicles, such as \nhybrids and fuel cells, significantly reduce the use of gasoline and \ndiesel and have dramatically reduced emissions. Each dedicated natural \ngas vehicle displaces 100 percent of the gasoline or diesel that \notherwise would be used in that vehicle.\n  Conventional gasoline and diesel motor vehicle technology has come \nabout as far as it can in terms of fuel economy and emissions. The \nfurther gains that are needed to allow the United States to achieve \nenergy security and clean air require nonpetroleum vehicles and hybrid \nand fuel cell vehicles. The nation simply cannot achieve its goals in \nthese areas with these conventional vehicles. Striking these provisions \nwould be a big mistake, and I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nKyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes evenly divided \nbefore a vote on the motion to table the Graham amendment.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment is not about the underlying \nprovision, but I think it is worthwhile for the Members to understand \nwhat the underlying provision would do.\n  The current tax law, consistent with generally accepted accounting \nprocedures, provides that when royalty payments are made by oil and gas \nproducers to the landowner during a period when there is no oil or gas \nproduction, during a suspension period, that those costs must be \ncapitalized, and then they can be recovered when there is actual oil \nand gas production. That is both the accounting and tax law today.\n  We are about to split the two and say that for tax purposes they can \nbe expensed within a 2-year period. If that sounds a little bit like \nsome of the things that Enron was doing on its books, the answer is it \nis a lot like what Enron was doing on its books.\n  But the fundamental issue is, without examination, we are about to \nask the Social Security trust fund to pay for the additional cost of \nthis preferential depreciation treatment. I believe, if this is a \nworthy provision, it is worthy that somebody come up with an offset so \nthat we decide who pays for it, not our children and grandchildren, by \ndepletion of the Social Security trust fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, the provision that the Senator from \nFlorida seeks to take out of the bill is part of a very carefully \nbalanced and level tax package that should remain in this bill. We \nshould table this amendment.\n  Simply stated, the situation is, if you produce oil, you pay a \nroyalty. You can deduct it. But if the price of oil drops, you have to \npay delayed rental payments, and you pay the payments to the \nGovernment. You should be able to deduct those payments as you can \ndeduct royalty payments when they are paid. That is what the bill says. \nThat provision should be kept in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is the only part of the bill that \nwould encourage small drillers to explore. In fact, this is as any \nother business is treated. The underlying bill\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\nsays, if you pay an expense, you get to deduct it in the year in which \nyou make it.\n  This amendment would take that away and make you amortize it, even \nthough you already paid it. And you may not even find oil. Please table \nthis amendment. It would be unfair not to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the senior Senator from Florida. As we all know, our budget \nposition has changed dramatically over the past year, and we are now \nfacing projected deficits for years to come. If we are to climb out of \nthe deficit hole, we absolutely must commit to a path of fiscal \nresponsibility. That means a lot of things. First and foremost, it \nmeans paying for the spending and tax cut bills we pass.\n  As it stands, we have not paid for this legislation. The tax package \nalone digs our deficit hole another $14 billion deeper. As we approach \nthe retirement of the largest generation in history, the baby boomers, \nwe face enormous fiscal challenges. Obviously, Social Security needs \nstrengthening, Medicare must be modernized, and our long-term care \nsystem is in desperate need of reform.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and put \nus back on the path to fiscal responsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of the sponsors and \nmy colleagues, we could make a point of order that this amendment is \nnot germane because it is not postcloture. I am not going to do that \nbecause I was informed they were going to have the same thing offered \nto the underlying bill. I think it is in the interest of Senators to \nconclude the bill, and the best way is to table this amendment. This \namendment is not germane postcloture.\n  I happen to be on the Finance Committee. All Democrats and \nRepublicans had chances to offer tax increases, and this amendment says \ndon't let this bill take effect in any of the tax provisions until we \nhave tax increases enacted into law. I think that is ridiculous. It is \na good way to kill the provisions that the Senator from Montana and the \nSenator from Iowa worked to put in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I move to table this amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending business is the Brownback \namendment No. 3239.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I suggest the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator \nfrom Kansas be allowed to explain that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is a compromise approach on a very \ndifficult issue. It involves taking out the underlying language on the \nCO2 registry. It will put in place a 5-year voluntary \nprogram on registering of CO2 emissions. After that period \nof time, if 60 percent are not reported, it does put in place a trigger \nmechanism, a mandatory reporting, unless there is an affirmative vote \nby this body which is required in the bill to remove that reporting \nrequirement.\n  It is a bipartisan approach. It is a compromise approach on a tough \ntopic. It is voluntary. It is market oriented. It provides companies a \nway to limit their risk and exposure on CO2 issues of \nanything that might happen in the future and provides a registry for \ncompanies that want to voluntarily step forward and work to reduce \nthose CO2 emissions. They may want to put in a new \npowerplant that is coal fired to protect themselves for CO2 \nexposures.\n  This is a tough and complex topic. I think we have struck the right \nbalance with this amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nNew Jersey be given a minute to explain his perspective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, we want to make sure in this compromise \namendment that the perfect not be the enemy of the good. This is not \neverything anyone would want, but we have struck a compromise with \nvoluntary reporting requirements and database buildup and recognition \nof actions by industry to control CO2. We will look at it in \n5 years.\n  If the threshold is not met, mandatory requirements will come into \nplay. This is an outstanding compromise where people worked very hard \non a complex issue to get to a bipartisan middle ground. I hope we will \nall support it.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I think it is appropriate to dispose of this amendment \nby voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3239.\n  The amendment (No. 3239) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, with the adoption of this amendment, the \nSenate has affirmed its commitment to dealing with the reporting of \ngreenhouse gases in a voluntary, incentive-based manner.\n  This amendment provides for a voluntary registry for the reductions \nin greenhouse gas emissions. Under this type of provision, industries \nwill have an opportunity to record reductions made in their emissions \nand receive credit for those reductions.\n  The legislative record should clearly note that the provisions \ncreating the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases originally \ncontained in the underlying legislation will no longer take effect \nunless the voluntary registry does not achieve a critical mass of \nparticipation. If the voluntary registry system generates sufficient \nparticipation, the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions will \nnever take effect.\n  This amendment is not without problems, nor do I believe it is the \nbest way to achieve robust participation in a voluntary registry. It \ncontains several impediments that should be addressed in conference.\n  The memorandum of agreement does not clearly spell out the roles of \nthe various federal agencies in the execution of the duties proscribed. \nThis is particularly troublesome for a voluntary registry. Those \nentities wishing to participate need the greatest clarity and certainty \nin order to have the greatest incentive to participate. Lack of \ncertainty creates a disincentive and should be addressed in conference.\n  There are onerous civil penalties contained is this amendment that \nshould be removed. Greater baseline protection needs to be provided to \nensure entities participating gain the rightful recognition for their \nefforts.\n  Furthermore, I hope the conference will address the fundamental \nquestion of whether any ``trigger'' is necessary. The mandatory \nreporting of greenhouse gas emissions has no true purpose. We already \ngarner information on the totality of U.S. emissions through annual \ninventories established within and reported by the Energy Information \nAdministration and the Environmental Protection Agency. The only \npurpose for the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions is to \ncreate the mechanism for the regulation of carbon dioxide. This option \nhas been dismissed by the current Administration, and I would hope the \nfinal legislation does not create a mechanism to help bring this about \nin the future.\n  Numerous other options for structuring a voluntary greenhouse gas \nemissions registry were discussed during the discourse on Title XI of \nthis legislation. Senator Voinovich and I offered an amendment on April \n18, 2002. It would have established a new and enhanced national \ngreenhouse gas registry to record and recognize voluntary reductions of \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  That registry was supported by a wide cross-section of American \nindustry, the very entities who would be participating in such a \nregistry. I have included a copy of an April 16 letter sent to all \nSenators and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record \nimmediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HAGEL. This amendment could provide an alternative structure for \na voluntary registry for consideration in the conference committee. It \nwas created in consultation with many other Senators and reflects the \nexpertise of their input.\n  It is a workable framework for a registry that would be robust and \ngain the greatest and most meaningful participation from American \nindustry. This, after all, should be our goal in the final outcome.\n  I appreciate the work of the sponsors of the amendment just adopted \nin putting the Senate on record in favor of dealing with the reporting \nof greenhouse gas emissions in a voluntary manner. And I look forward \nto the conference committee improving upon the work begun in the Senate \nto provide for the implementation of a voluntary greenhouse gas \nemissions registry.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                   April 16, 2002.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: We write to encourage your support \n     for a draft amendment to the Energy Bill that proposes \n     substantial improvements to Title XI, including the \n     establishment of a more effective national registry of \n     greenhouse gas emissions and a more practical framework \n     encouraging further voluntary efforts to reduce those \n     emissions without harming our economy, our workers or our \n     communities.\n       Without the needed changes, Title XI of the Energy Bill \n     would impose an unnecessary federal mandate to track and \n     report greenhouse gas emissions on large and small \n     businesses, as well as farmers, ranchers, some hospitals, \n     universities, school systems and more. And yet, the intent of \n     this costly and burdensome mandate is redundant. The federal \n     government, without any federal mandate, already compiles an \n     annual inventory of greenhouse gas emissions in compliance \n     with our national commitment to the ratified UN Framework \n     Convention on Climate Change.\n       The draft amendment would establish a new and enhanced \n     system to report and verify actions taken to reduce or avoid \n     greenhouse gas emissions and provide transferable credits to \n     persons who do. By offering appropriate recognition of \n     actions taken, the amendment will provide powerful incentives \n     to participate without harming the economy, all the while \n     strengthening our national climate policy strategy.\n       The draft amendment provides a constructive, achievable and \n     effective strategy to strengthen and improve the voluntary \n     reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and the reporting of \n     actions taken to reduce or avoid those emissions. We \n     encourage you to support the amendment and work with Senators \n     of both parties to secure its adoption.\n\n[[Page S3395]]\n\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views. While we \n     have some additional concerns regarding the policy provisions \n     of the bill, especially those provisions that appear to call \n     for a target and a timetable, we are hopeful these issues \n     will be resolved prior to final passage of the bill. In the \n     meantime, we look forward to working with you on developing \n     an effective climate policy strategy as part of our national \n     energy policy.\n           Sincerely,\n         Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, American \n           Architectural Manufacturers Association, American \n           Boiler Manufacturers Assn, American Farm Bureau \n           Federation, American Highway Users Alliance,\n         American Iron and Steel Institute, American Petroleum \n           Institute, American Portland Cement Alliance, American \n           Public Power Association, American Textile \n           Manufacturers Institute,\n         Associated General Contractors of St. Louis, Associated \n           Petroleum Industries of Pennsylvania, Association of \n           American Railroads, Automotive Parts Rebuilders \n           Association, Danville [IL] Area Chamber of Commerce,\n         Edison Electric Institute, Gas Appliance Manufacturers \n           Association, Greater Bristol [CT] Chamber of Commerce, \n           Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, Greater Merced \n           [CA] Chamber of Commerce,\n         Greater Victoria [TX] Chamber of Commerce, Idaho Mining \n           Association, Illinois Valley Area Chamber of Commerce & \n           Economic Development, Integrity Research Institute, \n           IPC--The Association Connecting Electronic Industries,\n         Kansas Petroleum Council, Leavenworth-Lansing [KS] Area \n           Chamber of Commerce, Lorain [OH] County Chamber of \n           Commerce, Louisiana Association of Business and \n           Industry, Metropolitan Evansville [IN] Chamber of \n           Commerce,\n         Naperville [IL] Area Chamber of Commerce, National \n           Association of Manufacturers, National Mining \n           Association, National Rural Electric Cooperative \n           Association, National Society of Professional \n           Engineers,\n         Nuclear Energy Institute, O'Fallen [IL] Chamber of \n           Commerce, Salt Institute, South Dakota Farm Bureau \n           Federation, Texas Association of Business and Chambers \n           of Commerce,\n         The Siouxland [IA] Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Chamber of \n           Commerce, Utah Rural Telecom Association, Wisconsin \n           Grocers Association.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Corzine/\nBrownback amendment No. 3239. This amendment replaces the existing \nlanguage in Title 11 which would have created a mandatory registry for \nthe reporting of greenhouse gases and replaces it with a voluntary \nprogram. I am pleased that the Senate has rejected the concept of \nmandating greenhouse gas reports at this time. While the amendment does \ncontain language which would trigger compulsory reporting in five years \nif sixty percent of the national aggregate anthropogenic greenhouse \ngases are not represented on the voluntary registry, we do not expect \nthis trigger to ever be activated since presently thirty percent of the \ngases are already reporting under the Clean Air Act by the utility \nsector.\n  I had joined with Senator Hagel in offering an alternative amendment \nwhich would have provided a much more robust voluntary reporting \nprogram with a transferable credit program and baseline protection. \nThis would have provided a clear incentive to encourage maximum \nparticipation.\n  The approach that Senator Hagel and I took in our amendment would \nhave accomplished three key objectives: (1) It will help us get the \nfull picture on climate change with real incentives for voluntary \nparticipation in the registry; (2) It will make sure that picture \nreflects what is really happening by providing for accurate measurement \nand verification of emission reductions, and (3) It is forward looking \nbecause it creates a process for establishing transferable credits that \ncan be used in voluntary transactions for any future potential \nregulatory program.\n  Unfortunately, due to cloture limitations, the Senate ran out of time \nto fully consider our amendment, yet I am pleased that Senators Corzine \nand Brownback adopted our idea of a voluntary registry to replace the \noverly burdensome mandatory program contained in the original bill. At \nthis point in time I do not think it is wise public policy to mandate \nthe reporting of greenhouse gases, and I am pleased that the Senate \nagrees with this point.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3146, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent amendment No. \n3146 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3146) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3355, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent amendment No. 3355 be modified \nto reflect changes to the fuel cell credit adopted as part of the \namendment by Senator Murray earlier this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an important \namendment on behalf of myself and Senator Wyden regarding carbon \nsequestration.\n  The Energy Policy Reform Act and the debates we have had on it have \nsought to achieve an integration of energy and environmental policy \nincluding new and far reaching provisions to help this nation meet its \ninternational obligations to address global climate change. The \namendment I propose today with Senator Wyden provides an important \ncomplement to provisions in S. 517, the Farm Bill that already passed \nthe Senate, and the President's recent announced plans to address \nglobal climate change. These other provisions would advance research on \ncarbon sequestration from the agriculture and forest sectors, establish \ncredible methods for measuring carbon sequestered for individual \nprojects, and create a national greenhouse gas emissions database and \nregistry at the project level.\n  The amendment takes a comprehensive view of both carbon sequestration \nand carbon storage--beyond the project level--to address what is \nhappening over time to release and sink carbon for the full range of \nland uses, management practices and natural resources. The amendment \ncreates a competitive grant pilot program for state and multi-state \nareas in a range of regional forest, agriculture and ecosystem \nsettings. The purpose is to help us better understand what is needed \nfor a national carbon sequestration inventory and accounting system \nthat would be credible and cost-effective.\n  The amendment will enable us to assess the overall effectiveness and \npotential contributions of new programs and policies to encourage \nactions which offer a broad range of benefits to the environment. To do \nthis, the amendment seeks to translate scientific information into \neasily understood means for landowners and others to apply in making \ndecisions on their current practices. This information will distinguish \npractices which offer additional environmental benefits that may be \nassociated with carbon storage or sequestration, such as flood and \nerosion prevention, soil conservation, fertility and productivity \nimprovements, improved water quality and management, protection and \nrestoration of ecosystems and habitat, and improved management of \nagricultural lands and forests including reforestation practices. It \nalso would include information for landowners and others on how to \nassess the economic and financial costs and benefits of land uses that \nsequester or store carbon.\n  If we make this investment now, within the next 5 years we should be \nprepared to identify real incentives not only for forest and \nagriculture but also for natural resources and land use management \nwhich will show up also in our national accounts. I also anticipate \nthat some policy changes supported by this information may enable our \nagriculture and forest sectors to realize an economic gain from the \npractices themselves.\n  The practices that will be encouraged by this amendment make good \ncommon sense and good economic sense. The State of Minnesota, with its \nrich forest and agricultural base and water resources, has a lot to \nlose from global warming.\n  While we have much to lose, we also have much we can contribute to \nreducing the problem of global climate change and gain in the process. \nIf done properly, carbon storage and sequestration offer a welcome \nopportunity to draw together the interests and talents of the \nenvironmental community, agriculture, forest and timber products \nindustries. Carbon sequestration is not the only or even major answer \nto our challenges in addressing climate change, but it is an important \ncomplement to other steps we must take to increase energy efficiency \nand conservation, increase use of renewable fuels and put in place an \neffective program for greenhouse gas emissions control.\n  This research must involve a wide range of perspectives and \ninterests. The Secretary of the Department of Agriculture is directed \nto work in collaboration with other federal agencies, on all aspects of \ncarrying out the purposes of the amendment. These agencies should \ninclude the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration, the Departments of Commerce, Energy, and the \nInterior, as well as several agencies within the Department of \nAgriculture, including the Agricultural Research Service, the \nCooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, the Forest \nService, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service.\n  Because forest and agriculture sectors play such a critical role in \ncarbon storage and sequestration, the pilot areas should have a high \npercentage of land that is forest or cropland. The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture already tracks this information through its Natural \nResources Conservation Service National Resources Inventory, the last \nbeing carried out in 1997.\n  Pilot State or multi-State areas should not only be capable of \ncarrying out the research on a technical level, they should have \ndemonstrated or be interested in pursuing the kind of policies and \nprograms to encourage environmentally beneficial carbon storage and \nsequestration practices that this amendment seeks to advance. This \nresearch takes research and information already available at different \nlevels of government, and in many different groups, and integrates it \nin a way that we can develop and assess these means of encouraging \nhelpful practices.\n  The amendment calls for an approach to carbon storage and \nsequestration accounting based on sound science. It is our intention \nthat the Peer Review process called for in the amendment would include \npublic and private science and policy groups as well as by the user \ncommunity. This peer review is important particularly in regard to \ntranslating science into information in a form that provides easy \naccess to landowners to encourage them to consider environmentally \nbeneficial carbon storage and sequestration practices in their decision \nmaking.\n  Eligible entities for the pilot program grants would include land \ngrant colleges or universities as defined both by the National \nAgricultural Research, Extension and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 and \ntribal land grant institutions established through the Equity in \nEducational Land Grant Status Act of 1994. These research institutions, \nas well as others with demonstrated experience in the field should be \nincluded among the eligible entities as should state or state consortia \nor non-profits be considered for these grants, especially since we want \nto see the results used to move forward on the policy and program front \nto encourage these practices.\n  The grant-eligible programs should also demonstrate that they would \ninclude some means of ensuring the participation of governmental and \nnon governmental interests that would be affected by the pilot program.\n  Carbon sequestration and storage potentially serve both environmental \nand economic interests. I have letters of endorsement from the American \nFarmland Trust, the National Farmer's Union, The Institute for \nAgriculture and Trade Policy, Environmental Defense and Nature \nConservancy, as well as from leading soil and forest scientists in \nMinnesota, Kansas, Ohio, and Oregon. Many others who are prominent in \nthe environmental, agricultural, forest, and research communities \nbelieve this amendment takes us in the right direction.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3230\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding rule XXII, it \nbe in order to consider amendment No. 3230; that Senator Cantwell and \nSenator Smith of Oregon be added as cosponsors, the amendment be agreed \nto,\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    broadband tax credit legislation\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a number of us have come to the floor \ntoday to discuss legislation to provide tax incentives to accelerate \n``broadband'' high-speed Internet access across the country. The \nwidespread availability of broadband technology is essential to \nensuring the United States' technological leadership in the world. We \nmust make a commitment to a national broadband policy and do it now.\n  The reach of the information revolution to our Nation's rural and \nurban underserved areas depends on affordable Internet access. For far \ntoo long, these regions have found themselves disconnected from the \ninformation age because of their geography and high-cost of service. \nOne of our greatest challenges for the future is to close the growing \neconomic gap in access to computers and the Internet. If we do not act \nto close it now, this ``digital divide'' will become the opportunity of \nour time.\n  Several policy initiatives have been proposed to stimulate broadband \ndeployment including deregulation, community planning grants, and low-\ninterest loans to name a few. The broadband tax credit proposal is an \nimportant first step that has gained widespread support in Congress \nbecause it provides tax credits to those who take broadband to places \nwhere the market is not taking it, both geographically and \ntechnologically. So we are here to discuss the importance of that \nproposal and of ensuring its passage this year.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is the sponsor of the preeminent \nbroadband tax credit bill, the Broadband Internet Access Act, of which \nI am pleased to be an original cosponsor, as is my friend from Oregon. \nSenator Rockefeller had led the fight to bring broadband access to all \nAmericans, and first introduced this bill along with Senators Moynihan, \nKerry, and others. He reintroduced the Broadband Internet Access Act, \nS. 88, last year, and it has 64 cosponsors from both sides of the \naisle. A companion bill in the House has 194 cosponsors. A version of \nSenator Rockefeller's bill was reported out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee as part of the stimulus package that was sent to the floor \nlast December. I commend my friend from West Virginia for his \nleadership on this and many other technology issues so important to our \nnation's economy.\n  Senator Smith and I have introduced a measure very similar to Senator \nRockefeller's bill as an amendment to the energy legislation now before \nthis body. Under this proposal, any company providing the required \nlevel of service, whether by telephone, cable modem, terrestrial \nwireless, satellite, or any other technology, would be eligible to \nclaim the credit. The proposal provides a 10 percent tax credit for \ninvestment in ``current-generation'' broadband services and a 20 \npercent credit for investment in ``next generation'' services. Current \ngeneration broadband is typically 5-20 times faster than conventional \n``dial-up'' Internet service and capable of transmitting text and \nphotos very quickly. Current generation broadband can also transmit \nvideo imagery, but with low quality. Next generation broadband is \nhundreds of times faster than dial-up and transmits video imagery with \ngreat speed and clarity, making it ideal for applications like \ntelemedicine, distance learning, and video conferencing.\n  In my home State of Massachusetts, I saw firsthand how these types of \nadvanced Internet services transformed the economy of the entire \nBerkshire County region. Like may rural areas across the Nation, the \nBerkshires were considered to be too far away from the Internet portals \nto interest providers. But business and Government leaders began an \ninitiative called ``Berkshire Connect,'' that resulted in a partnership \nwith providers to build a multi-million dollar network of microwave \ntowers and fiber-optic lines linking the county's scenic villages and \nsmall cities with fast Internet access.\n  The project put the Berkshires on an equal footing with the rest of \nthe global marketplace, because the Internet levels the playing field \nbetween large and small businesses and rural and urban areas. I am \nconfident that passage of the broadband tax credit measure will bring \nsimilar success stories across the Nation like we have seen in the \nBerkshires for more residents and businesses.\n  The proposal provides $540 million in tax credits for broadband \ndeployment to wire an estimated 5.4 million additional U.S. homes with \ncurrent generation broadband and 700,000 more with next generation \nbroadband. Today, 11 million U.S. homes are wired with current \ngeneration broadband and 340,000 with next generation broadband. This \nmeasure would increase those numbers by 50 percent and 200 percent \nrespectively.\n  Senator Smith and I filed this measure as an amendment to the energy \nlegislation because we see a clear connection between Internet use and \nenergy savings. One former Energy Department official has testified \nbefore Congress that by reducing shopping trips and retail office \nspace, e-commerce was responsible for energy use staying flat in the \nlast 1990s while the economy was expanding sharply. And a number of \nstudies have found that telecommuting saves 1-2 percent of total annual \ngasoline consumption and has the potential to save more. Meanwhile, \neconomists now recognize that telecommuters can avoid the ``congestion \ncosts'' which each additional driver imposes on others in terms of lost \ntime and excess fuel from sitting in traffic jams. Princeton Professor \nPaul Krugman has estimated Atlanta's congestion cost at $3,500 a year \nfor each\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\nadditional driver. And associated savings come in the area of the \nenvironment. A 1999 study by the International Telework Association and \nCouncil found that the average telecommuter saves 28.5 pounds of \npollution emissions every day he or she works from home.\n  The Senator from West Virginia was just discussing with me a number \nof other important benefits of broadband, apart from energy savings. I \nwonder if he would take a moment to describe those.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would be happy to do so, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. For years now, it has been a goal of mine to make \nsure that West Virginians, and indeed all Americans, can have access to \ntechnology. The primary reason I introduced the broadband tax credit is \nto help address some of the most intractable problems associated with \nour country's transition to the digital economy--unequal availability \nof broadband access technologies. This tax credit will encourage \ndeployment of broadband facilities in areas where such technologies \nhave not, and, without Congressional action, perhaps will not, be made \navailable. With the help of the tax credit, people and businesses in \nthese areas will be able to more fully benefit from the networked \neconomy, and from activities such as telemedicine, telecommuting, and \ndistance learning. This has positive consequences for everyone--not \njust those in rural areas--that go beyond the marketplace.\n  I also think it important to understand that this technology will \nalso be an important driver of productivity and economic growth. \nAccording to the Federal Reserve, information technology accounted for \nover 60 percent of the productivity growth occurring from 1995 to 1999. \nListen to the change that occurred at that time. During the first half \nof the 1990s, productivity increased on average only 1.5 percent per \nyear. Then, when we began to link our computers over the Internet, \nproductivity jumped to 2.8 percent in the second half of the decade. It \nis this increase which Fed economists attribute primarily to \ninformation technology, and I think it is very fair to expect that \nwide-spread broadband networks are going to make us that much more \nefficient because they move us beyond using the Internet for e-mail to \nmuch more substantive and sophisticated applications. And the economic \nvalue of that to us as a nation could be very significant. One \neconomist, Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institute, estimates that \naccelerated deployment of broadband will generate up to $500 billion in \neconomic growth annually.\n  But the other side of this is that if we do not deploy broadband \nquickly, and other nations do, then we will lose the productivity edge \nthat is so important. And unfortunately, that appears to be happening. \nA recent study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment (OECD) found that the United States is now fourth in the \nworld in broadband deployment, behind Korea, Canada, and Sweden. And \nothers may pass us soon. While only 10 percent of U.S. households have \nbroadband access, some 20 percent of homes in Canada have it, as do an \nastonishing 50 percent of homes in South Korea. Japan and a number of \nEuropean countries have adopted very aggressive plans for broadband \ndeployment involving laying optical fiber to every home. We should be \nvery aware that if other countries do that--deploy fiber to all homes \nand businesses within their borders--and we continue to move very \nslowly even in the deployment of slower, current-generation broadband, \nthose other nations will gain a huge economic advantage over us.\n  I thus see the broadband tax credit as presenting us with a double \nopportunity. It would help provide much-needed economic growth. And it \nwill also help ensure that rural and underserved Americans can fully \nparticipate in an increasingly digital world.\n  Mr. SMITH. I wonder if I might interrupt my friend from West Virginia \nto make an observation. I think his point about competitive advantage \nis a very good one, and it is important for the Congress to remember \nthat it applies not only internationally but also domestically. And it \nis an issue that is important to both sides of the aisle. For example, \nthe Senate Republican High Tech Task Force--HTTF--has made the \nBroadband Tax Credit legislation a priority and a part of its policy \nagenda. This agenda states ``The Task Force understands that high speed \nInternet access has the power to transform how we use the Internet. \nEncouraging tax and regulatory policies that foster rapid, efficient, \nand competitive deployment of broadband and other important \ntechnologies to urban and rural areas will be crucial to ensure our \neconomic growth and technological competitiveness.'' The fact is, those \ncommunities that do not have broadband will invariably be at the \ndisadvantage to those that do. And unfortunately, the communities that \noften have little or no broadband service are rural and low-income \nareas. I know this matter is as important to my colleagues from \nMassachusetts and West Virginia as it is to me. The Senator from West \nVirginia and I both come from states with large rural areas, so our \nconstituents likely face a similar situation. In the rural areas of \nOregon, we have seen concrete evidence of the difference broadband \nmakes in a community's economic vitality. For example, in La Grande, \nOregon, in the eastern part of the State, gaining connection to a \nnearby fiber optic route in 1999 made it possible for the town to \npersuade ODS Health Plans to establish a call center/claims center \nthere. By contrast, other communities, such as Madras and Crook County, \nreport that they have both lost potential businesses because of lack of \nbroadband infrastructure.\n\n  The other thing I think we should mention is that in addition to \neconomic benefits from this technology, there are other important \nsocietal benefits. For example, telemedicine. I'm happy to say that \nOregon has been at the forefront of developing new and innovative \ntelemedicine programs. In LaGrande, which, again, is fortunate to have \na solid broadband infrastructure, it has been possible to develop a \nvery good program for the provision of rural mental health services. \nThe program is called RODEO NET and it's been making a difference in \nthe lives of rural Oregonians for some time. And the telemedicine \nprogram of the Central Oregon Hospital Network makes it possible for \ndoctors to consult with patients remotely and to receive the patients' \nradiologial images, sounds, records, and pharmacy information. But to \ndo this well, you need broadband. In fact, the average data speed used \nby RODEO NET is 768 kilobits per second, more than twenty times the \ntypical dial-up service in rural areas of the country. The problem is \nthat few rural communities have a broadband connection. And that is \nsomething we must overcome. This technology can greatly improve the \nquality of life for rural residents, and we should not allow some of \nthem to be deprived because they live in a more remote area.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. My friend is correct. I agree with him \nwholeheartedly. That is exactly the kind of application that will make \na big difference to my constituents and his, and I want to do \neverything I can to make it widely available across the United States.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I wonder if my friend is a aware of the trans-Atlantic \nsurgery that occurred last year, where a surgeon in New York operated \non a patient in France?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes, indeed As I recall, the New York doctor \nremotely controlled some kind of robotic arms there at the patient's \nlocation, and it came off without a hitch, I believe.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think that is one of the most fascinating things I've \never seen, and as one who has worked for years on healthcare issues, it \nmakes me even more committed to moving this broadband technology out \nacross the country as quickly as possible, because one needs a very \nhigh bandwidth connection for those kinds of applications. You cannot \ndo remote surgery over a narrow band connection.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Exactly right, and I think that this shows the \npotential that exists if broadband becomes ubiquitously deployed in \nthis country. When we can transmit massive amounts of data \ninstantaneously, the applications are limited only by our imaginations.\n  Mr. KERRY. I wonder if my friend from West Virginia would yield for a \ncomment at this point?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would be happy to.\n\n[[Page S3401]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator, and my colleagues from Massachusetts \nand Oregon. As you know, I feel very strongly about this legislation. \nMy staff and I spent a lot of time working with our former colleague \nSenator Moynihan, and with Senator Rockefeller and others back in 2000 \nwhen we were putting this bill together. We put a lot of brainpower \ninto this bill. We met with innumerable telecom companies and analysts \nand experts, working to craft a bill that provided real incentives, and \ndoing so in a technology neutral manner. I do not care what the \ntechnology is, as long as it can provide broadband, it should receive \nthe incentive. And I think this bill does that. It specifically \nanticipates copper wire, coaxial cable, terrestrial wireless and \nsatellite technologies. If they can deliver true broadband services, at \na measurable speed requirement, then they qualify for the credit. That \nis as it should be. It is the service we are after, not a specific kind \nof delivery system. So this bill sets the standards and lets all \ncompete equally. All they have to do is meet the speeds, and they get \nthe credit.\n  For the current generation technologies, it targets rural and low-\nincome areas. Those are the areas where the Federal Communications \nCommission has told us there is a problem with current generation \ndeployment. For the next generation technologies, it targets the entire \ncountry, with the exception of urban businesses. That is because, while \nnext generation broadband exists and is being deployed aggressively in \nsome Asian and European nations, it has scarcely been deployed at all \nin the United States.\n\n  I have a number of reasons for caring about broadband deployment. One \nis that I think we cannot allow the ``digital divide'' to continue, and \nthere is a digital divide with broadband deployment just as there is \nwith computer access and dial-up Internet access. In fact, the digital \ndivide with broadband deployment is almost certainly greater than with \ncomputers or dial-up. So as a matter of basic equity, I think we must \ntake quick action to deploy broadband across the nation.\n  I also care about this issue because it is crucial for our \ninternational competitiveness. As Senator Rockefeller mentioned \nearlier, the United States is falling behind in broadband deployment. \nThere is little disputing that fact. While some seem unconcerned about \nthat matter, I am very concerned about it. I think there is little \ndoubt that a nation with ubiquitous broadband will be more efficient \nand productive than a nation without it. And, the fact is, other \nnations are starting to outspend us on broadband infrastructure. Sweden \nhas set aside some $800 million on broadband deployment in rural areas \nof the country--a much smaller area than the United States, obviously. \nAnd they have already spent an undisclosed amount to build a fiber-to-\nthe-home system serving much of Stockholm, which is becoming a model \nfor the rest of Europe. Now France is following suit. It recently \nannounced that it will invest $1.5 billion on broadband infrastructure \nover the next five years, and much of it will probably be optical \nfiber, as in Sweden. In Japan, who knows how much the government is \ninvesting, but it is substantial. The investment is made through Nippon \nTelegraph and Telephone, which is supposedly an independent telephone \ncompany, but the majority ownership belongs to the Japanese government. \nIn any case, NTT is in the middle of a huge fiber-to-the-home project \nall over the country, so the investment is clearly very large. And \nlisten to this figure from South Korea. In Korea, the government is \nlaying out some $15 billion to provide an optical fiber connection to \n84 percent of homes by 2005. This legislation would invest only $540 \nmillion over 10 years. That is not a lot for a nation as large as the \nUnited States. But it is an important start, and we should pass it now \nand get the ball rolling.\n  Finally, I feel strongly about this legislation because I think it is \ncrucial for small business. As Chairman of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee I have an obligation to look out for that sector, and it is \nsomething I am passionate about. I am a former small businessperson \nmyself, and I know how difficult it can be for a small company to \ncompete with larger enterprises. Broadband can make that easier by \nincreasing the productivity of the small business and opening up new \nmarkets. The telecom analyst Scott Cleland--many of you know him from \nhis testimony here on the Hill on various occasions--wrote a short \npiece last year on the importance of broadband to small businesses. \nParaphrasing Mr. Cleland, he said this. First, that small businesses \nhave less access to broadband because they tend to locate outside the \nhigh-rent urban business centers. It's those urban business centers, he \nsays where broadband is most plentiful. The second point he makes, and \nthis is very important, is that we as a nation are losing as a result \nof this situation because small businesses tend to be a very \ninnovative, economy-driving force. If broadband were more widely \navailable to small businesses, Cleland says, the U.S. would benefit \neconomically.\n  Those are a few of the reasons why I feel very strongly about this \nlegislation, and I think it is imperative that we pass it this year and \nsend it to the president for signature. I am delighted that we are \nhaving this discussion today, and I look forward to working with all of \nyou to pass this bill at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I notice that we are joined on the floor by the \ndistinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, two \ngentlemen who have a lot to say about which tax legislation passes this \nbody. I am pleased that both are cosponsors of S. 88 and strong \nsupporters of technology measures. I wonder if I could ask them their \nthoughts on the likelihood of passing the broadband credit this year.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my friend from West Virginia, and I congratulate \nhim on his leadership on this legislation. I agree that broadband \ntechnology is extremely important for this country. It will help ensure \nthat our productivity remains high and that our citizens receive the \nbest services modern telecommunications have to offer. I think some of \nthese services that you have already discussed there today--\ntelemedicine, distance learning, and videoconferencing, for example--\nwill be absolutely life altering for many Americans. In rural areas, we \nwill find even more ways to use broadband--televeterinary services, \nremote monitoring of crops, remote livestock auctions, etc. The fact is \nthat when the underlying broadband infrastructure is there, you can do \namazing things with relatively simple equipment--a digital video camera \nand a computer. And, taking a moment to indulge a point of home-state \npride, I want to ask my colleagues if they know where this idea \noriginated? I see my colleague from Montana, and he is smiling. He \nknows where it came from.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Of course. From the Montana legislature, that's where. \nWe're very creative in Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Exactly. The State of Montana enacted the first broadband \ncredit in the nation in 1999. It was the brainchild of one of our \npublic utility commissioners, Bob Rowe, and of state senator Mignon \nWaterman and others in the legislature. It was in effect for only two \nyears, I believe, before being temporarily suspended, along with a \nnumber of other tax breaks, due to the State's budget shortfall. But in \nthe short time it was in effect, it had very positive results. I want \nto quote from an article by Bob Rowe in one of our State newspapers, \nThe Missoulian, in June 2001, in which Bob was describing the effect of \nthe Montana broadband credit:\n\n       The results are impressive. Dozens of projects were awarded \n     tax credits, most of them in rural Montana--places like \n     Circle, Crow Agency, Superior and Big Timber. Projects \n     included DSL, cable modems, and wireless. They also included \n     projects to provide `redundant' access that is critical to \n     many technology businesses in case service goes out.\n\n  Now as you might surmise, Circle, Montana is not a very big place. It \nhad 644 people in the last census. None of those communities mentioned \nin that article has more than 1,600 people. If a broadband credit can \nhelp bring broadband to rural communities like those, then it is a \nworthy piece of legislation. But the problem is, even when the Montana \nbroadband credit is reinstated, it will not be enough to ensure \nbroadband deployment to all communities in a State like Montana, so we \nwill need Federal incentives, too. And\n\n[[Page S3402]]\n\nthat is where measures like the federal broadband credit we are \ndiscussing now come in. It is important that we adopt this kind of \nincentive on a national basis, so that all communities may benefit from \nit. And along with the incentives that various States may enact, and \nalong with other measures like low-interest loans and grants and so \nforth, we can really accelerate broadband deployment to all communities \nin the country.\n  So I applaud the efforts of my friends who have worked so diligently \non this bill. I stand with you and am committed to moving this bill \nthis year. The support is clearly there, with 64 cosponsors in the \nSenate and 193 in the House. There aren't many bills with that much \nsupport. So I think the time has come. We need broadband, and we need \nit now, and I think this bill will help a great deal. We will work \ntogether to get it done this year.\n  I want to turn to the Senator from Iowa, my Ranking Member on the \nFinance Committee. I used to be his Ranking Member when he was \nChairman, and now the roles are reversed. But regardless of which of us \nis sitting in the Chairman's seat, we always confer with one another \nand work closely together, and I know he cares as much about getting \nbroadband technology out to rural areas as I do. Senator Grassley, do \nyou have any thoughts on this issue?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank my Chairman, and I appreciate the opportunity \nto speak on this topic. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator \nRockefeller's bill, and I think it is important legislation. As you \nprobably know, I have spent a fair number of hours on a farm in my \nlife, and I can tell you that telecommunications are absolutely a \ncrucial lifeline to rural areas, and we must ensure that rural areas of \nthe country are not left behind as the state of the art evolves. I \nthink that is what is happening now--the state of the art is evolving, \nand rural areas are being left behind. In urban areas, we have \nwonderful broadband systems where you can type at your computer and \nhave a little TV screen going up in one corner. A lot of people here \nwatch the Senate floor right from their computers as they work, which \nmakes our work easier and more productive. In rural areas that kind of \ncapability generally doesn't exist. And we just can't allow two \ndifferent telecom standards for urban and rural areas. That would be \nlike urban areas having telephones and rural areas not having \ntelephones. What kind of country would we be if that were the case? So \nI think this legislation is very important.\n  I want to point out one provision in this bill which will be \nextremely important to rural areas, and that is one involving telephone \ncooperatives. Anybody from a rural State knows the importance that \ncoops play in making sure no one goes unserved. There are some places \nthat are so scarcely populated that the big publicly-owned companies \ncan't justify the investment to their shareholders. So who gets the job \ndone in those places? By and large, it's the telephone coops. And they \ndo a great job, and we need to make sure we support them in their \neffort. But, of course, telephone coops are tax exempt organizations. \nSo the question arises, if they don't pay taxes, how will they benefit \nfrom a tax credit? But this bill has found a way to let them take \nadvantage of the benefit. How so? Through the so-called, ``85-15'' \nrule. The tax code requires that at least 85 percent of a telephone \ncoops' income be used to pay losses and expenses. So this bill exempts \nfrom income the amount of broadband credit a coop would get if it were \na taxable company. That encourages coops to make broadband investments \nbecause, if they do, then they will get help meeting the 85 percent \nrule. I think that makes a lot of sense and is good tax policy. It both \nencourages a crucial infrastructure investment, and simplifies the tax \nlaw for coops, which is an importannt thing to do anytime we can.\n\n  So with that, just let me say again that I support this legislation, \nand I will work with Chairman Baucus and Senator Rockefeller and the \nother members here today to pass it.\n  Mr. BURNS. I wonder if I might very briefly add a couple of points at \nthis juncture. I wanted to join my colleagues here on the floor today \nbecause I feel strongly about this measure. As Senator Baucus said \nearlier, this whole idea started in Montana, and we've seen the kind of \neffect it can have there, so I feel confident that a federal broadband \ncredit can have a similar effect in other areas of the country. The \nother point I wanted to make goes back to Senator Grassley's discussion \nof farming applications. I've spent a fair amount of time in \nagricultural pursuits myself, and if there is any doubt how \nagricultural organizations feel about broadband, you should take a look \nat the farm groups that have endorsed this bill. The American Farm \nBureau, American Agri-Women, National Cattlemens' Beef Association, \nNational Corn Growers Association, National Council of Farmer \nCooperatives, National Pork Producers Council, National Sorghum \nProducers Association, National Wheat Growers Association, North \nAmerican Export Grain Association, Rice Millers' Association, \nCalifornia Cotton Growers Association, California Cotton Ginners \nAssociation, Western Growers Association, U.S. Rice Producers' Group. \nThe list goes on and on. Anyone who thinks farmers don't care about \ntechnology should spend some time on a modern farm, and what you will \nlearn in that American agriculture is one of the most innovative \nindustries in the world. Let me give you an example. Deere and Company, \nthe farm equipment maker, is also a supporter of this legislation. And \nyou may think at first, ``Why do they care? They just make tractors.'' \nBut when you talk to them, you learn that the tractor of tomorrow--\nindeed of today--has a lot of high-tech equipment on board that, as it \ndrives through the fields, gathers information on plant conditions and \nsoil conditions and moisture content and so forth. And that is \nincredibly valuable information to a farming operation. But to really \nuse that information, you need a broadband connection to send it from \nthe tractor to, say, a plant specialist a hundred miles away. Without \nthat broadband connection, it will take a very long time to transmit \nthe data, which makes it a lot less useful. So we need to take action \nnow to get broadband networks built out all over the country, including \nthose little places like Circle and Superior and Big Timber and Crow \nAgency and thousands of communities like them around the United States. \nAnd this bill is going to help do that, so I a feel very strongly that \nwe need to pass it at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I would like to add a brief comment on this topic, which \nis of critical importance to my State of South Dakota. My colleagues \nhave all spoken eloquently about the role of broadband deployment to \nour Nation, and the special importance of ensuring that our rural areas \nhave equal access. I think we all agree that the widespread \navailability of broadband infrastructure is absolutely crucial to the \nfuture of America. Throughout history, we have found ourselves at \ncritical junctures, when the Federal Government has needed to step in \nand help build an intrastructure system that is national in scope. The \ntranscontinental railroad. Rural electrification. The Interstate \nhighway system. None of those would have occurred without help from the \nFederal Government. That, in my opinion, is one of the most important \naspects of our job--to know when it is time for the Government to step \nin and facilitate the building of something big, something that will \nbenefit the nation as a whole and make us a stronger nation. The \ntransport of large amounts of information is no less important today \nthan the transport of large amounts of goods was a few decades ago. The \nphysical transport of goods is still necessary, and probably always \nwill be. But the transport of information? Why should we have to \ntransport people just to transport information? If a supplier can meet \nwith his customer without driving across town or getting on an \nairplane, then that is better. If a rural American can meet with the \nurban medical specialist without driving or flying to the city, then \nthat is better. If a rancher can show his cattle for sale to a distant \nbuyer without the expense of transporting them to a sale barn, then \nthat is better. All of those things are theoretically possible today, \nbut they are possible in fact only to a few of our citizens. The \ndisturbing thing is, that other nations are moving ahead of us in \ndeploying broadband technology, as my colleagues have already pointed\n\n[[Page S3403]]\n\nout. I believe that if the United States is to continue to lead the \nworld economically, it must invest in broadband infrastructure.\n\n  That's why I will continue to fight hard to pass this legislation. I \nhave written the President about it, I have written the majority leader \nabout it, I have spoken to my colleagues on the Finance Committee about \nit, and now I want to address all of my Senate colleagues about this \nbill. The fact is, we need this legislation to push broadband out to \nremote areas of the country. There are areas where the market will not \ntake broadband for many years, if ever. But that is where this \nlegislation is targeted--those very areas the market is leaving behind. \nWe need this legislation to ensure, first of all, that rural areas are \nnot left behind, and secondly that we do not fall behind as a nation. \nWe must not continue to fall behind Korea, Canada, Sweden, Japan, \nSingapore and others, because if we do, then they will be able to work \nfaster and more productively than we can work, and it is productivity \nwhich has been our hallmark, our saving grace, our competitive edge for \nyears. The Internet was an American invention, as are the broadband \ntechnologies that accelerate its use. We must not let others surpass us \nin our own technology, simply through inaction. I urge my colleagues to \ntake up and pass this very crucial legislation this year--at the \nearliest opportunity. It is very important that we do so, and I pledge \nmy support for it here today.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator and welcome his support. I \nbelieve the Senator from New York wanted to join in the discussion, as \nwell.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank my friend from West Virginia. As an original \nco-sponsor on Senator Rockefeller's broadband tax credit bill and a \nsupporter of the amendment offered on the energy bill, and having \nintroduced my own bills to enhance broadband deployment in Upstate New \nYork and around the country, I join my colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle today to express strong support for legislation stimulating \nbroadband infrastructure deployment and demand for broadband services.\n  As we all know, our Nation's economy has suffered a slowdown of \nstaggering proportions in the last year. Investment has slowed, jobs \nhave been lost, and for many companies revenues continue to decline. \nFew sectors of our economy have been as dramatically affected as the \ntelecommunications and high-tech industry, with job loss estimates in \nthe industry exceeding more than a quarter-million in the past year \nalone. Of particular concern to me, Upstate New York, like rural areas \nacross America, has continued to face obstacles to full engagement in \nthe new knowledge-based economy. Prior to the recent downturn, the \neconomic growth of the last decade left behind many of our Nation's \nrural areas--like Upstate New York with its highly educated \npopulation--that remain disconnected from major markets. Studies have \nshown that New York lags behind many states when it comes to Internet \nconnections and usage that are essential to commerce and communications \nin this new economy.\n  To be sure, communications technologies are important not only for \neconomic reasons. My State of New York suffered more than any other \nfrom the devastating attacks of September 11th. On that day, emergency \ncalls, communications between loved ones, and demand for reliable \ninformation demonstrated so clearly our dependence on--and the need \nfor--telecommunications technologies. I am extremely proud of the \nefforts that were made by our rescue personnel, utilities, and others \nto restore the communications infrastructure that was so damaged by the \nterrorist activities. Those tragic events underscored the importance of \nredundant telecommunications systems to enable us to stay connected in \ntimes of national emergency.\n  The message here is that broadband deployment and its uses are key \nfor the continuing economic development and growth of our Nation. I \nrecently offered a sense-of-the-Senate, which was adopted on the FY \n2003 Budget Resolution passed out of the Budget Committee, that \nhighlights the needs for investments in broadband technology to spur \ndevelopment and job creation in rural and underserved areas. Mr. \nPresident, I ask that it be included in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Sense of the Senate Regarding Broadband Capabilities in Underserved \n                                 Areas\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds in the following:\n       (1) In many parts of the United States, segments of large \n     cities, smaller cities, and rural areas are experiencing \n     population loss and low job growth that hurts the surrounding \n     communities.\n       (2) The availability and use of broadband \n     telecommunications services and infrastructure in rural and \n     other parts of America is critical to economic development, \n     job creation, and new services such as distance learning, \n     telework capabilities and telemedicine.\n       (3) Existing broadband technology cannot be deployed or is \n     underutilized in many rural and other areas, due in part to \n     technical limitations or the cost of deployment relative to \n     the available market.\n       (4) Today's small and medium-sized businesses need an \n     extension program that provides access to cutting edge \n     technology.\n       (5) There is a need to create partnerships to reduce the \n     time it takes for new developments in university and other \n     laboratories to reach the manufacturing floor and to help \n     small and medium-sized businesses transform their innovations \n     into jobs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Congress should:\n       (1) facilitate the deployment of and demand for broadband \n     telecommunications networks and capabilities (including \n     wireless and satellite networks and capabilities) in rural \n     and underserved areas,\n       (2) encourage the adoption of advanced technologies by \n     small and medium-sized businesses to improve productivity, \n     and to promote regional partnerships between educational \n     institutions and businesses to develop such technologies in \n     the surrounding areas, and\n       (3) invest in research to identify and address barriers to \n     increased availability and use of broadband \n     telecommunications services in rural and underserved areas.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The broadband tax credit is a critical component of \nthis economic development plan, in order to get broadband to ``the last \nmile''--to the households, schools, businesses, local governments and \nmany others that stand most to gain from its deployment and, of course, \nthe jobs and services that are sure to follow.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I am delighted to have this opportunity to join my \ncolleagues in discussing the importance of the broadband tax credit \nlegislation. We have worked on this bill since mid-2000, and we need to \nget it passed this year.\n  I am particularly pleased to have worked with Senator Rockefeller on \nthis issue. He and I go way back on technology matters. We worked side \nby side to ensure that all our classrooms and public libraries are \nconnected to the Internet and modern technology through the E-rate, and \nthis successful program is beginning its fifth year of funding.\n  Just as the E-rate continues to ensure that our Nation's schools and \nlibraries are not divided between technological haves and have nots, we \nmust ensure that all of our Nation's homes and businesses--in both \nrural and urban areas--have access to broadband services. Because \nalthough dial-up services are good for sending e-mail, sharing short \ndocuments, and browsing the web slowly, you need broadband services if \nyou need to receive information quickly or send an item that is data-\nintensive, such as photographs, graphics, or lengthy documents.\n  While broadband is already being deployed in rural States, such as \nmine, I believe it is imperative that we seek to accelerate the rate of \nthis deployment. Because where are the homes and small businesses \nwithout broadband service? That's easy--in rural and low-income areas. \nAnd that is what this bill is designed to cover: the rural and low-\nincome areas where broadband generally is not already available. \nFurthermore, it is designed to help us move to the next generation of \nbroadband that some countries are already rolling out.\n  The bottom line is that there are times when it makes sense to help \nthe market deploy technology more quickly and this is one of those \ntimes. Why? Because the Government can play an important role in \nensuring that all our citizens have access to basic infrastructure, \njust as it ensured universal access to telephone service in the 1930s.\n  I will not repeat what my other colleagues have said about the United \nStates falling behind in broadband infrastructure, but it is a fact and \nit is something we cannot allow. We must engage on this issue and we \nmust do it now. As the lead Republican cosponsor\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\nof the legislation, I urge the passage of the broadband tax credit \nlegislation as one way to address this matter, and believe it should be \ndone this year. While there are a number of other ideas on the table \nconcerning broadband deployment, this is one that is ready to go, and \nwe should not wait any longer. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport moving this incentive as part of the next available tax package \nmoving through the Congress.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. I would like to return to the issue of exactly how we move \nthis year. I think it is the most substantial broadband initiative with \na real chance of passing in the near future, and I think we should be \nvery specific about how we are going to accomplish it. It is now mid-\nApril, the number of legislative days remaining in this Congress are \ndwindling, and the available tax vehicles would seem to be limited for \nthe rest of the year.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I couldn't agree more. As I said earlier, I think this \nwould be a very good addition to the energy bill because it has clear \nenergy savings implications. If that proves not to be possible, I think \nit should be included in any other tax bill that comes through this \nyear. Passing the broadband tax credit this year should be a priority \nfor the Senate and we must ensure its passage at our earliest \nopportunity.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Absolutely. I am with you 100 percent. We have to \nget this done, and we have to get it done this year. I note that the \nmajority leader has joined us on the floor and I wonder if we might \nimpose on him to give us his views on the prospects for the broadband \ntax credit.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator for his leadership on the broadband \ntax credit, and I thank all of our colleagues who have expressed their \nsupport for this measure today. As you know, I am a cosponsor of \nSenator Rockefeller's bill, S. 88, and share the strong support for \nthis bill expressed by our colleagues today.\n  We have made this a centerpiece of the Democratic high technology \nagenda. We believe broadband deployment is key to the continued \neconomic growth of the entire Nation, and is particularly critical in \nrural areas that studies have shown too often lag behind their urban \ncounterparts. This bill addresses that issue head-on by giving special \nincentives to rural deployment. This measure is one of a number of \nsolutions that have been proposed that will prove effective in \nachieving universal availability of the most advanced \ntelecommunications technology.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator from West Virginia, the \ndistinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, and \nall of our colleagues who have spoken out so forcefully today. I hear \nyou and share your support for this proposal. Given the large number of \ncosponsors, it is clear that the broadband credit can win approval in \nthis Chamber. So I would say to my colleagues that I want to move the \nbill at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. We appreciate the Leader's interest and support. \nWith that support, and that of all our colleagues who have joined us \ntoday, I feel confident that we will succeed in getting this bill \nenacted into law this year. And I am excited at that prospect, because \nI think it will make a big difference in moving broadband both to \nremote and underserved areas of the Nation, and also in moving it to \nthe next generation. That will be an outstanding result, and a great \nbenefit for the Nation.\n\n\n                       energy policy act of 2002\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would like to engage in a brief discussion with my \ncolleague from Alaska concerning an important provision that is missing \nfrom the electricity title of this bill. Would the ranking member of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski, agree \nthat it is important to provide a level playing field for competitors \nin the interstate wholesale electricity market?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes, I agree with my colleague.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Is today's interstate wholesale electricity market a \nlevel playing field, in which all competitors are subject to the same \nrules?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. No. Publicly-owned utilities are not subject to the \nsame oversight of their rates and other activities related to sales of \nbulk electricity in interstate commerce as investor-owned companies.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I see nothing in the current language of the electricity \ntitle of this bill to rectify this disparate treatment. This seems \nunfair, and contrary to our policy of promoting competitive markets in \ninterstate electricity sales. Would the Senator from Alaska agree?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes, I think that all utilities who substantially \nparticipate in the interstate wholesale electric power market should be \nunder the same regulatory regime, and subject to the same oversight by \nthe same regulator. But I also want to make clear that municipally-\nowned and cooperatively-owned utilities that are too small or not \nselling in interstate commerce, such as those in Alaska, should not be \nsubject to FERC regulation. I would oppose any attempt to extend such \nFederal regulation to these entities or their activities.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Senator for that viewpoint. Do not \nmisinterpret what we are saying. This is not about ``spreading the \npain'' around to everybody. Rather, what we are saying is that if a \nmunicipally-owned or cooperatively-owned utility makes a strategic \nbusiness decision to go into the competitive interstate bulk power \nmarket to earn profits, then it ought to play by the same rules as \neverybody else. And once they enter that market, it is important that \nthe market competition takes place on a level playing field, or else \ncompetition will be diminished and consumers will suffer. So I would \nlike to go forward, in conference, and work with my friend, Senator \nMurkowski, and others of like mind, to correct this situation and \nensure equal treatment for all who chose to compete in the interstate \nwholesale electricity market.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I look forward to working with the Senator from \nOklahoma on this issue as this bill moves to conference.\n\n\n                 energy efficient commercial buildings\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, Section 2105 of this legislation, the \nsection providing a tax deduction for construction of energy efficient \ncommercial buildings, does not list the specific building components \nthat will qualify the building. This is different from Section 2103, \npertaining to energy efficient residential property, in which items \ncontributing to building efficiency are listed in some detail. My \nconcern is that certain energy efficiency improvements, if not \nspecifically included, may not qualify for the deduction under Section \n2105. I was wondering if the Senator from Montana could clarify for me \nthe reasons behind the differences between these two sections.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator from Florida asks a reasonable question, but \nhe need not be concerned about the differences between these two \nsections. The commercial building deduction is constructed as a \nperformance-based incentive for energy efficiency. The bill does not \nspecify which materials should be used because different buildings may \nrequire different components to meet efficiency standards. Construction \nneed not adhere to a specific list of energy efficient components.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let me ask then about a specific building component so \nthat I can be certain I understand what the Senator has explained. \nBuilding insulation is not referenced in Section 2105, however it is \nreferenced in Section 2103. Nevertheless, expenditures for insulation \nin a commercial building will qualify for the deduction so long as it \nmeets the energy efficiency requirements laid out in this measure. Is \nthat accurate?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct. In fact, the efficiency \nrequirements laid out in this legislation essentially require that \nbuilding construction include a combination of highly energy efficient \nproperty. Energy efficient insulation would almost certainly be \nincluded among these components.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The origin of my concerns regarding the enumeration of \nspecific components stems from the language used to define energy \nefficient commercial building property expenditures at the beginning of \nSection 2105. It indicates that in order to qualify, energy efficient \nproperty must be eligible for treatment as depreciable property under \nsection 167 of the tax code. There are many building components, like \ninsulation, not specifically\n\n[[Page S3405]]\n\nreferenced in section 167. Can the Senator from Montana confirm that \nthe intention of this measure is not to exclude these components from \neligibility for the energy efficient commercial buildings deduction?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I can confirm for the Senator from Florida that the \nintention of this provision is to include all those components that \nwould produce levels of energy efficiency sufficient to meet the \nstandard laid out by this amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator for his clarification and his time.\n\n\n   impact of reformulated fuels provisions and need for appropriate \n discretion for adjustments to required baselines for anti-backsliding \n                              requirements\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues an important issue that relates to provisions in the \nEnergy bill dealing with reformulated gasoline. After a few brief \nintroductory remarks, I would like to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague and friend, the Chairman of the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, in order to inform and clarify the legislative record on \nthe matters I am about to discuss.\n  The provisions contained in Subtitle C of Title VIII of the Energy \nbill deal with motor fuels. As has been discussed on this floor on \npreceding days, these provisions deal with a number of issues, \nincluding a ban on the use of MTBE and requirements for use of ethanol \nin reformulated gasoline. I would like to speak today on another issue \nin this subtitle that has received less attention during our debate on \nthese issues, but which could have a profound and detrimental effect on \nthe supply of gasoline in New Jersey and elsewhere in the Northeast, by \naffecting an important supplier to this market.\n  Section 834 of Subtitle C eliminates the oxygen content requirements \nfor reformulated gasoline. It is necessary to do this since the \nsubtitle, in Section 833, Subsection (c), otherwise bans the use of \nMTBE, the oxygenate most commonly used to meet the oxygen content \nrequirements of the Clean Air Act. And while we have all become aware \nof the groundwater contamination problems caused by leaks of gasoline \ncontaining MTBE, it is important to understand for the situation I am \nabout to discuss that MTBE does provide significant benefits in regard \nto emissions of toxic air pollutants under current EPA models. Indeed, \noverall toxic air emissions reductions achieved through the use of \nreformulated gasoline substantially exceeded the minimum requirements \nset by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. I think we all agree with \nthe Blue Ribbon Panel's recommendation, that with or without MTBE, it \nremains an important goal to maintain the real world emissions benefits \nderived from the use of reformulated gasoline.\n  So when the authors of Subtitle C eliminated the oxygen requirement \nfor reformulated fuel and banned the use of MTBE, they also wanted to \nbe sure that the toxic air pollutant reductions achieved from the use \nof reformulated gasoline were maintained. Thus, they included the so-\ncalled `anti-backsliding' provisions found in subsection (b) of Section \n834. Among other things, subsection (b) will require the EPA \nAdministrator to . . . establish, for each refinery or importer . . . \nstandards for toxic air pollutants from use of the reformulated \ngasoline produced and distributed by the refiner or importer that \nmaintain the reduction of the average annual aggregate emissions of \ntoxic air pollutants for reformulated gasoline produced or distributed \nby the refiner or importer during calendar years 1999 and 2000.\n  This provision thus requires EPA to establish, for each refinery, the \namount of toxic air emissions from the gasoline based on 1999 and 2000 \ndata, and then establish that as a ``baseline,'' or maximum level of \ntoxic air emissions from the gasoline produced by that refinery.\n\n  What this provision doesn't do, is tell the refiner how to maintain \nthe baseline once MTBE is eliminated, it just has to do it. In most \ncases, refineries can meet the gap in toxic air emissions performance--\ncaused by the ban on MTBE--simply by doing little more than complying \nwith an already-existing separate regulation that requires them to \nreduce the levels of sulfur in the gasoline. Removing sulfur improves \nthe toxic air emissions performance of the gasoline as calculated by \nEPA. Or the refinery could invest in improved extraction technology to \nremove directly some of the toxics--for example, benzene. Or a larger, \nmulti facility refiner could trade between its refineries the credits \nfor emissions of toxic air pollutants authorized by the Subsection.\n  So, once the EPA Administrator establishes the baseline for a \nrefinery, most refiners have options that are available to ensure that \ntheir refineries do not `backslide' on the emissions of toxic air \npollutants from gasoline. For example, refiners that had high sulfur \nlevels during the base period will have a relatively easy time \ncomplying with this requirement for their reformulated gasoline, \nprimarily because they must desulfurize gasoline by 2004-2005 under \nalready existing rules, and this step will substantially reduce toxic \nair emissions, thus offsetting the increases in calculated emissions \nfrom eliminating MTBE.\n  But what happens under the Energy bill to the refiner who had \nvoluntarily taken steps, not required by any regulation, to incorporate \nstate-of-the-art benzene extraction technology and also removed a very \nlarge amount of the sulfur from its gasoline before the base period \nthat the EPA will use to establish its baseline? That refiner will be \ngiven a baseline that is far tougher than virtually any other refiner. \nIt is so tough, Mr. President, that when MTBE is banned, as required by \nthe bill, it likely will not be able to make up the lost benefit MTBE \nprovides--substantially lowering modeled emissions of air toxic \npollutants--by lowering sulfur to required levels or taking any other \nactions that will allow it to maintain that baseline performance level.\n  This is exactly the situation facing the Amerada Hess Corporation, a \ncorporate constituent in New Jersey that is an important supplier of \nreformulated gasoline. At its Port Reading, New Jersey refining \nfacility, Hess produces 35-50 thousand barrels per day of reformulated \ngasoline that is supplied to New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut. \nHess also supplies another 40-60 thousand barrels per day of \nreformulated gasoline into the northeast market from HOVENSA, a \nrefinery it partly owns on St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands. Both \nfacilities, the only two under the Hess umbrella, have long produced \nvery clean gasoline--taken together, the gasoline produced by these \nrefineries has almost 60 percent less sulfur and 35 percent less \nbenzene than the refinery industry average.\n  Once the EPA establishes baselines for these two refineries, and MTBE \ncomes out of the gasoline, they will have no realistic options to \nmaintain the baseline--exactly because the gasoline was already so \nclean. They can put in ethanol, but that does not have the same level \nof positive effect on toxic air emissions, compared to MTBE. They will \nlower sulfur further to 30 ppm, but in contrast to most other \nrefineries, this will not be enough to maintain the baseline, since the \ngasoline was already low in sulfur before and during the relevant base \nperiod. Benzene is already at very low levels, and further reductions \nare not reasonably achievable.\n\n  I will include in the record tables of data provided to me by Amerada \nHess that illustrates this result. They could buy credits, if they were \navailable, but this would allow refiners who did not take early action \nto clean up gasoline to obtain a competitive advantage.\n  The only reasonable way to address this situation, Mr. President--and \navoid penalizing a refiner by virtue of the fact that it took early \naction to clean its gasoline before it was required to do so--is to \nensure that the EPA Administrator has the ability and discretion to \nreview situations like this, and when necessary and appropriate, make \nadjustments to the refinery-specific baselines.\n  This notion of providing limited, necessary baseline adjustments is \nnot unprecedented. Indeed, EPA provided this form of relief just last \nyear on nearly identical facts. In that case, it was implementing the \nMobile Source Air Toxics, or MSAT, rule. That rule sets maximum levels \nof toxic air emissions from gasoline from baselines established using \ndata from the base years, 1998, 1999, and 2000. It is thus nearly \nidentical to the anti-backsliding provisions of Subtitle C--it only \ndiffered in\n\n[[Page S3406]]\n\nthat it covered all fuel, conventional and reformulated, and looked to \ndata from one more base year, 1998.\n  In that case, Mr. President, Hess faced the same situation in which \nit finds itself in this instance for its gasoline supplies form Port \nReading and HOVENSA, except that the reason MTBE was going to be \nunavailable on a going forward basis was state-enacted bans on its use \nin New York and Connecticut. In this case, it is federal law that will \nban the use of MTBE. So the result in the MSAT rule situation should be \nthe same when the provisions of this bill go into effect. In the case \nof the MSAT rule, EPA agreed that once the state MTBE bans went into \neffect, EPA would make an appropriate adjustment to the baselines for \nthe Port Reading and St. Croix refineries to reflect their unique \nsituation.\n  The adjustment was based on EPA's finding that the reformulated \ngasoline which these refineries produce significantly outperforms the \nindustry average for toxic air emissions, and that MTBE bans would \naffect the modeled toxics performance. The purpose of this relief, \nquite simply, was to level the playing field, so that a refiner that \ntook steps to clean up its gasoline early could continue to supply \ngasoline when MTBE is eliminated. I will enter into the Record a copy \nof the letters from EPA laying out the details of EPA's resolution of \nthis problem.\n  My purpose today is therefore twofold. I first wanted to bring this \nmatter to the attention of the Senate. It would be a travesty if we \nwere to enact legislation that penalized parties for taking early \naction to improve the environmental performance of their product. And I \nshould hasten to add here, Mr. President, that based on every \nconversation I or my staff have had on this matter, we have been \nassured that this was an unintended consequence. So my second purpose, \nMr. President, is to ensure that the record on this legislation \nprovides sufficient guidance to EPA in order that it can address this \nmatter effectively.\n  For these reasons, I would like to engage the Chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, the Senator from Vermont, in a \ncolloquy on this issue.\n  As discussed in my remarks, EPA had the requisite authority and \ndiscretion under the MSAT rule to make limited, appropriate adjustments \nto refinery-specific baselines for toxic air emissions based on unique \ncircumstances such as those facing Amerada Hess. Would you agree that \nEPA would enjoy a similar level of discretion under the anti-\nbacksliding provisions of Subtitle C of Title VIII if and when the \nEnergy bill, or any other bill that carries similar provisions, becomes \nlaw?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I appreciate the Senator from New Jersey bringing this \nmatter forward at this time. As he noted, the last thing we want to do \nin this statute is to penalize--advertently or inadvertently--those \nparties that take early action voluntarily to improve the environmental \nperformance and public health benefits of the products they produce, in \nthis case, reformulated gasoline.\n  Based on the facts that the Senator has presented and as they have \nbeen presented to me and my staff, it appears that Amerada Hess and \nHOVENSA could be disadvantaged if the anti-backsliding provisions of \nthe bill were implemented without consideration of the factors that you \nhave outlined. And, this situation could lead to a less competitive \nmarket in the Northeast, potentially driving up prices.\n  It seems reasonable that refineries such as you have described, which \nhave worked out an understanding of an appropriate adjustment with EPA \nin the context of the implementation of rule on mobile sources of air \ntoxics, should be able to proceed in a similar fashion when the \nprovisions relative to reformulated fuels--particularly, the anti-\nbacksliding provisions in Section 834--are implemented. EPA has \ninformed my staff that they would interpret the provisions in question \nas providing them with adequate authority to do so. It would seem \nlogical that such authority would be used as it was in the case of the \nrule, regardless of whether the situation is a state ban or a Federal \nban on MTBE.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I very much appreciate the Chairman's answer, and \nbelieve that EPA should be able to retain and incorporate existing \nbaseline adjustments granted under the MSAT rule into the baselines \nthat will be established under Section 834(b).\n  I wonder whether the Chairman could answer another question in this \nregard. If the MTBE ban proposed in S. 517 takes effect before or \nsupersedes the implementation of existing state MTBE bans, is S. 517 \nintended to negate baseline adjustments that refer to or are based upon \nthose state laws?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. As the Senator knows, there is no Federal preemption of \nState law contained in the Subtitle C. In fact, Section 833 of the \nbill, in Subsection (d), states specifically that enactment of the \nfederal MTBE ban contained in the preceding subsection will ``have no \neffect on the law in effect on the day before the date of enactment if \nthis Act regarding the authority of States to limit the use of [MTBE] \nin motor vehicle fuel.'' And Section 834, in which the anti-backsliding \nprovisions are contained, includes a savings clause (Subsection (d)) \nthat states ``[n]othing in this section is intended to affect or \nprejudice any legal claims or actions with respect to regulations \npromulgated by the Administrator prior to enactment of this Act \nregarding emissions of toxic air pollutants from motor vehicles.''\n\n  Taken together, these provisions are a clear indication that it is \nthe intent of the Senate not to preempt the state laws that were the \ncause for the baseline adjustment granted under the MSAT rule or to \naffect any legal claims or actions related to the MSAT regulations, \nincluding the sections in that rule providing for baseline adjustments. \nFurthermore, as I observed in my prior response, fairness would dictate \nthat the result should be the same whether MTBE is banned as a result \nof this bill or as a result of state law.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I again thank the distinguished chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee for his comments and perspective \non this issue, as this is a very important issue for my State and \nregion.\n  Mr. President, New Jersey is the largest user of reformulated \ngasoline in the Northeast. Hess--through the Port Reading and Virgin \nIslands refineries--supplies about 13 percent of the reformulated \ngasoline used in the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut region. Production \nfrom Hess's Port Reading refining facility alone translates to 14-20 \npercent of New Jersey's total gasoline consumption. My office is \nadvised that if S. 517 does not allow EPA to retain existing MSAT \nbaseline adjustments or grant new ones, it will constrict the ability \nof its Virgin Islands joint venture facility to manufacture \nreformulated gasoline and may cause Port Reading to close. The \nreformulated gasoline supplied by these two refineries, as I noted \npreviously, today has almost 60 percent less sulfur and 35 percent less \nbenzene than the refinery industry average and would be replaced by \nother suppliers, who would supply less clean gasoline on average. \nMoreover, New Jersey could lose a major employer in the form of Port \nReading which, in addition to producing clean gasoline, has been \nidentified as among the top environmental performers for refineries in \nthe country in Environmental Defense's most recent rankings.\n  As a matter of sound environmental policy, refiners who voluntarily \ncleaned up gasoline by removing dirtier components before the baseline \nperiod should certainly not be put in a worse position than refiners \nwho waited until regulations forced them to reduce toxic air emissions. \nNor should such refiners reap a windfall under S. 517 by having clean \nrefiners end up buying credits from them to stay in business.\n  I greatly appreciate the interest my Chairman on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee has shown on this issue, and hope we can work \ntogether, along with other interested Senators, to remedy this \nsituation on this and any future legislation that may carry similar \nprovisions.\n\n\n                       Private Use Clarification\n\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of \nthe Senate Finance Committee in order to discuss an issue that I know \nthe chairman, the ranking member of the committee and their staffs have \nbeen attempting to address for some time. Specifically, we all know \nthat the electric industry is undergoing significant\n\n[[Page S3407]]\n\nchange However, certain tax provisions, drafted long ago, appear to \nobstruct the current restructuring of the industry. The Senate Finance \nCommittee has attempted to better understand these tax and non-tax \nconflicts in the rapidly changing national energy environment by \ndirecting the Department of the Treasury to conduct an ongoing study of \nthe issue and report back to the tax-writing committees on an annual \nbasis with legislative recommendations. In addition, the manager's \namendment to the tax title to the energy bill before us on the floor \nhas provisions that will facilitate restructuring for cooperatives and \ninvestor-owned utilities.\n  Public power utilities need to know how they can operate in this new \nenvironment. This guidance is especially critical given the lack of a \nlegislative solution to modernize Federal ``private use'' tax laws \npassed in the mid-1980s. I rise today to suggest two mechanisms that \nwill provide very limited, but necessary, guidance for public power \nutilities. I believe both of these mechanisms can be addressed either \nthrough administrative guidance or legislation.\n  First, the report of the Senate Finance Committee urges the \nDepartment of the Treasury to finalize as quickly as possible \nregulations relating to the definition of private activity bond for \npublic power entities. In adopting these regulations, the committee \nhopes that the Treasury will use its regulatory authority to provide \nflexibility to foster the participation of public power in a \nrestructured electric industry. I believe that finalization of the \nregulations is important.\n  I further believe that flexibility may be provided in the regulations \nby, among other measures, lengthening the term of the short-term output \ncontract exception to 5 years; providing specific, more flexible \nguidelines for utilities to replace load lost from participating in the \nopen access of their transmission facilities; and allowing the advance \nrefunding of bonds used to finance transmission facilities used in open \naccess or regional transmission organizations. I would hope that the \nlegislative history to the tax title to the energy bill would urge the \nTreasury Department to consider adopting these items to the greatest \nextent possible when the private activity regulations are finalized.\n  Second, public power utilities historically finance aggregate \ngeneration, transmission and distribution needs with tax-exempt debt \nand electric system revenues, equity. Moreover, these construction \nneeds are often financed on a system, versus a project, basis. This \nmeans that each dollar of borrowing is not tied to a dollar investment \nin specific projects. This is a common utility practice, but one that \ncomplicates the ability to manage private use limitations in the \ncurrent environment.\n  Current law does not provide specific guidance in this area, though \nthe Internal Revenue Service has issued individual private letter \nrulings to entities other than utilities that have sought clarification \non the ability to allocate private business use to equity. \nUnfortunately, the private letter ruling process can be lengthy, \nadministratively cumbersome and not viable were a large number of \nutilities to pursue this remedy. A modest solution to this issue would \nbe to provide that the portion of a public power utility's system that \nis financed with amounts other than tax exempt-debt can be used without \nregard to private use limitations. Public power systems then have a \nstrong incentive to finance projects with equity or taxable debt rather \nthan tax-exempt bonds.\n  Specifically, language to provide broad guidance in this area could \nstate:\n\n       If, after first allocating private business use contractual \n     sales to the portion of electric output facilities financed \n     with equity or taxable debt, the remaining amount of such \n     contracts, if any, when allocated to the tax exempt bond-\n     financed portion of the facilities would not cause the \n     private business use test to be exceeded, then the private \n     business use limitations are deemed not to have been \n     exceeded.\n\n  I have been informed by the Treasury Department that they believe \nthat they have the authority to address this issue and are working on \npublished guidance in this area. Unfortunately, the Treasury and the \nInternal Revenue Service have been working on comprehensive allocation \nregulations for some time and guidance is needed now. Therefore, I \nwould again hope that whatever legislative history that emerges with \nrespect to the tax title to the energy recognize the ability of a \npublic power system to allocate its equity to investments in as \nflexible a manner as possible.\n  I hasten to add that these two suggestions do not provide a \ncomprehensive fix to the numerous technical private use problems that \nrequire the attention of this body. However, it will provide necessary \nguidance to public power utilities at a time when managing private use \nhas become increasingly challenging due to industry events. Moreover, \nthey will not upset the competitive balance in the industry.\n  I ask the distinguished Chairman of the Committee on Finance if I can \ncount on him to support language with respect to these two items in any \nreport that this body or the conference may issue.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator from Arizona can count on my support in \nensuring that guidance with respect to the finalization of regulations \nrelating to the definition of private activity bonds for public power \nentities is provided at the earliest opportunity and most certainly in \nconference. Regarding the ability to allocate private business use to \nequity, I look forward to working with my colleague to fashion an \nappropriate remedy for this important issue.\n\n\n           NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT SERVICE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, section 1601 of title XVI of this bill \nwould establish a National Science and Technology Assessment Service to \ndevelop information for Congress relating to the uses and application \nof technology to address current national science and technology policy \nissues. Everyone in this body appreciates that the science and \ntechnology policy issues that we face today are diverse and complex. \nClearly there is a need for some reliable means for Congress to receive \ntimely, unbiased information on such matters.\n  However, I am concerned that the details of the organizational \nstructure being proposed in this section have not been fully vetted. No \nhearings were held on the proposal. Many of those interested are not \nlocked into this particular design proposal, but feel that there is a \nvalid need for such an organization. I hope that we can revise the \ntitle XVI provisions to ensure that it meets the needs of Members. Many \nof us recall the former Congressional Office of Technology Assessment \nwhich was abolished in 1995 over concerns about its ability to provide \ntimely information to Members of Congress. Oftentimes their reports \nwere released after a vote on a particular issue, rendering them \nuseless from a Congressional standpoint. There were also concerns that \nthe office had grown to be much larger than originally anticipated. By \nthe time the office was abolished, it had grown to have an annual \nbudget of approximately $22 million and had over 200 employees. The \ncost of an average report was around $400,000.\n  I believe that the authors of this title XVI intend that the \nassessment service be an unbiased, nonpartisan entity whose reports and \nrecommendations would be widely accepted by the Congress. To create \nsuch an entity with instant credibility, requires an open process for \nconsidering different approaches to structuring it. Without this \nopportunity and process, the established service may not be received as \na reliable non-partisan entity. Without such a reception, the service \nwould be essentially useless.\n  Although I have filed an amendment that would delete this title from \nthe bill, I am hereby withdrawing that amendment. I hope to work with \nthe chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, to further \nreview the provision while the Energy bill is in conference with the \nHouse. I urge Senator Hollings to hold hearings on this proposal to \nallow for an open debate on the needs and benefits of the congressional \nservice. I further urge the chairman to engage other committees and \nMembers in these discussions.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for his comments \nand his willingness to work with me on this issue. The need for \nreliable, sound advice to Congress on scientific and technology issues \nhas never been greater. Many of the issues that we tackle every day \ninvolve some scientific or technological element.\n\n[[Page S3408]]\n\n  Congress needs to be sure that it can avail itself of excellent \nscientific analyses on complex issues. The advice that we were able to \nreceive in the past from the Office of Technology Assessment on such \nissues as climate change and homeland security is sorely missed. As \nSenator McCain noted, any assessment service for the Congress needs to \nbe non-partisan and effective. I look forward to discussions with the \nranking member of the Commerce Committee, as well as other members of \nthe Senate, regarding the proposed structure of the National Science \nand Technology Assessment Service and possible changes to that \nstructure.\n\n\n                      Request for Tax Modification\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have long been interested in providing a \nmodification in the tax law allowing a historic hotel in my State to be \nrestored and used as housing for lower income elderly people. \nUnfortunately, as the chairman knows, the tax laws often determine the \nviability of the project and this modest sized project is more complex \nthen most of its size.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Iowa's \nconcern and his persistence. However, because the provision is not an \nenergy tax proposal, it is not appropriate for it to be included in \nthis energy bill. But I do want the Senator to know that there is \nsympathy for the proposal, and I do plan to consider its inclusion on \nan appropriate measure in the near future.\n\n\n      development of high temperature superconductor technologies\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would like to pose a question to my esteemed colleague \nfrom New Mexico, who serves as the chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. It is my understanding that the Energy Policy Act \nof 2002 contains language that will direct the Secretary of Energy to \nconduct research and development activities regarding enhanced \nrenewable energy. Within that language's provisions for electric energy \nsystems and storage, there exists language that directs the Secretary \nof Energy to undertake demonstration projects to further the \ndevelopment of high temperature superconducting, HTSC, technology. I am \nseeking the chairman's assistance in clarifying the specific factors \nand goals that are meant to be associated with these demonstration \nprojects.\n  It is my understanding that the HTSC technology demonstration \nprojects, which may include HTSC cables, fault current limiters, and \npower transformers, are meant to focus on the development of second \ngeneration YBCO-based superconductors that will make several \nsignificant contributions to the electrical system. Furthermore, the \nhigh temperature superconductor technology demonstration projects \nshould also have a minimal adverse impact on the environment and land \nuse, and produce environmental benefits by reducing reliance on oil as \na cooling agent in electric power devices and reducing harmful \nemissions caused by fossil-fuel-powered generating plants.\n  I would like to know if the Senator from New Mexico agrees with my \ninterpretation of the language in the Energy Policy Act of 2002.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I respond to my colleague from New York by stating that \nI do in fact share his understanding of the intent of the language \nrelating to HTSC research in the Energy Policy Act of 2002.\n\n\n                oil and gas development on public lands\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to engage in a colloquy with Senator \nFeingold and me with respect to oil and gas development on Federal \nlands, an issue that is very sensitive for Americans right now. There \nare areas on public lands where we can develop oil and gas resources in \na responsible way. But we should not take this fact as a green light to \ndegrade environmentally sensitive lands, which should be preserved for \ngenerations to come. We need to recognize that the Secretary of the \nInterior, as the steward of our public lands, must consider a range of \nfactors when developing and use plans for public lands. The Secretary \nof the Interior is not just in the business of energy--lands \nadministered by the Bureau of Land Management are multiple use lands \nand the Secretary is required to take many factors into consideration \nwhen developing land use plans, including the recreation, range, \ntimber, minerals, watershed, wildlife and fish, and natural, scenic, \nand historic values.\n  The Bureau of Land Management has authority to lease public lands for \noil and gas development under the authority of the Mineral Leasing Act, \nand this authority is referenced in section 602 of the energy bill. \nHowever, before the BLM exercises its authority, I believe that it is \nimportant that the secretary consider the characteristics of the land, \nincluding whether the land exhibits wilderness characteristics. For \nexample, section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act requires \nthe Secretary to consider ``any adverse environmental effects'' and \n``any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources'' that \nwould result from proposed agency actions. In addition, section 202 of \nthe Federal Land Policy and Management Act requires the Secretary to \ndevelop and maintain land use plans for public lands administered by \nthe BLM, using and observing the principles of multiple use and \nsustained yield, and among other criteria, ``giv[ing] priority to the \ndesignation and protection of areas of critical environmental \nconcern.'' Does the Senator from New Mexico agree that section 602 of \nthe Energy Policy Act does not change the Secretary's obligation to \ncomply with all laws and regulations applicable to the BLM's onshore \noil and gas program, including applicable requirements under NEPA, \nFLPMA, and other laws designed to protect environmental values and \nsensitive areas on public lands?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The Senator from Illinois is correct. Section 602 \nsimply states that in order to ensure timely action on oil and gas \nleases and applications for permits to drill on lands otherwise \navailable for leasing, the Secretary of the Interior is required to \nensure expeditious compliance with the requirements of section \n102(2)(C) of NEPA, improve consultation and coordination with the \nStates, improve the collection of information related to such leasing \nactivities, and improve inspection and enforcement activities related \nto oil and gas leases. The section also authorizes appropriations to \nthe secretary. Section 602 does not change any requirements under \ncurrent law applicable to the management of public lands, including any \nrequirements imposed by NEPA, FLPMA or any other applicable law.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the chairman. It is my understanding that the \ncurrent BLM policy requires the agency to consider activities on lands \nproposed for special designations, such as Areas of Critical \nEnvironmental Concern and Wilderness Study Areas, and, subject to valid \nexisting rights, to avoid approval of proposed actions that could \ndegrade the values of potential special designations. Does the Chairman \nagree that section 602 does not affect this policy?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The Senator from Illinois is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The Senator may be aware that citizens' groups have \npetitioned the BLM to review several million additional acres for \nwilderness designation, but these lands are largely not protected from \noil and gas development. The BLM's ``Wilderness Inventory and Study \nProcedures'' manual requires the BLM review wilderness recommendations \nreceived from the public, and to make a determination as to whether \nthere is a reasonable probability that the area in question may have \nwilderness characteristics. If the BLM determines that the area may \nhave wilderness characteristics, and if actions are proposed that could \ndegrade the wilderness values, the BLM ``should, as soon as \npracticable, initiate a new land use plan or plan amendment to address \nthe wilderness values.'' Does the chairman agree that section 602 does \nnot alter this policy, that the BLM must review wilderness proposals it \nreceives from the public?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The Senator is correct, Section 602 does not change any \nexisting requirements or policies, including the potential wilderness \nreview policy.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n            Protecting Leases on the Outer Continental Shelf\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment that I have \nbeen working on with several of my colleagues for some time now. The \namendment is based on S. 1952, a bill that would reacquire and \npermanently protect certain leases on the Outer Continental Shelf off \nthe coast of California by issuing credits that can be used to\n\n[[Page S3409]]\n\ndevelop energy resources elsewhere in the country.\n  As you know, for decades, Californians have opposed oil and gas \ndrilling along their coasts. We vividly remember the horrific oil \nplatform rupture and oil spill that occurred off the coast of Santa \nBarbara in 1969. The ecological implications of that spill and the many \nother spills and leaks associated with the rigs that are currently \nalong our coast are still being felt by Californians living along the \ncoast.\n  Unfortunately, 36 more leases off our coast remain eligible for oil \nand gas development and four additional leases remain in legal limbo.\n  That is the last thing Californians want or need.\n  In fact, the State of California has taken the Department of the \nInterior to court over whether the State has the ability to deny these \nleases. I strongly support the State in this effort and have joined \nRepresentative Capps of California in filing an amicus brief in support \nof the State's position.\n  I believe every State should have the right to deny oil and gas \ndevelopment off their shores, as offshore activities inevitably impact \nthe people and resources that are onshore. Last year, I reintroduced \nlegislation, the Coastal States Protection Act, to place a moratorium \non new drilling leases in Federal waters that are adjacent to State \nwaters that have a drilling moratorium. That bill, however, addresses \nonly future leases.\n  With regard to the undeveloped existing leases off of California's \ncoast, I believe a proactive approach is needed. These leases are in \nthe midst of protracted and contentious litigation. I do not believe, \nhowever, that any interests are best served by waiting for the courts \nto sort this out. I have been approached by California lessees that \nwant out of California. I want them out; the State wants them out; and \nthe people of California want them out. Instead of hoping the courts \nreach the same solution, I think it vital that we seek legislative \naction to eliminate any threat of future drilling off California's \nshores and remedy this situation as soon as possible.\n  That is why I have continued to work on this language with my \ncolleagues to find a compromise that would protect the fragile \nenvironment off the California coast and at the same time redirect the \nfinancial resources for energy production to other areas where it can \nbe used to meet our country's energy needs.\n  In short, we are working to rid California of unwanted drilling, end \na protracted legal battle in which nobody wins, and free the financial \nresources of the lease owners so that they may produce energy \nelsewhere. Our goal is a win-win situation.\n  However, this is a new idea that has significant implications and we \nhave not yet been able to work fully through all of the details. For \nthat reason, I will not offer this amendment to the Energy Bill and \nwill instead try to build consensus around this concept. I am committed \nto continuing to work on this issue with my colleagues because I know \nthey too are committed to the same goal.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with the goal \nof the Senator from California. One of the California lessees has their \nheadquarters in Colorado. I know that this company has wasted a great \ndeal of time, money and effort in the unproductive leases off the coast \nof California. It is time for this company to be allowed to recoup its \ncosts so that they can be redirected to more promising development \nopportunities elsewhere.\n  We need to enhance our domestic energy production in the interest of \nnational security, and so we have to find a way to reconcile the \ncompeting interests of the California environmentalists, the Department \nof the Interior and the oil companies. We can all agree that our nation \nneeds to produce more energy and that we must do so in environmental \nsensitive ways. However, the owners of the leases have had their hands \ntied in California for 20 or more years to no one's satisfaction. It is \ntime to move on, so that both important national goals can be met.\n  I applaud the efforts of Senator Boxer to continue to seek a \ncompromise that balances the environmental concerns with the need to \nfairly compensate the companies for their leases so they can redirect \ntheir efforts toward the production of more energy for our nation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President there is no aggressive advocates on this \nissue than Senator Boxer. I am willing to continue working with her to \nsee if there is a solution that addresses the environmental concerns of \nher state, the concerns of the oil and gas industry, and the need to \ndevelop additional energy resources. I also want to thank the Senator \nfor her willingness to put their issue aside for now so that consensus \ncan be reached. I am hopeful that through continued efforts we will be \nable to achieved that consensus.\n\n\nComprehensive studies of Shallow Underground Structures Holding Natural \n                                  Gas\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would like to pose a question to my esteemed \ncolleague from Kansas. It is my understanding that there was a terrible \naccident involving the death of several people in Kansas from the \nleakage of natural gas from a shallow underground storage structure. As \na result, you are offering a noncontroversial amendment to authorize \nthe Department of Energy to conduct a detailed study on the engineering \nand geology aspects of these shallow underground structures so that \ntheir safety can be assessed on a rigorous basis. I appreciate my \ncolleague's desire to work with me on addressing this issue in \nconference. I agree with him that it can be dealt with in the \nconference appropriately without taking up valuable Senate floor time.\n  I would just like to clarify that as this Energy Policy Act of 2002 \nmoves into conference, if the good Senator from Kansas that it might be \nappropriate to move some of the detailed language under your \namendment's section (c) to the subsequent conference report so that it \ngives the proper guidance and intent to the deparment?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank my good colleague from New Mexico for \nunderstanding the reason why this amendment is important to not only my \nstate but the safety of future underground shallow gas structures in \nthe entire U.S. I look forward to working with him and the Senate \nconferees on the energy bill to ensure the proper report language is in \nthe conference report based on the legislative language in my \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3185\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on April 22, I submitted amendment No. 3185 \nwhich addresses service obligations of load-serving entities. This \namendment gives specific direction to FERC in exercising that \nauthority. It amends title II of S. 517 to require FERC to ensure that \nutilities with service obligations are able to retain existing firm \ntransmission rights in order to meet those obligations.\n  This amendment allows FERC to go forward with its program to \nestablish a standard market design for wholesale electric markets while \nat the same time ensuring that transmission owners and holders of firm \ntransmission rights under long-term contracts are able to retain \nsufficient transmission rights to meet their service obligations under \nFederal, State, or local law, and thereby to protect retail customers.\n  This amendment has been reviewed by the Administration, FERC and a \nnumber of key participants in the electric restructuring debate. I \nbelieve we have some agreement on the concept, but need more time to \nwork out the language. Accordingly, I am not offering the amendment now \nbut would like to work with the managers of the bill to come up with an \nacceptable version.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from Arizona for bringing this \nvery imporatnt concept to our attention. We very much want to work with \nhim to develop an acceptable service obligation amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator from Arizona for not pursuing his \namendment at this time, and I agree to work with him to try to find an \nacceptable solution. To further this effort, I am willing to hold a \nhearing on the matter.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the \nenergy package the Senate will pass contains a solution to the MTBE \nproblem. This comprehensive MTBE legislative package protects our \ndrinking water while preserving air quality and minimizing negative \nimpacts on gasoline prices and supply. Solving the MTBE has been one of \nmy top priorities for over two years. My legislation\n\n[[Page S3410]]\n\nwas voted out of committee both last Congress and this Congress, and I \nam pleased that it was finally passed by the full Senate.\n  As Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I held a \nfield hearing in Salem back in April 2001 to hear from the folks in New \nHampshire about their MTBE problems. I have come to the floor on \nseveral occasions to speak specifically about New Hampshire families \nand small businesses that have been impacted by MTBE contamination. I \nhave visited with many of my constituents who suffer with MTBE \ncontaminated wells.\n  The Miller family--Christina and Greg, and their son Nathan--live in \nDerry, New Hampshire. This young family has been struggling for over \nthree years with the MTBE contamination in their well. I spent time at \nthe Four Corners Store and surrounding homes in the Town of Richmond, \nNew Hampshire. Although the store's underground storage tanks are in \ncompliance with the law, an MTBE plume persists from a tank that leaked \nyears ago. This plume has contaminated a number of private wells of the \nhomes near the Four Corners Store. The Goulas and Frampton families who \nlive close to the Four Corners Store, were kind enough to invite me \ninto their homes, and show me the massive treatment system that had \nbeen installed by the State. I am very pleased that I can tell these \nfamilies and many others in New Hampshire that we are one important \nstep closer to having an effective solution to the MTBE problem.\n  Specifically, this legislation bans MTBE; provides money for the \ncleanup of MTBE; eliminates the oxygen mandate in the RFG program, and \nmaintains the current level of air quality protection. Additionally, \nthe legislation requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to \nconduct an expedited review of state petitions to suspend the oxygen \nmandate in the RFG program. If the EPA fails to complete the review of \na State petition within 30 days, the petition will automatically be \ngranted. This provision could allow New Hampshire to begin to eliminate \nMTBE from the fuel system even before the oxygenate mandate is lifted.\n  Finally, the language includes $2 million for the research of \ntechniques to cleanup bedrock contamination and to establish a \nclearinghouse for sharing the information. According to Dr. Nancy \nKinner, a scientist from the University of New Hampshire, tracking and \ncleaning up MTBE in fractured bedrock is one of the greatest challenges \nwe face as a result of MTBE leaks. This research will help to address \nthat problem.\n  Mr. President, this was not an easy compromise to reach, but we have \ncome together on an effective solution. I want to thank Senator Daschle \nfor including my MTBE legislation in this energy package from the \nbeginning of this process. I would also like to thank the Majority \nLeader for working so hard with me and other members to hammer out a \ncompromise package and ensuring passage. Senators Murkowski, Inhofe, \nand Voinovich were in tough positions but they worked tirelessly to \ncome to this agreement--without them, we could not have solved the MTBE \nproblem. I would also like to thank the stakeholders, including the \nrefiners, ethanol producers, and environmental groups--all of whom have \nworked with me over the last few years to reach a consensus.\n  Last, I would like to thank all the Senate staff who worked on this \npackage. Specifically, I would like to mention David Conover, Chris \nHessler, Melinda Cross, Eric Washburn, Chris Miller, Alison Taylor, \nJanine Johnson, Dan Kish, Jamie Karl and Andy Wheeler. I am pleased \nthat this comprehensive solution is supported by so many of my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the energy bill that we will pass today is \nnot the most perfect bill--there are a number of things in this bill \nthat I don't like. What we will pass today is the product of two months \nof debate and changes, and it is a compromise. It offers the basis for \na comprehensive and balanced plan to address the energy needs of this \ncountry.\n  Anyone who drives a car or pays an electric bill knows that over the \npast two years there have been huge fluctuations in oil and gas prices. \nThe bill that will pass the Senate today by a bipartisan vote will \nincrease energy supplies--fossil fuels and alternative sources such as \nethanol, biodiesel, wind, solar and geothermal--will help stabilize \nprices, and will do so in an environmentally sensitive way. It provides \ntax incentives to spur new oil and gas production and development of \nrenewable sources, while also promoting responsible conservation. It \nincludes important consumer protections and assistance for low income \npersons, particularly the elderly who live on fixed incomes. And I was \nalso pleased that this bill protects the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge from oil drilling, and takes important steps toward cutting \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  I am voting in favor of this bill today because it provides an \nimportant framework for a national energy policy. I think that there is \nmore we can do and I am hopeful that in conference, the House and \nSenate will work together to improve this legislation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise to explain the reality \nof ethanol production in the United States and do so in opposition to \nthe amendment to postpone the renewable fuels standard implementation \ndate.\n  There are currently 61 ethanol plants with the capability of \nproducing 2.3 billion gallons of ethanol per year, the amount required \nby the current RFS on the starting date of January 1, 2004. Some \nopponents of the RFS claim ethanol plants operate at only 82 percent of \ncapacity.\n  We have tried to explain that production is below capacity because \nthe market for ethanol at a fair price is below production capability. \nIn previous testimony, I have explained that certain big oil and \ngasoline companies simply refuse to use ethanol even when wholesale \nprice is well below the wholesale price of gasoline and ethanol's high \noctane number is a free benefit. The RFS will change that situation.\n  However, to ease the concern of the RFS opponents, we have accepted \ntheir production number of 1.7 billion gallons in 2001--not the 2.3 \nbillion gallon capacity.\n  There are currently 16 new plants under construction that will add \nanother 400 million gallons of capacity, raising the total to 2.7 \nbillion gallons of ethanol by year's end. Again, taking our opponents \nnumbers, total production is forecast at 2.2 billion gallons.\n  From a review of proposed new ethanol plants in various stages of \nplanning, design, engineering, permitting and financing, we can very \nconservatively estimate that another 300 million gallons of production \ncapacity will come on line in 2003, to give us a total of 3 billion \ngallons capacity and 2.5 billion gallons of production, using the \nestimates of RFS opponents.\n  I know ethanol plant operators; they will exceed nameplate capacity \nwhen the market is there and the price is fair. We should also have \nwell over 70 million gallons of biodiesel production by 2004. This is \nequivalent to about 100 million gallons of ethanol, using the 1.5 to 1 \nratio for biodiesel and cellulosic biomass allowed by the RFS.\n  Consequently, without unforeseen obstacles, America will have the \ncapability to produce about 3 billion gallons of ethanol when the RFS \nrequirement is only 2.3 billion gallons to be used throughout 2004--\ngiving us still more construction time in 2004. If a disaster hits, \nthere are safety features in the RFS to deal with the problem.\n  I might add it is far more likely that a disaster in oil and \npetroleum product availability will occur than a shortage in the supply \nof ethanol. Should a fossil fuel disaster hit, ethanol supplies will be \nmost welcome in keeping the price of gasoline down.\n  I will add to the Record an op-ed article written by a professor of \nrural sociology and environmental studies at the University of \nWisconsin in Madison. It appeared in The Washington Post on April 4. It \nis titled ``Why We Can't Drill Our Way to Energy Independence.'' \nProfessor Freudenburg ends his article with these thoughts: ``Only if \nwe recognize the facts can we start to talk about a realistic energy \npolicy. If the United States is ever to become energy-independent \nagain, it won't be because of oil.''\n  The professor is right, and Senator Kerry was right when he said we \nhave to create our way out of our dangerous dependence on foreign oil \ndependence.\n  I wish my colleagues, determined to weaken the ethanol industry, \nwould\n\n[[Page S3411]]\n\njoin the creative team by recognizing ethanol, biodiesel and other \nbiofuels are a big part of the solution. We are all patriots. We are \nclear-sighted and determined to protect our national interest abroad \nand homeland security in America.\n  We seem, however, myopic in fully appreciating that transportation \nfuels do much more than move us to our jobs, our kids to school and \ngoods to the market. They are absolutely vital to our economy, our well \nbeing--and to national and homeland security. Interrupt the flow of \nfossil fuels in our transportation sector and we are weakened in all of \nthese sectors.\n  We must break that direct connection between fossil fuel imports and \nthe overall well being of America. We can do so through the biofuels \nprovisions in the RFS.\n  If we were real patriots, we would push beyond the goal of about 3 \npercent replacement by 2012 and set a goal of 10 percent or about 14 \nbillion gallons by that year. In Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, and \nIllinois we are already well above the 10 percent mark.\n  For almost all States outside the Corn Belt, there are ample supplies \nof cellulosic biomass including agricultural and forestry crops and \nresidues, rights-of-way, park, yard and garden trimmings and the \nbiomass and fraction of municipal waste that is a disposal problem, and \nends up in land fills and sewers.\n  We are on the cusp of the science and technologies to cost \neffectively convert this biomass into biofuels, bioelectricity and \nbiochemicals. That is why I am promoting a ``Manhattan'' type approach \nin order to rapidly move forward with large demonstration plants and \nthen on to full commercialization.\n  By working together and with adequate resolve, we can make the 10 \npercent goal and go beyond to the benefit of America's national, \nenergy, and homeland security and its economy through new basic \nindustries, quality jobs and an expanded tax base. The environmental \nbenefits are equally important.\n  If the Senator from California is concerned about ozone formation \nresulting from the introduction of ethanol, she should look to Chicago \nand Milwaukee where they have been essentially using ethanol blends for \nyears with air quality steadily improving.\n  If the California Senators are concerned about benzene in their \nground water, they should call for reductions in benzene and other \naromatics in gasoline. These other aromatics, toluene and xylene, \npartially break down into benzene, a potent carcinogen, in the \ncombustion process, both in the engine and the catalytic converter. \nEthanol can replace these aromatics to the overall benefit of the \nenvironment.\n  California will ban MTBE in 2004. Yet, the California Senators oppose \nthe introduction of ethanol to replace MTBE. They want to turn to the \naromatics and alkylates to meet supply and octane needs. The \navailability and costs of alkylates are unknown. The adverse \nenvironmental and health effects of aromatics are well known. \nTherefore, to accept aromatics and to oppose ethanol is a disservice to \nthe people of California.\n  The opponents of ethanol bring up the possibility of price fixing by \nthe ethanol industry. I believe bringing such unsubstantiated claims to \nthe Senate, and used as arguments to damage the ethanol industry in its \nentirety while the future of ethanol is being debated, is regrettable. \nThis sudden flood of media on this issue cast suspicion on the reality \nof these claims, and leads one to believe that enemies of ethanol are \nsimply continuing their campaign to tarnish ethanol's reputation and \nthe industry in its entirety.\n  If there are concerns about the price of ethanol, the reality of the \nmarketplace should provide needed comfort. At the wholesale level, \nethanol prices are well below those for MTBE, ethanol-free gasoline, \nthe aromatics and, we assume, alkylates, since wholesale prices for \nthis gasoline component are not available.\n  The RFS is the best option we have to reduce our dangerous dependence \non imported oil and to gain other benefits I have already outlined. It \nis time to bring this debate to a close and to seriously move forward \nwith national determination to lead the world in the production of \nbiofuels, bioelectricity and biochemicals using cellulosic biomass and \nwaste streams as feedstocks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the op-ed from the Washington \nPost be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 24, 2002]\n\n           Why We Can't Drill Our Way to Energy Independence\n\n                      (By William R. Freudenburg)\n\n       Washington, Apr. 24.--It's time for a reality check on \n     energy policy.\n       Politicians are fond of claiming that increased domestic \n     oil production can restore energy ``independence,'' but \n     anyone who actually believes those claims is living in a \n     world of self-delusion. U.S. energy independence hasn't been \n     physically possible since the days when Elvis was still \n     singing, and if we're talking about oil, it won't ever be \n     possible again.\n       There are two reasons. One is that the United States simply \n     uses too much oil, too wastefully. The other is that we've \n     already burned up almost all the petroleum we have. The calls \n     for ``energy independence'' aren't based on realism; they're \n     based on nostalgia.\n       To be fair, we've had quite a petroleum history. Back in \n     1859, the United States was the country where the idea of \n     drilling for oil originated, and for nearly a century \n     thereafter, we were a virtual one-nation OPEC. Save for a few \n     years around the turn of the last century, the United States \n     produced over half of all the oil in the world more or less \n     continuously until 1953.\n       But ever since then, our proportion of world oil production \n     has been dropping, with only minor fluctuations, no matter \n     how much our politicians have tried to stop the slide. \n     Ironically, around 1973, when President Nixon's ``Project \n     Independence'' first brought the issue of energy policy (and \n     the idea of energy ``independence'') to the minds of most \n     Americans, the country moved decisively in just the opposite \n     direction from independence. Even during the massive push to \n     increase U.S. oil production in the years of Ronald Reagan \n     and James Watt, the only real effect was a tiny increase in \n     the U.S. proportion of world oil production--from 14.5 \n     percent to 16.8 percent--between 1980 and 1985.\n       By the time Reagan left office, physical reality had \n     reappeared, and the U.S. share of world oil production was \n     even lower than when he started. In recent years, we have \n     produced less than a tenth of the world's oil.\n       Why have politicians been arguing about oil exploration on \n     the northern edge of Alaska, even as we keep moving further \n     off the southern edge of the continent, into the ever-deeper \n     waters of the Gulf of Mexico? It's simple: We've already \n     drained almost everything in between.\n       Politically savvy spin doctors may be able to get many \n     Americans to overlook the facts, at least in the short run, \n     but they aren't going to change reality, and the aren't going \n     to turn back the clock. According to the American Petroleum \n     Institute, the United States is now down to just 3 percent of \n     the world's proven reserves of oil. Wishful thinking isn't \n     going to change that.\n       Unless the politicians can figure out how to turn their hot \n     air into oil, we need to face the facts: It is no longer \n     possible for the United States to drill its way to energy \n     independence. This country simply doesn't have that much oil \n     left, and if we use that oil faster, we will just run out \n     sooner.\n       Only if we recognize the facts can we start to talk about a \n     realistic energy policy. If the United States is ever to \n     become energy-independent again, it won't be because of oil.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, energy policy is an important issue for \nAmerica, and my Wisconsin constituents take it very seriously. The bill \nbefore us seeks to address the balance of domestic production of energy \nresources versus foreign imports, the tradeoffs between the need for \nenergy and the need to protect the quality of our environment, and the \nneed for additional domestic efforts to improve our energy efficiency, \nand the wisest use of our energy resources. Given the importance of \nenergy policy, an energy bill is a very serious matter, and I do not \ntake a decision to oppose such a bill lightly. Mr. President, in my \nview, this bill does not achieve the correct balance on several \nimportant issues, and I will oppose this bill.\n  Though the bill as amended will revitalize the Federal Government's \nresponsibility to regulate fuel economy, it weakens current law and \nexempts pickup trucks from any future increases in fuel economy \nstandards. The amendment by the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, on \nfuel economy which I supported requires the Department of \nTransportation to develop new fuel economy standards in 15 months for \nlight trucks and 24 months for passenger cars. Taking pickup trucks off \nthe table undermines a serious effort to re-think our fuel economy \npolicy in a rulemaking context, and it is a direction I oppose.\n  In addition, Mr. President, as introduced, this bill contained a \nrenewable\n\n[[Page S3412]]\n\nenergy portfolio standard requiring electric utilities to generate or \npurchase 10 percent of the electricity that they sell from renewable \nsources by 2020. I supported an amendment offered by the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Jeffords, to increase this percentage to 20 percent, but \non the floor the Senate adopted amendments to water it down to 8 \npercent. Moreover, with the exemptions for some utilities added to the \nbill, the real effect will be about 4-5 percent new generation from \nrenewable sources by 2010. We can and should do more to use renewable \nsources of energy, and this bill should have set a serious target.\n  In addition, this bill repeals the pro-consumer Public Utility \nHolding Company Act, the Federal Government's most important mechanism \nto protect electricity consumers. The Senate failed to adopt the \namendment by my colleague from Washington, Mrs. Cantwell, to strengthen \nconsumer protections which I helped write and co-sponsored. The bill \nshould have given the Federal Government more oversight over utility \nmergers and should have prevented utilities from passing on the costs \nof bad investments to consumers and from using affiliate companies from \nundercutting small businesses. Also the electricity provisions of the \nbill do not re-regulate trading of energy derivatives. This would have \nbeen addressed by an amendment offered by the Senator from California, \nMrs. Feinstein, which I supported, which would have fostered a more \nstable market with transparent transactions and helped to prevent \nanother Enron.\n  Finally, I am also concerned that we added $14 billion in tax breaks \nwithout paying for them on this bill. Our budget position has \ndeteriorated significantly over the last year, in large part because of \nthe massive tax cut that Congress enacted. We now face years of \nprojected budget deficits. The only way we will climb out of this \ndeficit hole is to return to some sense of fiscal responsibility, and \nfirst and foremost that means making sure that the bills we pass are \noffset. Without offsetting the cost of the tax package, we are digging \nour deficit hole even deeper and adding to the massive debt already \nfacing our children and grandchildren.\n  The American people deserved better with this bill, and I cannot vote \nin favor of it. This measure will need to improve in Conference to get \nmy vote, and I look forward to an improved bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will vote against the energy bill \nbecause it is a bad bill for California and the nation.\n  The bill includes an ethanol mandate for California that will raise \ngas prices. Cleaner air for California can be achieved without this \nmandate. Ethanol has been given a liability waiver if there are adverse \nconsequences from its use. I tried to eliminate this waiver but lost on \na 42-57 vote. We already know that ethanol may spread plumes of harmful \nchemicals, such as benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene. So this \nis a dangerous waiver.\n  The energy bill does not do enough to protect consumers from another \nelectricity crisis. I worked to include a measure in this bill that \nwould have guarded against future market manipulation by companies like \nEnron by increasing oversight of the electricity market. Companies \nwould be far less likely to gouge consumers if these additional \nprotections were in place, but the Senate refused to pass this vital \nmeasure.\n  Also, I am disappointed that the Senate walked away from reasonable \nfuel economy standards and stronger air conditioner efficiency \nstandards, which are so important to our environment and to lessening \nour dependence on foreign oil.\n  The ``good guys'' have had few wins. We were able to keep the \nprovision of the bill to provide tax credits for alternative energy \nsources and alternative fuel vehicles. And we defeated an attempt to \nopen the Alaska Wildlife Refuge to drilling, for which I am very \nthankful to the grassroots of California for all their efforts. But \ndrilling in Alaska did get 46 votes, and I am concerned that with the \nbill passing the Senate, drilling in Alaska may not be dead in the \nconference committee.\n  In conclusion, the bill does more harm than good for the people of \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I must rise, regrettably, to oppose the \nenergy bill. This legislation means higher gas prices and lower \nenvironmental protections for the American people, and it should be \nopposed.\n  I commend Senators Bingaman and Daschle for their leadership and \ntheir tireless work on this initiative. I believe I could have lived \nwith many sections of the bill as introduced. I know there are many \nissues regarding our national energy policy upon which Senator Daschle, \nSenator Bingaman and I agree. However, in my opinion the bill in its \ncurrent form falls far short of the mark for environmental and consumer \nprotections, and forces us to rely on oil more than innovation for our \nenergy needs for the foreseeable future.\n  The energy bill as introduced wasn't as bold as it could have been, \nbut it represented an improvement over the status quo. It had higher \ngoals for renewable energy. It maintained some consumer protections. \nThere are still provisions in this bill that deserve everyone's \nsupport. It's true that we are raising the bar a bit in calling for \nrenewable energy, though not enough. We're providing some tax credits \nfor renewable energy production and energy efficiency. We're improving \npipeline safety. We're investing resources in making renewable energy \nmore efficient and profitable. We're conducting research on finding the \nmost appropriate and effective places to site renewable energy \nfacilities. We spoke very clearly that drilling in the Arctic Natural \nWildlife Refuge is not in the interests of our economic or national \nsecurity.\n  I am also pleased with Senator Bayh's leadership on clean-burning \nschool buses, and I look forward to continuing our work together on \nthis very important issue.\n  But I think this bill doesn't do enough to ensure that efficiency is \na serious component of our energy policy. I commend Senators Kerry and \nMcCain for their efforts on fuel economy standards, but I'm very \ndisappointed in the vote on CAFE. I'm also disappointed that the Senate \ncouldn't find an agreement to set broad goals for fuel consumption as \nreflected in the Carper amendment. I fear we will be forced to revisit \nthis issue again sooner rather than later.\n  I'm very concerned that we didn't do enough to protect consumers in \nthis bill. Energy industries wanted fewer regulatory restrictions, and \nwere rewarded in this bill. The underlying bill had adequate consumer \nprotections, but they were watered down by amendments. In today's fast-\npaced world of energy trading, and mergers, we should err on the side \nof transparency and consumer protection. The energy bill doesn't do \nthat.\n  I'm particularly concerned about the potential harm to the \nenvironment in this bill. This bill supports hydraulic fracturing. It \nforces States to use ethanol--and while ethanol clearly addresses air \npollution, I'm concerned that the residue created by ethanol, known as \nEBTE, could pollute our water supply. We shouldn't be trading clean \nwater for clean air.\n  The fuel oxygenate mandate provisions are cumbersome for \nMassachusetts. It forces our state to use more ethanol than it will be \nable to accommodate for several years. The infrastructure to transfer \nethanol is inadequate, and when Massachusetts finds itself unable to \nmeet the mandate, it will be forced to pay a credit--increasing gas \nprices at the pump. I'm also concerned about the impact to the highway \ntrust fund--Federal resources from the gas tax should be spent on \nrepairing and constructing roads and bridges. More ethanol would reduce \nthe revenues in this fund and compromise our ability to maintain our \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  I am very concerned about the liability protections given to \nindustry. We're subsidizing and capping the liability costs of the \nnuclear industry in this bill--I believe if you're not prepared to bear \nthe total costs of nuclear power, then you shouldn't enter the \nbusiness. We're giving blanket product liability protections to fuel \nadditive manufacturers, even though we don't have adequate information \non their safety if they drain into our drinking water. An energy bill \nshould be about innovation, conservation, and security--not about \nproviding yet more liability protections for corporations when their \nproducts hurt people or the environment.\n\n[[Page S3413]]\n\n  This bill has some improvements, but I'm sure the Senate could do \nbetter.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, regarding this energy proposal before the \nSenate proceeds to a final vote today. For 6 weeks, we have debated \nvarious aspects of this energy proposal. It's been the most exhaustive \ndebate on energy related issues since 1992 when previous energy \nlegislation was enacted.\n  In that 10-year time span, unfortunately, conditions have only \nworsened. America's dependence on foreign oil has increased from 46 \npercent to 57 percent. In 1992, gas prices were $1.13 per gallon. But, \nin recent times, consumers have had to absorb several price spikes in \ngasoline prices, some in excess of $2 per gallon. Special interest tax \nsubsidies are also on the rise. In 1992, the Congress enacted $1.5 \nbillion for energy tax credits and benefits for 5 years. This Senate \nbill includes more than $13 billion for 10 years, and this amount could \nincrease since the House-passed energy bill includes more than $30 \nbillion in energy tax subsidies.\n  As I listened to many of my colleagues debate these various issues on \nthe Senate floor, the consistent message I have heard from both sides \nof the aisle is the need for a balanced energy policy, increasing U.S. \nenergy stability, and protecting American consumers. These are all \nlaudable and important goals. The end result, however, is a bill that \nfalls significantly short of these goals and represents more benefits \nto special interests than to the American people.\n  One of the stated objectives of this new energy policy is to reduce \nAmerica's dependence on foreign oil. Regrettably, we missed a critical \nopportunity when the Senate rejected a proposal to increase fuel \nefficiency standards, which would have substantially decreased our \nNation's dependence on foreign oil and also reduced greenhouse gas \nemissions. Had we adopted an increase of fuel efficiency standards to \n36 mpg average by 2015, we could have potentially saved 2.6 million \nbarrels of oil per day by 2020. This amount is about equal to present \nimports from the Persian Gulf.\n  The Senate also rejected a modest effort to mitigate the growth rate \nof our Nation's oil consumption, which increases each year by an \nestimated 2.5 percent, by requiring the Secretary of Transportation to \nreduce the amount of oil we use to power passenger cars and light \ntrucks by 1 million barrels per day by the year 2015.\n  Both these critical measures would have gone far to improve energy \nefficiency, the environment, and public health. By increasing CAFE \nstandards by 46 percent and reducing our consumption of oil, we could \nalso have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent in Arizona \nalone, significantly improving the air that is negatively impacting our \ncitizens. Instead, pressure from car manufacturers and industry won the \nday, and we rejected these modest approaches to improving energy \nefficiency and public health.\n  Another big benefactor in this bill is the ethanol industry. Not only \ndoes this bill propose a ten-year extension of tax benefits for the \nethanol industry, it also requires that ethanol use in gasoline shall \nbe increased three-fold by 2012.\n  Proponents of the new reformulated fuel standard requirement suggest \nthat their intention is to help farmers, small ethanol producers, and \nreplace the controversial fuel additive, methyl tertiary butyl ether, \nMTBE, which has been proven to contaminate groundwater. This new \nethanol requirement is so important to its sponsors that they willingly \noverride continuing public and scientific concerns about ethanol's \nimpacts on the environment and public health. Unanswered questions \nremain about the Nation's production and transportation readiness for \nthis expanded market. Billions will continue to be drawn from the \nFederal treasury to subsidize the ethanol industry.\n  The ethanol industry has enjoyed extremely generous subsidies for \nclose to 30 years. By any business standard, it should be more than \naptly competitive. This is a free market economy, yet, here we are, \nessentially guaranteeing the ethanol industry a monopoly on the \ngasoline market for the next 10 years. Plus, this bill continues the \n5.3 cents-a-gallon tax subsidy and other ethanol tax benefits, which \ndrain $1 billion annually from the Federal treasury. By tripling the \namount of ethanol use, this amount could raise to $2.5 to $3 billion a \nyear. This is poorly conceived public policy, and blatant corporate \nwelfare at its worst.\n  Back in March of this year, I voted for the Job Creation and Worker \nAssistance Act of 2002. It was the economic stimulus package that \nprovided temporary assistance for unemployed Americans and their \nfamilies. At the time, I stated that we should not ignore the plight of \nmillions of Americans who were laid off and wanted to return to work. I \nalso said that my vote for this legislation should not be interpreted \nas a total endorsement of all of its provisions. Indeed, I stated my \nserious reservations about a particular provision in the bill that \nextended a tax credit to the industry in the business of converting \npoultry waste into electricity until the end of 2003.\n  Well, guess what? The tax incentives in the energy bill address the \nvery same provision again but with a twist that will cost taxpayers \n$2.3 billion over the next 10 years. In the past, this income tax \ncredit has been allowed for the production of electricity from either \nqualified wind energy, ``closed-loop'' biomass, or poultry waste \nfacilities. But the bill before us not only extends this tax credit \nuntil the end of 2006, it also expands the qualifying energy resources \nto include geothermal energy and solar energy, ``open-loop'' biomass, \nand swine and bovine waste nutrients.\n  I am certainly glad that we have gone beyond helping the chicken \nwaste industry now. Now, we have eliminated the discrimination in favor \nof chickens. We are awarding the productive use of the waste of pigs \nand cows. But why don't we totally eliminate this animal waste \ndiscrimination. Why not give a credit for the waste of dogs, cats, \nmice, birds? The list is infinite. Let's end discrimination now and \ngive a tax credit for converting all kinds of animal waste. I am very \nconfident that the American taxpayer will feel that their hard-earned \nmoney is being well spent. And if you believe that statement, I'm sure \nthat there is some waterfront property in Gila Bend, AZ, you would be \ninterested in buying.\n  Again, my concern is that the special interests continue to benefit \nat the expense of hard-working American taxpayers. I regret that I \ncannot support a bill that is so detrimental to taxpayers and does \nlittle to improve national energy security.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate completed consideration of \nthe energy reform bill after 6 weeks of debate. I voted yea on final \npassage. Before we began debate on this legislation, I gave a talk here \nin Washington at the Center for National Policy outlining a sound \nenergy policy for this Nation. Despite my vote for the energy bill, I \nbelieve that the Senate has fallen far short of crafting a sound energy \npolicy for this nation.\n  The Senate did not enact a national energy policy today. I should add \nthat the House and President has failed at that task, as well. Why then \nam I voting for the Senate bill? Because the Senate bill is far better \nthan the President's plan or the House bill. It is critically important \nthat the Senate have a voice in this discussion and put forward its \nwork. After 17 years in the Senate, I can see from this debate, that \nwhile the bill we passed today falls far short of what the Nation \nneeds, it is simply the most the political system can bear right now. \nThe fundamental changes we need were resisted and ultimately defeated \nby the special interests that benefit from the status quo. And while it \nmay be too much to ask, I hold out hope that the bill can be improved \nin the conference process. If it is not improved, I do not believe I \nwill be able to support the conference report.\n  I want to quickly outline some of the strengths in this bill and some \nof the weaknesses.\n  The tax package is reasonable and balanced. It totals about $15 \nbillion, with that cost nearly equally divided between coal, oil, gas, \nand nuclear and energy efficiency and renewable energy. In the context \nof this measure, I support the assistance to clean coal, marginal well \nproduction, and other areas. I strongly support the tax credit for \nhybrid, fuel cell, and alternative fuel vehicles. I strongly support \ntax credits for efficient air conditioners, water heaters and other \nappliances. I strongly support the tax credits for wind, solar, \nbiomass, geothermal, and\n\n[[Page S3414]]\n\nother renewable electricity and energy production.\n  The bill contains significant provisions to increase oil and gas \nproduction. As I have said, it includes new tax credits for marginal \nwell and other production. It also includes loan guarantees and prices \nsupports for the construction of a natural gas pipeline from the North \nSlope of Alaska to the Lower 48 States. This will move more than 35 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas to market, be the largest private \nworks project ever undertaken in North America, and create hundreds of \nthousands of jobs.\n  The bill also contains a very modest renewable portfolio standard \nthat would require 10 percent of the Nation's electricity be produced \nfrom renewable energy sources by 2020. This standard is weaker than \nwhat I believe is possible. I have advocated that the Nation set a goal \nof producing 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by \n2020. Unfortunately, the Senate not only accepted a lower target, but \nit adopted an amendment that undermines the integrity of the RPS system \nallowing for the purchase of inexpensive credits, credits potentially \nbelow the market price of renewable electricity. Nevertheless, it is \nimportant to enshrine this important concept of a renewable portfolio \nstandard into law.\n  I supported the renewable fuel standard in the law. This provision \nwas supported by the State of Massachusetts as a way to end more costly \nmandates under the Clean Air Act, ensure clean air, end the use of \npolluting MTBE, and create a national market for corn ethanol, biomass \nethanol, and other renewable fuels.\n  The bill's most significant failure is that it does nothing to \nmeaningfully reduce oil consumption or enhance efficiency in the \ntransportation sector. The Senate rejected a proposal I crafted with \nSenator McCain that would have raised fuel economy standards for \nAmerica's passenger vehicles and save 1 million barrels of oil per day \nby 2015. The result is that the Senate has foregone action on the \nsingle greatest step we can take as a nation to reduce our dependence \non oil, protect the economy from oil price shocks, and reduce harmful \npollution.\n  For the past year I have urged my colleagues to oppose drilling in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I am grateful that a majority of \nthe Senate voted to protect the refuge. I am grateful that, while this \nbill is inadequate, it does not open the refuge to oil drilling. I will \noppose any attempt to add drilling in this bill in conference with the \nHouse.\n  As I have said, this energy bill is not an energy policy for the \nNation. It is a collection of policies, many good and many bad, that \nwill, in total, move the Nation only incrementally forward. It is not \nby any means a solution to the challenges that we face. While I voted \nfor this bill today, I pledge myself to continuing the fight for clean, \nreliable, and domestic energy and for a real energy policy for this \nNation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, when the members of the Senate Energy \nCommittee, including Senator Schumer, Senator Cantwell, Senator Wyden, \nand I, began talking about doing a comprehensive energy bill more than \na year ago there were three major things all of us said that we wanted \nto see in the bill.\n  First we believed that we needed to reduce our energy consumption and \nhence our country's dependence on foreign oil.\n  Second we wanted to get to the bottom of what was happening with \nenergy markets in California and the West where electricity and natural \ngas prices were 10-25 times higher that they should have been.\n  And we wanted to do all we could to ensure that a crisis of this \nmagnitude could never happen again.\n  And third, we wanted to address global warming by quantitatively and \nmeasurably reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases.\n  These are still the elements I support in an energy bill. But the \nsimple fact of the matter is that these elements are not in this bill.\n  First the Senate rejected Senator Cantwell's and my amendment to \nprovide transparency, oversight and authority by the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission (CFTC) on energy derivative trading.\n  What we saw in energy markets was the on-line trading of energy \ncommodities like natural gas and electricity multiple times to drive up \nprices and escape any federal oversight or transparency whatsoever.\n  This is what Enron was doing through its on-line trading company, \nEnron On-Line before the company went bankrupt.\n  And Dynegy and Williams, two companies operating on-line exchanges \nsimilar to Enron On-Line have taken over some of Enron's market share \nand are trading without oversight or transparency either.\n  The Senate had the opportunity to address this problem which arose \nfrom the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000.\n  But instead the Senate rejected our amendment which would have \nensured that there was proper oversight for energy trading.\n  So I don't think this energy bill will do a single thing that assures \nme that we won't have another crisis in my state.\n  The Senate also had the opportunity to pass legislation to increase \nfuel economy standards. Senator Snowe and I introduced legislation last \nyear that would have closed what is known as the SUV Loophole.\n  That loophole allows SUVs and other light duty trucks to meet lower \nfuel economy standards than other passenger vehicles. The standard is \n27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 20.7 miles per gallon for SUVs.\n  Our bill would have saved a million barrels of oil a day, reduced our \ndependence on foreign oil by 10 percent, and prevented more than 200 \nmillion tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each year.\n  It was the single most important thing our country could have done \nnot only to combat global warming, but to become more fuel-independent \nat the same time.\n  I regret that we did not have the opportunity to vote on this measure \nas the Senate instead overwhelmingly defeated a much more ambitious \nproposal to significantly raise standards for all vehicles.\n\n  I am convinced that had we not done that, the Feinstein-Snowe \namendment would have had a real shot at winning.\n  By a longshot however, the ethanol mandate is the most troublesome \nprovision in the Senate energy bill.\n  What was also sneaked into this bill without a hearing was \nessentially a new gas tax that will result in a wealth transfer from \nCalifornia and New York and other coastal States to States in the \nMidwest.\n  It actually triples the ethanol market by mandate.\n  And if a State does not need it, it forces that State to buy credits \nto pay for it.\n  In fact, the mandate extorts California to use 2.68 billion gallons \nof ethanol over nine years that it does not need.\n  All this for a substance that is already subsidized to the tune of 53 \ncents per gallon and protected from any foreign competition through \nsignificant tariffs.\n  No one knows for sure how much gas prices will increase because of \nthis mandate.\n  One recent analysis indicates that prices will increase 4 to 10 cents \nper gallon across the United States if the Senate energy bill becomes \nlaw.\n  I believe that the price spikes in California will be even more \nsevere beginning in about 2004 as our State is close to our refining \ncapacity and using ethanol will shrink our gasoline supply and force us \nto refine more.\n  California also does not have the necessary infrastructure in place \nto transport the ethanol to market.\n  I am particularly concerned about the limited number of suppliers in \nthe ethanol market.\n  In fact, one company ADM controls 41 percent of the market.\n  And of course, nobody really knows the long-term health and \nenvironmental effects of nearly tripling the amount of ethanol in our \ngasoline supply.\n  Some evidence suggests that (1) reformulated gasoline with ethanol \nproduces more smog pollution than reformulated gas without it; and (2) \nethanol enables the toxic chemicals in gasoline to seep further into \ngroundwater and ever faster than conventional gasoline.\n  But just like when we introduced MTBE into our gasoline we simply\n\n[[Page S3415]]\n\ndon't know what the ramifications will be.\n  And of course to top it off this bill protects these energy producers \nfrom any future liability.\n  And the funniest thing of all is that all this is for a gasoline \nadditive that California and other States hardly need.\n  With the exception of the winter months in some of the southern part \nof the State, California can meet all its Clean Air Act Standards with \nits own reformulated gasoline.\n  In actuality we need to use very little ethanol.\n  So that is why I strongly oppose this bill and I believe we will rue \nthe day we passed this ethanol mandate and this energy bill.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about biodiesel, an \nalternative source of energy. I believe that we have made great strides \non this energy bill. A sensible energy policy requires that we boost \nproduction of domestic energy sources while also balancing \nconservation. Biodiesel as an alternative fuel is one good way this \nenergy bill will increase domestic production and lessen our dependence \non foreign oil.\n  I am very happy to hear that the Finance Committee's tax proposals \nwere added to this bill. The tax proposals included provisions that \npromote conservation and expanded use of cleaner burning fuel.\n  Also in these provisions are tax credits for biodiesel. The tax \ncredits are a good start at encouraging the use of biodiesel as an \nalternative fuel source. However, the tax provisions do not treat all \nbiodiesel the same.\n  There are many types of biodiesel including animal fats, recycled \ncooking oils or restaurant greases, and vegetable oils made up of \nsoybeans, sunflower seed, canola, safflower seed, and flaxseed. In the \ntax provisions, though, the vegetable oils are treated differently than \nthe animal fat and recycled oils.\n  There should be equal tax treatment for biodiesel. The different tax \ncredits for biodiesel sends a confusing signal to the biodiesel market. \nIt encourages growth only in one area of this beneficial renewable \nfuel, vegetable oil.\n  In addition, vegetable production has highly federalized subsidies \nand a lucrative byproduct market. For instance, glycerin from soy \nrefining is used in a variety of food and pharmaceutical processes, and \nhas a value advantage of 10-15 cents per gallon of biodiesel. The \nrendering industry, the primary source of animal-based biodiesel \nfeedstocks, receives no Federal support and has a more limited \nbyproduct market.\n  The unequal tax treatment is in stark contrast to the remainder of \nthe energy bill. The bill includes all domestic energy sources in its \nrenewable energy provisions and treats animal and vegetable sources \nbiodiesel equally.\n  Kentucky has a large amount of soybean crops. So, I support \nencouraging the use of vegetable oil and support the tax credits in the \nbill. However, tax incentives should not discriminate between different \nkinds of alternative fuels.\n  One of the goals of the pending energy bill is to encourage \ndevelopment of renewable energy supplies. Including all sources in the \ntax provision will further this effort and maximize the positive impact \non U.S. agriculture.\n  I hope that we find a way to encourage all alternative sources of \nenergy. This is important to our production and will strengthen our \nnational security.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to state my support for the \namendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator \nFitzgerald, and to express my extreme disappointment that it was not \nagreed to by this body.\n  This very sensible amendment would have clarified that the \nincineration of municipal solid waste will not be treated as renewable \nenergy for purposes of the renewable portfolio standard and for the \nFederal renewable energy purchase requirement.\n  This issue arises because the burning of landfill waste in \nincinerators is one method of producing electricity. It produces only a \nminimal percentage of our electricity, but creates almost one quarter \nof the nation's mercury emissions, and significant levels of dioxin.\n  Dioxin, a known carcinogen, cause impairment of immune, nervous, \nreproductive and endocrine systems, even at extremely low \nconcentrations. Infants are particularly sensitive to dioxin because of \ndioxin concentrations in human breast milk. Studies of infants show up \nto 65 times the maximum dioxin exposure recommended by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  The National Academy of Science has found that although waste \nincinerators have reduced their dioxin air emissions, total dioxin \nreleases in fly ash, bottom ash and other revenues have not decreased.\n  According to the most recent EPA data, 2.2 tons of mercury were \nemitted from garbage incinerators in 2000. This accounts for almost 20 \npercent of the nation's mercury emissions. Toxic amounts of mercury \nexist in our lakes, rivers and groundwater. Mercury causes neurological \ndamage and birth defects, resulting in developmental delays and \ncognitive defects.\n  The renewable portfolio standard contained in the bill is intended to \nprovide incentives and market support for the production of clean, \nrenewable energy technologies. These include wind, solar, geothermal \nand biolass energy. One of the primary reasons for promoting these \nenergy sources is that they give us clean power. They provide \nelectricity that is free of the toxic wastes and emissions associated \nwith many of our traditional fuel supplies.\n  Including the incineration of municipal solid waste in this category \nflies in the face of reason. If we want to keep mercury flowing into \nour streams and rivers, we can just pour more money into coal-fired \npower plants. An energy source that cripples our infants and causes \ncancer is not something we should support under the umbrella of \nrenewable energy.\n  I am aware that incinerators have made significant strides in \nreducing toxic emissions. However, as I have stated above, municipal \nsolid waste incinerators still account for 20 percent of nationwide \nmercury emissions, and still contribute to the release of highly toxic \ndioxins.\n  It is completely inappropriate to incentivize the continued release \nof these toxic substances as part of a provision aimed at clean, \nrenewable energy.\n  Neither the amendment nor the underlying bill language would in any \nway undermine or hamper the current incineration of municipal solid \nwaste, and would not prohibit or discourage new incineration. Neither \nthe amendment nor the underlying bill language will not create new \nregulations regarding incineration of municipal solid waste, nor change \nexisting ones. All this amendment would have done is ensure that \nmunicipal solid waste is not encourage as a renewable energy resource.\n  Including energy sources that result in highly toxic emissions does \nhowever undermine the foundation of the renewable portfolio standard, \nwhich is to help clean, renewable energies to compete against other \nenergy sources.\n  Mr. President, I am greatly disappointed that this amendment was \ndefeated but intend to address this issue further in conference.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the world's energy system has evolved for \nthousands of years.\n  Almost without trying, the global energy system has favored fuels \nthat burn cleaner and more efficiently: from wood burning in \nprehistoric caves to the Franklin stove of the 18th century; to coal \ndespite the fact that wood was more abundant; to oil required to meet \nthe insatiable needs of a motorized transportation sector at the start \nof the 20th century; to natural gas, which can be distributed through a \nsystem of pipes right into the kitchen or a home furnace, or easily \nconverted into electricity; and now to renewable energy sources.\n  Faced with uncertainties in electricity energy markets, turmoil in \nthe Mideast, the need to cut back on the fossil fuel emissions linked \nto global warming, local and regional air pollution that contributes to \nhigh rates of asthma and smog-filled national parks, the United States \nmust diversify its energy supply using renewable energy.\n  If State regulators approve Nevada Power's latest rate proposals for \n2002, Las Vegas electricity rates will have jumped a total of 75 \npercent since 1999. In the same period, natural gas prices have \ndoubled. We need to change the energy equation. We need to diversify\n\n[[Page S3416]]\n\nthe Nation's energy supply to reduce volatility and ensure a stable \nsupply of electricity. We must harness the brilliance of the sun, the \nstrength of the wind, and the heat of the Earth to provide clean, \nrenewable energy for our Nation.\n  I am also pleased that the energy bill currently before the Senate \ncontains a renewable portfolio standard requiring that a small, \ngradually growing percentage of the nation's power supply come from \nrenewables such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal sources over the \nnext two decades.\n  I am pleased that the tax provisions of this bill strengthen the \nproduction tax credit for renewable energy resources.\n  Eligible renewable energy resources have been expanded from wind and \npoultry waste to include geothermal, solar, open-loop biomass, and \nanimal waste. The credit has been extended for 5 years for geothermal \nand solar, and animal waste, and 3 years for biomass. We need this \nproduction tax credit to provide business certainty and ensure the \ngrowth of renewable energy development and to signal America's long-\nterm commitment to renewable energy. It is time to level the playing \nfield--subsidies for fossil fuels dominate the Federal Tax Code, with \n62 percent of all Federal tax expenditures going to oil and gas \ncompanies.\n  After pouring billions into oil and gas, we need to invest in a clean \nenergy future.\n  Other nations are developing renewable energy resources at a much \nfaster rate than the United States. In 1990, America produced 90 \npercent of the world's wind power; today we generate less than 25 \npercent. Germany now has the lead in wind energy, and Japan in solar \nenergy. Foreign corporations are using the same technology available to \nus--in fact, many of these technologies were developed in the U.S. But \nthey have surpassed us because their governments have provide stable \nsupport for renewable energy production and use. America needs to \nreestablish its leadership in renewable energy.\n  In the U.S. today, we get less than 3 percent of our electricity from \nrenewable energy sources like wind, solar, geothermal and biomass. But \nthe potential for much greater supply is there. For example, Nevada, is \nconsidered the Saudi Arabia of geothermal. My state could use \ngeothermal energy to meet one-third of its electricity needs, but today \nthis source of energy only supplies 2-3 percent. This needs to change.\n\n  The good news is that the production tax credit for renewable energy \nresources really works to promote the growth of renewable energy.\n  In 1990, the cost of wind energy was 22.5 cents per kilowatt hour \nand, today, with new technology and the help of a modest production tax \ncredit, wind is a competitive energy source at 3 to 4 cents per \nkilowatt hour. At the Nevada Test Site, a new wind farm will provide \n260 megawatts to meet the needs of 260,000 people--more than 10 percent \nof Nevada's population within 5 years. In the last 5 years, wind energy \nhas experienced a 30 percent growth rate. In 2001, wind energy capacity \ngrew nationally from 2,600 Megawatts to 4,300 Megawatts, a 65 percent \nincrease. With the benefit of the production tax credit, wind energy is \nthe fastest growing renewable. We need to do the same for the other \nrenewable energy resources.\n  America needs to build its energy future on an environmental \nfoundation that protects air and water quality.\n  A recent article in The Journal of the American Medical Association \nrevealed an alarming link between soot particles from power plants and \nmotor vehicles and lung cancer and heart disease.\n  This was an exhaustive study of 500,000 people in 16 American cities, \nwhose lives and health have been tracked since 1982. Experts gave the \nstudy high marks. Its conclusions are obvious--we need to do a better \njob protecting the air we breathe.\n  The adverse health effects of powerplant and vehicle emissions cost \nAmericans billions in medical care, and our cost in human suffering is \nimmeasurable. Simply put, the human cost of dirty air is staggering. If \nwe factor in environmental and health effects, the real cost of energy \nbecomes apparent, and renewables become the fuel of choice.\n  America's abundant and untapped renewable resources can fuel our \njourney into a more prosperous and safer tomorrow without compromising \nair and water quality. The potential is enormous. We need to expand and \nextend the production tax credit to enable renewable energy to compete \non a playing field that currently is heavily inclined towards the \ncontinued production of oil, gas, and coal. In many States, including \nNevada, expanded renewable energy production will provide jobs in rural \nareas--areas that are desperate for economic growth.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this tax package, with its provisions \nfor a production tax credit to encourage the growth of renewable energy \nresources. Renewable energy--as an alternative to traditional energy \nsources--is a common-sense way to make sure that the American people \nhave a reliable source of power at an affordable price. Renewable \nenergy is the cornerstone of a successful, forward looking, and secure \nenergy policy for the 21st century.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are now going to \nmove to final passage. I would like to say, before everyone votes--and \nwe will be very quick here--we have spent approximately 6 weeks on this \nbill. It has been a tremendous amount of time and I have been here a \nlot of the time. But I want to extend the full appreciation of the \nentire Senate for the work done by the two managers of this bill. \nSenator Bingaman and Senator Murkowski have worked through some very \ndifficult issues. I think they have made the Senate very proud in the \nwork they have done.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I cannot let this opportunity go by. I will \nbe brief so we can vote. I know Senators have obligations they want to \nfulfill, but I have to say we do owe a debt of gratitude from the \nSenate as a whole to the chairman and the ranking member of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee. They have been at this for 6 weeks. It \nhas been at least 5 years since we spent that long--I don't think, \nsince I have been in the Senate, we have spent 6 weeks on a bill. So \nthis is a monumental undertaking. It is coming to a positive result.\n  They provide bipartisan leadership. They have been persistent, and I \nthank them for that. I especially have to say to my colleague from \nAlaska, I appreciate his attitude. Even though I know his feelings on \nan issue that meant so much to him and the other Senator from Alaska, \nMr. Stevens, he said we had to move forward on an energy policy for \nthis country.\n  You did the right thing for your country. I know in the end we are \ngoing to do the right thing for you and your State, too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are now reaching the end of 6 weeks of \ndebate on this energy bill. I want to thank Chairman Bingaman for his \ntireless leadership.\n  He began this process by coordinating the work of nine separate \ncommittees, and he has done an amazing job of shepherding this large, \ndifficult, and sometimes contentious piece of legislation to its \nconclusion.\n  When we began this energy debate, I spoke about the need to keep in \nmind four key goals. I said that any energy plan we pass should \nincrease our energy independence . . . it should be good for consumers \n. . . it should create jobs . . . and it should be responsible--both \nenvironmentally and fiscally.\n  In a number of places, this bill meets those goals. In some, it falls \nshort. But overall, this is a far more responsible, progressive, \nconsumer-friendly energy policy than the one advanced by the \nAdministration, or passed by the House.\n  Our energy plan invests in new ideas, new technologies, and new \napproaches to old problems.\n  It demonstrates that our energy policy need not be a tug-of-war \nbetween increased production and increased conservation. This bill \nhelps us do both.\n  For example, this bill encourages the construction of a pipeline to \nbring natural gas from Alaska to the lower forty-eight states. There \nare 35 trillion cubic feet of known natural gas reserves on the North \nSlope of Alaska.\n  Right now, that gas is being pumped back into the ground because \nthere's no way to get it to the American consumers who need it.\n\n[[Page S3417]]\n\n  Our nation faces a long-term shortage of natural gas, all experts \nagree. An Alaska pipeline would deliver at least 4.5 billion cubic feet \nof gas per day to the Midwest, the central point of the nation's gas \ndelivery network. 4.5 billion cubic feet per day is nearly ten percent \nof America's daily gas consumption.\n  Last month, Alaska Governor Tony Knowles met with me to discuss the \nadditional provisions he felt were needed to invigorate this project. \nAt his urging, and with the strong support of Senators Murkowski and \nStevens, the bill we are clearing for conference today not only assures \nthat any gas pipeline from Prudhoe Bay will run through Alaska, it also \nseeks to assure access to the gas for residential and business users in \nAlaska, protects access to the pipeline for future gas discoveries, and \nreduces the financial risk resulting from wildly fluctuating gas \nprices.\n  The provisions we added are important to our nation's energy and \neconomic security, and improve the viability of the Alaska gas pipeline \nproject. They should be retained in conference, and I will work with \nSenator Murkowski and Governor Knowles to protect them.\n  That pipeline is one example of how this bill will allow us to use \nour traditional fossil fuel supplies more intelligently.\n  Other examples include tax incentives to increase common-sense \nconservation in our homes, expand the use of renewable energy like \nwind, solar and geothermal power, and encourage investments in new \ntechnologies to help us use energy sources like coal in a more clean \nand efficient manner.\n  And, when it comes to energy efficiency, this bill also says that the \nfederal government must lead by example.\n  I also said at the beginning of this debate that we already look for \nthe ``Made in America'' label on our clothes. We need to put that same \n``Made in America'' label on our energy, too.\n  That's why this bill includes tax incentives to help us diversify our \nenergy supplies by harnessing the power of the wind, the sun, and the \nheat of the earth itself, and to keep the energy produced from those \nsources affordable.\n  And that's also why this bill triples the amount of ethanol we use.\n  Yesterday, I was out in South Dakota at an ethanol plant with \nPresident Bush. I agree with the President when he said, ``[ethanol is] \nimportant for the agricultural sector of our economy, it's an important \npart of making sure we become less reliant on foreign sources of \nenergy.''\n  To that I would add that it's an important way of keeping our air \nclean, as well.\n  Tripling the use of ethanol is a win, win, win, and I'm glad that's \nwhat this bill does.\n  The electricity provisions in this bill will shore up the authority \nof the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to make our electricity \nmore reliable and competitive, and will establish a small but important \nrenewable portfolio standard.\n  Remember, ethanol and renewable energies come from American farmers \nand producers, pass through American refiners, and fuel American energy \nneeds.\n  No soldier will have to fight overseas to protect them. And no \ninternational cartel can turn off the spigot on us.\n  It is important we make sure these provisions stay as part of this \nbill in the conference.\n  On a personal note, I should add that crafting this fuels compromise \ntook enormous effort, and I would like to thank Senators Jim Jeffords \nand Bob Smith of the EPW Committee, as well as Senators Tim Johnson, \nDick Lugar, Ben Nelson and Chuck Hagel for their vision and hard work.\n  I do regret that we failed to keep the vehicle fuel-efficiency \nprovisions that were originally in this bill--something that could have \nbeen done without affecting safety or performance.\n  That measure we would have saved American drivers billions of \ndollars--and saved our nation the same amount of oil we are currently \nimporting from the Persian Gulf.\n  Bold steps like that would have moved us much closer to energy \nindependence, and I hope that we can work to increase vehicle fuel \nefficiency in conference.\n  While I am frustrated that we didn't take that large step forward, \nCongress did the responsible thing by refusing to take a huge step \nbackward by opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil \ndrilling.\n  Ultimately, a bipartisan majority of the Senate concluded that \ndrilling in the Arctic Refuge would do very little to help our economic \nsituation or increase our energy independence--but would do a lot to \ndamage one of the last pieces of pristine wilderness in this country.\n  Finally, this bill reflects the growing bipartisan consensus that the \nthreat of global climate change is real and, unless we act, will have \ndevastating consequences for our children and grandchildren.\n  The climate change provisions in this bill will help restore American \ncredibility in this area and begin the long-overdue process of American \nengagement in solving this growing problem.\n  In the end, this bill recognizes that we can't be content to pursue \nan energy policy based upon the old philosophy of dig, drill, and \nburn--and begins the process of moving towards more innovative \napproaches to our energy future.\n  It doesn't get us all the way there, but it gets us moving in the \nright direction.\n  I am hopeful that we can continue to move even further in that \ndirection when this bill goes to conference. But for that to happen, we \nneed to pass this bill now.\n  It has been six weeks on the floor.\n  We have had a good, open, and fair debate. We've debated and voted on \ndozens of amendments.\n  Let us acknowledge the important role of conservation and renewable \nsources for our nation's energy future.\n   Let us start moving towards a more balanced and far-sighted energy \npolicy.\n  Let us pass this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the substitute \namendment, No. 2917, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2917), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

LANCASTER, OF MINNESOTA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n              DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the nomination of Joan E. Lancaster, of Minnesota, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Joan E. \nLancaster, of Minnesota, to be United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of Minnesota.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with today's votes on Judge William \nGriesbach to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nWisconsin and Justice Joan Lancaster to the United States District \nCourt for the District of Minnesota, the Senate will have confirmed its \n40th and 41st district court judges in the less than 10 months since I \nbecame chairman this past summer. This is in addition to the nine \njudges confirmed to the courts of appeal.\n  With today's votes, the total number of Federal judges confirmed \nsince the change in Senate majority will now be 50. As our action today \ndemonstrates, again, we are moving to confirm President Bush's nominees \nat a faster pace than the nominees of prior Presidents.\n  It took almost 14 months for the Senate to confirm 50 judicial \nnominees for the Reagan administration. It took more than 15 months for \nthe Senate to confirm 50 judicial nominees for the Clinton \nadministration. And it took nearly 18 months for the Senate to confirm \n50 judicial nominees for the George H.W. Bush administration.\n  At the risk of offending some of my colleagues, we have confirmed 50 \njudicial nominees in 10 months--while it took the Senate nearly twice \nthat amount of time to confirm the same number of his father's judicial \nnominees and nearly 50 percent more time to confirm the same number of \nPresident Clinton's and President Reagan's nominees. With today's \nconfirmations, in the fewer than 10 months since the shift to a \nDemocratic majority in the Senate, President Bush's judicial nominees \nhave been confirmed at a rate of five per month, a pace nearly double \nthat of the average for the last three Presidents, two of whom had \nSenates led by their own party.\n  The confirmation of these nominees today demonstrates our commitment \npromptly to consider qualified, consensus nominees. I commend Senator \nKohl and Senator Feingold who worked with Chairman Sensenbrenner to \nutilize a bipartisan commission process to recommend District Court \nnominees as has been the practice in Wisconsin for over 20 years.\n  Once confirmed, Judge Griesbach, who is a well-regarded judge in \nEastern Wisconsin, will be the first District Judge to sit in Green \nBay, WI.\n  Justice Lancaster, like Judge Griesbach, received the support of her \nSenators, Democrats who endorsed this Bush nominee. Both nominees \nappear to be the type of qualified, consensus nominees that the Senate \nhas been confirming expeditiously to help fill vacancies on our Federal \ncourts. I congratulate them and their families.\n  With today's votes on Judge Griesbach and Justice Lancaster, in fewer \nthan 10 months of Democratic leadership, 50 judicial nominees have been \nconfirmed. That number exceeds the number of judicial nominees \nconfirmed during all of 2000, 1999, 1997 and 1996, four out of six full \nyears under Republican leadership. I would like to commend all \nSenators, but in particular the members of the Judiciary Committee, for \ntheir efforts to consider scores of judicial nominees for whom we have \nheld hearings and on whom we have had votes during the last several \nmonths.\n  Mr. HATCH. I rise to support the nomination of Joan Ericksen \nLancaster to be U.S. District Judge for the District of Minnesota.\n  I have had the pleasure of reviewing Justice Lancaster's \ndistinguished legal career, and I have concluded as did President Bush, \nthat she is a fine jurist who will add a great deal to the federal \nbench in Minnesota.\n  Justice Lancaster's record of service in private practice and for the \ngovernment is exemplary of the quality of judges the President has \nnominated.\n  Following her graduation from the University of Minnesota Law School, \nJustice Lancaster worked as an Assistant City Attorney, trying \napproximately 12 jury and 40 court trials.\n  From 1983 to 1993, Justice Lancaster served as an Assistant U.S. \nattorney for the District of Minnesota, representing the federal \ngovernment in medical malpractice, tort, and insurance matters, and \nlater prosecuting Federal crimes. Justice Lancaster then worked for \nseveral years as a partner with the Minneapolis firm of Leonard, Street \n& Deinard.\n  In 1995, Justice Lancaster was named as a District Court Judge in the \n4th Judicial District in Minnesota, where she was assigned to family \nand juvenile cases. She also presided over adult civil and criminal \nmatters.\n  Since 1998, she has served as an Associate Justice on the Minnesota \nSupreme Court.\n  Justice Lancaster is liaison to the Court's Juvenile Delinquency \nRules Committee and has served as chair of the Minnesota Supreme Court \nTask Force on Juvenile Justice Services.\n  She has also served on a statewide task force devoted to addressing \nthe problem of fetal alcohol syndrome.\n  I have every confidence that Justice Joan Lancaster will serve with \ndistinction on the federal district court for the District of \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I commend to the Senate for \nconfirmation tonight the nomination of Justice\n\n[[Page S3419]]\n\nJoan Ericksen Lancaster to serve as a judge of the United States \nDistrict Court in Minnesota. I also thank Chairman Leahy and Senator \nHatch for moving this nomination through the Senate so quickly.\n  Chairman Leahy has been criticized by some Republicans, at times \ngrossly unfairly, for the pace with which certain nominees have come \nthrough the committee. This nomination, which has enjoyed broad \nbipartisan support here in the Senate, has moved very quickly, and for \nthat I am very grateful. It is a model of how this process should work, \nand I would hope the White House would see it in those terms as the \nPresident makes future Federal judicial nominations.\n  The Senate will have no problem offering its advise and consent to \nexperienced, able jurists like Joan Lancaster, with longstanding \nrecords of public service in their communities, who are deeply \ncommitted to equal justice and equal opportunity for all Americans. But \nwhen the President nominates controversial figures with very extreme \nviews, or records which call into question their commitment to equal \nopportunity and equal justice, the Senate will take more time to \nscrutinize those records and to determine if they deserve its consent, \nand reject them if they don't.\n  Justice Lancaster's qualifications are outstanding. She is currently \nserving with distinction as an Associate Justice on the Minnesota \nSupreme Court, and has held that position since 1998. She has also \nserved as a Judge of the 4th District Court in Hennepin County for \nthree years, and as a Partner at the law firm of Leonard, Street and \nDeinard in Minneapolis for two years before that. Particularly relevant \nto the position for which she is being confirmed tonight are her ten \nyears as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of Minnesota, where \nshe provided leadership in both the civil and criminal divisions.\n  Justice Lancaster's compassion, her deep commitment to creating a \nbetter, more just society and her record of public service are \nenormously impressive. She has lived what she speaks. She as a co-chair \nof the Governor's Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, chaired the \nMinnesota Juvenile Justice Services Task Force, chaired a number of \nimportant committees on the operations of the court, and has served on \nthe boards of a host of other important Minnesota-based organizations \ndedicated to the causes of children, the legal system, and education. \nHer stints as a distinguished law professor at the University of \nMinnesota and the William Mitchell College of Law highlight her \nimpressive intellectual and courtroom talents.\n  Through these and her many other professional accomplishments, \nJustice Lancaster has earned the high regard of her peers. She received \na well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association and she was \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously, and has from the \nstart enjoyed my enthusiastic support and that of Senator Dayton.\n  In my conversations with judges, and lawyers who have both practiced \nwith an argued before Justice Lancaster, it is clear that she is widely \nrespected and is seen as a brilliant, thoughtful and independent jurist \nwith a deep commitment to justice and to the American promise of equal \nopportunity for all before the bar of justice. I thank Representative \nRamstad and President Bush for this excellent nomination, and again \nthan Senator Leahy for moving her quickly through the process.\n  I congratulate Justice Lancaster and her wonderful children, John and \nClaire, whom I have had the pleasure to meet. I know Justice Lancaster \nwill continue to serve as an outstanding jurist in Minnesota, and I \noffer her my warn congratulations, anticipating her confirmation. I \ncommend her to the full Senate enthusiastically, and am confident \nshe'll receive an overwhelming vote of support.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the Presiding Officer, Senator \nDayton--unless he is going to be able to join me on the floor--we \ncongratulate Justice Joan Ericksen Lancaster, who will now serve as a \njudge for the United States District Court in Minnesota.\n  She is highly qualified. We thank Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch for \nmoving this so quickly. We thank all of our colleagues.\n  I want to say a special hello to her wonderful children, John and \nClaire. I believe she is watching this proceeding.\n  You should be proud, Judge Lancaster.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I second the comments of the senior \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Joan E.

GRIESBACH, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n              JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of William C. Griesbach, to \nbe United States District Court Judge for the Eastern District of \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to support the confirmation of \nWilliam C. Griesbach to be U.S. District Judge for the District of \nWisconsin.\n  I have had the pleasure of reviewing Mr. Griesbach's distinguished \nlegal career, and I have come to the opinion that he is a fine lawyer \nwho will add a great deal to the Federal bench in Wisconsin.\n  Judge Griesbach is a Wisconsin native and attended both college and \nlaw school in the area. He graduated from Marquette University in 1976 \nand from Marquette University Law School in 1979.\n  After graduation from law school, Judge Griesbach served as a law \nclerk to the Honorable Bruce F. Beilfuss, Chief Justice of the \nWisconsin Supreme Court. He then worked for 2 years as a staff attorney \nfor the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit before joining a \nGreen Bay law firm where he spent 5 years as an attorney handling \nprimarily civil cases, including personal injury, insurance, commercial \nand employment litigation.\n  In 1987, he returned to public service as an Assistant District \nAttorney in Brown County until 1995 when he was appointed to the \nWisconsin Circuit Court for Brown County, the position in which he \ncurrently serves.\n  His docket has included the full range of cases appearing before a \nState trial court, including criminal, civil, juvenile and domestic \nmatters.\n  In 1998, he was ranked highest among local circuit judges in several \ncategories, including temperament, fairness, and judicial scholarship.\n  Judge Griesbach has also made substantial contributions to the \ncommunity, serving as a board member for\n\n[[Page S3420]]\n\nWisconsin Family Ties, a non-profit organization that provides \ninformation and support to families with children that have mental, \nemotional and behavioral disorders; as a board member of the Family \nViolence Center in Green Bay; and as a board member of Legal Services \nof Northeast Wisconsin, a nonprofit organization that provides legal \nservices for the poor.\n  I have every confidence that William Griesbach will serve with \ndistinction on the Federal district court for the District of \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, today is a proud day for the state of \nWisconsin. For 10 years we have worked to establish the Green Bay \njudgeship that makes this day possible. And for far longer, Judge \nGriesbach has developed the ability, gained the experience and \ncultivated the temperament necessary to be the first Federal judge to \nsit in Green Bay.\n  We are confident that Judge Griesbach is the right man for the job. \nHe possesses all the best-qualities that we look for in a judge: \nintelligence, diligence, humility, and integrity.\n  The Green Bay community has waited a long time for a Federal judge. \nWhen Judge Griesbach is sworn in we think they will find it was well \nworth the wait.\n  The lawyers who practice in front of Judge Griesbach agree. In a 1998 \nsurvey by the Green Bay News Chronicle, Brown County attorneys ranked \nJudge Griesbach as the best judge in the area. In fact, he was rated \nfirst in every category polled, including: temperament; fairness; legal \nscholarship; work habits; and decisiveness. That is quite a testament \nto his ability.\n  So, it came as no surprise that the bipartisan Wisconsin Federal \nNominating Commission concluded that Judge Griesbach would make a fine \nFederal judge. For the past 23 years, Wisconsin has used a nominating \ncommission to select candidates for the Federal bench. Through a great \ndeal of cooperation and careful consideration, and by keeping politics \nto a minimum, we always find qualified candidates. Judge Griesbach's \nselection demonstrates that our process has succeeded once again.\n  The Commission's reasons for his recommendation became apparent when \nI met him for our interview. He was candid, humble, and thoughtful. He \nhas impressed everyone. He also made a fine impression during his \nSenate Judiciary Committee hearing.\n  Judge Griesbach will inaugurate a tradition of fair and well-\nrespected jurists in northeastern Wisconsin. I support Judge \nGriesbach's nomination and commend our colleagues for supporting this \nfine judge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of William C. Griesbach, to be United States \nDistrict Court Judge for the Eastern District of Wisconsin? On this \nquestion, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES, I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), and the Senator from \nKansas (Mr. Brownback) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wanted to make note of a very \nimportant fact with regard to judicial nominations. With the \nconfirmation now of the two judges tonight, we have reached an even 50 \nso far since we have become members of the majority. Forty-one district \njudges and nine circuit judges have now been confirmed. We have now \nexceeded the number of judges confirmed in the first year of the Reagan \nadministration, the first Bush administration, and the Clinton \nadministration. We have done that in 10 months, not 12. We will do much \nmore over the course of the next 2 months, but I think it is a record \nof which we can be very proud. It is a record about which we feel very \nstrongly. It is a record we said we would deliver when we became \nmembers of the majority. It is a record I think bears some attention, \nespecially now that we have reached 50 confirmations in this relatively \nbrief period of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3420-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I want to take a moment to \ncongratulate, first, the extraordinary effort made by the Chair of the \nEnergy Committee, Senator Bingaman. I think he has put more time on the \nfloor in the last few weeks than anybody in recent times. Were it not \nfor his patience and extraordinary willingness to work with all of us, \nwe would not be celebrating the successful conclusion of this work \ntoday.\n  I know I speak for all Senators and congratulate him and commend him \nfor the work and leadership he has shown and for the tremendous \ncontributions he has made to public policy in energy today. I am \ngrateful for his friendship, but I am especially appreciative of his \nleadership, and I think that ought to be recognized.\n\n  I also congratulate the ranking member, the Senator from Alaska, for \nhis efforts as well. I know there may not be any more important \nlegislation from the Senator from Alaska than this one. He has \ndemonstrated a resolve and an extraordinary persistence, and were it \nnot for his efforts and the work he has done, especially in recent \nweeks, we would not be here as well. So he also deserves special \ncommendation and recognition for the remarkable job he has done.\n  Finally, as is the case in so many instances, the distinguished \nassistant Democratic leader deserves recognition. He does not like it \nwhen I do this, but I do think it is important for the historical \nrecord to note that his constant presence on the floor, his willingness \nto work with Senators in working through the amendment logjams on so \nmany occasions was absolutely invaluable. So I thank him as well for \nhis constant effort on the floor, but in particular on this bill.\n  I thank all of our colleagues, and I appreciate very much the work \nthat has been done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, before the majority leader leaves, let \nme return the compliment. This was the Daschle-Bingaman bill we passed \nin the Senate. It was his leadership that was absolutely essential in \ngetting this to the floor and his continuing leadership in keeping it \non the floor. He has devoted 6 weeks of Senate floor time to this bill, \nand at many crucial points he made absolutely essential decisions to \nget us to closure.\n  Let me also indicate what everyone in the Senate knows, and that is \nwithout the superb work that Senator Reid, our assistant floor leader, \ndoes, without his tremendous effort, we could not possibly have \ncompleted this work. He was present every day, every hour, moving this \nbill forward, working with\n\n[[Page S3421]]\n\nSenators on both sides of the aisle. To the extent we have succeeded, \nhe deserves the lion's share of the credit.\n  Let me also acknowledge the great work Senator Murkowski has done. He \nhas been committed to getting an energy bill through the Senate for a \nvery long time. He had strongly held views on certain aspects of that \nbill, with which we are all familiar. He was very committed also, \nthough, to work with those of us on this side of the aisle to see to it \nthat we got a bill through the Senate. So I compliment him.\n  I did want to also thank and compliment the excellent staff we had on \nthe Energy Committee. First, I thank Bob Simon, who is the staff \ndirector for the Democratic side in the Energy Committee. He did a \nsuperb job working on every aspect of this.\n  I have a long list of folks to thank. I will run through the list. I \nacknowledge the tremendous contribution each one has made: Vicky \nThorne, who is central to our activity, John Watts, Bill Wicker, Patty \nBeneke, Jonathan Black, David Brooks, Shelley Brown, Mike Connor, \nDeborah Estes, Kira Finkler, Sam Fowler, Amanda Goldman, Leon Lowery, \nJennifer Michael, Shirley Neff, Malini Sekhar. All of those staff \npeople on our Energy Committee did an absolutely superb job. My \npersonal staff, James Dennis, John Epstein, and John Kotek, all made a \ngreat contribution.\n  The floor staff the cloakroom staff did a tremendous job, Lula and \nMarty and all the others who have worked on this bill. They work day in \nand day out on the floor and do a superb job. I appreciate their good \nwork.\n  Senator Daschle's staff, Eric Washburn, Peter Umhofer, and Senator \nReid's staff, Peter Arapis, all did a wonderful job, and I appreciate \nthe good work. Those of us who are elected to these jobs get to take \nthe credit, but we know who actually does the work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Briefly, I note the contribution of our staff. As is \nalways the case, we could not do what we do were it not for them. On \nthis particular bill, I think their contribution will never be fully \ncalculable, but it was invaluable. I thank our floor staff profusely \nfor their effort. As Senator Bingaman noted, Eric Washburn from my \nstaff has been a remarkable contributor to our effort. Were it not for \nhis daily counsel, I would not have been able to accomplish what we \nhave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the majority leader for his comments, and I \nthank my good friend Senator Bingaman. I think it is noteworthy that we \nare at the end of a long road towards a comprehensive energy policy. I, \ntoo, want to thank all of those who worked so tirelessly on the \nlegislation that helped make this momentous achievement possible. I \nthink it was nearly 7 weeks that we have been on this bill. We have \nlost a little track of time.\n  Indeed, the staffs of both the majority and the minority of the \nEnergy Committee have done a tremendous job, and we owe them a debt of \nthanks. I think we have had over 400 amendments we have reviewed and \ndispensed with over the course of this period of time.\n  I, of course, thank my own team for their dedication and work. To \nthose on the other side, I thank them as well for their work, their \ncooperation, their professionalism, and that of the professional staff. \nThey can be very proud of their efforts.\n  I am appreciative of my relationship with Senator Bingaman and his \ncommitment to proceed with this bill. He has truly proceeded as a \ngentleman during the debate.\n  I think the recognition of Senator Reid is most noteworthy because \nSenator Reid has been very cooperative in moving this process along, \nand Senator Daschle, without his overall support and commitment to stay \nwith the bill, the bill may have been pulled at previous times or \nanywhere along the way. That was not the case. I think we both \nrecognize that this bill came about in a rather unusual manner, but I \nthink we worked diligently through the amendment process to come up \nwith something of which we can be proud.\n  So I congratulate everyone on a job well done. I think it is fair to \nsay that the passage of this bill culminates my almost 22 years in the \nSenate. It is not all I had wished for, but, by the same token, the \nglass is either half full or half empty. Today, as far as the Senator \nfrom Alaska is concerned, it is a little more than half full. Around \nhere sometimes those are pretty good odds.\n  We did get the gas line provision in; we got a heavy oil provision, \nboth of which are very important for my State as well. So as we look to \nthe conference and the conferees, we look to proceeding with the work \nahead.\n  I also thank the Republican leader, who has been with us in this \nentire matter. Senator Lott, at the beginning of the 107th Congress, \ndeclared that getting an energy bill passed would be one of the \nRepublicans' top five priorities. He stood by us side by side at the \nextended press conferences that we have had for over a year. He has \nalways been supportive. Once the energy bill came to the floor this \nyear, the leader established an energy task force and held daily \nmeetings directing our efforts each morning at 9 a.m. I am not sure \nwhere we will go at 9 a.m., we are so programmed.\n\n  He promised, although we had reservations, it was our ticket to \nconference and we would work to improve it on the floor and get to \nconference. That is what has happened. Now, hopefully, the report will \nbe forthcoming and we will get a bill to the President. We thank \nSenator Lott for his leadership.\n  We made significant progress in many aspects. They speak for \nthemselves: CAFE, electricity, renewables, and so forth.\n  I recognize the efforts of our Commander in Chief, President George \nW. Bush. Today is a great victory for George W. Bush and his programs. \nWe all recognize the world is a different place today than it was when \nthe effort started more than a year ago. We have seen the tragic events \nthat reshaped our national focus. But we underscore the need for a \nnational energy policy. Now more than ever we need an energy policy \nwith solutions, solutions that begin at home.\n  The administration's national energy policy has served as a \nlegislative blueprint for the energy debate that has taken place in the \nCongress. This is what we have had. We have had a committee process \nmore or less on the floor of the Senate. We have made it work. Between \nthe House-passed H.R. 4 and the Senate bill, nearly every one of the \nPresident's initiatives have been adopted. The President has been a \ntrue leader on this issue. Today marks a great victory for him. I am \npleased to have been a part of this success.\n  Our work is not done. There is more to do. The Senate goes into \nconference with NASA programs dealing with ethanol, renewable portfolio \nstandards, the Alaska gas issue, electricity, climate change, and ANWR \nis in the House bill. These provisions will have to be worked out in \nwhat will likely be a very difficult conference. We are up to the \nchallenge and we look forward to working with our House Members and \nChairman Tauzin. I believe the House leadership and the administration \ncertainly are up to it. Working with our colleagues on the other side, \nI think we can get a bill to the President this year.\n  In closing, remember, we must get a plan to the President not because \nit is the President's legislation or his priority, and not because it \nis the Senate's legislation or the Senate's priority, but because it is \nthe people's priority. That is our obligation--reliable affordable \nenergy supply that powers this Nation. It is up to us to deliver this \ncomprehensive bill. Without such a stable energy supply, our security \nis threatened, whether it is economic security, personal security at \nhome, at work, or our national security on the world stage. Energy \nmeans security.\n  I thank the staff director, Brian Malnak, for his tireless work; Jim \nBeirne, chief counsel; Bryan Hannegan, staff scientist. I thank staff \nassistants Dan Kish, Christine Drager, Mike Merge, Howard Useem, \nColleen Deegan, David Woodruff, Joe Brenckle, Frank Gladics, Jack \nPhelps, Jim O'Toole, Josh Bowlen, Julia Gray, Shane Perkins, Jared \nStubbs, Macy Bell, and Dick Bouts; our personal office staff: Alexander \nPolinsky, Joel Gilbertson, Chuck Kleeschulte, Charles Freeman, Isaac \nEdwards, Chris Eyler, Kristin Daimler, Julie Teer, Sarah Berk,\n\n[[Page S3422]]\n\nCarrie Lehman, and Jerry Ritter. They have done a magnificent job.\n  If I left anybody off the payroll, I apologize.\n  I congratulate my good friend, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Reid for \nmaking this possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, \nPrince Abdullah, met with President Bush in Crawford, TX. Based on the \nreports from that meeting, there were several items on the agenda, one \nof which was the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, and \nthe other was the nature of the Saudi-U.S. bilateral relationship.\n  A report this morning in the New York Times said that the Crown \nPrince intended to deliver a ``blunt message'' to President Bush. \nApparently, a Saudi official indicated after that meeting that oil \nwould not be used as a weapon. Earlier, an unnamed Saudi official said \nthat we, the United States, may face a ``strategic debacle'' unless we \nalter our relationship with Israel.\n  There is nothing wrong with blunt messages and blunt talk between \nfriends. I am confident the President of the United States was equally \nblunt in the message he delivered. No doubt the Crown Prince discussed \nways to advance his initiative with regard to Israel, a breakthrough \nthat I publicly stated several times in recent weeks has not been fully \nappreciated by the world.\n  The Saudis had endorsed unanimously at the Arab League meeting last \nmonth in Beirut a plan that holds out hope for normal peaceful \nrelations between Arab States and Israel. However, laying down that \nplan is not enough. It is time for more mature leadership.\n  We have been asked by the rest of the world and the Crown Prince to \ntake an active role in supporting this plan. That is fine. However, I \nadd, I hope the President discussed what active role the Saudis should \ntake in dealing with peace in the Middle East. When the Crown Prince \ngoes home, what concrete steps will he take to move the process \nforward, to create a new environment that builds trust and hope for a \npolitical settlement?\n\n  I am troubled by the apparent disconnect between the initiatives for \npeace taken by the Crown Prince and his nation and the contradictory \nbehavior that is prevalent in Saudi Arabia and its policies. For \nexample, in March the Saudi newspaper, Al-Riyadh, carried a vile, anti-\nSemitic article by someone claiming to be a professor. The article \nresurrected the centuries-old blood libel that civilized people would \nhave thought was a thing of the past. This Saudi professor, in a \nleading Saudi newspaper, wrote for the Jewish holidays: ``Blood must be \ntaken from a non-Jew, dried, and mixed with dough to make pastries.'' \nIt goes on to say that using human blood in pastries was a ``well-\nestablished fact historically and legally throughout the history of \nmankind and that this was one of the main reasons for the persecution \nof Jews and the exile of Jews in Europe and Asia at different times.''\n  Finally, the article says: ``The needles enter the body extremely \nslowly causing immense pain that gives the Jewish vampires extreme \npleasure and they closely monitor this bloodletting in detail with \npleasure and enjoyment that is beyond comprehension.''\n  That is printed in a leading Saudi newspaper. The editor of that \npaper says that he was out of town when this article appeared, and \nlater wrote that it was unworthy of publication.\n  Forgive me if I have a hard time believing that the article simply \nslipped through the cracks and that it was a fluke. I can believe many \nthings about Saudi Arabia, but freedom of the press is not one of them. \nThis article was published because no one who saw it believed that it \ncontained anything offensive or untrue.\n  Imagine the outrage in Riyadh, in Cairo, in Amman, in the United \nNations, and elsewhere if a Jewish professor published an article in an \nAmerican paper saying that Muslim holiday feasts were prepared with the \nblood of ritualistically sacrificed Jews? Can anyone imagine what the \nSaudis would expect of the President of the United States, what the \nSaudis and the rest of the civilized world would rightly expect of all \nUnited States Senators who had nothing to do with it being published, \nbut saw it published? The civilized world would demand of us, as they \nwould have a right to, that we, the leaders of this country, stand up \none at a time and disavow these vile, vile, vile diatribes.\n\n  What did people expect of us, and what did our President do, when a \ngroup of mostly Saudi citizens killed thousands of Americans on the \n11th? The President did the right thing. He stood up and he said: This \nis not about Saudi Arabia, this is not about Muslims. He did the right \nthing.\n  I wonder what would have happened had it been the reverse. I wonder \nwhat would happen.\n  It is time for some mature leadership here. It is not enough just to \nlay down a good plan--and it is a good plan the Saudi Crown Prince laid \ndown and which was adopted in Beirut. What would the Saudis expect us \nto say, though, were the roles reversed? What action would they demand \nof the President if in fact such vile lies were printed about Muslims \nand Saudis in an American paper? And what would the rest of the world \nhave us say about such slander, in a country where there is freedom of \nthe press, the United States?\n  Another example of this disconnect that baffles me is the recent \ntelethon, ordered by King Fahd, which, according to press reports, \nraised over $85 million for families of so-called Palestinian martyrs. \nAccording to the Saudi Government, these people are defined as people \n``victimized by Israeli terror and violence.'' But in the common \nparlance of the region, this term often refers to suicide bombers.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, in which 15 Saudis engaged in the \nmost deadly suicide attacks in history, one would hope the Saudi \nGovernment might think twice before offering financial incentives for \nso-called martyrdom.\n  Imagine if the President of the United States and the Members of the \nCongress contributed to a telethon for someone who walked into a hotel \nin Riyadh and killed 100 Muslims. What would we say? What would we be \nexpected to say? What would we think? What would happen if the \nPresident of the United States said: We condemn it, but we understand \nthe frustration of the Saudi people, in having no democracy? We \nunderstand the frustration of the Jewish people, being victims of \nsuicide bombing? It would be an outrage, an outrage. And the whole \nworld would say: Where is the moral leadership of the United States?\n  But the Saudi support for the cult of martyrdom is not restricted to \noffering financial incentives. Recently the Saudi Ambassador to the \nUnited Kingdom wrote a poem entitled ``The Martyrs.'' The poem appeared \nin Arabic language newspapers and praised Palestinian suicide bombers, \nparticularly a young deranged Palestinian woman from a refugee camp who \nkilled herself and two Israelis on March 29. The Ambassador refers to \nher as ``the bride of loftiness.''\n  This is written by the Saudi Ambassador to the United Kingdom.\n\n     She embraces death with a smile\n     while the leaders are running away from death . . .\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n     We complained to the idols of a white house whose heart is \n           filled with darkness.\n\n  Given the opportunity to renounce this poem, a Saudi spokesman said \non United States television:\n\n       The ambassador is a very well known poet . . . he was \n     expressing the anger and frustration people feel.\n\n  Give me a break. That is not good enough. I personally met with this \nspokesman, who is a fine man. I expected more from a man as educated \nand sophisticated as Mr. Al-Jubeir. If an American diplomat wrote a \npoem--\n\n[[Page S3423]]\n\nif the Ambassador from the United States to England wrote a poem \nextolling terrorism and attacking the leader of an ally, the President \nof the United States would have his or her head on a platter the next \nday. They would be fired.\n\n  What would happen if an ambassador of the United States to another \ngreat country wrote a poem that extolled the virtues of some Saudi \ncitizen who--like bin Laden--attempted to assassinate or was engaged in \na plot to do harm to the royal family? What would the Saudis expect of \nus? What would the Saudis, or any civilized nation, expect the United \nStates President to do? They would expect him to do exactly what he \nwould do: Fire the person on the spot, and vocally, in more than one \nlanguage, disavow the poetry.\n  Since September 11, we have become all too familiar with the term \n``madrassa,'' a term probably few had ever heard of in the United \nStates. We have learned that madrassas are religious schools. We have \nlearned the extent to which funds from Saudi Arabia have supported \nmadrassas, over 7,000 of them in Pakistan and in Afghanistan. We have \nlearned that many madrassas indoctrinate children with distorted and \nhateful ideas.\n  But now we have learned that the problem with education is not simply \noutside of Saudi Arabian borders, but within the kingdom itself. \nAccording to an article in last October's New York Times, 10th grade \ntextbooks in Saudi Arabia warn students to ``consider the infidel their \nenemy.''\n  Saudis claim such quotes are taken out of context, but in what \ncontext is religious prejudice acceptable?\n  Of course, hateful diatribes and words of incitement also are found \nin Palestinian textbooks.\n  While Arafat is talking about peace in Oslo, the textbooks in the \nWest Bank talk about ``the hated Jew.'' And they have long been \naccompanied by schoolroom maps in the Middle East that pointedly do not \nshow, even on a map, Israel as a state. When our Saudi friends argue \ntheir support and funding for Palestinian causes is for humanitarian \nand educational purposes, I think it is fair to ask why they continue \nto turn a blind eye toward this fomenting of hate that exists in their \nregion and their country.\n  I mention these examples to illustrate why there is a disconnect when \nwe hear Saudi leaders talk of making peace with Israel.\n  Peace will not happen by itself. It has to be nurtured. Certainly \nthose Arab nations we put in the moderate camp ought to prepare their \npeople for the ``normal, peaceful relations'' they espoused in Beirut. \nIf the Crown Prince means what he says about normal, peaceful relations \nwith Israel--and I believe he does--then it is time for his government \nto prepare Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Arab world for this new \nday. No responsible leaders want to see bloodshed continue in the \nMiddle East. We all want for it to end immediately. All of us would \nlike to see a peaceful settlement. To make it happen, everyone--\neveryone--must shoulder responsibility.\n  It is time for big nations and serious leaders to stand up, to stand \nup and speak the truth. It is time for nations with the ability to \ndirectly influence events to exercise simply mature leadership.\n  I am not expecting the Saudis to all of a sudden take a pro-Israeli \nposition. But I am expecting, I do demand of them as a civilized nation \nand a mature country, to do the right thing.\n  The United States must do its part, too. I have urged the \nadministration to increase its involvement, not only in resolving the \ncurrent crisis but also convening an international peace conference \nthat would move the parties quickly to a political solution or at least \nprovide a political horizon.\n  The Arab world must demonstrate mature leadership as well. It cannot \nsimply demand that the United States abandon Israel, something we will \nnever do.\n  Let me say that again: Something we will never do. Over my dead \nphysical political body will we ever abandon Israel. But that does not \nmean we believe everything Israel does is right. It does mean, though, \nwe will fight for Israel's right to exist within secure borders.\n  Mature leadership means taking risks and confronting those forces \nthat hinder progress--not abetting those forces.\n  Mature leadership means condemning terrorism--not extolling the \nvirtues of ``martyrdom.''\n  Mature leadership means halting the flow of funds to terrorists--not \nproviding financial incentives for more terror.\n  Mature leadership means creating an educational system that provides \nthe foundation for future progress--not text and textbooks that promote \nreligious bigotry.\n  Mature leadership means being responsive to the legitimate demands of \none's citizen for political openness and transparency--not stifling \ndissent and exporting your problems elsewhere.\n  Mature leadership means sitting down with the Israelis and talking \npeace--not treating them as pariahs.\n  I find it fascinating that the President was criticized for \nauthorizing and directing the Secretary of State to sit down with the \nperson who many Israelis consider a pariah and who many of us consider \na pariah--Yasser Arafat. The Saudis thought that was essential. Why \nwill they not sit down? Why will they not sit down with a man who is \nthe elected leader of Israel, regardless of whether or not they think \non the West Bank he is a pariah as many Israelis and Americans think is \nthe case with Mr. Arafat?\n  The President has shown mature leadership. I may disagree with his \napproach, but why is it expected of us and not of them?\n  As the birthplace of Islam and the land of the holiest Muslim sites, \nSaudi Arabia has a critical role to play in resolving one of the most \nintractable conflicts of our time.\n  This is an opportunity for the Saudi Royal Family to make a real \ncontribution to peace. They have taken the first steps with bold action \nthat holds out hope for peace as they presented their peace plan.\n  Now let them take the next step of mature, consistent leadership. Let \nthem denounce the Palestinian leadership that uses terror to gain \npolitical leverage. Let them denounce hateful language. Let them \ndenounce the incitement to violence in textbooks and in the media.\n  I hope they will take the next step so the Saudi initiative will not \nbecome just another missed opportunity--an interesting footnote in \nhistory.\n  I hope our relationship with the Saudis can improve. I hope the Saudi \nArabian citizens can begin to enjoy the freedom they deserve.\n  But these things can only occur with farsighted, mature leadership.\n  There has never been a time when we have needed such leadership more \nthan it is needed now. I hope that kind of leadership will enable our \ntwo countries to move forward together to achieve progress and peace--\nnot just for the Israelis and Palestinians but for all the people of \nthe Middle East.\n  I urge the administration to increase its involvement--not only in \nthe present circumstance but beyond.\n  Let us be honest. This is a historic opportunity. The Saudis have \nmade a significant proposal. I beg them, do not squander the \nopportunity to be remembered for the century as the party and the force \nthat was the catalyst for bringing an end to the suffering of the \npeople in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3423-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3423-S3424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL DAN L. LOCKER, COMMANDER, 81ST MEDICAL \n                GROUP AND LEAD AGENT, TRICARE REGION IV\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to \nrecognize one of the finest officers in the U.S. Air Force, Brigadier \nGeneral Dan L. Locker. On July 31, 2002, General Locker will retire \nfrom the Air Force and his positions as Commander of the 81st Medical \nGroup, Keesler Medical Center, Keesler Air Force Base, MS, and Lead \nAgent for Department of Defense TRICARE Region IV. During his time at \nKeesler Air Force Base, General Locker has exemplified the Air Force \ncore values of integrity, service before self, and excellence in all \nendeavors. Many Members and staff have enjoyed the opportunity to meet \nwith him on a variety of Department of Defense health care issues and \nhave come to appreciate his many talents. Today it is my privilege to \nrecognize some of Dan's many accomplishments since he\n\n[[Page S3424]]\n\nentered the military 30 years ago, and to commend the superb service he \nprovided the Air Force, the Congress, and our Nation.\n  Dan Locker was commissioned in the Air Force Reserve in 1970 through \nthe Health Professions Scholarship Program. A proud Texan, he completed \nhis bachelor's degree in biology at Southwest Texas State College in \n1967. He entered active duty in 1972, and received his Doctor of \nMedicine degree in 1973 from the University of Texas Medical School in \nSan Antonio. He then completed residencies in family practice at Scott \nAir Force Base, IL, and general surgery at Keesler Air Force Base, MS. \nAn active chief flight surgeon, General Locker has logged more than \n1,000 hours of flight time in numerous military aircraft, including 21 \ncombat missions and 25 combat hours.\n  From early in his career, General Locker's exceptional leadership \nskills were always evident to both superiors and subordinates as he \nrepeatedly proved himself in numerous select command positions. He was \nthe Chief of Surgical Services in his first post-residency assignment \nat Mountain Home Air Force Base, ID. From there, he went overseas to \nserve as Chief of General Surgery and Director of U.S. Air Forces in \nEurope Flying Ambulance Surgical Trauma teams in Wiesbaden, Germany. \nWhile in Germany, he also was the military consultant to the Air Force \nSurgeon General for general surgery. Next, he moved to the Royal Air \nForce Lakenheath, England, where he served as deputy commander for \nhospital services. Then it was back to Texas to command, first, the \n96th Strategic Hospital at Dyess Air Force Base, and then the 82nd \nMedical Group at Sheppard Air Force Base. After proving his staff \nproficiency as Director of Medical Service Officer Management at the \nAir Force Military Personnel Center at Randolph Air Force Base, TX, \nthen-Colonel Locker, was summoned to be the Command Surgeon at \nHeadquarters, U.S. Air Forces in Europe in Ramstein Air Base, Germany. \nWhile in that position, he was responsible for management, resources, \nand oversight of all health care provided at 12 Air Force clinics, \nhospitals, and medical centers throughout Europe.\n  In 1997, Dan Locker was promoted to brigadier general, and was \nselected for his current high-profile position as commander of the \nsecond largest medical center in the Air Force at Keesler Air Force \nBase in the great State of Mississippi. General Locker took Keesler \nMedical Center to new heights, earning the 81st Medical Group the Air \nForce Outstanding Unit Award, the Department of Defense TRICARE \nCustomer Service Award, and the TRICARE Access to Care Award. The \nTRICARE honors resulted in a $100,000 cash award, that was used to \nimprove the quality of life and benefit the more than 2,000 health care \nprofessionals of the 81st Medical Group at Keesler. General Locker has \nworked diligently to hone the military professionalism of the ``Combat \nMedics'' at Keesler Medical Center, which is responsible for the direct \ndelivery of health care to more than 50,000 patients in the Keesler \narea, and provides referral and consultative services to an additional \n605,000 beneficiaries in a 5-State region.\n\n  As Lead Agent for TRICARE Region IV, General Locker is responsible \nfor the direction of all managed health care activities at 23 military \ntreatment facilities throughout all of Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, \nand parts of Louisiana and Florida. In addition, through a $4 billion \ncontract with Humana Military Healthcare Services, he is responsible \nfor the provision of care to all military beneficiaries in the region. \nThe Managed Care Support Contract relationship with Humana was so \nstrong that both parties were recognized by the National Managed Health \nCare Congress with the 2001 AstraZeneca Partnership Award for improving \nthe delivery of health care throughout the Gulf-South Region.\n  A dynamic and skilled lecturer, General Locker has delivered \npresentations around the world on a variety of clinical and \ntechnological health care issues to a broad range of audiences, both \nmilitary and civilian. Still active in his surgical practice, he spends \na week each winter, leading a team on a humanitarian mission trip to \nMexico to help provide much-needed care to rural and under-served \npatients. Just last week, he was presented the prestigious Excalibur \nAward by the Society of Air Force Clinical Surgeons for demonstrating \nthe highest personal dedication, surgical competence, and providing \nleadership and vision to further advance the field of surgery.\n  I offer my congratulations to Dan, his wife, Cynthia, daughters, \nValerie and Rachel, and son, Ryan. The Congress and the country applaud \nthe selfless commitment his entire family has made to the Nation in \nsupporting his military career.\n  I know I speak for all of my colleagues in expressing my heartfelt \nappreciation to General Locker. He is a credit to both the Air Force \nand the United States. We wish our friend the best of luck in his \nretirement and we look forward to working with General Locker in his \nnext career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3424-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3424-S3425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL ROOSEVELT ``TED'' MERCER, JR., COMMANDANT, \n                       JOINT FORCES STAFF COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to \nrecognize one of the finest officers in the United States Air Force, \nBrigadier General Roosevelt ``Ted'' Mercer, Jr. On May 9, 2002, General \nMercer will become the Commandant of Joint Forces Staff College at the \nNational Defense University in Norfolk, VA. He will be leaving the job \nas Commander of the 81st Training Wing at Keesler AFB MS, a position he \nhas held and executed with great pride, leadership, and honor. During \nhis time at Keesler, as Commander of the 81st Training Wing, General \nMercer personified the Air Force core values of integrity, service \nbefore self, and excellence in all things. Many Members and staff \nenjoyed the opportunity to meet with him on a variety of Air Force \nissues and came to appreciate his many talents. Today it is my \nprivilege to recognize some of Ted's many accomplishments since he \nentered the military 27 years ago, and to commend the superb service he \nprovided the Air Force, the Congress and our Nation.\n  Ted Mercer entered the Air Force through the Reserve Officer Training \nCorps program at University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington. While \nthere, he completed his bachelor's degree in urban planning in 1975, as \nwell as being a distinguished graduate of the university's ROTC \nprogram. Upon graduation, he was assigned to Vandenberg Air Force Base \nin California, where he became proficient in Titan II missile combat \ncrew operations, so much so that by 1980 he became an instructor in \nmissile combat crew operations at Vandenberg.\n  From early in his career, General Mercer's exceptional leadership \nskills were always evident to both superiors and subordinates as he \nrepeatedly proved himself in numerous select command positions. He was \nthe Commander of the 447th Strategic Missile Squadron at Grand Forks \nAir Force Base, North Dakota; Commander of the 45th Logistics Group at \nPatrick Air Force Base, Florida; and at Minot Air Force Base, North \nDakota he was Commander of the 91st Operations Group. In June 1998, he \nassumed command of the 30th Space Wing at Vandenberg Air Force Base, \nCalifornia. As I've stated earlier, he superbly led the 81st Training \nWing at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi from September 2000 until \nMay 2002.\n  Ted Mercer also has excelled in a variety of key staff assignments. \nThese include serving as Deputy Director of Operations, Headquarters \nU.S. Space Command at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado; Vice Director \nof Plans, Directorate of Plans, Headquarters U.S. Space Command at \nPeterson Air Force Base, Colorado; Chief, Nuclear Division, Directorate \nof Plans and Policy, Headquarters U.S. European Command, Stuttgart, \nGermany; and Executive Officer, Directorate of Personnel Plans, Deputy \nChief of Staff for Personnel, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington \nDC. General Mercer also served as Chief of Congressional Affairs, \nDeputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Headquarters U.S. Air Force in \nWashington DC, and has been awarded a Defense Superior Service Medal \nand Legion of Merit among other decorations.\n  We were all pleased to see General Mercer selected as Commandant of \nthe Joint Forces Staff College at the National Defense University in \nNorfolk, VA. I offer my congratulations to him,\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\nhis wife, Mike, and daughter, Sidnee, on this new assignment. The \nCongress and the country applaud the selfless commitment his entire \nfamily has made to the Nation in supporting his military career.\n  I know I speak for all of my colleagues in expressing my heartfelt \nappreciation to General Ted Mercer. He is a credit to both the Air \nForce and the United States of America. We wish our friend the best of \nluck in his new command.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3425-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3425-S3427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ARTHUR M. SCHLESINGER, JR. ON AMERICAN DEMOCRACY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, few individuals have made a greater \ncontribution to the study of American history than Professor Arthur M. \nSchlesinger, Jr.\n  Arthur's been a pre-eminent historian for over half a century, ever \nsince 1946, when he won the Pulitzer Prize at the age of 28, for his \nbook ``The Age of Jackson.''\n  As Oscar Wilde once said--anybody can make history but only a truly \ngreat man can write history. And Arthur Schlesinger has written about \nhistory with unsurpassed eloquence, and he's shaped that history with \nhis unsurpassed wisdom and scholarship. In so many ways, Arthur \nSchlesinger represents the best of the liberal and progressive ideal in \nthe 20th century.\n  Arthur Schlesinger continues to represent these ideals in the 21st \ncentury, and I believe that his article on the 2000 presidential \nelection published in last month's issue of The American Prospect will \nbe of interest to all of us in Congress. I ask unanimous consent that \nit may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the American Prospect, Mar. 25, 2002]\n\n                        Not the People's Choice\n\n                    (By Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.)\n\n       The true significance of the disputed 2000 election has \n     thus far escaped public attention. This was an election that \n     made the loser of the popular vote the president of the \n     United States. But that astounding fact has been obscured: \n     first by the flood of electoral complaints about deceptive \n     ballots, hanging chads, and so on in Florida; then by the \n     political astuteness of the court-appointed president in \n     behaving as if he had won the White House by a landslide; and \n     now by the effect of September 11 in presidentializing George \n     W. Bush and giving him commanding popularity in the polls.\n       ``The fundamental maxim of republican government,'' \n     observed Alexander Hamilton in the 22d Federalist, ``requires \n     that the sense of the majority should prevail.'' A reasonable \n     deduction from Hamilton's premise is that the presidential \n     candidate who wins the most votes in an election should also \n     win the election. That quite the opposite can happen is \n     surely the great anomaly in the American democratic order.\n       Yet the National Commission on Federal Election Reform, a \n     body appointed in the wake of the 2000 election and co-\n     chaired (honorarily) by former Presidents Gerald Ford and \n     Jimmy Carter, virtually ignored it. Last August, in a report \n     optimistically entitled To Assure Pride and Confidence in the \n     Electoral Process, the commission concluded that it had \n     satisfactorily addressed ``most of the problems that came \n     into national view'' in 2000. But nothing in the ponderous \n     80-page document addressed the most fundamental problem that \n     came into national view: the constitutional anomaly that \n     permits the people's choice to be refused the presidency.\n       Little consumed more time during our nation's \n     Constitutional Convention than debate over the mode of \n     choosing the chief executive. The framers, determined to \n     ensure the separation of powers, rejected the proposal that \n     Congress elect the president. Both James Madison and James \n     Wilson, the ``fathers'' of the Constitution, argued for \n     direct election by the people, but the convention, fearing \n     the parochialism of uninformed voters, also rejected that \n     plan. In the end, the framers agree on the novel device of \n     an electoral college. Each state would appoint electors \n     equal in number to its representation in Congress. The \n     electors would then vote for two persons. The one \n     receiving a majority of electoral votes would then become \n     president; the runner-up, vice president. And in a key \n     sentence, the Constitution stipulated that of these two \n     persons at least one should not be from the same state as \n     the electors.\n       The convention expected the electors to be cosmopolitans \n     who would know, or know of, eminences in other states. But \n     this does not mean that they were created as free agents \n     authorized to routinely ignore or invalidate the choice of \n     the voters. The electors, said John Clopton, a Virginia \n     congressman, are the ``organs . . . acting from a certain and \n     unquestioned knowledge of the choice of the people, by whom \n     they themselves were appointed, and under immediate \n     responsibility to them.''\n       Madison summed it up when the convention finally adopted \n     the electoral college: ``The president is now to be elected \n     by the people.'' The president, he assured the Virginia \n     ratifying convention, would be ``the choice of the people at \n     large.'' In the First Congress, he described the president as \n     appointed ``by the suffrage of three million people.''\n       ``It was desirable,'' Alexander Hamilton wrote in the 68th \n     Federalist, ``that the sense of the people should operate in \n     the choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to \n     be confided.'' As Lucius Wilmerding, Jr., concluded in his \n     magistral study of the electoral college: ``The Electors were \n     never meant to choose the President but only to pronounce the \n     votes of the people.''\n       Even with such a limited function, however, the electoral \n     college has shaped the contours of American politics and thus \n     captured the attention of politicians. With the ratification \n     of the 12th Amendment in 1804, electors were required to vote \n     separately for president and vice president, a change that \n     virtually guaranteed that both would be of the same party. \n     Though unknown to the Constitution and deplored by the \n     framers, political parties were remolding presidential \n     elections. By 1836 every state except South Carolina had \n     decided to cast its votes as a unit--winner take all, no \n     matter how narrow the margin. This decision minimized the \n     power of third parties and created a solid foundation for a \n     two-party system.\n       ``The mode of appointment of the Chief Magistrate \n     [President] of the United States,'' wrote Hamilton in the \n     68th Federalist, ``is almost the only part of the system, of \n     any consequence, which has escaped without severe censure.'' \n     This may have been true when Hamilton wrote in 1788; it was \n     definitely not true thereafter. According to the \n     Congressional Research Service, legislators since the First \n     Congress have offered more than a thousand proposals to alter \n     the mode of choosing presidents.\n       No legislator has advocated the election of the president \n     by Congress. Some have advocated modifications in the \n     electoral college--to change the electoral units from states \n     to congressional districts, for example, or to require a \n     proportional division of electoral votes. In the 1950s, the \n     latter approach received considerable congressional favor in \n     a plan proposed by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., and \n     Representative Ed Gossett. The Lodge-Gossett amendment would \n     have ended the winner-take-all electoral system and divided \n     each state's electoral vote according to the popular vote. In \n     1950 the Senate endorsed the amendment, but the House turned \n     it down. Five years later, Senator Estes Kefauver revived the \n     Lodge-Gossett plan and won the backing of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee. A thoughtful debate ensued, with \n     Senators John F. Kennedy and Paul H. Douglas leading the \n     opposition and defeating the amendment.\n       Neither the district plan nor the proportionate plan would \n     prevent a popular-vote loser from winning the White House. To \n     correct this great anomaly of the Constitution, many have \n     advocated the abolition of the electoral college and its \n     replacement by direct popular elections. The first \n     ``minority'' president was John Quincy Adams. In the 1824 \n     election, Andrew Jackson led in both popular and electoral \n     votes; but with four candidates dividing the electoral vote, \n     he failed to win an electoral-college majority. The \n     Constitution provides that if no candidate has a majority, \n     the House of Representatives must choose among the top three. \n     Speaker of the House Henry Clay, who came in fourth, threw \n     his support to Adams, thereby making him president. When \n     Adams then made Clay his secretary of state, Jacksonian cries \n     of ``corrupt bargain'' filled the air for the next four years \n     and helped Jackson win the electoral majority in 1828.\n       ``To the people belongs the right of electing their Chief \n     Magistrate,'' Jackson told Congress in 1829. ``The first \n     principle of our system,'' he said, is ``that the majority is \n     to govern.'' He asked for the removal of all ``intermediate'' \n     agencies preventing a ``fair expression of the will of the \n     majority.'' And in a tacit verdict on Adams's failed \n     administration, Jackson added: ``A President elected by a \n     minority can not enjoy the confidence necessary to the \n     successful discharge of his duties.''\n       History bears out Jackson's point. The next two minority \n     presidents--Rutherford B. Hayes in 1877 and Benjamin Harrison \n     in 1889--had, like Adams, ineffectual administrations. All \n     suffered setbacks in their midterm congressional elections. \n     None won a second term in the White House.\n       The most recent president to propose a direct-election \n     amendment was Jimmy Carter in 1997. The amendment, he said, \n     would ``ensure that the candidate chosen by the votes \n     actually becomes President. Under the Electoral College, it \n     is always possible that the winner of the popular vote will \n     not be elected.'' This had already happened, Carter said, in \n     1824, 1876, and 1888.\n       Actually, Carter placed too much blame on the electoral \n     system. Neither J.Q. Adams in 1824 nor Hayes in 1876 owed his \n     elevation to the electoral college. The House of \n     Representatives, as noted, elected Adams. Hayes's \n     anointment was more complicated.\n       In 1876, Samuel J. Tilden, the Democratic candidate, won \n     the popular vote, and it appeared that he had won the \n     electoral vote too. But the Confederate states were still \n     under military occupation, and electoral boards in Florida, \n     Louisiana, and South Carolina disqualified enough Democratic \n     ballots to give Hayes, the Republican candidate, the \n     electoral majority.\n\n[[Page S3426]]\n\n       The Republicans controlled the Senate; the Democrats, the \n     House. Which body would count the electoral votes? To resolve \n     the deadlock, Congress appointed an electoral commission. By \n     an 8-7 party-line vote, the commission gave all the disputed \n     votes to Hayes. This was a supreme election swindle. But it \n     was the rigged electoral commission, not the electoral \n     college, that denied the popular-vote winner the presidency.\n       In 1888 the electoral college did deprive the popular-vote \n     winner, Democrat Grover Cleveland, of victory. But 1888 was a \n     clouded election. Neither candidate received a majority, and \n     Cleveland's margin was only 100,000 votes. Moreover, the \n     claim was made, and was widely accepted at the time and by \n     scholars since, that white election officials in the South \n     banned perhaps 300,000 black Republicans from the polls. The \n     installation of a minority president in 1889 took place \n     without serious protest.\n       The Republic later went through several other elections in \n     which a small shift of votes would have given the popular-\n     vote loser an electoral-college victory. In 1916, if Charles \n     Evans Hughes had gained 4,000 votes in California, he would \n     have won the electoral-college majority, though he lost the \n     popular vote to Woodrow Wilson by more than half a million. \n     In 1948, a shift of fewer than 30,000 votes in three states \n     would have given Thomas E. Dewey the electoral-college \n     majority, though he ran more than two million votes behind \n     Harry Truman. In 1976, a shift of 8,000 votes in two states \n     would have kept President Gerald Ford in office, though he \n     ran more than a million and a half votes behind Jimmy Carter.\n       Over the last half-century, many other eminent politicos \n     and organizations have also advocated direct popular \n     elections: Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford; Vice \n     Presidents Alben Barkley and Hubert Humphrey; Senators Robert \n     A. Taft, Mike Mansfield, Edward Kennedy, Henry Jackson, \n     Robert Dole, Howard Baker, and Everett Dirksen; the American \n     Bar Association, the League of Women Voters, the AFL-CIO, and \n     the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Polls have shown overwhelming \n     public support for direct elections.\n       In the late 1960s, the drive for a direct-election \n     amendment achieved a certain momentum. Led by Senator Birch \n     Bayh of Indiana, an inveterate and persuasive constitutional \n     reformer, the campaign was fueled by the fear that Governor \n     George Wallace of Alabama might win enough electoral votes in \n     1968 to throw the election into the House of Representatives. \n     In May 1968, a Gallup poll recorded 66 percent of the U.S. \n     public in favor of direct election--and in November of that \n     year, an astonishing 80 percent. But Wallace's 46 \n     electoral votes in 1968 were not enough to deny Nixon a \n     majority, and complacency soon took over. ``The decline in \n     one-party states,'' a Brookings Institution study \n     concluded in 1970, ``has made it far less likely today \n     that the runner-up in popular votes will be elected \n     President.''\n       Because the danger of electoral-college misfire seemed \n     academic, abolition of the electoral college again became a \n     low-priority issue. Each state retained the constitutional \n     right to appoint its electors ``in such manner as the \n     legislature thereof directs.'' And all but two states, Maine \n     and Nebraska, kept the unit rule.\n       Then came the election of 2000. For the fourth time in \n     American history, the winner of the popular vote was refused \n     the presidency. And Albert Gore, Jr., had won the popular \n     vote not by Grover Cleveland's dubious 100,000 but by more \n     than half a million. Another nearly three million votes had \n     gone to the third-party candidate Ralph Nader, making the \n     victor, George W. Bush, more than ever a minority president.\n       Nor was Bush's victory in the electoral college unclouded \n     by doubt. The electoral vote turned on a single state, \n     Florida. Five members of the Supreme Court, forsaking their \n     usual deference to state sovereignty, stopped the Florida \n     recount and thereby made Bush president. Critics wondered: if \n     the facts had been the same but the candidates reversed, with \n     Bush winning the popular vote (as indeed observers had rather \n     expected) and Gore hoping to win the electoral vote, would \n     the gang of five have found the same legal arguments to elect \n     Gore that they used to elect Bush?\n       I expected an explosion of public outrage over the \n     rejection of the people's choice. But there was surprisingly \n     little in the way of outcry. It is hard to image such \n     acquiescence in a popular-vote-loser presidency if the \n     popular-vote winner had been, say, Adlai Stevenson or John F. \n     Kennedy or Ronald Reagan. Such leaders attracted do-or-die \n     supporters, voters who cared intensely about them and who not \n     only would have questioned the result but would have been \n     ardent in pursuit of fundamental reform. After a \n     disappointing campaign, Vice President Gore simply did not \n     excite the same impassioned commitment.\n       Yet surely the 2000 election put the Republic in an \n     intolerable predicament--intolerable because the result \n     contravened the theory of democracy. Many expected that the \n     election would resurrect the movement for direct election of \n     presidents. Since direct elections have obvious democratic \n     plausibility and since few Americans understand the electoral \n     college anyway, its abolition seems a logical remedy.\n       The resurrection has not taken place. Constitutional \n     reformers seem intimidated by the argument that a direct-\n     election amendment would antagonize small-population states \n     and therefore could not be ratified. It would necessarily \n     eliminate the special advantage conferred on small states by \n     the two electoral votes handed to all states regardless of \n     population. Small-state opposition, it is claimed, would \n     make it impossible to collect the two-thirds of Congress \n     and the three-fourths of the states required for \n     ratification.\n       This is an odd argument, because most political analysts \n     are convinced that the electoral college in fact benefits \n     large states, not small ones. Far from being hurt by direct \n     elections, small states, they say, would benefit from them. \n     The idea that ``the present electoral-college preserves the \n     power of the small states,'' write Lawrence D. Longley and \n     Alan G. Braun in The Politics of Electoral Reform, ``. . . \n     simply is not the case.'' The electoral-college system \n     ``benefits large states, urban interests, white minorities, \n     and/or black voters.'' So, too, a Brookings Institution \n     report: ``For several decades liberal, urban Democrats and \n     progressive, urban-suburban Republicans have tended to \n     dominate presidential politics; they would lose influence \n     under the direct-vote plan.''\n       Racial minorities holding the balance of power in large \n     states agree. ``Take away the electoral college,'' said \n     Vernon Jordan as president of the Urban League, ``and the \n     importance of being black melts away. Blacks, instead of \n     being crucial to victory in major states, simply become 10 \n     percent of the electorate, with reduced impact.''\n       The debate over whom direct elections would benefit has \n     been long, wearisome, contradictory, and inconclusive. Even \n     computer calculations are of limited use, since they assume a \n     static political culture. They do not take into account, nor \n     can they predict, the changes wrought in voter dynamics by \n     candidates, issues, and events.\n       As Senator John Kennedy said during the Lodge-Gossett \n     debate: ``It is not only the unit vote for the Presidency we \n     are talking about, but a whole solar system of governmental \n     power. If it is proposed to change the balance of power of \n     one of the elements of the solar system,'' Kennedy observed, \n     ``it is necessary to consider all the others. . . . What the \n     effects of these various changes will be on the Federal \n     system, the two-party system, the popular plurality system \n     and the large-State-small-State checks and balances system, \n     no one knows.''\n       Direct elections do, however, have the merit of correcting \n     the great anomaly of the Constitution and providing an escape \n     from the intolerable predicament. ``The electoral college \n     method of electing a President of the United States,'' said \n     the American Bar Association when an amendment was last \n     seriously considered, ``is archaic, undemocratic, complex, \n     ambiguous, indirect, and dangerous.'' In contrast, as Birch \n     Bayh put it, ``direct popular election of the president is \n     the only system that is truly democratic, truly equitable, \n     and can truly reflect the will of the people.''\n       The direct-election plan meets the moral criteria of a \n     democracy. It would elect the people's choice. It would \n     ensure equal treatment of all votes. It would reduce the \n     power of sectionalism in politics. It would reinvigorate \n     party competition and combat voter apathy by giving parties \n     the incentive to get out their votes in states that they have \n     no hope of carrying.\n       The arguments for abolishing the electoral college are \n     indeed powerful. But direct elections raise troubling \n     problems of their own--especially their impact on the two-\n     party system and on JFK's ``solar system of governmental \n     power.''\n       In the nineteenth century, American parties inspired \n     visiting Europeans with awe. Alexis de Tocqueville, in the \n     1830s, thought politics ``the only pleasure which an American \n     knows.'' James Bryce, half a century later, was impressed by \n     the ``military discipline'' of the parties. Voting statistics \n     justified transtlantic admiration. In no presidential \n     election between the Civil War and the end of the century did \n     turnout fall below 70 percent of eligible voters.\n       The dutiful citizens of these high-turnout years did not \n     rush to the polls out of uncontrollable excitement over the \n     choices they were about to make. The dreary procession of \n     presidential candidates moved Bryce to write his famous \n     chapter in The American Commonwealth titled ``Why Great Men \n     Are Not Chosen President.'' But the party was supremely \n     effective as an agency of voter mobilization. Party loyalty \n     was intense. People were as likely to switch parties as they \n     were to switch churches. The great difference between then \n     and now is the decay of the party as the organizing unit of \n     American politics.\n       The modern history of parties has been the steady loss of \n     the functions that gave them their classical role. Civil-\n     service reform largely dried up the reservoir of patronage. \n     Social legislation reduced the need for parties to succor the \n     poor and helpless. Mass entertainment gave people more \n     agreeable diversions than listening to political harangues. \n     Party loyalty became tenuous; party identification, casual. \n     Franklin D. Roosevelt observed in 1940: ``The growing \n     independence of voters, after all, has been proved by the \n     votes in every presidential election since my childhood--and \n     the tendency, frankly, is on the increase.''\n       Since FDR's day, a fundamental transformation in the \n     political environment has further undermined the shaky \n     structure of American politics. Two electronic technologies--\n     television and computerized polling--have had a devastating \n     impact on the party system. The old system had three\n\n[[Page S3427]]\n\n     tiers: the politican at one end, the voter at the other, and \n     the party in between. The party's function was to negotiate \n     between the politician and the voter, interpreting each to \n     the other and providing the links that held the political \n     process together.\n       The electronic revolution has substantially abolished this \n     mediating role. Television presents politicians directly to \n     the voters, who judge candidates far more on what the box \n     shows them than on what the party organization tells them. \n     Computerized polls present voters directly to the \n     politicians, who judge the electorate far more on what the \n     polls show them than on what the party organization tells \n     them. The political party is left to wither on the vine.\n       The last half-century has been notable for the decrease in \n     party identification, for the increase in independent voting, \n     and for the number of independent presidential candidacies by \n     fugitives from the major parties: Henry Wallace and Strom \n     Thurmond in 1948, George Wallace in 1968, Eugene McCarthy in \n     1976, John Anderson in 1980, Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996, and \n     Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan in 2000.\n       The two-party system has been a source of stability; FDR \n     called it ``one of the greatest methods of unification and of \n     teaching people to think in common terms.'' The alternative \n     is a slow, agonized descent into an era of what Walter Dean \n     Burnham has termed ``politics without parties.'' Political \n     adventurers might roam the countryside like Chinese \n     warlords, building personal armies equipped with \n     electronic technologies, conducting hostilities against \n     various rival warlords, forming alliances with others, \n     and, if they win elections, striving to govern through ad \n     hoc coalitions. Accountability would fade away. Without \n     the stabilizing influences of parties, American politics \n     would grow angrier, wilder, and more irresponsible.\n       There are compelling reasons to believe that the abolition \n     of state-by-state, winner-take-all electoral votes would \n     hasten the disintegration of the party system. Minor parties \n     have a dim future in the electoral college. Unless third \n     parties have a solid regional base, like the Populists of \n     1892 or the Dixiecrats of 1948, they cannot hope to win \n     electoral votes. Millard Fillmore, the Know-Nothing candidate \n     in 1856, won 21.6 percent of the popular vote and only 2 \n     percent of the electoral vote. In 1912, when Theodore \n     Roosevelt's candidacy turned the Republicans into a third \n     party, William Howard Taft carried 23 percent of the popular \n     vote and only 1.5 percent of the electoral votes.\n       But direct elections, by enabling minor parties to \n     accumulate votes from state to state--impossible in the \n     electoral-college system--would give them a new role and a \n     new influence. Direct-election advocates recognize that the \n     proliferation of minor candidates and parties would drain \n     votes away from the major parties. Most direct-election \n     amendments therefore provide that if no candidate receives 40 \n     percent of the vote the two top candidates would fight it out \n     in a runoff election.\n       This procedure would offer potent incentives for radical \n     zealots (Ralph Nader, for example), freelance media \n     adventures (Pat Buchanan), eccentric billionaires (Ross \n     Perot), and flamboyant characters (Jesse Ventura) to jump \n     into presidential contests; incentives, too, to ``green'' \n     parties, senior-citizen parties, nativist parties, right-to-\n     life parties, pro-choice parties, anti-gun-control parties, \n     homosexual parties, prohibition parties, and so on down the \n     single-issue line.\n       Splinter parties would multiply not because they expected \n     to win elections but because their accumulated vote would \n     increase their bargaining power in the runoff. Their \n     multiplication might well make runoffs the rule rather than \n     the exception. And think of the finagling that would take \n     place between the first and second rounds of a presidential \n     election! Like J.Q. Adams in 1824, the victors would very \n     likely find that they are a new target for ``corrupt \n     bargains.''\n       Direct election would very likely bring to the White House \n     candidates who do not get anywhere near a majority of the \n     popular votes. The prospect would be a succession of 41 \n     percent presidents or else a succession of double national \n     elections. Moreover, the winner in the first round might \n     often be beaten in the second round, depending on the deals \n     the runoff candidates made with the splinter parties. This \n     result would hardly strengthen the sense of legitimacy that \n     the presidential election is supposed to provide. And I \n     have yet to mention the problem, in close elections, of \n     organizing a nationwide recount.\n       In short, direct elections promise a murky political \n     future. They would further weaken the party system and \n     further destabilize American politics. They would cure the \n     intolerable predicament--but the cure might be worse than the \n     disease.\n       Are we therefore stuck with the great anomaly of the \n     Constitution? Is no remedy possible?\n       There is a simple and effective way to avoid the troubles \n     promised by the direct-election plan and at the same time to \n     prevent the popular-vote loser from being the electoral-vote \n     winner: Keep the electoral college but award the popular vote \n     winner a bonus of electoral votes. This is the ``national \n     bonus'' plan proposed in 1978 by the Twentieth Century Fund \n     Task Force on Reform of the Presidential Election Process. \n     The task force included, among others, Richard Rovere and \n     Jeanne Kirkpatrick. (And I must declare an interest: I was a \n     member, too, and first proposed the bonus plan in The Wall \n     Street Journal in 1977.)\n       Under the bonus plan, a national pool of 102 new electoral \n     votes--two for each state and the District of Columbia--would \n     be awarded to the winner of the popular vote. This national \n     bonus would balance the existing state bonus--the two \n     electoral votes already conferred by the Constitution on each \n     state regardless of population. This reform would virtually \n     guarantee that the popular-vote winner would also be the \n     electoral-vote winner.\n       At the same time, by retaining state electoral votes and \n     the unit rule, the plan would preserve both the \n     constitutional and the practical role of the states in \n     presidential elections. By insulating recounts, it would \n     simplify the consequences of close elections. By discouraging \n     multiplication of parties and candidates, the plan would \n     protect the two-party system. By encouraging parties to \n     maximize their vote in states that they have no chance of \n     winning, it would reinvigorate state parties, stimulate \n     turnout, and enhance voter equality. The national-bonus plan \n     combines the advantages in the historic system with the \n     assurance that the winner of the popular vote will win the \n     election, and it would thus contribute to the vitality of \n     federalism.\n       The national-bonus plan is a basic but contained reform. It \n     would fit comfortably into the historic structure. It would \n     vindicate ``the fundamental maxim of republican government . \n     . . that the sense of the majority should prevail.'' It would \n     make the American democracy live up to its democratic \n     pretensions.\n       How many popular vote losers will we have to send to the \n     White House before we finally democratize American democracy?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3427-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

According to a recent \npoll commissioned by the Ms. Foundation for Women, girls believe the \nprogram increased their interest in education, broadened their thinking \nabout the future, and strengthened their relationship with their \nparents and other caring adults.\n  This morning's Senate activities began with a breakfast and a tour of \nthe Senate floor for approximately 200 girls and their sponsors, many \nof them Senate staff members and assistants who wanted to share with \ntheir girls the excitement and challenges of working in our Nation's \nCapitol, and in particular, here in the Senate.\n  This year I am happy to host ten young ladies, all with very \npromising futures, most from my home State of Louisiana.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Brown \nUniversity's 1976 Ivy League Championship Football Team, which recently \nwas inducted into the Brown University Athletic Hall of Fame. In \nparticular, I want to salute Joe Wirth, an assistant coach of that \nteam, who was inducted into the Brown Hall of Fame in his own right in \n1995, and who was an important influence on my own collegiate athletic \ncareer.\n  Joe coached at Brown from 1973 to 1979, and during his tenure, the \nBrown University Bears compiled an impressive 42-18-1 record. Joe Wirth \nwas a defensive genius, and it certainly showed out on the field--the \nBrown defense was nationally ranked in five of those seven seasons. In \nthe 1976 championship year, when the Bears led the way with an 8-1 \nrecord, they allowed the second-fewest points in the Ivy League. And \nthat stingy defense translated into victories over the traditional \nleague powers: Princeton, Harvard, and Yale. It was the first time in \nthe school's history that they beat all three in the same season.\n  As if his responsibilities to the football team were not enough, Joe \nalso was the coach of the wrestling team during that time and he helped \nkeep the program alive. He produced a New England Champion in 1976. As \none of Joe's co-captains on the 1975-76 wrestling team, I can attest \nthat he had the respect and admiration of all of his wrestlers. We were \nall so grateful for his leadership and for his encouragement.\n  Despite the time commitments associated with his football and \nwrestling teams, Joe remained a family man. With his wife, Carol, he \nraised a wonderful family of six children.\n  To this day, Joe Wirth is a popular figure in Brown athletic circles. \nHis players still recall his admonition to never give up ``until the \nlast white line is crossed.'' In honor of his accomplishments as a \nBrown coach, I will conclude with a toast first offered to the 1976 Ivy \nLeague Champions by my classics professor, John Rowe Workman:\n\n     To your continued good health\n     To your continued prosperity\n     And to the maintenance of the great tradition\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3428-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL PECAN MONTH\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nNational Pecan Month. Each April the nation celebrates the pecan. Used \nin recipes ranging from pies and candy to soups and salads, the pecan \nis an important part of New Mexico's diet and economy.\n  New Mexico is the third largest pecan producing State following \nGeorgia and Texas. The Pecan tree is uniquely native to North America. \nPecans were first introduced to New Mexico in the early 1900's at the \nNew Mexico State University and then in the Mesilla Valley. In 1932, \nthe late Dean Stahmann Sr. planted the first commercial Pecan orchard, \nand pecans quickly became an important product of our State. In 2001, \nthe State of New Mexico produced over 50 million pounds of pecans and \nhad approximately 30,000 acres of pecan trees.\n  I am proud of the 15 New Mexico counties which produce pecans. Seven \nof the leading counties in pecan production include Chavez, Dona Ana, \nEddy, Lea, Luna, Otero, and Sierra. Dona Ana county has more than \n20,000 acres of pecan trees. Eight others including Bernalillo, Curry, \nDe Baca, Grant, Hidalgo, Lincoln, Quay, and Roosevelt are all growing \nas valuable pecan producing counties.\n  Pecans not only taste great, but also may provide a way to help \nAmerican's live healthier lives. A recently released study printed in \nthe Journal of Nutrition reported regular consumption of pecans lowers \ncholesterol in conjunction with a step I diet of the American Heart \nAssociation. I encourage all American's to celebrate National Pecan \nMonth with the people of New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3428-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3428-S3429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO 2002 TEACHER OF THE YEAR: CALIFORNIAN CHAUNCEY VEATCH\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na great Californian, Chauncey Veatch, whom I am very proud to know. \nChauncey Veatch has been bestowed the highest honor available to \nteachers; he has been named the 2002 ``Teacher of the Year.''\n  I have had the honor of meeting Chauncey Veatch on two occasions. \nFirst when he became California's Teacher of the Year, and then again \ntoday. I could tell from my first meeting with Mr. Veatch that \nCalifornia was lucky to have a teacher like him in the State. His love \nfor teaching and genuine concern for his students was apparent from the \nway he spoke about his classroom, students, and community.\n  Mr. Veatch did not always know he wanted to be a teacher. He came to \nteaching later in his career. He first spent 22 years in the Army \ninfantry and medical services corps, working as a medical \nadministrator.\n  After retiring in 1995, Mr. Veatch decided to follow in his siblings \nfootsteps and become a teacher. He currently teaches social studies at \nCoachella Valley High in Thermal, California. The overwhelming number \nof his students come from migrant families, and nearly all of his \nstudents are Spanish-speaking. Mr. Veatch speaks Spanish to communicate \nwith many of his students and to show respect for their culture.\n  His students and colleagues know Mr. Veatch as a courteous, tireless \nworker. He goes the extra mile for his students and his community. It \nis not uncommon for Mr. Veatch to spend hours after school helping \nstudents get caught up on their course work or to get ahead. One of his \nmigrant students had to work with his family until November. A place \nwas saved for him in the classroom, and Mr. Veatch worked with him \neveryday after school to make sure he caught up with the rest of the \nclass. This is just one example of the many students he has helped.\n  Mr. Veatch's former principal, Rick Alvarez, said of his colleague: \n``Believing our students can succeed is not a desire or a facade, but \nis actually something Chauncey lives. This caring can be seen in his \neyes and heard in his voice and felt in his presence, and mostly seen \nin his actions.''\n  Chauncey Veatch said in the Rose Garden yesterday as President Bush \npresented him with his award, ``If you'd like to be a part of America's \ntomorrows become a teacher today.'' Mr. Veatch is a living example of \nthe difference each person can make in the life of a child. Along side \nhim at the ceremony were two of his students whose lives he has touched \nand undoubtedly changed. His students are his legacy, as he commonly \nrefers to them as his ``kids.'' Through his actions, it is apparent to \nme that the terms ``kids'' is not only used a word to describe his \nclassroom, but really how he thinks of his students. They are like \nfamily.\n  From Army Colonel to ``Teacher of the Year,'' I am proud to know you \nChauncey Veatch and to call you a Californian. In Mr. Veatch's words, \n``There is nothing more rewarding, nothing more patriotic than \nteaching. It is truly a joy and honor to be a teacher. This award \nbelongs to my students.''\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the \nSenate's attention an exceptional person--Chauncey Veatch, a teacher \nfrom Coachella Valley High School in Thermal, California.\n  He teaches world history, government and ninth-grade career \npreparation at Coachella Valley High School. He also does much more. He \nhas taught English as a Second Language and citizenship classes in \nevening adult school. He revived the high school's cadet program, which \nhas grown to 170 students. And he is often found with his students and \ntheir families outside of school in the community. Although he has only \nbeen teaching since 1995, after 22 years of service in the U.S. Army, \nMr. Veatch\n\n[[Page S3429]]\n\nhas become a mentor and an inspiration not only to his students, but to \nother teachers as well.\n  While he has never sought recognition, Chauncey Veatch was selected \nlast year as California Teacher of the Year. More significantly he was \nrecently honored at the White House as the 2002 National Teacher of the \nyear.\n  Chauncey Veatch believes in his students and demonstrates that belief \nto them every day. The result is they believe in themselves. Their \nsuccess in school, and in life, is remarkable.\n  California is extremely proud of Chauncey Veatch. I am honored to pay \ntribute to him. As National Teacher of the Year he will travel for a \nyear as an education ambassador. I encourage my colleagues to join me \nin wishing Chauncey Veatch continued success as he spreads his positive \nmessage across our nation and beyond and as he continues his \nexceptional teaching.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3429-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3429-S3430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NUCLEAR SECURITY OFFICERS\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to recognize \nthe brave and patriotic security officers who protect the Seabrook \nNuclear Power Station in my State of New Hampshire. Recently, \nallegations have been made that have caused great concern to these \nhighly trained professions. The Local 501 Security, Police and Fire \nProfessionals of America have written a letter to me and provided a \nposition paper representing their views of security at Seabrook Station \nand responding to the issues raised by others. One particular part of \nthe position paper caught my attention as it exemplifies the character \nof the brave men and women who serve and protect our nuclear power \nplants. It reads,\n\n       The last thing that you should know about us is that we are \n     your family, your friends and your neighbors. Most of us live \n     within 20 miles of the plant. We have families and children \n     of our own. Everything that we have worked so hard for and \n     love is in close proximity to this plant. We are not cowards \n     and will not run. God forbid the day ever comes, but if it \n     does, we will stay and fight for you and for our friends and \n     families.\n\n  I want to thank the President of Local 501, Clifford Bullock, and all \nof the professionals who are members of Local 501 for providing their \nwell-informed perspective on security at Seabrook Station. Most \nimportantly, Mr. President, I want to thank them for their bravery and \ncommitment to protecting all of us--they are true patriots. I ask that \nthe letter and position paper of Local 501 be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n\n                                                   April 24, 2002.\n     The Hon. Robert Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: We understand from news media reports \n     that two former security officers from Seabrook Station are \n     planning to meet with various Congressional staff members to \n     discuss concerns they have about their service at Seabrook.\n       As the Senator from New Hampshire and the ranking member of \n     the Environment and Public Works Committee, we believe you \n     would be interested in our position on the issues raised by \n     the former officers. The attached paper represents the \n     position of Local 501 of the Security, Police and Fire \n     Professionals of America. We feel that it is especially \n     important for you and your colleagues to have a full \n     perspective on these issues.\n       We would be pleased to provide any additional information \n     or respond to any other questions you may have.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Clifford Bullock,\n\n                            President, Local 501, Security, Police\n     and Fire Professionals of America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Statement on Security at Seabrook Station From Security, Police and \n        Fire Professionals of America--Local 501--April 23, 2002\n\n       Since the tragic events of September 11, the nation has \n     been focused on its security like never before. The public \n     and media have been quick to both praise and criticize the \n     men and women tasked with keeping us safe from harm. \n     Recently, light has been shed on a relatively unknown part of \n     America's critical infrastructure; the protection of our \n     nation's commercial nuclear power reactors. It seems that \n     since September 11, hardly a week goes by that there is not a \n     story in the news regarding the possibility of attacks \n     against a nuclear power plant. This increased media attention \n     has produced two results. It has shown us that prior to \n     September 11, most people in this country were unaware of the \n     importance of homeland security. It has also shown us that in \n     this time of national uncertainty, anyone appearing on \n     television, regardless of his or her background, education or \n     experience, may be considered a ``security expert''.\n       In recent weeks, former newly hired security officers have \n     expressed their perception that the security at the Seabrook \n     Nuclear Power Station is inadequate. We would like the public \n     to know that the concerns expressed by these individuals had \n     been bought to the attention of management, and that they \n     were being evaluated and any discrepancies addressed. The \n     former officers' main area of concern centered on the initial \n     training they received when they were hired in November 2001. \n     They expressed discontent with the quality and quantity of \n     tactical and weapons training they received during the six \n     weeks of initial classroom and practical instruction. In an \n     open letter to the public, one of the former officers stated \n     that he fired only 96 rounds at the range before being \n     declared ``proficient'' with his weapon. What he failed to \n     disclose was that after firing 96 practice rounds, he then \n     fired 120 rounds in order to qualify with his weapon using a \n     state of New Hampshire and U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission-certified course of fire. After qualification came \n     familiarization training on a stress-fire course and low-\n     light firing. Only after successful completion of this \n     training (300-350 rounds) is any officer declared \n     ``proficient'' with his or her weapon. Admittedly, we would \n     all like more time to practice with our weapons, not only \n     because we want to hone our skills, but also because we enjoy \n     it and are very good at it.\n       The strategic doctrine of nuclear power facilities is not \n     designed to be as extensive as that of a SWAT team or a \n     Special Forces branch of the military. We are by our very \n     nature, defensive, not offensive. During our initial training \n     we spend approximately four days learning general and site-\n     specific tactics. This training, coupled with an intimate \n     knowledge of the plant, ongoing training and drills and a \n     fair measure of common sense prepares an individual to \n     protect this plant in the event of an attack.\n       Although for obvious reasons we cannot disclose the \n     specifics of our tactical strategy, we want the public to \n     know that it has been validated numerous times by both \n     industry and military experts and that, as the people who \n     will employ it into actual use, we are confident that it is \n     sound.\n       On September 11, due to our heightened state of alert, we \n     stopped conducting tactical training drills on shift. Drills, \n     though, are an essential part of the training process, and in \n     January of this year, we began to once again practice our \n     defensive strategy. The resumption of drills coincided with \n     the few weeks that the former officers actually worked on \n     shift. In their statements, they criticized our ability to \n     perform our jobs of protecting this plant and the public from \n     a terrorist attack based upon what they saw. Drills are \n     performed as ``force on force'' exercises, meaning that a \n     mock adversary team actually ``attacks'' the on-shift \n     security officers. Explosions, gunfire and ``kills'' are \n     simulated, and after the drills are complete, a critique is \n     completed and feedback given not only to those involved, but \n     also to the officers who did not participate in the drills. A \n     mistake or failure during a drill may serve to save that \n     person's life during an actual attack on the plant. It should \n     be noted that sometimes the defending officers do not win the \n     the drills. This is not a reflection of our abilities or \n     aptitude, but rather of the difficulty of the exercises that \n     are conducted. Adversary teams consist of well-trained \n     officers and supervisors who are not only familiar with every \n     square inch of the facility, but are also experts on our \n     tactical and defensive strategy and can predict every \n     movement of the defenders. Drills are meant to be difficult \n     in order to reinforce the skills of the officers involved. \n     With the odds stacked so far in favor of the adversaries, the \n     public should take solace in the fact that we actually win \n     many more drills than we lose. Initial training is only one \n     step in the ongoing development of the skills and experience \n     required to protect the public from the danger of a terrorist \n     attack on our facility.\n       There was one last concern brought forth by these \n     individuals that we wish to address as being not only \n     erroneous, but also as nothing short of a personal attack on \n     the hard-working men and women of the security staff at \n     Seabrook Station. Our former co-workers have stated that in \n     the event of an actual attack, the majority of officers would \n     use their weapons to flee the plant. We want to state for the \n     record that the dedication and integrity of the security \n     force at Seabrook is unimpeachable.\n       Since September 11, despite long hours and few days off, no \n     officer who was here prior to the terrorist attacks, has \n     resigned or been terminated. Those of us who were here before \n     have stayed, not because we cannot find other jobs, but \n     because we are dedicated to what we do.\n       For those of you who do not know us, please allow us to \n     introduce ourselves. We are educated, experienced and hard-\n     working individuals. Thirty percent of us have college \n     degrees. Eighty percent have prior military, law enforcement \n     or security experience. On average we are 38 years old, and \n     have worked as security officers at Seabrook Station for over \n     eight years. Since September 11, we have worked roughly 60 \n     hours per week. We know the dangers inherent in our work; we \n     know the possibility of a terrorist attack on a U.S. nuclear \n     power plant. Every day that we drive through the gate, we \n     know that we are putting our lives at risk to protect the \n     public, yet we continue to come.\n       The last thing that you should know about us is that we are \n     your family, your friends and your neighbors. Most of us live \n     within 20 miles of the plant. We have families and children \n     of our own. Everything that we have\n\n[[Page S3430]]\n\n     worked so hard for and love is in close proximity to this \n     plant. We are not cowards and we will not run. God forbid the \n     day ever comes, but if it does, we will stay and fight for \n     you and for our friends and families.\n       Members of the public should be confident that the security \n     of Seabrook Station is tight, and will get tighter in the \n     months ahead. We will be the first to admit that we are not \n     perfect. As in any organization, we have areas in need of \n     improvement. We have been addressing these areas and together \n     with management, continue to strive towards making these \n     improvements a reality. In the meantime, we will continue to \n     be here to protect the public from the threat of radiological \n     sabotage, just as we have been since well before September \n     11, 2001.\n\n                                             Clifford Bullock,\n\n                            President, Local 501--Security, Police\n     and Fire Professionals of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3430-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL JACOBS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMichael J. Jacobs as he leaves the National Security Agency. Mr. Jacobs \nhas served our nation for more than 38 years. He has distinguished \nhimself and the National Security Agency in positions of increasing \nresponsibility. Mr. Jacobs capped his illustrious career as the \nInformation Assurance Director of the National Security Agency.\n  Mr. Jacobs is an outstanding example of the many dedicated public \nservants who fulfill critical needs, often without public recognition. \nWhen Mr. Jacobs joined the NSA, the agency's existence was a secret. \nWhile the American people now know and appreciate more about the NSA, \nmost of the attention goes to signals intelligence.\n  Mr. Jacobs made his mark fulfilling the NSA's other core mission: \ninformation assurance. He has led and shaped the essential effort to \ndevelop secure information systems. Our Presidents, our Armed Forces, \nour diplomats, our intelligence agencies, and other Government leaders \ndepend on secure communications every day. During his tenure, Mr. \nJacobs has shaped every part of how our government addresses the \nInformation Assurance needs.\n  Mr. Jacobs demonstrated a real commitment to the long-range needs of \nAmerica. His initiatives in research and education are key examples. He \nworked to sustain the Information Assurance Awareness and Training and \nEducation Research Program. He also broke new ground in establishing \nNSA Centers of Excellence in Information Assurance Education at \ninstitutions of higher learning in Maryland and across the country.\n  Mr. Jacobs was stayed ahead of the curve in protecting America's \ncritical information infrastructure. The White House recognized the \nInformation Assurance System Security Education and Training Program \n(NIEPT) he developed as a model in Government.\n  Mr. Jacobs' embodies the best traditions of our civil service. That's \nwhy he has been recognized with the NSA Exceptional Civilian Service \nAward and the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement.\n  As the Senator from Maryland and a member of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, I want to thank Mr. Jacobs for his \ndedication to the United States of America. He has served our nation \nwith honor. I wish Mike well as he enters a new phase of his \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3430-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION: LOOKING TO THE FUTURE\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this year marks the 76th year of \noperations for the U.S. International Trade Commission, ITC. Throughout \nthat time, the Commission has played an essential role in the \nadministration of U.S. trade remedy laws.\n  Today, I would like to emphasize two aspects of the ITC that I \nbelieve are critical to their ability to effectively administer U.S. \ntrade remedy laws in the future.\n  First, it is important to remember that the ITC is an independent, \nimpartial arbiter in international trade disputes under U.S. trade law. \nThis independent stature was established and is guaranteed by the \nCongress. Inevitably, by deciding the cases on the merits, the \nCommission has made decisions that may be unpopular with certain \nindustry sectors or individual Senators and Representatives--including \nme--and will doubtless to so again. But, despite disagreements the \nCongress continues to defend the Commission's independence. The fact \nthat the Commission and Commissioners can rule on the merits, without \nfear of political pressure or retribution, is crucial to America's \neconomy at home and our trade negotiations abroad.\n  As other nations begin to implement their own trade remedy laws, they \noften look to U.S. law and institutions for guidance. It is important \nthe U.S. institutions serve as good models for other nations. One way \nto do that is for Congress to ensure that the independent nature of the \nITC is preserved, regardless of the outcome of any particular case, \njust as we would any other quasi-judicial agency. It is our duty as \nelected representatives.\n  There is one other issue related to the ITC I would like to \nhighlight, and that is the importance of having ITC Commissioners with \nan agriculture background. As the number of agricultural cases before \nthe ITC increases, the appointment of a Commissioner with a substantive \nagricultural background is crucial to American agriculture. There are \ncurrently a number of antidumping orders and pending investigations \naffecting agricultural products. The ITC's commissioners must determine \nwhether U.S. producers have suffered injury from unfairly traded \nproducts. A background in agriculture would assist the Commission in \ndeciding these cases on the merits. I hope that the Administration will \nconsider nominees with a background in agriculture, as current \nCommissioners' terms expire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3430-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIONAL ORGAN AND TISSUE DONOR AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to honor National \nOrgan and Tissue Donor Awareness Week, April 21 through April 27, 2002. \nI want to commend the thousands of families each year whose selfless \ngenerosity helps save the lives of others. Since January, 115 people in \nmy State of Michigan have received organ or tissue transplants. \nUnfortunately, in that same time, 40 people in Michigan have died \nwaiting for needed organs.\n  Each day in America, about 63 people receive an organ transplant, but \n16 die waiting. Over 79,000 Americans are on waiting lists for organs \nand tissues. For many of them, this issue is about their very survival. \nRight now, we have almost everything we need to save these lives. We \nhave skilled doctors and medical professionals and we have hospitals \nwith transplant facilities. All we need now are people who are willing \nto share the gift of life with others.\n  I would like to share the story of Maria Compagner, a 5-year-old girl \nwho lives in Holland, MI. When Maria was 2 months old, she was \ndiagnosed with hepatic hemangioendotheliomas on her liver, which caused \nher liver to grow at such a rapid pace that it pushed her other vital \norgans out of place. She was hospitalized, received chemotherapy and \nAlpha Inferon treatment, followed by steroid treatments. The treatments \npermanently damaged Maria's thyroid gland and inhibited growth hormone \nproduction. She will have to take synthetic hormones for the rest of \nher life.\n  Maria suffered from congestive heart failure, severe respiratory \ndistress which led to many intubations, a pulmonary hemorrhage in her \nlung, several serious infections, hypothyroid condition, a collapsed \nlung, pneumonia, chronic emesis, aspiration, and severe reflux, all \nbefore her first birthday.\n  Just before her first birthday, Maria finally received a precious \ngift of life, a new liver. She spent the next year in and out of the \nhospital. After a little catching up, Maria is a happy and well-\nadjusted 5-year-old.\n  But she's not out of the woods yet. In November 2000, doctors \ndiscovered that Maria's portal vein and inferior vena cava are blocked \nand her hepatic artery is narrowed. She is now waiting for a second \nliver transplant to correct those problems.\n  This week, I urge all Americans to consider becoming an organ donor. \nI urge them to think about filling out a donor card. And most \nimportantly, I urge them to talk to their families about their \ndecision.\n  When you become an organ donor, you guarantee that you will live on \nnot just in the memories of your loved ones. You will live on in the \nheart and soul of the fellow human beings you save, and in the heart \nand soul of every loved one that person gets to touch.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3431-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3431]]\n        60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED WAY OF CHITTENDEN COUNTY\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize and celebrate the United Way of Chittenden \nCounty on the occasion of their 60th Anniversary. Many Vermonters have \nworked tirelessly for this organization throughout the years and I take \ngreat pride in what they have accomplished.\n  Since Henry Way founded the organization under the name of the \nBurlington Community Chest in 1942, the United Way has brought vital \nservices to generations of Vermonters and earned its reputation as a \ncornerstone of Chittenden County's collaborative community development.\n  Vermonters must never take for granted the key role the United Way \nplays in the well-being of our local communities. Sustainable, \ngrassroots solutions to complex problems do not come easily. In \npartnership with citizens, businesses, services, State and Federal \nGovernment, the United Way helps to fund such worthy organizations as \nthe Girl Scouts, YMCA, Red Cross, Salvation Army, and many more.\n  Communities throughout the United States are served well by their \nlocal United Way chapters. If founders Henry Way, C.P. Hasbrook, and I. \nMunn Boardman were alive today they would be proud of the \norganizational strength the United Way has built through the years. I \ncommend the board, staff, contributors, and volunteers for their \ngenerous efforts in securing crucial resources for their communities. \nThe legacy of these groundbreaking Vermonters is honored by sixty years \nof tenacious work. This proud history continues today under the apt \nleadership of Gretchen Morse. I am sure the United Way of Chittenden \nCounty will continue to be an example for other charitable \norganizations throughout the country.\n  The United Way is sure to meet their community's challenges in the \nnext 60 years with the vision, leadership and perseverance demonstrated \ntoday.\n  I extend my hearty congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3431-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DRAWING THE LINE ON GUN VIOLENCE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to call to the \nattention of my Senate colleagues, Mr. Hasani Tyus, a junior at Cass \nTechnical High School in Detroit, MI. He has been drawing for years and \nhas won several Motor City Comic Book Convention art awards. Hasani, \nalong with his father, have been honored in a book of outstanding \nAfrican-Americans for their artwork. Hasani is also a member of several \nacademic societies, is a straight A student and recently earned his \nblack belt in karate. More importantly, Hasani has done what so many \nyoung people across the Nation have done in the years following the \nColumbine tragedy. He has put his talents to use. He did so by urging \nus to ``Draw the Line on Gun Violence.''\n  Hasani is 1 of 13 national poster contest winners selected from more \nthan 1,000 entries by the Alliance for Justice's Co/Motion Program, a \nnational program that helps community organizations teach youth leaders \nto become advocates for a cause in their community. Co/motion partners \nwith youth organizations, national service and service learning \nprograms, schools and other community-based organizations to provide \ntraining to young adults in advocacy and organizing skills. Further, it \nempowers young people to take action to effect social change. Co/\nmotion's Drawing the line on Gun Violence Poster Contest, the first of \nits kind, provided young people the opportunity to express their \nfeelings about the issue of gun violence in a rewarding and artistic \nway. Hasani's award-winning poster is currently posted on my website \n(http://levin.senate.gov).\n  I had the pleasure of meeting Hasani earlier this week and I \ncommended him on his hard work and honest depiction of the results of \ngun violence. I am sure that I speak for many of my Senate colleagues \nin congratulating Hasani Tyus on a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3431-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3431-S3432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ESSAY BY LELAND MILLER\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, recently I was asked by a \nconstituent of mine, Mr. Marshall Miller, if I would seek to have an \nessay on Central Asia that was written by his son, Leland, reprinted in \nthe Congressional Record. Leland Miller is a second year law student at \nthe University of Virginia. I ask that Mr. Miller's essay be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The essay follows:\n\n           Keeping Central Asia's Kleptocrats at Arm's Length\n\n                         (By Leland R. Miller)\n\n       As American planes take off from Uzbek airstrips to provide \n     support for the war against the Taliban, another conflict is \n     occurring nearby, underneath the radar of the American media. \n     Kazakhstan, the largest territory in Central Asia, is \n     undergoing a palace coup. Yet few in Washington seem to know \n     or care.\n       As the only major area on earth that is still ``up for \n     grabs,'' Central Asia may very well become a key geopolitical \n     battleground of the 21st century. This is nothing new. In the \n     early 20th century, British strategist Sir Halford J. \n     Mackinder proclaimed that whoever controls Central Asia has \n     the key to world domination. Yet a century later, it is \n     almost an afterthought in American strategic thinking.\n       This is a major mistake, the result of two phenomena. \n     First, the war in Afghanistan has convinced U.S. policy \n     makers that the need for support--both rhetorical and \n     substantive--from Central Asian regimes trumps all other \n     considerations.\n       Second, the promise of the Caspian oil basin and other \n     large business opportunities in the lucrative Central Asian \n     energy markets have seduced Washington into turning a blind \n     eye towards whom we are dealing with.\n       As a result of these dual factors, America is walking into \n     a dangerous trap. As we open our arms to these unstable and \n     authoritarian Central Asian regimes, they are gradually \n     gaining the status not just of America's temporary allies but \n     as our friends. This is a disastrous betrayal of U.S. \n     interests. Granted, the promise of quick rewards is enticing. \n     However, like all Faustian bargains, the sacrifice could be \n     considerable.\n       Perhaps no country sings this siren song more effectively \n     than Kazakhstan. Although it is one of the world's poorest \n     countries, its president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, is ranked as \n     the eighth richest man in the world. The reason? He and his \n     two venal sons-in-law have run Kazakhstan as a family \n     business. The family has sustained itself through gross \n     corruption and the ruthless exploitation of would-be foreign \n     investors.\n       The Kazakh leaders entice investments or loans, take over \n     the investments under some pretext, then ``sell the same \n     horse'' again to someone else. With abundant oil, uranium, \n     and other resources, the country always seems able to find \n     another group of gullible suitors. If that fails, pseudo-\n     investments can be induced to cover up money laundering from \n     the Russian mafia.\n       The recent crisis in Kazakhstan only reinforces this image. \n     It began when Rakhat Aliyev, son-in-law to President \n     Nursultan Nazabayev, was forced to resign his position as \n     deputy chairman of the National Security Committee after \n     reportedly making an Absalom-like run at his father-in-law's \n     authority. He re-emerged just days later as the new head of \n     the presidential guard, seemingly unscathed, but he had \n     driven the first big split in the ruling family. His \n     detractors used this opening to form a new party, Democratic \n     Choice.\n       While some insiders have suggested that this new group may \n     be nothing less than a second tier of crooks fighting Aliyev \n     for a bigger piece of the pie, the government reacted \n     swiftly. Prime Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev, a Nazarbayev \n     crony, angrily demanded (and received) the resignations of \n     four top cabinet members, all of whom were founding members \n     of the new party. Tokayev's justification?: ``All those \n     disagreeing with our policy and wishing to participate in \n     political movements should resign.''\n       Perhaps no one outside of the palace in Astana knows what's \n     really going on. But in the world of Kazakh politics, it \n     matters little whether this battle was an intrafamily fight \n     for power or simply a battle amongst politicians unhappy with \n     the current division of spoils. Either way, this is clearly \n     not a regime that America should be too identified with.\n       True, Kazakhstan does draw some favorable comparisons, but \n     only when contrasted with its neighbors. The fact is, Central \n     Asian governments are among the most corrupt and repressive \n     regimes in the world. Most inherited the apparatuses of their \n     communist predecessors and many have been just as ruthless in \n     wielding it. Most, like Nazarbayev's and Turkmenbashi's of \n     Turkmenistan, are even extensions of the same communist party \n     structure that they allegedly replaced.\n       Autocratic and corrupt governance is the rule, not the \n     exception, in Central Asia. The lack of available political \n     channels is so endemic in these countries that frustrated \n     citizens are offered but two choices: attempt to mobilize \n     politically, despite the obvious barriers, or else turn to \n     extra-political means of empowerment.\n       It is this second possibility that so desperately deserves \n     U.S. attention. Across Central Asia, ethnic and religious \n     differences among the populations constitute a\n\n[[Page S3432]]\n\n     sizable obstacle to stability and democratic governance. \n     Unlike the Balkans, however, it is not an insurmountable one.\n       Despite the pervasive following of Islam in the region, \n     religious extremism does not have the same roots in Central \n     Asia that it does in other parts of the world. Radical \n     groups, such as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (whose \n     leader, Jumaboi Khojiev Namangani, was reportedly killed \n     fighting in Afghanistan--some sources say he has merely gone \n     into hiding) are fortunately still the exception.\n       However, this could certainly change if repressive regimes \n     continue to kindle the flames of religious extremism by \n     stifling virtually all other opportunities for political \n     voice. The horrors of Algeria should not be replicated in \n     Uzbekistan or Tajikistan.\n       Situated in the middle of Russia, China, and India, and \n     with virtually untapped energy potential, Central Asia would \n     be an area of importance to the United States even under the \n     best of circumstances. However, the War on Terror has now \n     considerably upped the ante. Support for the cause of Muslim \n     fundamentalism in Central Asia not only threatens the \n     region's stability, but is sure to mean more fuel for a \n     global jihad. As the events of 9/11 have made clear, America \n     has as much reason to fear that development as any of the \n     regimes themselves.\n       The next generation of America's leaders must not be made \n     apologists for today's policies aimed at the short-term and \n     short-sighted advancement of U.S. interests. This means \n     avoiding marriages of convenience with repressive Central \n     Asian regimes that will inevitably prove harmful to the \n     nation's future.\n       The New Great Game in Central Asia is very much a battle of \n     good against evil. Democracy, not Islamic extremism, must \n     fill the political void. While the U.S. has no role in \n     fomenting or aiding these ``coups of the apparatchiks,'' \n     Americans are still beholden to one obligation: We need to at \n     least make sure we are not rooting for the wrong \n     side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3432-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS TO WORK DAY\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have had the privilege of \nhosting some of the future leaders of America in my office as part of \nMs. Magazine's Take Our Daughters to Work Day. As part of the day's \nactivities I asked them to write a speech on what they would do if \nelected to serve as a United States Senator. I am proud to submit for \nthe record some of their responses.\n  If I were a United States Senator by Annie Ballard, 5th Grade, Future \nUS Senator 2021. As a Senator of the United States I will find equality \nfor all peoples of the Nation. For every man, woman and child of all \nraces and types. Every man and woman should have equal pay and \ntreatment. In some places of the country, women and people of color are \nnot payed or treated equally to whites and men. Hispanics might be \npayed $2.29 for 13 hours of work each day. Some women are qualified for \njobs and have to give them up because of a less qualified man. Teams of \nsports will choose males over females in football, baseball and other \nsports. In this bill, I plan to equalize all jobs, sports and pay for \nall people of the United States of America.\n  What I would do if I were Senator, by Ashley Bageant. I would \nincrease security at big buildings and airports so our environment can \nbe more safe. I would do that by hiring more police officers. I would \ntry to treat everybody the same. I would do what I would think would be \nright for our country. I would pay my people more money so they would \nhave enough money to build homeless shelters to get homeless people off \nthe street.\n  What I would do if I were Senator? By Kathleen Warner, 9th Grade, \nFuture US Senator 2018. As a high school student and a Catholic, I am \npro-life and feel that my opinion should be strongly considered. My \nreasoning on the abortion issue is that a child is a life from the \npoint of conception and therefore should by the state just like any \nother citizen. Also, if a child is conceived unexpectedly the mother \ncan put the child up for adoption where he or she has the same \nopportunity as other children to live a strong, successful life. \nFinally, let me say, I am proud to live in a country where I can \nexpress my opinion like this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3432-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3432-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3432-4", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:05 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3763.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to reduce the \nage for receipt of military retired pay for nonregular service from 60 \nto 55; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nthat would reduce the retirement age for members of the National Guard \nand Reserve from 60 to 55. This change would allow 93,000 reservists \ncurrently aged 55 to 59 to retire with full benefits and would restore \nparity between the retirement systems for Federal civilian employees \nand reservists.\n  In the interests of fairness, the United States must act quickly to \nrestore parity between the retirement age for civilian Federal \nemployees and their reserve counterparts. When the reserve retirement \nsystem was created\n\n[[Page S3437]]\n\nin 1947, the retirement age for reservists was identical to the age for \ncivilian employees. At age 60, reservists and Government employees \ncould hang up their uniforms and retire with full benefits. However, \nsince 1947, the retirement age for civilian retirees has been lowered \nby 5 years, while the reserve retirement age has not changed.\n  The disparate treatment of Federal employees and reservists would \nhave been serious enough had the nature of the work performed by the \nreserves not changed substantially over the past five decades. But \nAmerica has never placed greater demands on its ready reserve than it \ndoes now. Today, some 80,000 reservists are serving their country in \nthe war on terrorism, both at home and abroad. America's dependence on \nour ready reserve has never been more obvious, as reservists are now \nproviding security at our nation's airports and air patrols over our \nmajor cities.\n  With call-ups that last several months and take reservists far from \nhome, serving the Nation as a reservist has taken on more of the \ntrappings of active duty service than ever before. Before the war on \nterrorism began, reservists were performing about 13 million man-days \neach year, more than a 10-fold increase over the 1 million man-days per \nyear the reserves averaged just 10 years ago. These statistics, the \nlatest numbers available, do not even reflect the thousands of \nreservists who have been deployed since September 11. There is little \ndoubt there will be a dramatic increase in the number of man-days for \n2001 and 2002. In my view, with additional responsibility should come \nadditional benefits.\n  The Department of Defense typically has not supported initiatives \nlike this. The Department has expressed concern over the proposal's \ncost, which is estimated to be approximately $20 billion over 10 years, \nalthough CBO figures are not yet available. However, I am concerned \nthat the Department's position may be shortsighted.\n  At a time when there is a patriotic fervor and a renewed enthusiasm \nfor national service, it is easy to forget that not long ago, the U.S. \nmilitary was struggling to meet its recruitment and retention goals. In \nthe aftermath of September 11, defense-wide recruitment and retention \nrates have improved. However, there is no guarantee that this trend \nwill continue. Unless the overall package of incentives is enhanced, \nthere is little reason to believe that we will be able to attract and \nretain highly-trained personnel.\n  Active duty military personnel have often looked to the reserves as a \nway of continuing to serve their country while being closer to family. \nWith thousands of dollars invested in training active duty officers and \nenlisted soldiers, the United States benefits tremendously when \npersonnel decide to continue with the reserves. But with reserve \ndeployments increasing in frequency and duration, pulling reservists \naway from their families and civilian life for longer periods, the \nbenefit of joining the reserves instead of active duty has been \nseverely reduced. The more we depend on the reserves, the greater \nchance we have of losing highly trained former active duty servicemen \nand women. The added incentive of full retirement at 55 might provide \nan important inducement for some of them to stay on despite the surge \nin deployments.\n  Enacting this legislation will send the clear message that the United \nStates values the increased sacrifice of our reservists during these \ntrying times. The legislation has been endorsed by key members of the \nMilitary Coalition, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Air \nForce Sergeants Association, the Air Force Association, the Retired \nEnlisted Association, the Fleet Reserve Association, the Naval Reserve \nAssociation, and the National Guard Association. The bill would restore \nparity between the reserve retirement system and the civilian \nretirement system, acknowledge the increased workload of reserve \nservice, and provide essential personnel with an inducement to join and \nstay in the reserves until retirement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. \n        Ensign):\n  S. 2271. A bill to provide for research on, and services for, \nindividuals with post-abortion depression and psychosis; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today, along \nwith Senators Inhofe and Ensign, to introduce the Post-Abortion Support \nand Services Act.\n  On November 1, 2001, the Senate unanimously passed an amendment I \nintroduced to the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill recognizing the \nexistence of post-abortion syndrome. The amendment encouraged the \nNational Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to ``expand and intensify \nresearch and related activities'' regarding this issue, and it is the \nfirst time that the United States Senate is on record acknowledging \nthat post-abortion syndrome is a serious problem for American women.\n  This bill is an extension of what has already passed the Senate, and \nprovides the National Institutes of Health with Federal resources to \nresearch the emotional impact of abortion on women. The bill also \ncreates a $1.5 million grant program to fund the development of \ntreatment programs for women who suffer from post-abortion syndrome.\n  What is post-abortion syndrome? Many people have never heard of it. \nMany others deny its existence.\n  Post-abortion syndrome is characterized by one or more of the \nfollowing symptoms: severe depression, guilt, eating disorders, anxiety \nand panic attacks, addictions, anniversary grief, nightmares, lower \nself-esteem, intense anger, suicidal urges, sexual problems or \npromiscuity, difficulty with relationships, and unexplained sadness.\n  A new study from the prestigious British Medical Journal reports that \nwomen who abort a first pregnancy are at greater risk of subsequent \nlong-term clinical depression compared to women who carry an unintended \nfirst pregnancy to term.\n  Among the key findings: the association between abortion and \nsubsequent depression persists over at least 8 years. Many other \nstudies show similar findings, and more.\n  Post-abortion syndrome is a treatable disorder if promptly diagnosed \nby a trained provider and attended to with a personalized regimen of \ncare including social support, counseling, therapy, medication, and if \nnecessary, hospitalization.\n  A number of women who have undergone abortions also experience \ndebilitating physical health problems such as infection, cervical \ntearing, infertility, excess bleeding, and death. Thus, the bill also \nseeks to study the physical repercussions of abortion as well.\n  After 29 years of legalized abortion, it is time that we recognize \nthe suffering that so many women have undergone by carefully examining \nthe women's emotional and physical health following her abortion \ndecision. We have a responsibility to understand what they are going \nthrough and how we can appropriately diagnose and treat them.\n  It is my sincere hope that we can pass this bill and give our support \nto potentially millions of women across the country who suffer alone \nwith their private and profound guilt and depression. Many women who \nchoose abortion have previously aborted. If we are ever going to end \nabortion in America, we must reach out with love and compassion to \nwomen who deeply regret their decision to abort their children, not \nonly to encourage them through their present struggles, but also to \nhelp them so they will not choose abortion for themselves again in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2271\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Post-Abortion Support and \n     Services Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) About 3,000,000 women per year in the United States \n     have an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and approximately \n     1,186,000 of these pregnancies end in elective abortion.\n       (2) Abortion can have severe and long-term effects on the \n     mental and emotional well-being of women. Women often \n     experience sadness and guilt following abortions with\n\n[[Page S3438]]\n\n     no one to console them. They may have difficulty in bonding \n     with new babies, become overprotective parents, or develop \n     problems in their relationships with their spouses. Problems \n     such as eating disorders, depression, and suicide attempts \n     have also been traced to past abortions.\n       (3) Negative emotional reactions associated with abortion \n     include, depression, bouts of crying, guilt, intense grief or \n     sadness, emotional numbness, eating disorders, drug and \n     alcohol abuse, suicidal urges, anxiety and panic attacks, \n     anger, rage, sexual problems or promiscuity, lowered self \n     esteem, nightmares and sleep disturbances, flashbacks, and \n     difficulty with relationships.\n       (4) Women who aborted a first pregnancy are four times more \n     likely to report substance abuse compared to those who \n     suffered a natural loss of their first pregnancy, and are \n     five times more likely to report subsequent substance abuse \n     than women who carried to term.\n       (5) Research shows that the more women attempt to cope with \n     abortion using means of avoidance, mental disengagement, or \n     denial, the more likely the women are to report post-abortion \n     distress, intrusive thoughts, and dissatisfaction.\n       (6) Women who experience a lack of social support and \n     strong feelings of ambivalence are statistically more likely \n     to suffer severe negative emotional reactions to an abortion.\n       (7) Depression and other maladjustments to abortion can be \n     prolonged by the failure of the medical community, loved \n     ones, and society to recognize the complexity of post-\n     abortion reactions.\n       (8) Many women submit to an abortion in violation of their \n     own moral beliefs or maternal desires in order to satisfy the \n     demands of others.\n       (9) Women who submit to an abortion because of social \n     pressure are more likely to suffer from psychological \n     distress in subsequent years.\n       (10) Post-abortion depression is a treatable disorder if \n     promptly diagnosed by a trained provider and attended to with \n     a personalized regimen of care including social support, \n     therapy, medication, and when necessary, hospitalization.\n       (11) While there have been many studies regarding the \n     emotional aftermath of abortion, very little research has \n     been sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n      TITLE I--RESEARCH ON POST-ABORTION DEPRESSION AND PSYCHOSIS\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on 3-sulfinobenzoic \nacid; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S3439]]\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce three \nbills to temporarily suspend duties on the importation of certain \nchemicals used by manufacturers in my State.\n  According to informational provided to my office, none of these \nchemicals are produced in the United States. Therefore, the suspension \nof the duties will not hurt any domestic chemical companies. In \naddition, suspension of these duties will not cost the US government \nmore than $500,000 in revenue annually. It is my understanding that the \nCommerce Department and the International Trade Commission will verify \nthat each of the chemicals for which I am requesting duty suspension \nmeets these standards.\n  Mr. President, it makes little sense to impose duties on chemicals \nthat are needed by American producers and that are not available from \ndomestic sources. Such duties only hurt American businesses and \nconsumers. In the case of these chemicals, companies in my State of New \nJersey rely on these chemicals, and employ many New Jerseyans. The \nsuspension of duties should strengthen these New Jersey businesses and \nthe State's economy, and reduce costs to consumers.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 2316. A bill to make technical and conforming changes to provide \nfor the enactment of the Independence of the Chief Financial Officer \nEstablishment Act of 2001, to establish a reporting event notification \nsystem to assist Congress and the District of Columbia in maintaining \nthe financial stability of the District government and avoiding the \ninitiation of a control period, to provide the District of Columbia \nwith autonomy over its budgets, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to help continue the District of Columbia's fiscal \nresurgence. The District of Columbia Fiscal Integrity Act will give the \nDistrict's Chief Financial Officer, CFO, authority to manage personnel, \nprocurement practices, and to maintain independent control over the \nbudget of the Office of the Chief Financial Officer. This bill was \nintroduced in the House by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton and \nCongresswoman Connie Morella. I appreciate their leadership on this \nissue and I am pleased to join with them in introducing this \nlegislation here in the Senate.\n  As my colleagues know, from 1995 to 2000, a Control Board oversaw \nmanagement of the District of Columbia in an attempt to reform the \ncity's finances and administration. One of the key features of that \nreform was the establishment of a strong Chief Financial Officer for \nthe District with wide-ranging authority over the fiscal management of \nthe city. That model worked. The city balanced its budget, restored its \ninvestment bond rating, and improved many city services. As a result, \nthe District met the requirements set forth by the Control Board Act \nand today the elected representatives of the District of Columbia are \nin charge and doing a great job. They do not want the Control Board to \ncome back on their watch and neither do I.\n  It is critical that the Senate work its will by marking up and \npassing this legislation as quickly as possible. When the Control Board \nwent out of business, some of the Chief Financial Officer's authorities \nlapsed, but his responsibility for the District's financial management \nwas not put on hold. The Congress provided temporary authority for the \nCFO in the FY 2002 District of Columbia Appropriations Act to continue \nthe smooth operation of the City, but this temporary authority will \nexpire at the end of June this year. Congress must fulfill its \nresponsibility to the District of Columbia by ensuring that local \nleaders have the authority and resources to maintain and promote the \ncity's growth. I encourage the Government Affairs Committee to begin \ntheir work right away.\n  In addition to restoring some of the authorities the CFO previously \nexercised during the Control Board era, this bill establishes an early \nwarning system, implemented by the CFO, to examine the city's financial \nmanagement and the surrounding economic environment and determine \nwhether the city's fiscal integrity is at risk. Should the CFO \ndetermine that trouble is on the horizon, the Mayor must develop an \naction plan to respond to the problem. This unique fiscal management \ntool will ensure accountability in how the District manages its \nfinances.\n  Mr. President, in the past the congressional schedule has often \ninterfered with the smooth operations of the District. Like the Federal \nGovernment, the District Government's fiscal year begins on October 1. \nWe, the Congress, have the authority to approve the District's budget--\na budget derived from locally-generated tax dollars. We rarely do that \nbefore the start of the fiscal year, in fact one or two months often go \nby before we pass the District's budget. This delay creates a great \ndeal of uncertainty for District officials in their programming and \nfinancial planning.\n  To remedy this situation, this legislation establishes budget \nautonomy for the District of Columbia beginning with fiscal year 2004. \nThe local budget would become effective once it has been approved by \nthe City Council and signed by the Mayor. The Congress will retain the \nauthority to approve the Federal funding now contained in the D.C. \nAppropriations bill and will continue its general oversight of the \nDistrict. We can still pass general provisions governing city \noperations and we can still hold hearings, but this bill will ensure \nthat Congress' schedule will not hamstring the smooth operation of the \nDistrict.\n  Mr. President, the Mayor and the City Council have worked very hard \nto restore fiscal integrity to the District Government, as well as the \npeople's faith in that government. The District is enjoying a \nrenaissance. Once a fiscal and management nightmare, the city has \nturned its economic ship around. When once the city was ruled by the \nControl Board, today the accountable authority is vested in officials \nelected by the District's citizens. A rampant crime rate chased \ncitizens from District neighborhoods into the suburbs, now people are \ncoming back. Property values are rising, new businesses are opening, \nand the city is working to beautify the Anacostia waterfront. This \nlegislation will continue this transformation by maintaining the strong \nindependence of the Chief Financial Officer and will demonstrate \nCongress's confidence in he District's elected leadership and its \ncitizens by giving them greater control over their local budget. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation. The Congress has a \nConstitutional responsibility to the District of Columbia, now is the \ntime to support the city and ensure that locally-elected leaders have \nthe necessary tools for success.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 2317. A bill to provide for fire safety standards for cigarettes, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today to \nintroduce the Joseph Moakley Memorial Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 2002. \nJoe Moakley started his effort to require less fire-prone cigarettes in \n1979 and championed this issue until his death this past May. It is \ntime to finish what he started. My colleagues Senators Brownback, \nKennedy, and Kerry join me in introducing this legislation to solve a \nserious fire safety problem, namely, fires that are caused by \ncigarettes.\n  The statistics regarding cigarette-related fires are startling. \nCigarette-ignited fires accounted for an estimated 140,800 fires in the \nUnited States. Such fires cause more than 900 deaths and 2,400 injuries \neach year. More than $400 million in property damage reported is due to \na fire caused by a cigarette. According to the National Fire Protection \nAssociation, one out of every four fire deaths in the United States are \nattributed to tobacco products--by far the leading cause of civilian \ndeaths in fires. Overall, the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nestimates that the cost of the loss of human life and personal property \nfrom not having a fire-safe cigarette standard is approximately $4.6 \nbillion per year.\n  In my State of Illinois, cigarette-related fires have also caused too \nmany senseless tragedies. In 1998 alone, the most recent year for which \nwe have\n\n[[Page S3440]]\n\ndata, there were more than 1,700 cigarette-related fires, of which more \nthan 900 were in people's homes. These fires led to 109 injuries and 8 \ndeaths. Property losses resulting from those fires were estimated at \n$10.4 million.\n  Tobacco companies spend billions on marketing and learning how to \nmake cigarettes appealing to kids. It is not unreasonable to ask those \nsame companies to invest in safer cigarette paper to make their \nproducts less likely to burn down a house.\n  A Technical Study Group, TSG, was created by the Federal Cigarette \nSafety Act in 1984 to investigate the technological and commercial \nfeasibility of creating a self-extinguishing cigarette. This group was \nmade up of representatives of government agencies, the cigarette \nindustry, the furniture industry, public health organizations and fire \nsafety organizations. The TSG produced two reports that concluded that \nit is technically feasible to reduce the ignition propensity of \ncigarettes.\n  The technology is in place now to begin developing a performance \nstandard for less fire prone cigarettes. The manufacture of less fire-\nprone cigarettes may require some advances in cigarette design and \nmanufacturing technology, but the cigarette companies have demonstrated \ntheir capability to make cigarettes of reduced ignition propensity with \nno increase in tar, nicotine or carbon monoxide in the smoke. For \nexample, six current commercial cigarettes have been tested which \nalready have reduced ignition propensity. Furthermore, the overall \nimpact on other aspects of the United States Society and economy will \nbe minimal. Thus, it may be possible to solve this problem at costs \nthat are much less than the potential benefits, which are saving lives \nand avoiding injuries and property damage.\n  The Joseph Moakley Memorial Fire Safe Cigarette Act requires Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission to promulgate a fire safety standard, \nspecified in the legislation, for cigarettes. Eighteen months after the \nlegislation is enacted, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC, \nwould issue a rule creating a safety standard for cigarettes. Thirty \nmonths after the legislation is enacted, the standards would become \neffective for the manufacture and importation of cigarettes. The CPSC \nwould also have the authority to regulate the ignition propensity of \ncigarette paper for roll-your-own tobacco products.\n  The standard may be modified if new testing methodology enhances the \nfire-safety standard. It may also be modified for cigarettes with \nunique characteristics that cannot be tested using the specified \nmethodology if the Commission determines that the proposed testing \nmethodology and acceptance criterion predict an ignition strength for \nsuch cigarettes.\n  The Act gives the Consumer Product Safety Commission authority over \ncigarettes only for purposes of implementing and enforcing compliance \nwith this Act and with the standard promulgated under the Act. It also \nallows states to pass more stringent fire-safety standards for \ncigarettes.\n  The Joseph Moakley Memorial Fire Safe Cigarette Act is supported by \nmore than 25 public health groups including the American Cancer \nSociety, the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids and the American Academy of \nPediatrics. It has been endorsed by the Congressional Fire Services \nInstitute and its 42 member organizations. Tobacco giant Phillip Morris \nis also supporting the bill.\n  While the number of people killed each year by fires is dropping \nbecause of safety improvements and other factors, too many Americans \nare dying because of a product that could be less likely to catch fire \nif simple changes were made. Cigarettes may be less likely to cause \nfire if they were thinner, more porous or the tobacco were less dense. \nThese common-sense changes could help prevent an all-too-common cause \nof fires.\n  When Joe Moakley set out more than two decades ago to ensure that the \ntragic cigarette-caused fire that killed five children and their \nparents in Westwood, Massachusetts was not repeated, he made a \ndifference. He introduced three bills and passed two of them. One \ncommissioned a study that concluded it was technically feasible to \nproduce a cigarette with a reduced propensity to start fires. The \nsecond required that the National institute of Standards and Technology \ndevelop a test method for cigarette fire safety, and the last and final \nbill, the Fire-Safe Cigarette Act of 1999, mandates that the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission use this knowledge to regulate cigarettes \nwith regard to fire safety.\n  Today we are here to reintroduce Moakley's bill and to accomplish \nwhat he set out to do. I hope that the Commerce Committee will consider \nthis legislation expeditiously and that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this effort. Joe waited long enough. He didn't have more \ntime. Let's get this done for him.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. \n        Dodd):\n  S. 2328. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to ensure a safe pregnancy for all \nwomen in the United States, to reduce the rate of maternal morbidity \nand mortality, to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in maternal \nhealth outcomes, to reduce pre-term, labor, to examine the impact of \npregnancy on the short and long term health of women, to expand \nknowledge about the safety and dosing of drugs to treat pregnant women \nwith chronic conditions and women who become sick during pregnancy, to \nexpand public health prevention, education and outreach, and to develop \nimproved and more accurate data collection, related to maternal \nmorbidity and mortality; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, over the last decade there has been \na significant recognition of the importance and increase in funding of \nwomen's health research, including the establishment of Offices of \nWomen's Health throughout various government agencies. Women's health \nissues and women, as participants, are now routinely included in \nresearch studies.\n  Despite this progress, many gaps still exist. In particular, there is \na troubling lack of research on pregnancy-related health issues. Too \noften we take pregnancy for granted; we do not view pregnancy as a \nwoman's health issue with short and long term health consequences.\n  Safe motherhood is a woman's ability to have a safe and healthy \npregnancy and delivery. Of the 4 million women who give birth in the \nU.S. each year, over one-third--or one out of every 3--have a \npregnancy-related complication before, during, or after delivery. These \ncomplications may cause long-term health problems or even death. \nUnfortunately, the causes and treatments of pregnancy-related \ncomplications are largely unknown and understudied.\n  If fact, the United States ranks only 20th in maternal mortality \nrates out of 49 developed countries--that is barely better than the \n50th percentile, behind Cyprus, Singapore and Malta. Every day, two to \nthere women die from pregnancy related complications. And despite the \nfact that maternal mortality was targeted in 1987 as part of Healthy \nPeople 2000, the maternal mortality rate in this country has not \ndecreased in twenty years.\n  The scariest part of this problem is we can't answer the most basic \nquestions--what causes the complications, what can we do to prevent \nthem, and how can we treat them?\n  One example of this problem is preeclampsia, or high blood pressure. \nYes, we know some indicators that place some women at greater risk than \nothers for this complication. And yes, we know some steps that can be \ntaken to reduce a women's risk. But we know shamefully little, with the \nexception of inducing labor, of how to really prevent or treat this \nproblem. Yet 5 percent of all pregnancies are affected by this \ncomplication, which can cause blindness or even death and there has \nbeen a 40% increase in the incidence of preeclampsia over the last 10 \nyears.\n  Likewise, we know almost nothing about which prescription drugs are \nsafe for the fetus and effective for the mother. Most prescription \ndrugs women take during pregnancy are necessary to maintain health. But \nonly 1% of FDA approved drugs have been shown in controlled studies to \nshow no risk to pregnant women and their babies. And 80% of FDA \napproved drugs lack adequate scientific evidence about use in \npregnancy. That means that pregnant women are essentially forced\n\n[[Page S3441]]\n\nto take these medications with little or no knowledge about their \nimpact on the fetus.\n  Of course, we don't want pregnant women placed at risk by putting \nthem in early stage clinical trials. But the fact is that pregnant \nwomen with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, asthma, or epilepsy, \nneed to take medication to maintain their health and support the growth \nof the fetus. And even pregnant women who don't have chronic health \nconditions need across to safe and effective prescription drugs.\n  And while people in Washington tend to throw around statistics to \nmake a point, it is important to remember that behind each of these \nstatistics is a real person and family. And yesterday, I had the \nopportunity to talk to a group of moms from my State of Iowa.\n  Without exception, these moms talked about their frustration with a \nhealth care system that continues to fail to meet some of the most \nbasic needs of pregnant women. They all rely on a group call Sidelines, \nthat provides support and guidance to pregnant women on bed rest. While \nit is great that a group like Sidelines is there for our mom's, \nsisters, and daughters, it is shameful that there isn't more accurate \nand more widely available information to women and their providers.\n  That is why earlier today, I, along with some of my colleagues, \nintroduced the Safe Motherhood Act for Research and Treatment, or, \nSMART Mom Act. The SMART Mom Act will address these concerns by: \nIncreasing research and data collection to learn how to prevent, treat, \nand cure pregnancy related complications; providing comprehensive \ninformation to pregnant women, practitioners, and the public; and, \nimproving information about medication and medical device for pregnant \nwomen.\n  Pregnancy is a natural and wonderful occurrence in a woman's life. \nThe SMART Mom Act takes a critical step towards ensuring pregnancies \nand healthy outcomes for America's women.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Hollings, \n        and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 2329.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to \nintroduce the Ship, Seafarer and Container Security Act, along with my \nranking subcommittee member, Senator Gordon, Senators Hollings and \nMcCain. This legislation will be crucial in providing the type of \ninformation and analysis that we need to protect the United States from \npotential acts of terrorism against our Nation through international \ntrade at our seaports. This legislation is the product of field \nhearings that my Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine \nSubcommittee held at various seaports around the Nation. This \nlegislation augments the Senate-passed seaport security bill, S. 1214, \nthe Port and Maritime Security Act, and I intend to push for the \ninclusion of the provisions of this bill in the context of a House-\nSenate conference on seaport security legislation\n  The United States has more than 1,000 harbor channels and 25,000 \nmiles of inland, intercoastal, and coastal waterways. These waterways \nserve 361 ports, and have more than 3,700 terminals handling passengers \nand cargo. The U.S. marine transportation system each year moves more \nthan 2 billion tons of domestic and international freight, imports 3 \nbillion tons of oil, transports 134 million passengers by ferry, and \nhosts more than 7 million cruise ship passengers. Of the more than 2 \nbillion tons of freight, the majority of cargo is shipped in huge \ncontainers from ships directly onto trucks and railcars that \nimmediately head onto our highways and rail systems. Oceangoing sea \ncontainers are a vital artery of the U.S. economy. Indeed, 46 percent \nof all goods imported into the United States, by value, arrive at our \nNation's seaports, mostly in containers, and currently, we are able to \nphysically inspect less than 2 percent of those containers.\n  Since September 11, we have faced up to the task of securing our \nseaport and affiliated transportation systems. We are now faced with \nthe need to adapt the most efficient transportation system, with the \nmost secure and efficient system of transportation. To do so, given the \ncomplexities of the task, we need to rely on all parties in the \ntransportation chain, not just Federal agencies such as the Coast \nGuard, Customs and INS, but State law enforcement and the private \nsector. The enormity of the task we face, and the potential catastrophe \nwe face if we do not strengthen our systems of security, mandates we \nwork on this issue together.\n  In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center \nand the Pentagon, all U.S. airports were closed. Fortunately, we have a \ngood degree of control of our aviation system and were able to re-exert \na degree of normalcy 4 days after the September 11 attacks. If similar \nattacks had occurred at a U.S. port, I am not sure whether we would be \ncomfortable opening our borders in 4 months.\n  We obviously have a huge stake in ensuring the protection of our \nmaritime transportation system and respective arteries of business. To \nthis end, I was disappointed the President's budget request did not \ninclude any funds to help our State port authorities and private ports \nsecure the type of infrastructure and security equipment necessary to \nprotect this Nation. Not providing funding to our seaports is clearly \nan unfunded mandate for States that have seaports, such as my home \nState of Louisiana, and it is our duty as a nation to secure all of our \nborders, including our maritime borders. This issue simply has to be \naddressed, and a Federal commitment is required to help secure our \nmaritime boundaries, and secure our international trade.\n  As I mentioned seaport security is simply too important to disregard. \nWhile visiting the Port Everglades in Florida, the Ports of New \nOrleans, Houston and Charleston, SC, during my subcommittee hearings, I \nbecame aware of the incredible role that information plays in security \nstrategy at our seaports. Given the scope of trade and security, it is \nnecessary that we know more about ships, the seafarers on those ships \nthat enter the United States, the systems that we use to secure cargo \nso it is not tampered with or used for illegal purposes, and also the \nsystem we uses to analyze the risks of shipping and to secure our \nmarine environment.\n  The Ship, Seafarer, and Container Security Act requires certain \nvessels to carry transponders to allow their positions to be \ntransmitted and tracked and ensure the Coast Guard can track United \nStates and foreign vessels. When an aircraft leaves a U.S. airport we \ntrack it wherever it goes, however, when huge oil tankers and hazardous \nmaterial ships carrying tons and tons of explosive cargoes enter U.S. \nwaters, we do not. This is not right, and not prudent.\n  My bill will also require the Department of Transportation, DOT, to \nnegotiate an international agreement in 2 years, or if the agreement \nhas not been negotiated within 2 years to submit legislation to \nCongress, to: One, identify foreign seafarers; two, to provide greater \ntransparency of the ownership of ship registration, so that we can \ntrack vessel ownership; and, three, mandate stronger standards for \nmarine containers, and for anti-tampering and locking systems for \nmarine containers. Importantly, the bill would also require DOT to \nbetter assess the risks posed by certain vessels, and areas they \ndesignate as secure zones, and require recommendations to better secure \nthem.\n  Last year, the U.S. Coast Guard, identifed over 1,000 Panamanian \nseamen operating with licenses they fraudulently obtained for a couple \nof hundred dollars. At the time, it did not create that much of a \nruckus, although perhaps it should have, because the primary focus was \non the safe operation of the vessel. In the aftermath of September 11, \nit gives rise to the potential use of the system of maritime licensing \nto disguise entry into the United States. The system of registration \nand identification of vessels is equally obtuse. In the aftermath of \nthe bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Mombassa and Dar-El-Salem, we \nattempted to track the shipping assets of Asama Bin Laden that were \nused to convey explosives. NATO experts reportedly indicated that \ntracking banking assets was far easier than identifying the shipping \nassets owned by the terrorists. I would also mention that, a recent \nreport in Lloyd's List, a business publication\n\n[[Page S3442]]\n\nspecializing in ocean shipping and international trade, indicated that \nthe Coast Guard interdicted at sea a container ship, with an improperly \nsealed container filled with nuclear warheads. According to the \narticle, the cargo manifest, indicated that it was carrying explosives, \nand the master of the vessel was a citizen of Yemen, while the \nmaterials turned out to be without fissile materials, it still raises \nconsiderable concern about our shipping practices.\n  This legislation is another critical step in addressing some of the \nmany crucial requirements to ensure our nation has a secure system of \ninternational trade, allow us to protect and foster our transportation \nchain, and provide public safety.\n  The issues facing our Nation in seaport security are very serious \nissues. The consequences of relying on our current systems of openness, \nand with our focus on efficiency could be disastrous. However, at the \nother end of the spectrum, is being so excessively obsessed with \nsecurity that we cause the suffocation of trade and business. The \nsystem we had in place prior to 9-11 was insufficient. I believe that \nS. 1214 coupled with the legislation I am introducing will help remedy \nthe flaws of pre- 9-11 security and enhance seaport security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2329\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to convey land to the University of Nevada at Las \nVegas Research Foundation for a research park and technology center; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce this bill, which \nwill convey land to the University of Nevada at Las Vegas Research \nFoundation for a research park and technology center adjacent to \nMcCarran International Airport.\n  This bill transfers a 115-acre parcel from the Clark County \nDepartment of Aviation to the University of Nevada at Las Vegas \nResearch Foundation. The Foundation, in turn, will build a research and \ntechnology park on the parcel, which has been identified as the best \nlocation in the area for this kind of facility.\n\n[[Page S3443]]\n\n  Nevada will benefit significantly from this bill. As you may know, \nLas Vegas is the fastest-growing city in the United States. The \nUniversity of Nevada at Las Vegas needs space to grow. Building this \ntype of research park will also further develop the high-tech industry \nin the State of Nevada. This is just the kind of thoughtful land \nplanning and development that the Las Vegas Valley needs to ensure that \nNevadans are able to maintain the high quality of life that they \ndeserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2333\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, needs land in the \n     greater Las Vegas area to provide for the future growth of \n     the university;\n       (2) the proposal by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, \n     for construction of a research park and technology center in \n     the greater Las Vegas area would enhance the high tech \n     industry and entrepreneurship in the State of Nevada; and\n       (3) the land transferred to the Clark County Department of \n     Aviation under section 4(g) of the Southern Nevada Public \n     Land Management Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-263; 112 Stat. \n     2346) is the best location for the research park and \n     technology center.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide a suitable location for the construction of \n     a research park and technology center in the greater Las \n     Vegas area;\n       (2) to provide the public with opportunities for education \n     and research in the field of high technology; and\n       (3) to provide the State of Nevada with opportunities for \n     competition and economic development in the field of high \n     technology.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA AT LAS VEGAS \n                   RESEARCH FOUNDATION.\n\n       (a) Conveyance.--Notwithstanding section 4(g)(4) of the \n     Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998 (Public \n     Law 105-263; 112 Stat. 2347), the Clark County Department of \n     Aviation may convey, without consideration, all right, title, \n     and interest in and to the parcel of land described in \n     subsection (b) to the University of Nevada at Las Vegas \n     Research Foundation for the development of a technology \n     research center.\n       (b) Description of Land.--The parcel of land referred to in \n     subsection (a) is the parcel of Clark County Department of \n     Aviation land--\n       (1) consisting of approximately 115 acres;\n       (2) located in the SW \\1/4\\ of section 33, T. 21 S., R. 60 \n     E., Mount Diablo Base and Meridian; and\n       (3) identified in the agreement entitled ``Interim \n     Cooperative Management Agreement Between the United States \n     Department of the Interior-Bureau of Land Management and \n     Clark County'', dated November 4, 1992.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 2334. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to accept \nthe donation of certain land in the Mineral Hill-Crevice Mountain \nMining District in the State of Montana, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n Mr. BURNS. I am pleased to announce the introduction of the \nMineral Hill Historic Mining District Preservation Act of 2002. The \npurpose of this Act is for the Forest Service to accept a donation from \nTVX Mineral Hill, Inc., an inholding of approximately 570 acres of \nprivate land in the Gallatin National Forest. This inholding overlooks \nthe Northern entrance of Yellowstone National Park and is within well \nknown elk habitat. The donation also includes 194 acres of mineral \nright underlying federal lands.\n  This bill provides a win-win situation with benefits for the \ncommunity, for wildlife, for the company, and for the environment. \nAfter a rich and storied history, the Mineral Hill mine is played out \nand the opportunity to extract minerals has passed.\n  The property is in very good condition and is being reclaimed in \naccordance with a reclamation plan approved by the Montana Department \nof Environmental Quality. The Forest Service has been closely involved \nduring the reclamation planning and implementation processes to make \ncertain that the property will remain in the excellent environmental \nstate it is in today.\n  As an added guarantee, the United States will also be the beneficiary \nof a $10 million insurance policy provided by TVX to clean up the site \nin the unlikely event that hazardous materials are discovered in the \nfuture.\n  The Mineral Hill Mine is located in the historic Jardine Mining \nDistrict which was established during the 1860s. Many of the buildings \nat the site go back to that time period. Some of the buildings will be \npreserved for interpretation purposes and will be available to the \npublic. In addition, the site will be used in cooperation with Montana \nTech of the University of Montana for mining and geologic education.\n  The Mineral Hill property is being donated by TVX to the government \nwithout the necessity of a payment. There will be ongoing permits \nissued by the State of Montana and by EPA for monitoring of water \ndischarge. This bill allows for those permits to be upheld and for the \nwater processes to be maintained. In a letter to my office dated June \n25, 2001, the Greater Yellowstone Coalition observed that ``we believe \nthat there would be no adverse impact to the agency and indeed would be \na benefit to the public that this donated land is conveyed with the \nobligation to maintain the NPDES permit already in force.'' This is \nexactly what the bill provides in Section 11.\n  I am pleased to say that this is a bill with the support of all key \nparties. The Forest Service has agreed to the transfer and management \nof the land and has been actively involved in this process. The \nGardiner Chamber of Commerce supports the project, as do the \nCommissioners of Park County. The Greater Yellowstone Coalition also \nsupports the donation.\n  Simply put, this legislation is in the public interest. On behalf of \nthe people of Montana, I look forward to its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Ms. Stabenow, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2335. A bill to establish the Office of Native American Affairs \nwithin the Small Business Administration, to create the Native American \nSmall Business Development Program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today, I proudly join with Senator \nKerry to introduce the Native American Small Business Development Act \nof 2002. This important legislation is designed to help American \nIndians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to overcome barriers \nwhich inhibit business development and job creation. We greatly \nappreciate the support of the distinguished Senators who join us in \nsponsoring the legislation including Senators Cantwell, Wellstone, \nDaschle, Baucus, Inouye, Bingaman, Stabenow, and Clinton. I encourage \nmy colleagues to support this critical legislation.\n  The communities served by this initiative represent some of the most \ntraditionally isolated, disadvantaged, and underserved populations in \nour country. Despite the unique and persistent challenges to business \ndevelopment in these areas, many of the supportive services the Federal \nGovernment provides to entrepreneurs are not available in these \ndistressed regions. The Native American Small Business Development Act \nendeavors to develop and disseminate culturally tailored business \nassistance to assure Native American businesses may secure and sustain \nlong-term success.\n  Among the achievements included in the bill is the establishment of a \nstatutory office within the U.S. Small Business Administration to focus \non concerns specific to Native American populations. The Office of \nNative American Affairs will serve as an advocate in the SBA for the \ninterests of Native Americans. In addition to administering the Native \nAmerican Development Program, the Assistant Administrator will consult \nwith Tribal Colleges, Tribal Governments, Alaska Native Corporations \nand Native Hawaiian Organizations to enhance the development and \nimplementation of culturally specific approaches to support the growth \nand prosperity of Native American small businesses.\n  Furthermore, the Act creates the Native American Development Program \nto provide necessary business development assistance. These services \nare vital to establish and support small businesses. The Federal \nGovernment currently invests to provide these services in communities \nthroughout the\n\n[[Page S3444]]\n\ncountry. It is past time for these services to be integrated into our \nefforts to promote self-sufficiency and economic development in Indian \nCountry.\n  In addition, we recognize that in order to remain competitive, \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs must be innovative and flexible to change. \nThis legislation reflects the needs of businesses, tribes, and regional \ninterests to pursue unique approaches that will complement local needs \nand improve the overall quality of services. Two pilot programs are \nintegrated in this approach to promote new and creative solutions to \nassist American Indians to awaken economic opportunities in their \ncommunities.\n  We must strive to eliminate the impediments that stifle Native \nAmerican entrepreneurs. By providing business planning services and \ntechnical assistance to potential and existing small businesses, we can \nunlock the capacity for individuals and families to pursue their dreams \nof business ownership. Not only will these efforts combat poverty and \nunemployment, but they will bring new services and opportunities to \ncommunities that enhance the quality of life for local families.\n  We must also work to improve access to investment capital to support \neconomic and community development for Native Americans. As the \nchairman of the Senate Banking Financial Institutions Subcommittee, I \nam conducting hearings to identify opportunities and techniques which \nmay foster greater access to capital markets for Tribal and Native \nAmerican entities.\n  Together, these initiatives will help to turn an important corner as \nwe endeavor to enhance the livelihood of the first Americans.\n  I would like to thank Congressman Udall for his leadership in the \nU.S. House of Representatives in bringing these issues to the forefront \nand for his cooperation on this historic legislation. I would like to \nthank Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, for his hard work on this legislation and \nhis serious commitment to these critical issues. In addition, I would \nlike to express my sincere appreciation for the strong support of the \nmany cosponsors who join us in introducing the bill today.\n  I encourage the Senate to fully consider this historic legislation \nand to work expeditiously to enact it into law. The Native American \nSmall Business Development Act will forge a more hopeful and prosperous \nfuture for Native American families and communities. By investing in \nadequate infrastructure and by making the appropriate tools available, \nwe can empower individuals to pursue, achieve, and sustain economic \nopportunities that enrich their lives and their communities. The \nAmerican dream will never be fully realized until it becomes a reality \nfor all Americans. This legislation is critical to ensuring that \neconomic growth and economic opportunity permeate the lives of Native \nAmerican families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2335\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my \ncolleague, Senator Johnson, as well as the cosponsors of our \nlegislation, Senators, Cantwell, Wellstone, Daschle, Baucus, Inouye, \nBingaman, Stabenow, and Clinton in introducing the Native American \nSmall Business Development Act.\n  This legislation bears the same name as legislation that passed the \nHouse last year, H.R. 2538, which was introduced by Congressman Tom \nUdall, a recognized leader in promoting the interests of American \nIndians. I would like to thank Congressman Udall for his work in \nstewarding H.R. 2538 through the House and for his assistance in \nworking with Senator Johnson and me in drafting the Senate version of \nour legislation.\n  I would also like to thank the National Indian Business Association, \nthe National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development, the \nAssociation of Small Business Development Centers, ONABEN, Native \nAmerican Management Services, Inc., and all of the tribes that met with \nus or provided information to help in the crafting of this legislation.\n  The Senate version of the Native American Small Business Development \nAct, while incorporating the heart of the Udall legislation, is more \ncomprehensive and provides greater assistance to Native American \ncommunities. Senator Johnson, who serves on the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, and I, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship, were able to combine our resources in crafting \nthis legislation.\n  Our desire to fashion a comprehensive assistance package for Native \nAmerican small businesses stems in no small part from an apparent lack \nof commitment the Small Business Administration (SBA) has shown to our \nNative American communities under the Bush Administration.\n  While I applaud the Bush Administration for responding to \ncongressional requests and including $1 million in the Administration's \nfiscal year 2003 budget request for Native American outreach, I was \ndisappointed that it did not seek the full level of $2.5 million \nrequested in a letter I sent with my colleagues Senators Daschle, \nWellstone, Johnson, Bingaman and Baucus. Our request specifically \nsought funding for the SBA's Tribal Business Information Center (TBIC) \nprogram, started under the Clinton Administration and designed to \naddress the unique conditions faced by American Indians when they seek \nto start or expand small businesses.\n  I do not believe that anyone in this Congress would dispute that \neconomic development in Indian Country has often been difficult to \nachieve and that one important way to help American Indians who live on \nreservations is to provide them with assistance to open and run their \nown small businesses. Helping Native Americans open and run small \nbusinesses not only instills a sense of pride in the owner and his or \nher community, it also provides much-needed job opportunities, as well \nas other economic benefits.\n  Although underfunded, the TBIC program has provided assistance to a \nnumber of small businesses on Indian reservations. TBICs have the \nsupport of the American Indian communities they serve because they \nprovide desperately needed, culturally tailored business development \nassistance in those communities. The administration should be seeking \nto strengthen its commitment to programs that assist Native American \ncommunities. Unfortunately, the SBA cut off TBIC funding on March 31, \n2002, and has not met a request by a bipartisan group of Senators to \nbegin the reprogramming process in order to keep the TBICs open for the \nremainder of the fiscal year.\n\n  The Native American Small Business Development Act will ensure that \nthe SBA's programs to assist Native American Affairs (ONAA) a permanent \noffice, create a statutory grant program, known as the Native American \nDevelopment grant program, to assist Native Americans, establish two \npilot programs to try new means of assisting Native American \ncommunities and require Native American communities to be consulted \nregarding the future of SBA programs designed to assist them. In short, \nour legislation will ensure that our Native American communities will \nreceive the assistance they need to help start and grow small \nbusinesses.\n  The ONAA, to be headed by an Assistant Administrator, will be \nresponsible for assisting Native Americans and Native American \ncommunities to start, operate, and grow small business concerns; \ndevelop management and technical skills; seek Federal procurement \nopportunities; increase employment opportunities through the start and \nexpansion of small business concerns; and increase their access to \ncapital markets.\n  To be selected to serve as the Assistant Administrator for ONAA, a \ncandidate must have knowledge of Native American cultures and \nexperience providing culturally tailored small business development \nassistance to Native Americans. Under our legislation, the Assistant \nAdministrator would be statutorily required to consult with Tribal \nColleges and Tribal Governments, Alaska Native Corporations (ANC) and \nNative Hawaiian Organizations (NHO) when carrying out responsibilities \nunder this legislation. The Assistant Administrator for ONAA would be \nresponsible for administering the Native American Development program \nand the pilot programs created by the Native American Small Business \nDevelopment Act.\n  The Native American Development program is designed to be the SBA's \nprimary program for providing business development assistance to Native \nAmerican communities. To offer this support, the SBA will provide \nfinancial and resource assistance to establish and keep Native American \nBusiness Centers (NABC) in operation. Financial assistance under the \nNative American Development program would be available to Tribal \nGovernments and Tribal Colleges. Unlike the SBA's TBIC program, \nhowever, ANCs and NHOs would also be eligible for the grants.\n  NABCs would address the unique conditions faced by reservation-based \nAmerican Indians, as well as Native Hawaiians and Native Alaskans, in \ntheir efforts to create, develop and expand small business concerns. \nGrant funding would be used by the NABCs to provide culturally tailored \nfinancial education assistance, management education assistance, and \nmarketing education assistance.\n  The first pilot program under the legislation establishes a Native \nAmerican development grant. This grant is modeled after the Udall \nlegislation and designed to bring the expertise of SBA's Small Business \nDevelopment Centers (SBDC) to Native American communities. \nAdditionally, any private nonprofit organization, whose board of \ndirectors consists of a majority of Tribal Government members or their \ndesignees, is an NHO or an ANC, may also apply for the grant. \nNonprofits were included in the Senate version thanks to the thoughtful \ninput of Senator Cantwell. Many American Indian communities in \nWashington State are served by an organization called ONABEN, which \nprovides SBDC-like services to Native American communities in \nWashington, Oregon, Idaho, and California. Organizations like ONABEN \nshould be encouraged to provide resources to Native American \ncommunities, and including them in the grant program available to SBDCs \nwas an important addition to the legislation.\n  Finally, our legislation establishes a second pilot program to try a \nunique experiment in Indian County. Grant funding would be made \navailable to establish American Indian Tribal Assistance Centers. These \ncenters will consist of joint entities, such as a partnership between \nan NABC, a Native American development center (which receive grants \nfrom the Department of Commerce) and possibly an SBDC. The purpose of \nthis grant is to bring together experts from various entities to \nprovide culturally tailored business development assistance to \nprospective and\n\n[[Page S3448]]\n\ncurrent owners of small business concerns on or near Tribal Lands.\n  I would again like to thank Senator Johnson and all of the cosponsors \nof this important legislation to assist our Native American \ncommunities. I would also, again, like to thank Congressman Udall for \ntaking the lead in the House on providing critical assistance for small \nbusinesses in Native American communities. I would urge all of my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this legislation to help us fulfill our \ncommitment to Native American communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3448-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3448-S3449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 252--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN TIBET, THE PANCHEN LAMA, AND THE NEED FOR \n   DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP AND THE DALAI LAMA OR HIS \n                            REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 252\n\n       Whereas Hu Jintao, Vice President of the People's Republic \n     of China and former Party Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous \n     Region, will visit the United States in April and May of \n     2002;\n       Whereas Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was taken from his home by \n     Chinese authorities on May 17, 1995, at the age of 6, shortly \n     after being recognized as the 11th incarnation of the Panchen \n     Lama by the Dalai Lama;\n       Whereas the forced disappearance of the Panchen Lama \n     violates fundamental freedoms enshrined in international \n     human rights covenants to which the People's Republic of \n     China is a party, including the Convention on the Rights of \n     the Child;\n       Whereas the use of religious belief as the primary criteria \n     for repression against Tibetans reflects a continuing pattern \n     of grave human rights violations that have occurred since the \n     invasion of Tibet in 1949-50;\n       Whereas the State Department Country Reports on Human \n     Rights Practices for 2001 states that repressive social and \n     political controls continue to limit the fundamental freedoms \n     of Tibetans and risk undermining Tibet's unique cultural, \n     religious, and linguistic heritage, and that repeated \n     requests for access to the Panchen Lama to confirm his well-\n     being and whereabouts have been denied; and\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has failed to respond positively to efforts by the Dalai Lama \n     to enter into dialogue based on his proposal for genuine \n     autonomy within the People's Republic of China with a view to \n     safeguarding the distinct identity of Tibet and protecting \n     the human rights of the Tibetan people: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Vice President Hu Jintao should be made aware of \n     congressional concern for the Panchen Lama and the need to \n     resolve the situation in Tibet through dialogue with the \n     Dalai Lama or his representatives; and\n       (2) the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     should--\n       (A) release the Panchen Lama and allow him to pursue his \n     traditional role at Tashi Lhunpo monastery in Tibet; and\n       (B) enter into dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his \n     representatives in order to find a negotiated solution for \n     genuine autonomy that respects the rights of all Tibetans.\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and \ncelebrate the 13th birthday of Gendun Choekyi Nyima, the boy recognized \nby the Dalai Lama in 1995 as the 11th reincarnation of the Panchen \nLama, Tibet's second highest spiritual leader.\n  As you may know, shortly after the Dalai Lama recognized Gedhun \nChoekyi Nyima as the Panchen Lama in 1995, the Chinese government \nabducted him with his family. He was 6 years old at the time. Today, \nthe Panchen Lama remains in detention, and his whereabouts are unknown. \nFor the past 7 years repeated requests from both governments and \nprivate humanitarian organizations to meet with the boy have been \ndenied. It is intolerable that the Chinese leadership is using this \nyoung child in their efforts to tighten their grip on Tibet. On his \n13th birthday, he remains one of the world's youngest political and \nreligious prisoners.\n  Tibetans are persecuted for their religious beliefs. Prior to the \nChinese invasion of 1950, Tibet was a deeply religious society. \nReligion remains an integral part of the daily lives of Tibetans, and \nit forms the social fabric connecting them to the land. Since the \nChinese take over, religious practice and belief have come at a great \ncost. Over 6,000 monasteries and sacred places have been destroyed by \nthe Chinese. Religious leaders are incarcerated with great frequency. \nThey are forced to perform ``reeducation labor,'' and often subjected \nto torture, including electric shock, rape, and other serious forms of \nabuse.\n  The Chinese Government continues to exert power over Tibetans by \nrequiring monks to sign a declaration rejecting independence for Tibet, \nrejecting the Panchen Lama, rejecting and denouncing the Dalai Lama, \nrecognizing the unity of China and Tibet, and ignoring the voice of \nAmerica. Monks who refuse to accept these terms risk expulsion from \ntheir monasteries, or possible incarceration. Fleeing is the only other \noption for Tibetans who refuse to accept these terms. Historically, up \nto 3,000 Tibetans enter Nepal each year to escape the conditions.\n  Religious persecution is not the only type of persecution in Tibet. \nTibetans are also subject to political imprisonment. A few months ago, \nI had the honor of meeting with Ngawang Choephel, a former Fulbright \nscholar who taught at Middlebury College in Vermont, who was imprisoned \nin 1995. What was his crime, the crime for which his brave mother \nlabored intensively to have him freed? He was arrested and jailed for \nespionage while filming a documentary on performing arts in Tibet. \nAfter serving more than 6 years, he was released on a medical parole. \nRegrettably, his story is emblematic of the daily struggles faced by \nTibetans.\n  China has consistently used excessive military force to stifle \ndissent, which has resulted in untold cases of arbitrary arrests, \nimprisonment, torture, and execution. Moreover, the Tibetan people are \ndenied the rights to self determination, freedom of speech, assembly, \nmovement, expression and travel, rights enshrined in the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. Population transfers, environmental \ndegradation, forced abortions and sterilizations, and the systematic \ndestruction of the Tibetan language and culture continue unabated.\n  The problems in Tibet go beyond continuing human rights violations. \nAs long as the Tibetan people are denied the right to self \ndetermination, human rights violations and political unrest will \ncontinue. For almost 40 years Chinese oppression in Tibet has been met \nby resistance. However, despite over four decades of force and \nintimidation, the Tibetan people have proven again and again that they \nwill not succumb. Until a negotiated settlement is reached, Tibet will \nremain a contentious and potentially destabilizing issue for China. The \nonly way to settle the question of Tibet is for the Chinese leadership \nto enter into negotiations with the Dalai Lama or his representatives.\n  Both publicly and privately, the Dalai Lama has stated his \nwillingness to negotiate with the Chinese in his own words, ``anywhere, \nanytime, and with no pre-conditions.'' Thus far, Beijing has refused to \neven consider talking to him. Despite the fact that the Dalai Lama is \nrespected worldwide as a spiritual leader and was awarded the Nobel \nPeace Prize, Chinese Communist party leaders continue to eschew \ndialogue.\n  Next week, Chinese President Hu Jintao will visit the United States \nfor the first time. Many believe that he will be the next Premier of \nChina. As you may know, Hu Jintao was the Party Secretary in the Tibet \nAutonomous Region, TAR, from 1988 to 1992. During his tenure as Party \nSecretary, Hu Jintao made a name for himself as a tough administrator \nof Beijing's control mechanisms in Tibet, including the use of deadly \nforce against unarmed Tibetan protestors.\n  Despite Hu Jintao's record as TAR Party Secretary, I, like some \nTibetans, remain hopeful that he can play a positive role in the \nfuture. Because Hu has direct experience with the sentiments of \nTibetans, he could be more responsive to Tibetan interests than past \nChinese leaders. On November 9, 2001, Hu told journalists in Berlin, \n``I have been in Tibet for almost 4 years and I am very familiar with \nthe situation.'' It is a positive factor that Hu Jintao knows \nconditions in Tibet from first-hand experience.\n  In light of his visit, I am introducing a resolution in the Senate \ncalling for\n\n[[Page S3449]]\n\nthe release of the Panchen Lama. With this action, I am also hoping to \nsee a serious and substantive discussion of the continued human rights \nviolations in China and Tibet. I will continue to communicate these \nobjectives directly to the administration and the Chinese leadership. \nSpecifically, I strongly believe we should urge the Chinese leadership: \nTo release the Panchen Lama and allow him to pursue his traditional \nrole at Tashi Lhunpo monastery in Tibet; and to enter into dialogue \nwith the Dalai Lama or his representatives in order to find a \nnegotiated solution for genuine autonomy that respects the rights of \nall Tibetans.\n  Today, across America Tibetans and their supporters are staging \nevents to draw international attention and support for Tibet. This \nincludes five Tibetan men who are biking from the state capitol in St. \nPaul, MN, to the Chinese Embassy in Chicago. There, they are calling \nfor the release of the Panchen Lama, the second highest leader in \nTibetan Buddhism. Today, I ask that the Senate join their cause. Free \nthe Panchen Lama.\n  I offer my deepest respect and prayers to them and to the countless \nbrave men and women who have lost their lives in the struggle to bring \nfreedom and democracy to Tibet. It is my hope that the United States \nwill be ``on the right side of history'' by pressing hard for \nnegotiations and a peaceful solution to the Tibetan situation, in \naccordance with U.N. resolutions.\n  Finally, I would like to commend the Tibetan people, who under the \nleadership of the Dalai Lama, have remained steadfast in their \ncommitment to non-violence. While in other parts of the world \nindividuals seeking freedom have employed any means available, \nincluding violence and terrorism, the Tibetans have not altered from \nthe path of nonviolence, even while their homeland, their families, \ntheir religion, and their culture are decimated. To turn away from the \nTibetan people in their hour of need, would send a message to the world \nthat the international community does not care about what is just. I \nurge Tibetans to stay the course of nonviolence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3449-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 253--REITERATING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n              THE RISE OF ANTI-SEMITIC VIOLENCE IN EUROPE\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \nHatch) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Res. 254\n\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools authorized by a \n     designated public body and operating on the principles of \n     accountability, parental involvement, choice, and autonomy;\n       Whereas in exchange for the flexibility and autonomy given \n     to charter schools, they are held accountable by their \n     sponsors for improving student achievement and for their \n     financial and other operations;\n       Whereas 37 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have passed laws authorizing \n     charter schools;\n       Whereas 37 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico will have received substantial \n     assistance from the Federal Government by the end of the \n     current fiscal year for planning, startup, and implementation \n     of charter schools since their authorization in 1994 under \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6301 et seq.);\n       Whereas 34 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are serving more than 500,000 \n     students in more than 2,431 charter schools during the 2001-\n     2002 school year;\n       Whereas charter schools can be vehicles for improving \n     student academic achievement for the students who attend \n     them, for stimulating change and improvement in all public \n     schools, and for benefiting all public school students;\n       Whereas charter schools must meet the same Federal student \n     academic achievement accountability requirements as all \n     public schools, and often set higher and additional goals, to \n     ensure that they are of high quality and truly accountable to \n     the public;\n       Whereas charter schools assess and evaluate students \n     annually and often more frequently, and charter school \n     student academic achievement is directly linked to charter \n     school existence;\n       Whereas charter schools give parents new freedom to choose \n     their public school, charter schools routinely measure \n     parental approval, and charter schools must prove their \n     ongoing and increasing success to parents, policymakers, and \n     their communities;\n       Whereas two-thirds of charter schools report having a \n     waiting list, the average size of such a waiting list is \n     nearly one-half of the school's enrollment, and the total \n     number of students on all such waiting lists is enough to \n     fill another 1,000 average-sized charter schools;\n       Whereas students in charter schools nationwide have similar \n     demographic characteristics as students in all public \n     schools;\n\n[[Page S3450]]\n\n       Whereas charter schools in many States serve significant \n     numbers of students from families with lower income, minority \n     students, and students with disabilities, and in a majority \n     of charter schools almost half of the students are considered \n     at risk or are former dropouts;\n       Whereas charter schools have enjoyed broad bipartisan \n     support from the Administration, Congress, State Governors \n     and legislatures, educators, and parents across the Nation; \n     and\n       Whereas charter schools are laboratories of reform and \n     serve as models of how to educate children as effectively as \n     possible: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 29, 2002, through May 3, 2002, as \n     ``National Charter Schools Week'';\n       (1) honors the 10th anniversary of the opening of the \n     Nation's first charter school;\n       (2) acknowledges and commends the charter school movement \n     and charter schools, teachers, parents, and students across \n     the Nation for their ongoing contributions to education and \n     improving and strengthening the Nation's public school \n     system;\n       (3) supports the goals of National Charter Schools Week, an \n     event sponsored by charter schools and charter school \n     organizations across the Nation and established to recognize \n     the significant impacts, achievements, and innovations of the \n     Nation's charter schools; and\n       (4) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to conduct \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities to \n     demonstrate support for charter schools in communities \n     throughout the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3450-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3376.

Mr. President, earlier this month, Attorney General \nAshcroft announced that the defendant in the case where two women were \nkilled in the Shenandoah National Park will be tried using the Hate \nCrimes Sentencing Enhancement Act. This is the first time in the \nhistory of our country that a Federal murder prosecution will use this \nprovision of the law.\n  At his press conference announcing the indictments, Attorney General \nAshcroft said:\n\n       Criminal acts of hate run counter to what is best in \n     America--our belief in equality and freedom.\n\n  He was absolutely right. Americans know that hate crimes injure the \nvictim, the community, and the entire Nation. No one should be attacked \nsimply because of his or her race, religion, gender, physical \nabilities, or sexual orientation.\n  As Senator Edward Kennedy has said, until we pass the hate crimes \nlegislation pending before Congress, the promise to aggressively \nprosecute hate crimes is really an empty promise.\n  For many years now, we have attempted to pass the hate crimes \nlegislation that Senator Kennedy and others have introduced. In the \nfall of 2000, this same bill passed the Senate as an amendment on the \nDepartment of Defense authorizations bill. However, despite strong \nbicameral, bipartisan support, it was stripped out of the conference \nreport, as happens a lot of times.\n  The need is clear. The support is there. It is time to finish the job \nwe started 2 years ago and pass the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement \nAct, and pass it quickly.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Republican leader, may turn to the \nconsideration of S. 625, the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, and \nthat it be considered under the following limitations: There be 4 hours \nfor debate on the bill, equally divided between the chairman and \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee; that each leader, or their \ndesignee, be permitted to offer two relevant first-degree amendments; \nthat there be a time limitation of 1 hour for debate on each first-\ndegree amendment; that no second-degree amendments be in order prior to \na failed motion to table; that if a second-degree amendment is offered, \nit be relevant to the first degree and be limited to 30 minutes for \ndebate; that upon the disposition of the amendments, and the use or \nyielding back of the time on the bill, the bill be read a third time, \nand the Senate vote on passage of the bill, without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  Prior to putting this to the Senate, I simply say, we are going to \ncontinually offer this unanimous consent request. This unanimous \nconsent request tonight is not going to be approved tonight, and that \nis too bad. I wish it could be. We need to move this legislation. It is \npriority legislation for the Senate and, therefore, for this country.\n  Now, Mr. President, on behalf of the minority, the Republicans, I \nobject. I explained to them I was going to move this forward. As you \nknow, we have worked very long and hard on a number of different \nmatters, and I indicated that it would not be necessary for a Senator \nto remain to simply object, as I have. But I do say that I am \ntremendously disappointed that I have to object on behalf of the \nminority. It is too bad. But we will revisit this in the near future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3454-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TERRORISM REINSURANCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to read into the Record a \nletter that is written to the Honorable Tom Daschle, majority leader of \nthe Senate; the Honorable Trent Lott, Republican leader of the Senate; \nthe Honorable Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives; \nand the Honorable Richard Gephardt, House Democratic leader. The letter \nis dated April 15 of this year.\n\n       Dear Congressional Leaders: As a result of the event of \n     September 11th, the nation's property and casualty insurance \n     companies have or will pay out losses that will exceed $35 \n     billion dollars. Since the first of January, many insurance \n     companies, self-insurers and states have been faced with a \n     situation where they are unable to spread the risk that they \n     insure because of the unavailability of reinsurance \n     protection. In the event of another major attack, some \n     companies or perhaps a segment of the industry would face \n     insolvency. While most states have approved a limited \n     exclusion for terrorism with a $25 million deductible, \n     exclusions for workers' compensation coverage are not \n     permitted by statute in any state. The present situation \n     poses a grave risk to the solvency of the insurance industry, \n     state insurance facilities, economic development initiatives, \n     and the ability of our states to recover from impacts of the \n     September 11th attacks.\n       In the months after the attack on our nation, legislation \n     passed in the House and was introduced in the Senate to \n     create a backstop for the insurance industry so they could \n     continue to provide protection to their customers. The \n     Administration has also supported this concept. Currently, \n     there is broad bi-partisan agreement for providing an \n     insurance backstop. Governors believe this is an important \n     goal that should not be inhibited by other issues.\n       Since late December, the lack of a financial backstop has \n     started to ripple through the economy and will continue to do \n     so. This will further impact the ability of the economy to \n     recover from the current recession.\n       As Governors, we are facing many critical issues resulting \n     from the September 11th crisis. The emerging problem in \n     insurance coverage only serves to exacerbate our recovery \n     efforts. In view of this, we the undersigned Governors, \n     respectfully urge the Congress to quickly complete its work \n     on the terrorism reinsurance legislation in order to return \n     stability to U.S. insurance markets.\n           Sincerely,\n\n  The letter is signed by Governor Hodges of the State of South \nCarolina; Governor Johanns of the State of Nebraska; Governor Patton of \nthe State of Kentucky; Governor Martz of the State of Montana; Governor \nSiegelman of the State of Alabama; Governor Holden of the State of \nMissouri; Governor Warner of the State of Virginia; Governor McCallum \nof the State of Wisconsin; Governor Owens of the State of Colorado; \nGovernor Ryan of the State of Illinois; Governor Geringer of the State \nof Wyoming; Governor Huckabee of the State of Arkansas; Governor King \nof the State of Maine; Governor Rowland of the State of Connecticut; \nGovernor Bush of the State of Florida; Governor O'Bannon of the State \nof Indiana; Governor Taft of the State of Ohio; Governor Swift of the \nState of Massachusetts.\n  I have been advised that there are many other Governors who would \nhave signed this letter. But as with all things, sometimes it is \ndifficult to get the signatures from all of those Governors.\n  I personally have had many conversations regarding this issue. I have \nhad conversations with people in the insurance industry. I have had \nconversations in my office right across the hall with people in the \nreal estate business. I have had many conversations with people in the \nfinancial markets across the country, and people from home, people who \nwant to continue one of the largest construction projects we have had \nin Nevada. It would be a huge mall. It is already half completed. It is \na huge facility that they said they will have to stop construction by \nthe first of June if that is not taken care of.\n  Senator Dodd has worked incredibly hard to put together a bill that \nresolves this serious problem. The White House wants this bill to get \nto conference with the House, we are told. As I have indicated, these \nGovernors, Democratic and Republican, have called for this action. I \nhave personally spent a lot of time with the Presiding Officer, junior \nSenator from Florida, who, prior to coming here, was insurance \ncommissioner of one of the largest States in the Union, and who has a \nvery personal knowledge of the insurance industry. The leader has \nspoken to the Senator from Florida many times more than I have because \nwe have looked to him for leadership on this issue.\n  I am prepared to move forward with a unanimous consent request \nrelating to this issue. I will do so. The only question at this time is \nwhether the Republican leader is in the building. I wouldn't want him \nto come from his residence. If he is not here in a reasonable period of \ntime, I will be notified by staff. I will at that time make the consent \nrequest.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3455-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3455]]\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3210\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Republican leader, may turn to the \nconsideration of H.R. 3210, the terrorism insurance bill, and that it \nbe considered under the following limitations: That the Dodd-Sarbanes-\nSchumer substitute be agreed to for purposes of original text; that \nthere be a time limitation of 3 hours for debate on the bill and 1 hour \nfor debate on each amendment equally divided in the usual form; that \nthe only amendments in order be relevant to terrorism insurance; that \nin addition to a managers' amendment, the following be the only \namendments in order: Senator Hollings, relevant; Senator Nelson of \nFlorida, relevant; Senator Wyden, relevant; Senator Leahy, relevant; \nthat Senator Lott, or his designee, be permitted to offer four first-\ndegree amendments; that relevant second-degree amendments be in order \nand limited to 30 minutes for debate equally divided in the usual form; \nthat upon the disposition of these amendments and the conclusion or \nyielding back of debate time, the bill be read a third time and the \nSenate vote, without any intervening debate, on final passage of the \nbill.\n  I would say that I have been advised, and certainly this has been the \ncase in the past, that Senator Lott, the Republican leader, would offer \na counter to this agreement. I would simply say this is how we would \nlike to go forward. This is what we have been asked to have cleared on \nour side for a long period of time. We have done that. It is cleared on \nour side.\n  I think it is a shame that we are not going to be able to get this \napproved. I believe this is something that is critical to be done. I am \ndisappointed we will not be able to do that.\n  As I have indicated in relation to the hate crimes unanimous consent \nrequest, the Republicans have indicated that if I did offer this \ntonight, they would object. As I have said, there is absolutely no \nreason at this late hour that somebody wait because this would have \ntaken an hour or two for them to wait around, and that was not \nnecessary. So on behalf of the minority, I object to my own request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the hour is late, and I am not \ngoing to speak but a couple of minutes, just to lay the predicate for \nthe subject that the distinguished Senator from Nevada has just raised, \nto which the Republican minority has entered an objection--the bill on \nproviding Federal backup for the terrorism risk the insurance industry \nwould assume.\n  I am assuming that eventually we will get some agreement to bring \nthis legislation to the floor. I want the record to reflect that it is \nthe considered judgment of this Senator, with the experience I have had \nin my former public service as insurance commissioner of Florida, that \nthere needs to be some considerable tightening of this legislation, and \nthe majority leader and the assistant majority leader have been kind \nenough to indicate that I will be protected in order to offer one of \nthe amendments.\n  That amendment would simply be to make sure the rates are frozen on \nany further rate hike until the actuarial soundness can be determined \nof what should be the rate with regard to the terrorism risk. The \nproblem for determining that is the fact that there is no data--very \nlittle, except for the data we now have from September 11, and that is \nthe only experience we have, save the earlier decade of the nineties \nand the attempt at bombing the World Trade Center. Therefore, it is \nvery difficult to determine what is an adequate rate. Because it is \ndifficult, it is also easy to jack the rates up sky high.\n  So that is the burden I will come to the floor to try to address.\n  If the Republican minority ever releases their objection to this \nlegislation, then we need to perfect this legislation so that the \nratepayers, the consumers, are not paying a much higher rate for the \nterrorism risk than is justified by actuarial soundness.\n  I thank the assistant majority leader for presiding so I could come \ndown to make this statement. I look forward to working with the \nleadership on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. NELSON of Florida assumed the chair).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3455-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3455-S3456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DESIGNATING APRIL 30, 2002, AS ``DIA DE LOS NINOS: CELEBRATING YOUNG \n                              AMERICANS''\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 249\n\n       Whereas many nations throughout the world, and especially \n     within the Western hemisphere, celebrate ``Dia de los Ninos'' \n     on the 30th of April, in recognition and celebration of their \n     country's future--their children;\n       Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas children are the center of American families;\n       Whereas children should be nurtured and invested in to \n     preserve and enhance economic prosperity, democracy, and the \n     American spirit;\n       Whereas Hispanics in the United States, the youngest and \n     fastest growing ethnic community in the Nation, continue the \n     tradition of honoring their children on this day, and wish to \n     share this custom with the rest of the Nation;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 Americans is projected to be of Hispanic \n     descent by the year 2050, and there are, in 2002, \n     approximately 12.3 million Hispanic children in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas traditional Hispanic family life centers largely on \n     children;\n       Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, \n     and culture are parents and family members, and we rely on \n     children to pass on these family values, morals, and culture \n     to future generations;\n       Whereas more than 500,000 children drop out of school each \n     year and Hispanic dropout rates are unacceptably high;\n       Whereas the importance of literacy and education are most \n     often communicated to children through family members;\n       Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family \n     and community activities that include extended and elderly \n     family members and encourage children to explore, develop \n     confidence, and pursue their dreams;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of \n     the Nation will help affirm for the people of the United \n     States the significance of family, education, and community;\n       Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition of \n     children of the United States will provide an opportunity to \n     children to reflect on their future, to articulate their \n     dreams and aspirations, and find comfort and security in the \n     support of their family members and communities;\n       Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving \n     as a voice for children, has worked with cities throughout \n     the country to declare April 30 as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''--a day to bring together \n     Latinos and other communities nationwide to celebrate and \n     uplift children;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 254, submitted earlier today by \nSenators Lieberman, Gregg, Carper, and Hutchinson of Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 254) designating April 29, 2002, \n     through May 3, 2002, as ``National Charter Schools Week,'' \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues, \nSenators Gregg, Carper, Hutchinson, and Bayh in introducing this \nresolution today to salute the success of public charter schools in our \ncountry and to designate April 29, 2002 through May 3, 2002, as \nNational Charter Schools Week.\n  This week also marks the 10th anniversary of the opening of the \nNation's first charter school. Since the City Academy in St. Paul, MN, \nwas founded, the idea has been catching on.\n  From seeing several charter schools up close, I am convinced that \nthey represent one of the most promising engines of education reform in \nthe country today. Charter schools grant educators freedom from top-\nheavy bureaucracies and their red tape in exchange for a commitment to \nmeet high academic standards. In 1994, I was proud to join my colleague \nDave Durenberger of Minnesota as sponsor of the bill authorizing the \nFederal Charter School Grant Program, which Congress passed with strong \nbipartisan majorities and which has provided more than $750 million \nsince then for planning, startup and implementation of charter schools.\n  I also think it's important to note in many cases charter schools are \nbuilt from the ground up by educational entrepreneurs, teachers, \nparents and local leaders seeking to reinvent the public school and \ntake it back to the future, reconnecting public education to some of \nour oldest, most basic values--responsibility, opportunity, community, \nand refocusing its mission on doing what's best for the child instead \nof what's best for the system.\n  The results speak for themselves. Today, over 500,000 students attend \nmore than 2,400 charter schools in 34 States, the District of Columbia, \nand the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. And, nationwide charters schools \nhave combined waiting lists long enough to fill another 1,000 schools. \nParents and educators in turn have given these programs overwhelmingly \nvery high marks. Growing research shows that charter schools are \neffectively serving diverse populations, particularly many of the \ndisadvantaged and at-risk children that traditional public schools have \nstruggled to educate.\n  Despite our achievements to date, we cannot rest on our laurels. We \nmust strive to increase options, and replicate successes. Recently, \nsome skeptics have criticized what they see as a slow down in the \ngrowth of charter schools and an increase in the number of schools that \nhave closed. Although the hundreds of families on waiting lists clearly \nrefutes these skeptics, we must rightly maintain our vigilance to \nensure that charter schools reach our high academic expectations and \ndemand accountability from those that our failing their students.\n  Unfortunately in too many cases, charter schools are the victims of \npoorly drafted charter school laws and inadequate funding. I am pleased \nthat many of the reforms enacted under the recently signed No Child \nLeft Behind Act will further strengthen the academic performance of \ncharter schools and help put them on firmer fiscal footing. Recognizing \nthat greater choice and accountability enhances our public education \nsystem, I recently urged all American colleges and universities to \ncreate charter schools. Parents are crying out for more high-quality \npublic school options that prepare their children for college, and \ncolleges are perfectly positioned to help.\n  The most remarkable aspect of the charter movement may be that it has \nmanaged to bring together educators, parents, community activists, \nbusiness leaders and politicians from across the political spectrum in \nsupport of a common goal to better educate our children by offering \nmore choice, more grassroots control and more accountability within our \npublic schools. I am proud to salute these growing community efforts \nthroughout our nation, and commend these frontline educational \ninnovations for their commitment to expanding educational options for \nAmerican families to ensure that all children reach high levels of \nacademic achievement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to, en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid on \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 254\n\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools authorized by a \n     designated public body and operating on the principles of \n     accountability, parental involvement, choice, and autonomy;\n       Whereas in exchange for the flexibility and autonomy given \n     to charter schools, they are held accountable by their \n     sponsors for improving student achievement and for their \n     financial and other operations;\n       Whereas 37 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have passed laws authorizing \n     charter schools;\n       Whereas 37 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico will have received substantial \n     assistance from the Federal Government by the end of the \n     current fiscal year for planning, startup, and implementation \n     of charter schools since their authorization in 1994 under \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6301 et seq.);\n       Whereas 34 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are serving more than 500,000 \n     students in more than 2,431 charter schools during the 2001-\n     2002 school year;\n       Whereas charter schools can be vehicles for improving \n     student academic achievement for the students who attend \n     them, for stimulating change and improvement in all public \n     schools, and for benefiting all public school students;\n       Whereas charter schools must meet the same Federal student \n     academic achievement accountability requirements as all \n     public schools, and often set higher and additional goals, to \n     ensure that they are of high quality and truly accountable to \n     the public;\n       Whereas charter schools assess and evaluate students \n     annually and often more frequently, and charter school \n     student academic achievement is directly linked to charter \n     school existence;\n       Whereas charter schools give parents new freedom to choose \n     their public school, charter schools routinely measure \n     parental approval, and charter schools must prove their \n     ongoing and increasing success to parents, policymakers, and \n     their communities;\n       Whereas two-thirds of charter schools report having a \n     waiting list, the average size of such a waiting list is \n     nearly one-half of the school's enrollment, and the total \n     number of students on all such waiting lists is enough to \n     fill another 1,000 average-sized charter schools;\n       Whereas students in charter schools nationwide have similar \n     demographic characteristics as students in all public \n     schools;\n       Whereas charter schools in many States serve significant \n     numbers of students from families with lower income, minority \n     students, and students with disabilities, and in a majority \n     of charter schools almost half of the students are considered \n     at risk or are former dropouts;\n       Whereas charter schools have enjoyed broad bipartisan \n     support from the Administration, Congress, State Governors \n     and legislatures, educators, and parents across the Nation; \n     and\n       Whereas charter schools are laboratories of reform and \n     serve as models of how to educate children as effectively as \n     possible: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 29, 2002, through May 3, 2002, as \n     ``National Charter Schools Week'';\n       (1) honors the 10th anniversary of the opening of the \n     Nation's first charter school;\n\n[[Page S3457]]\n\n       (2) acknowledges and commends the charter school movement \n     and charter schools, teachers, parents, and students across \n     the Nation for their ongoing contributions to education and \n     improving and strengthening the Nation's public school \n     system;\n       (3) supports the goals of National Charter Schools Week, an \n     event sponsored by charter schools and charter school \n     organizations across the Nation and established to recognize \n     the significant impacts, achievements, and innovations of the \n     Nation's charter schools; and\n       (4) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to conduct \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities to \n     demonstrate support for charter schools in communities \n     throughout the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/25/senate-section/article/S3457-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE EXPANSION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.
