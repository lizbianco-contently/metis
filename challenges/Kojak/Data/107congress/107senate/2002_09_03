Mr. President, good morning. I welcome back every one of \nour very competent staff which has been away for 30 days.\n  Mr. President, this morning we are going to begin consideration of \nthe homeland security legislation, H.R. 5005, with 7 hours of debate on \nthe motion. The time will be divided between Senators Lieberman and \nThompson, and in opposition that time will be controlled by Senator \nByrd.\n  At 12:30 today, we will proceed to executive session to vote on the \nconfirmation of a judicial nomination. Following that vote, the Senate \nwill recess until 2:15, as we do each Tuesday for party conferences. \nDebate on the motion will resume at 2:15.\n  All Senators should be alerted that in addition to the vote on the \njudicial nomination at 12:30 today, the Senate will vote on the motion \nto proceed to H.R. 5005 upon the expiration or yielding back of all \ntime--somewhere around 6:15 this afternoon.\n  Today, we have a motion to proceed, as I have indicated. Tomorrow, we \nhave the morning devoted to the Interior appropriations bill starting \nat 9:30. Then we will move again to homeland security.\n  Tomorrow evening at 6 o'clock, Vice President Mondale will be here \nfor the Leader Lecture Series.\n  It will be a relatively short day tomorrow.\n  Then on Thursday, we will have full debate, which will include work \non the Interior appropriations bill. We hope we can complete the \nInterior appropriations bill this week.\n  Hopefully, with permission of the minority, we can move to another \nappropriations bill.\n  We have one additional bill which the House passed, Treasury-Postal \nService appropriations. That is something we have to do. There is a lot \nof work to do. Thursday will be our last legislative workday this week \nbecause Congress is going to New York on Friday.\n  As the leader announced, on each Monday there will be votes--some as \nearly as noon. One week from Monday is a Jewish holiday. It is my \nunderstanding we will not work that day. At least that is the \nindication I got a\n\n[[Page S8036]]\n\nshort time ago in speaking with the leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8036-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S.J.

Under the previous order, time for \ndebate on the motion is limited to 7 hours to be equally divided \nbetween the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, and the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, for the proponents, and the Senator from \nWest Virginia, Mr. Byrd, for the opponents, or their designees.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two managers will be here very shortly. \nI ask unanimous consent that the time for the quorum be charged equally \nagainst both sides, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me beg the Senator's forgiveness. Before \nhe begins, I want to ask this earlier rather than later. May I ask a \nquestion with respect to the amendment?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Of course.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is the amendment that the distinguished Senator will offer \nas a substitute the amendment I have seen? Is that the amendment?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In responding to the Senator from West Virginia, that \nis indeed the amendment. What is before the Senate now, as the Senator \nfrom West Virginia knows, is the House-passed bill. It is my intention, \nassuming the motion to proceed passes today, to offer as a substitute \nthe legislation that was adopted by the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee in July, which has been distributed to the Senator from West \nVirginia and others.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I ask the distinguished Senator, with great respect, \ndoes he have any suggestion as to how we will handle the time on quorum \ncalls?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I appreciate the question. It was my hope we could \nagree that the time on the quorum calls be subtracted equally from each \nside. Is that agreeable to the Senator from West Virginia?\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope it would not be. Once I begin, I don't plan to have \nany quorum calls. Yet, of course, at times it becomes necessary. When I \ndo ask for a quorum call, I will expect that to be taken out of my \ntime. I would not want to divide the time equally on quorum calls, I \nsay with great respect.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator has that privilege, and I have no desire \nto limit debate. So let us just agree that quorum calls will remove \ntime from the side that asks for the quorum call.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. I have one further question. In closing the \ndebate, does the Senator have any particular way he wishes to proceed? \nI believe he would want to close the debate. If I might make a \nsuggestion.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Please.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask if I could go preceding the Senator and if the \ndistinguished minority member, Mr. Thompson, could speak just prior to \nme. That would be my suggestion. However, if Senator Thompson wants to \ndo this differently, I will accept that.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. That order was \nexactly what I had in mind. I ask Senator Thompson if that is agreeable \nto him.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. It is most agreeable to me. I think that is the way to \nproceed.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Fine. So we will close the debate in the last half \nhour going from Senator Thompson, to Senator Byrd, to myself.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I say, I hope we will not confine our closing arguments \nto a half hour. As far as I am concerned, when we get to that point, \nperhaps we can wait until the last hour to close the arguments, or the \nlast hour and a half, and Senator Thompson would proceed, and then the \nSenator from West Virginia, and then the distinguished manager of the \nbill, and that we not limit ourselves--the three of us--to the totality \nof 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Once again, Mr. President, that suggestion is \nagreeable to me. Debate, as the Senator from West Virginia knows, is \nlimited to 3\\1/2\\ hours on each side. But some of this will depend on \nhow many colleagues come to the floor to speak. Let us work together. I \nagree that we don't have to limit the time in which we go to closing \narguments to the last half hour. We can work that out ourselves and \ntake longer than that. That is fine.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I say I thank the distinguished Senator, \nthe manager of the bill. I have only the very highest degree of respect \nfor him, and I have only the highest degree of respect for the \ncommittee, and for his counterpart--if I may use that word--a very \nrespected Senator, the Senator from Tennessee. I have great respect, \nand anything I say during this debate will be only with the desire in \nmind to contribute something that will reflect well upon this Senate in \nthe days and years to come.\n  I have every belief that the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator \nfrom Tennessee approach the matter in the same spirit. I thank the \nSenators for yielding.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his graciousness. Of course, Senator Thompson and I return the \nrespect the Senator kindly offered to us. This is a very significant \ndebate. It goes to the heart of the security of the American people \ntoday, post September 11, and it is also, by my calculation, the \nlargest reorganization of the Federal Government since the late 1940s. \nTherefore, the kind of debate in which I know the Senator from West \nVirginia intends to engage is very much in the public interest. I look \nforward to it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  September 11 is now one of the darkest days in American history \nbecause of the almost 3,000 innocent lives that were taken and because \nof the way in which the American people were jarred from the dream that \nwe would experience a time of extended peace after our victory in the \ncold war. The attacks made against us on September 11 were not just \nvicious in their inhumanity and in the lives that were taken in\n\n[[Page S8037]]\n\ntragic consequences, but also in the assault made by the terrorists on \nour very way of life, on our values.\n  We are a nation whose founders stated right in the original American \ndocument, the Declaration of Independence, that every citizen has the \nright to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and that right is \nthe endowment of our Creator. Yet we were attacked on September 11 by a \ngroup that claimed to be acting in the name of God. Yet they took \nplanes into buildings full of thousands of people without regard to the \nlives of those people, killing them only because they were Americans, \nacting in the name of God to kill almost 3,000 children of God--diverse \nand varied in age and demographics, as the American people are.\n  It is in that sense that I view September 11 as an attack on our way \nof life. It is why we have pulled together after that as united people \nto resist, to strike back at those who struck at us first, through our \ncourageous and skillful military achieving a great victory in \nAfghanistan. We must continue, since Afghanistan was only the first \nbattle in the war against terrorism, to search out and capture or \ndestroy all the enemy that remains in this unprecedented war, \nunprecedented in so many ways because we cannot see the enemy on a \nbattlefield, they are not on ships at sea, but they are out there \nliving in the shadows, preparing to strike us again.\n\n  What this proposal is about, stated in the most direct way, is to \ndiminish, hopefully eliminate, the vulnerabilities of which the \nterrorists took advantage to strike at us on September 11, so that they \nwill never again be able to do that.\n  I am not one who views another September 11-type attack as \ninevitable. We are the strongest nation in the history of the world, \nmilitarily and economically. We are united by our shared values. We are \na patriotic and innovative people, and if we marshal these strengths, \nwe can make another September 11-type attack impossible, and that is \nthe aim of the legislation our committee puts before the Senate today.\n  The urgent purpose of all three versions of homeland security that \nare in the discussion now--and I am speaking of the proposal by \nPresident Bush, the proposal passed by the House, and the one endorsed \nby the Governmental Affairs Committee of the Senate--is to meet the \nurgent post-September 11 security challenge we face, which is \nunprecedented, by consolidating the disparate Federal agencies and \noffices that deal with homeland security into a single Cabinet \ndepartment under a strong, accountable Secretary.\n  In one sense, one might say the problem with the Federal Government's \norganization today with regard to homeland security is that a lot of \npeople are involved in homeland security but nobody is in charge. The \nmission of this new Department that all three proposals would create is \nto spearhead the Federal Government's defense of the American people \nagainst terrorism on our home soil, working particularly with States, \ncounties, cities, towns, and Native American tribes across the country \nand working with the private sector to improve their preparedness and \nresponse capabilities.\n  As the 1-year anniversary of September 11 approaches, the \nreconstruction of the Pentagon is almost complete, the field in \nPennsylvania, to the casual eye, looks almost like any other field, and \nplans for the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site are already \nbeing actively discussed. But the reality is that the vulnerabilities \nthe terrorists exploited on September 11 in America's homeland defense \nstructure still exist. We are still at risk, and that is why we must \nurgently proceed to discuss, debate, and then adopt legislation \ncreating a Department of Homeland Security.\n  The dark day of September 11 and the future it foretold are seared in \nour minds and our hearts. We must never stop feeling anger and outrage \nabout what our enemies did to us. We must never stop mourning the 3,000 \nlives we lost. We must never stop honoring the legacy they left. We \nmust never stop supporting the families whose loved ones were the first \ncasualties of the war on terrorism. And we must never stop treasuring \nthe freedoms and the opportunities that make this Nation truly the \nlight it is to so many people around the world.\n  The single most important action we can take now as individuals and \nas a nation, in addition to continuing the military phase of the \noffensive war against terrorism, is to channel our sorrow, our outrage, \nour unity, our anxiety, and our pride into building better defenses at \nhome.\n  This legislation is not a single-magic-bullet answer to our homeland \nsecurity challenges--much more work needs to be done--but I am \nconvinced it is a strong and necessary first step. It will provide the \nstructure that can deliver the defense the American people deserve.\n\n  I thank President Bush for embracing the creation of a Department of \nHomeland Security and for the diligence with which he and his staff \nhave worked through the details with members of our committee, with \nMembers of the Senate, and with Members of the House. Amendments always \nhighlight differences, but the reality is that President Bush and the \nmajority of members of the Governmental Affairs Committee who reported \nout the legislation are in agreement on more than 90 percent of what \nthis legislation provides. We stand broadly on common ground, even as \nwe debate some of the remaining differences between us.\n  I also want to thank my colleagues in this Chamber for their \ncontributions and cooperation across party lines for the building of \nthis proposal. We have come a long way, and we must get to the end in \nthis session. I particularly want to thank my ranking member, Senator \nThompson, for his characteristic constructive and thoughtful \ncontributions to this proposal, even when we have been in dissent. The \nleast we can do for the American people and for Senator Fred Thompson \nis to pass this legislation while he is still a Senator, before he \nretires.\n  The President and Congress and the American people have made real \nprogress since September 11. A successful military campaign in \nAfghanistan, creating the Office of Homeland Security, passing the USA \nPatriot Act, creating a Transportation Security Administration, \nbeginning to reform the FBI--those are just a few of the significant \nsteps we have taken forward together.\n  Federal employees are working very hard at their assigned tasks and \nworking increasingly in cooperation with our State and local colleagues \nto keep the American people safe. We have to speak frankly about this \nas we begin the consideration of this legislation.\n  Our progress will hit a wall--in effect it has--if we do not reform \nthe Federal Government's homeland security capabilities because the \ngains we have made in keeping America safe since September 11 have \nbeen, and will continue to be, in some sense despite the system, not \nbecause of it.\n  The system, the organization, is dispersed and in some ways it is \ndysfunctional. It needs to become coherent and consolidated, \ncoordinated, to rise to the complex challenge of defeating 21st century \nterrorism in our homeland.\n  The 18 hearings we on the Governmental Affairs Committee have held \nsince September 11 on this matter, and countless other hearings by so \nmany other committees, have made the scope and depth of this \ndisorganization and dysfunction clear.\n  To sum it up in the words of Stephen Flynn, senior fellow of national \nsecurity studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, who testified \nbefore us on October 21 of last year:\n  We have built our defense and intelligence communities to fight an \naway game.\n  Now we must build them to fight at home and to win. Across our \nGovernment, we are dividing our strengths when we desperately need to \nbe multiplying them. As the President acknowledged on June 6, the \nOffice of Homeland Security, though ably headed by Gov. Tom Ridge, did \nnot have the structural power to get the job done we need done. Indeed, \nthe release on July 16 of the President's national strategy for \nhomeland security, underlay the importance of creating a Department \nthat can orchestrate the huge task ahead.\n  The status quo is simply unacceptable and we must rise to the \noccasion by organizing for the occasion. We must move from \ndisorganization toward organization. When we pass this legislation, the \nAmerican people, for\n\n[[Page S8038]]\n\nthe first time, must be able to look to a single Federal agency that \nwill take the lead in the homeland fight against terrorism and to hold \nthat agency accountable for accomplishing what is Government's first \nresponsibility, and that is to provide, as the Constitution says, for \nthe common defense. And now that means the defense of the American \npeople at home.\n  The Department we will create will be led by a Presidentially \nappointed, Senate-confirmed Secretary. It would be comprised of six \ndirectorates that, taken together, would accomplish its missions and \ngoals. Let me briefly describe them now.\n  First is intelligence. I put that first intentionally because we \ncannot prevent attacks, nor can we adequately prepare to protect \nourselves or respond if we cannot first detect the danger. This \nlegislation would establish a strong intelligence division to receive \nall terrorism-related intelligence from Federal, State, and local \nauthorities; from human intelligence and signal intelligence; from \nclosed and open sources; from the FBI and the CIA, including foreign \nintelligence analysis from the Director of Central Intelligence's \nCounterterrorism Center. Then it would have the authority to fuse that \nall in a single place. This would be the one place--which does not \nexist in our Government now--where all the proverbial dots could be \nconnected as they were not because of existing barriers to sharing \ninformation prior to September 11. Indeed, the new Department will not \njust receive and analyze intelligence collected from other agencies; it \nwill contain agencies within itself that collect intelligence and will \nshare it and send it up to this directorate of intelligence. I am \nspeaking of the Customs Service, of Immigration, of the Coast Guard, of \nthe Transportation Security Agency, all examples. All of that will be \nfed into the same stream.\n  I want to stress that stream will include information from State and \nlocal law enforcers who we acknowledge now are the first responders, as \nwe saw on September 11.\n  If this directorate of intelligence is working well, State and local \nlaw enforcers can become first preventers. They are hundreds of \nthousands of eyes out across America who can share information, who can \nhelp us detect patterns and work with law enforcement to prevent any \nfuture attacks against America. This precise capability exists nowhere \nin Government and would be designed to complement the Director of \nCentral Intelligence's Counterterrorism Center and the capabilities of \nother intelligence and law enforcement agencies such as the FBI.\n  This directorate would not collect intelligence; it would receive it \nand analyze it. It would mean all information related to terrorist \nthreats on American soil would, for the first time in our history, come \ntogether in this one place. Perhaps it could be called a hear-all-evil \nand see-all-evil office. That is precisely what we need to prevent the \nrecurrence of the disastrous disconnects that left the puzzle pieces of \nthe September 11 plot laying scattered throughout our Government, when \nthey should have been together in one box so they could have been \nassembled. That is what this division of intelligence would do.\n\n  The second, critical infrastructure: We can expect terrorists to try \nto hurt us by destroying or disrupting our infrastructure. What do we \nmean by that? Well, our water and agricultural delivery systems, our \nenergy grids, our information technology networks, our transportation \nsystems, our ports and airports, and more. Eighty-five percent of our \ninfrastructure is actually owned and operated by the private sector. \nThat is the nervous system, the respiratory system, the circulatory \nsystem of our society. Infrastructure, however, is not the only target. \nIndeed, attacks by weapons of mass destruction have up until now been \ndesigned largely to destroy people, not to damage our infrastructure. \nIn fact, of course, the attacks on September 11 were not against \ninfrastructure in the way in which that term has normally been meant. \nThey were against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. But \ninfrastructure is a big, vulnerable, and complex target.\n  Today, responsibility for working with the private sector to \nsafeguard it is spread thin throughout the Federal bureaucracy. This \ndirectorate would mesh critical infrastructure protection programs now \nresiding in five different Federal agencies, including the Department \nof Energy, the Department of Commerce, and the General Services \nAdministration.\n  Third is a border and transportation protection directorate. Every \npotential source of danger that is not already inside our country must \ncome in through our ports or airports or over our borders. Once danger \ngets inside, it is much harder to root out. So to effectively \ninterdict, interrupt, and intercept terrorists and the weapons of toxic \nmaterials or mass destruction they seek to smuggle in, this directorate \nwould bring together our Customs Service, the border quarantine \ninspectors of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the recently created Transportation Security \nAdministration, and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.\n  The Coast Guard will also be transferred to the new Department \nreporting directly to the Director of Homeland Security and will work \nclosely with all other authorities on our waterways, in our ports, and \nat our borders.\n  Fourth is science and technology. Now terrorists will try to turn \nchemistry, biology, and technology against us in untraditional and \ninhumane ways. So we are challenged to marshal our superior \ntechnological talents to preempt them and protect our people.\n  This science and technology directorate is intended to leverage \nAmerica's advantage on this front, creating a lean entity to manage and \ncoordinate innovative homeland security research and development and to \nspearhead rapid technology transaction and deployment. It would be \narmed with an array of mechanisms to catalyze and harness the enormous \nscientific and technological potential residing within our Government, \nwithin our private sector, and within our university communities.\n  One of the key features of this directorate will be a homeland \nsecurity version of the Defense Advanced Research Protects Agency, \nDARPA, which has sparked the development of Revolutionary Warfighting \nTools for our military throughout the cold war and now into the post-\ncold-war world, the very tools and systems and weapons that enabled our \ncourageous and skillful fighting forces to terrify and defeat the \nTaliban in Afghanistan so brilliantly and to disrupt the al-Qaida \nnetwork.\n  Of course, DARPA has also spun off from its technologies to create \nsome of the most remarkable commercial and civilian technologies that \ncharacterize our age, including the Internet.\n  It is our hope and prayer that this new Department, which we would \nlike to call SARPA, the Security Advanced Research Projects Agency, \nwill do the same for our homeland security and for our economy.\n  Fifth, emergency preparedness and response: After September 11, we \nall have an obligation to think about and to prepare ourselves for the \nunthinkable, including attacks with chemical, biological, radiological, \nand nuclear weapons at home. This directorate with the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency at its core will combine and integrate the \nstrengths of a number of Federal agencies and offices responsible for \ndispensing critical vaccines and medicines for training local and State \nofficials in emergency readiness, and for reacting to and helping the \nAmerican people recover from the attacks that we hope and pray and will \nwork to deter, but we must be ready to respond.\n\n  Six is immigration. America's positive fundamental heritage of \nimmigration, central to our character as a country of opportunity and \nresponsibility and community, must be honored. But at the same time, \nafter September 11 we have to look with new clarity and intensity at \nillegal immigration as well as how to better screen those who come to \nthis country legally and may stay beyond the time allowed.\n  Our proposal brings the troubled Immigration and Naturalization \nService into the Department of Homeland Security and places those \nfunctions in a separate division within it. Then, to undo internal \nconflicts in the agency and give each set of functions the concerted \nattention it deserves, we propose to split the directorate into two\n\n[[Page S8039]]\n\ndistinct but closely linked bureaus as called for in the bipartisan INS \nrestructuring plan of our colleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator \nBrownback. This is a long overdue major reorganization of a very \ntroubled agency.\n  We also require the Secretary to establish a border security working \ngroup comprised of himself, working with the Under Secretary for Border \nand Transportation Security and the Under Secretary for Immigration \nAffairs. Our goal is to make passage more efficient and orderly for \nmost people and goods crossing the border while at the same time \nraising our capacity to identify and stop dangerous people and things \nfrom entering America.\n  Those are the six core directorates which we see as six spokes of the \nwheel. Where they meet at the axis is where our security at home comes \ntogether.\n  There are a few important pieces of this legislation I want to \ndescribe additionally. As we need to keep reiterating, this is not \nsolely a Federal responsibility or a Federal fight in the war against \nterrorism, it is a national responsibility and a national fight, with \nthe front lines being drawn in our cities and towns all across America. \nOne need only look at the long list of fallen heroes of September 11 to \nunderstand that. That is why we in Washington must do a far better job \nof creating and sustaining potent partnerships with States and \nlocalities which will be facilitated, I am confident, through the new \nDepartment. We are creating an Office of State and Local Government \nCoordination. This office is designed to assess and advocate for the \nresources needed by State and local governments all across the country.\n  In fact, there is separate legislation, quite appropriate, \nrecommending the creation of a homeland security block grant. The \ninitial amount proposed is $3.5 billion for fiscal year 2003.\n  I know from having spoken to the Presiding Officer, speaking to the \nlocal responders and first preventers, they are already spending \nsignificant funds to carry out the wider range of homeland security \nresponsibilities they have. This is a national problem, and they are \nplaying a large role in responding. We have to give them the resources, \nthe funds, to make that possible. In fact, to meet the pressing need \nfor well-trained firefighters in our communities, our legislation \nincludes an amendment offered by Senators Carnahan and Collins that \npoints Federal assistance to local communities nationwide, patterned on \nthe very successful COPS program adopted during the Clinton \nadministration. This program for firefighters would enable the hiring \nof as many as 10,000 additional firefighters per year.\n  The Office of State and Local Government Coordination would also be \nstrengthened with the help of an amendment offered by Senators Carper \nand Collins providing a number of new mechanisms, including the \ncreation of liaison positions in each State in the country, a liaison \nwith the new Department of Homeland Security to ensure close and \nconstant coordination between the Federal Government and the first \nresponders, first preventers, who are our principal partners in this \nsolemn task.\n  Recognizing the need to ensure that fundamental American freedoms are \nnot curbed as we build a more secure society, our legislation also \ncreates positions of civil rights officer and privacy officer, as well \nas a designated officer under the inspector general within the new \nDepartment. Those positions will provide the Secretary valuable \nguidance to help craft effective policies and practices that don't \ncompromise individual rights, and ensure there is an effective avenue \nfor receiving complaints and investigating them. Outside of this \nDepartment, within the White House, the amendment would create another \nentity, a National Office for Combating Terrorism. Here I want to give \nsubstantial credit to the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, who has \nworked very hard with Members of both parties, in this Chamber and the \nother body, to fashion this proposal.\n\n  We cannot fail to recognize that the fight against terrorism is, by \ndefinition, larger than what will be done by this new Department of \nHomeland Security. It will involve our military and intelligence \ncommunities separately, our diplomatic services, our law enforcement \nagencies, our international economic agencies, and many others. It \nseems to me and the committee that it is therefore still necessary to \nhave a policy architect in the White House who can design and build the \noverriding antiterrorism strategy for and with the President, and to \ncoordinate the implementation of that strategy that will necessarily go \nbeyond the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The director of this office will work, of course, with the Homeland \nSecurity Secretary to develop the national strategy for combating \nterrorism and the homeland security response. With budget certification \nauthority, the director of this White House office will be able to make \nsure all the budgets that make up our antiterrorism national strategy \nfit together smoothly. And because of the critical nature of this job, \naccording to our legislation, the director would be confirmed by the \nSenate, making him or her accountable to the Congress and to the people \nof the United States.\n  That is an overview of our legislation as will be contained in the \namendment I look forward to putting before the Senate this evening, \nafter, hopefully, we have adopted the motion to proceed. I am proud \nthat on the guts, on the fundamentals, of this proposal we in the \nSenate are near unified on this attempt to form, in a very modern \ncontext, what our Founders described as ``a more perfect Union.''\n  Winston Churchill once said:\n\n       A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an \n     optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.\n\n  I think only a big pessimist would see the difficulty in the \nopportunity this Department would create to secure our people and our \nhomeland. We have crafted here a fundamentally optimistic and I think \nrealistic answer to the homeland security challenges we face--seeing \nopportunity, not difficulty. As we go forward with amendments and \ndiscussion and votes on the remaining differences, I hope and believe \nthat optimism will prevail and constructive action will result. \nTogether, united across party lines, as it has been over and over again \nthroughout history, our great country, which today faces a challenge \nthat is unprecedented, will give the response we are called on to \ngive--which is equally unprecedented.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, it is indeed true that today we begin \nconsideration of the most significant reorganization of the executive \nbranch in over 50 years. Not since the creation of the Department of \nDefense and the creation of the national intelligence apparatus in the \nNational Security Act of 1947 has the Senate considered such a massive \nrestructuring of Federal agencies.\n  Just as World War II and the start of the cold war demonstrated the \nneed to reorganize our defense and intelligence establishment, the \nterrorist attacks of September 11 demonstrate the need to reorganize \nour homeland security establishment to address the threat of terrorism \nand other types of asymmetric warfare against our country and against \nour people.\n  I start by acknowledging and thanking Senator Lieberman, the manager \nof the bill, for his leadership on this issue. He was an early \nsupporter of legislation to reorganize the executive branch to confront \nemerging threats against our country. He recognized what needed to be \ndone and has worked hard to get us to the point where we are today.\n  While we have some disagreements in some important areas, in the end \nwe both believe that the creation of a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity is needed to make this country safe. Our Nation and the Senate \nalso owe a debt of gratitude to the Members of the Hart-Rudman and \nGilmore Commissions. Recommendations from both commissions have \ncontributed greatly to our efforts. Indeed, the proposal before us owes \nmuch to the insight and thoughtful recommendations of our former \ncolleagues, Senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman.\n  This legislation is one of the centerpieces of our country's overall \nhomeland security strategy. What we do here will have lasting effects \non our Nation. It will certainly outlive us. We should not shy away \nfrom the fact that\n\n[[Page S8040]]\n\nwhile some bureaucracies will be reduced and eliminated, we will be \ncreating a large new bureaucracy with new leadership, a new mission, \nand a new culture. However, even advocates of smaller Government \nrealize it is a mission that is vital to the security of this Nation, \nthe most important responsibility of this or any other government and \none of the basic responsibilities outlined for the National Government \nby the framers of our Constitution. That is what we are about today.\n  I think it is appropriate perhaps to take a moment to reflect on how \nwe got here. It is obvious to all that in the last several years we \nhave undergone a revolution in the world in terms of the advances of \nmodern technology. The same thing has happened with regard to \ntransportation. We have also seen the emerging of a brand of religious \nradicalism that has infected certain parts of our world. We have seen \nthe merging of those factors together, now, so that a small band of \npeople, a small group of people, or even individuals on the other side \nof the world can wreak tremendous damage to our homeland.\n  It is a different world we live in today, and we must have different \nmeans of dealing with it. We have seen attacks on us over the last \nseveral years that have become more and more indicative of the kind of \nworld we can expect in the future: The Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, \nthe original World Trade Center bombing, our embassies have been \nattacked, the U.S.S. Cole has been attacked. There have been other \nattempts that have failed because of the intelligence we were able to \nobtain. Attacks have been thwarted.\n  We have seen over the last few years, through our committee hearings \nand through reports of the GAO and other governmental entities, a \nrising pattern of capabilities, in terms not only of terrorism but of \nrogue nation-states and their increasing ability to deliver weapons of \nmass destruction, to develop those weapons of mass destruction, and to \nhave the missile capability and other capabilities of delivering those \nfor thousands and thousands of miles.\n\n  We have seen intelligence reports reminding us from time to time that \nthis is what is going on out there.\n  We have not paid as much attention to that in times past as we should \nhave. When we look back with the vision we have now and see the attacks \nthat have come upon us around the world, attacks on our interests and \nour people, coupled with the intelligence information we were getting \nhere in our own Congress, we should have been able to see, as some of \nus have seen, that there was a developing pattern out there that needed \nto be addressed by the Congress.\n  One of the good things that comes from such a tragedy under which we \nare now laboring is that it does finally focus our attention and allows \nus to do some things we should have done some time ago. It is a \nterrible price to pay in order to get us here, but we are here now and \nwe should take advantage of that opportunity.\n  How do we react to something like September 11? We react by coming \ntogether, as the American people have. We react by being strong \nmilitarily and having the kind of leadership that we have to carry out \nthe necessary operations overseas. We are doing that. The President \nsaid in the very beginning that it was going to be a long, tough road. \nIndeed, it is proving to be. It doesn't take a whole lot of effort for \npeople to rally right after an attack. But it is going to take \nsomething special from the American people to have the stick-to-\nitiveness, and to have the stamina it is going to take, over a long \nperiod of time, for us to do what we are in the midst of doing now \nmilitarily.\n  We also react by changing our priorities. We cannot continue, in the \nCongress of the United States, in terms of budgetary matters, for \nexample, to act as if these are normal times. We cannot have guns and \nbutter at all times. We cannot have our cake and eat it, too. We have \nto prioritize now to deal with this threat that we have to our Nation.\n  Finally, the other important thing we can do is the one we are \ndealing with here today, this week, and days hereafter, and that is \naddressing and improving the institutions we have in our Government to \ndeal with such matters and specifically the new threat we face.\n  We have seen--Senator Lieberman and I--especially in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee over the last several years, an increasing array of \nproblems that our Government has. There have been problems in \nmanagement. There have been problems in trying to develop information \ntechnology that the private sector already has up and running. We have \nspent billions and billions of dollars and still have difficulty in \ngetting that right and integrating those systems into our governmental \noperations.\n  We have financial management difficulties. We literally cannot pass \nan audit as a Government. We lose things and misplace things such as \nmilitary equipment and other troubling things such as that. We have \nhuman capital problems. Half our workforce is going to be eligible for \nretirement before long. We do not have what we should have, in terms of \nability to recruit, ability to retain, ability to keep the people we \nneed and not keep the people we do not need, and pay the ones we need \nto pay for these high-tech jobs--jobs that are so highly paid out in \nthe private sector--to do the things we have to do in Government now.\n  All of this presents a real problem to us, as a government, a \nGovernment-wide problem that has been growing--and growing all too \nsilently out there--and without us doing too much about it.\n  The GAO reminds us every year that the same agencies year after year \nappear on the high-risk list. That is the list that is compiled, as you \nknow, on a yearly basis to lay out the agencies that are most \nsusceptible to waste, fraud, abuse, overlap, duplication, and \ninefficiencies. The same agencies appear year after year. Some of those \nagencies are the ones being brought into this homeland security bill.\n  We can't afford, as we create this new Department, to incorporate the \nsame kinds of problems that we are seeing government-wide because the \nstakes are too great. It is not just a matter of wasting a few billion \ndollars of the taxpayers' money; it is a matter that could literally be \nlife and death. This is what this bill is all about. This is why \nSenator Lieberman took the initiative. This is why the President \ndecided, once the strategic view was presented to him by the people he \nhad commissioned to look at all of this, that a homeland security \napproach was needed, and that the 22 agencies out there needed to be \npulled together into one cohesive entity that could work to make our \ncountry safer.\n  Certainly, there are very important areas. I will not go over all of \nthem. Senator Lieberman has done that.\n  But border security, for example, has never made any sense when we \nhave people crossing borders, when goods cross the borders, and when \nplant life crosses the borders--all of which can be dangerous to the \nAmerican people. They can cross them by water, they can cross the \nborders by air, they can cross the borders by highways. All of those \nthings are just different aspects of the same problem. It all has to do \nessentially with border security. It has never made any sense to have \nall of this dispersed throughout Government.\n  What the President does and what the committee bill does is to pull \nthose in. We have different ways of doing it. We will have an \nopportunity to discuss those in more detail as we proceed, but it gets \nits arms around the border security problem.\n  A lot of experts will say if you can do much better on the border \nproblem, you can do better in the intelligence area, then you have gone \na long way toward solving the problem.\n  In the intelligence area, the President's approach is to have an \nintelligence entity that will allow us to protect our infrastructure. \nAs you know, our infrastructure is elaborate, far-flung, and complex. \nAlmost all of it is in private hands. It is an extremely difficult \nproblem to address and to get our arms around and to protect. We can \nnever be totally protected at all times in all ways. It is going to \nrequire a great deal of attention and expenditure of money by State, \nlocal, and Federal Government over years to come.\n  We are going to have to address the vulnerabilities that we have. The \nPresident's approach would set up a system to assess those \nvulnerabilities in order to protect those infrastructures. The \ncommittee's approach is a broader approach. We will have an opportunity \nto discuss that.\n\n[[Page S8041]]\n\n  I have concern about this broader approach because I don't think we \ncan address the difficulties with the intelligence community in this \nbill and give it to a sub-Cabinet officer to have authority to pull all \nthe dots together and all the things that need to be done in the \nintelligence community. We have seen, goodness knows, over the last \nseveral months and few years the difficulties we have in those areas of \ncollecting intelligence, analyzing intelligence, and disseminating \nintelligence properly. That, to me, is a very important area that is \ngoing to have to be led by the President. It is going to have to be \ndone by the administration. I view that as somewhat separate from the \nhomeland security effort. But we can never mesh our entire intelligence \ncommunity into this new Department.\n\n  The analyses that we are going to need for the Homeland Security \nDepartment are also needed by these various intelligence communities.\n  These are legitimate differences of view and approach that we will \nhave an opportunity to discuss as we proceed. But we all agree that we, \nNo. 1, must do much better in terms of our intelligence community and \ncapabilities government-wide; secondly, this new entity must have some \nnew intelligence entity to assist it to do what we properly decide that \nit ought to be doing. We will have an opportunity to discuss that in \nsome more detail.\n  I think as we proceed we can flesh this legislation out and we can \nmake it even better than it is. Senator Lieberman is correct. I think \nthere are many things we have basic agreement on here on a bipartisan \nbasis. There are some serious differences of view on some important \nareas--differences the majority of the committee took versus what the \nPresident wishes to do. I think in these times the President must be \ngiven some leeway. It is going to be a long time before we put the \nfinal period to the last sentence of this legislation. I think it will \nbe changed, as many other pieces of legislation dealing with the \nDepartment of Defense and the Transportation Department and others have \nchanged over the years. I think there will be amendments and changes as \nwe go forward. But it is important that we get off on the right foot.\n  It is important, for example, that we give the new Department the \nmanagement tools it needs. I have mentioned some of the problems we \nhave traditionally with Government and the fact that we can't afford to \nbring those problems into the new Department. We can't expect to keep \ndoing things the same old way and get different results. We don't want \nthose inefficiencies, those overlaps, duplications, and waste, lost \nitems, and things such as that, to follow us into the Department of \nHomeland Security. We can't have that happen. It won't work.\n  What is the answer? The answer is to give the new Department \nsufficient management flexibility in order to address these issues. We \nhave recognized this need in times past. We have given this flexibility \nin terms of hiring and firing and managing and compensating. Most of it \nhas to do with compensation. A lot of people will say this is anti-\nemployee or union-busting or what not. It has nothing to do with that. \nVarious agencies and the GAO came to us. The IRS came to us. The FAA \ncame to us. The Transportation Security Administration came to us. They \nall came to us and said: Look, we either have special circumstances or \nwe have special problems and we need some additional tools to deal with \nthat. We need the right people in the right place to deal with those \nmatters.\n  In every one of those instances which I mentioned, Congress gave it \nto them. Congress gave them additional flexibilities that are not \nwithin the body of title V because we perceived those needs to be \nexactly as they were described to us.\n  Now we are pulling 22 agencies together--some of them, quite frankly, \nalready dysfunctional--and giving out these new responsibilities. We \ntalk about how important it is to the new Department.\n  My question is, If we are going to give these flexibilities to these \nother agencies, my goodness, why not this one, of all agencies or all \ndepartments?\n  The President's national security authority must be preserved. We \nhave significant disagreement with regard to whether the traditional \nauthority that Presidents have had since President Jimmy Carter in the \nnational security area in terms of the justifiable need to activate \ncollective bargaining agreements with particular entities at particular \ntimes, for good reason. Presidents have used this authority \njudiciously. As far as I know, there has never really been a problem \nwith it.\n  This bill, as written, would take a step backwards from that \nauthority of the President. I don't think it is fair in these times, of \nall times, to do that.\n  On the issue of the White House staff, should we force on the \nPresident a Senate-confirmed person in that position when he says he is \ncreating a new Department and a new Secretary with all of this \nelaborate mechanism, and he wants his personal person--some people make \nthe analogy with the National Security Council, for example, that it is \nnot Senate confirmed--inside the White House working for him?\n  I assume, as Mr. Ridge is doing today, should we not give the \nPresident that? I believe so, after a sound intelligence approach, as I \nmentioned earlier, with not too many directorates, and not making this \nmore elaborate and complex than we should.\n  Those are issues that we have. I think they are legitimate. I think \nthey are important. They will be the subject of amendments as we \nproceed.\n  But, again, we do not want to look at a glass that is almost full and \nsay that it is almost empty, because it is not. We agree on many, many \nimportant fundamental aspects. I think it is our job to get about the \nconsideration of it, and to improve it, to discuss these important \nissues and differences that we have, and come to a conclusion that is \ngoing to achieve what we are all striving for; that is, a safer United \nStates of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nTennessee for his very thoughtful statement. It has been a pleasure to \nwork with him on the Governmental Affairs Committee, both when he led \nthe committee and in the time that I have. I look forward to working \nwith him in the weeks ahead to achieve what we all want to achieve, \nnotwithstanding some differences that we have today, which is to secure \nthe future of the American people here at home.\n  I know that the intention was that Senator Byrd would speak next. He \nis not on the floor at the moment. I note the presence of the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I would ask that the Senator from Texas be given as \nmuch time----\n  Mr. GRAMM. Why don't I take up to 10 minutes. Every time I have ever \nheard anybody say they will not use it, they talk more. But certainly \neverything I would want to say or should say or am competent to say I \ncan say in 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Very well. Then it would be our understanding, after \nthe Senator from Texas has completed his statement, that Senator Byrd \nwill be recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will withhold for a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I greatly appreciate my friend from Texas \nwithholding. He has always been very courteous. Today is no different \nthan any other time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8041-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8041-S8048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session, today, at 12:30 p.m. to consider Executive Calendar \nNo. 962, Terrence McVerry, to be a United States District Judge; that \nthe Senate immediately vote on confirmation of the nomination, that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, any statements thereon be printed in \nthe Record, with the preceding all occurring without any intervening \naction or debate, and that upon the disposition of the nomination, the \nSenate resume legislative session and stand in recess until 2:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, whenever a bill comes to the floor from a \ncommittee, obviously, a lot of people have had an opportunity to have \nan input in it. It is always easy for people who do not serve on that \ncommittee to stand on the outside and jeer and throw rocks through the \nwindows. And we are going to have a long debate. I think this bill is \ngoing to change dramatically. So rather than spending my time being \ncritical of the product, I would like to just talk about some basic \nprinciples, sort of where I am coming from and what I hope can happen.\n  First of all, when September 11 occurred, it sort of awakened the \ncountry to a threat we always knew was there. But there is nothing like \nseeing your fellow countrymen suffer to focus the mind on a challenge \nthat too often we chose to pretend did not exist. I think we all \nconcluded, in the wake of September 11, that our country had changed, \nperhaps forever. Part of that change had to do with coming up with an \neffective response.\n  Free societies are vulnerable to terrorist attacks. There is nothing \nwe can do about that since we are going to remain a free society.\n  The President, who has the responsibility under the Constitution, as \nCommander in Chief, to defend the homeland, spent time and effort in \ngetting together the best people, at least in his mind, that he could \nassemble, and he came up with a plan. That plan involved bringing all \nor part of 22 agencies together in a new Homeland Security Department.\n  I know there are many people who have many different views, and that \nis what makes democracy strong. But I would like to begin with the \npoint that the one person who has the constitutional responsibility, \nthe one person who has access to more information than anybody else in \nour society, made a proposal; and that is the President's proposal.\n\n  In my mind, under these circumstances, and in this clear and present \ndanger that we face, I believe--no blank check, no guarantee we are \ngoing to do it just as the President wants it--we ought to bend over \nbackwards to try to accommodate the man who has the constitutional \nresponsibility and is ultimately going to be given the credit or the \nblame by the American people based on what happens.\n  The President primarily asked for three things. One, he wanted \nflexibility in reorganizing these Departments. The flexibility wanted \nwas substantial, but it was not without precedent. We had given similar \nflexibility to the Department of Energy, which was created from other \nDepartments. We had given similar flexibility to the Department of \nEducation, which was created in part by transfer and part by creation. \nYet, remarkably, the bill that is before us denies the President the \nsame flexibility that the President had when the Departments of Energy \nand Education were created.\n  Now, energy is important, especially if you are in an energy crisis. \nEducation is always important. But is there anybody who really believes \nthe crisis we face is so unimportant that President Bush should not \nhave the same powers in setting up the Department of Homeland Security \nthat the President had in setting up the Department of Energy? I do not \nthink many people take that position, but we have a problem in that the \nbill before us takes that position. In my mind, that has to be fixed.\n  I understand reasonable people with the same facts are prone to \ndisagree, but, as I look at this first request of the President, that \nhe be given enhanced flexibility, not dissimilar to what we had with \nthe Department of Energy and the Department of Education, to me, that \nis pretty close to a no-brainer that the President ought to have that \nflexibility.\n  The second request is that the President have the power, based on \nnational security, to override labor agreements. Now, that sounds like \na pretty dramatic power. In fact, the way opponents normally talk about \nit, it is basically giving the President the power to eliminate \ncollective bargaining. In my mind, nothing could be further from the \ntruth. All this power does is gives the President the power to set \naside elements of collective bargaining when national security is \ninvolved.\n  Interestingly enough, the power the President sought he has under \nexisting law. The President was simply asking for an affirmation of \nexisting power. But, remarkably, in the wake of 9/11, not only did the \ncommittee not reaffirm this existing power but they took power away \nfrom the President in saying that whereas today, whereas on September \n11, or September 10, the President could have waived collective \nbargaining agreements for national security purposes, under this bill \nhe would not be able to do that. But the prohibition would apply only \nto the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I submit there is always room for disagreement, there is always room \nfor some negotiation in trying to understand what other people think, \nbut, to me, it is incomprehensible and absolutely unacceptable that we \nshould be setting up a Department of Homeland Security and at the same \ntime take away power the President has under existing law to take \naction based on national security concerns.\n  The provision taking away the President's national security powers \nsimply does not fit in this bill. I do not think it fits in any bill. \nBut in a bill that is trying to respond to 9/11, it clearly does not \nfit and cannot be accepted and will never be accepted. Clearly, that is \nsomething that has to be fixed.\n  Let me give you some examples. We currently have labor contracts \nnegotiated with Government employee labor unions that prohibit the \nstationing of Border Patrol in areas that do not have laundries, that \ndo not have access to personal services. There is a long list of things \nthat were written.\n  Now, in normal circumstances, where you have people trying to lead a \nquality life like everybody else, you can understand those things. The \nability to take your clothes to the drycleaners is pretty important \nwhen you are wearing uniforms that require drycleaning. But in an \nemergency circumstance, do we really not want to have the power to \nwaive that collective bargaining agreement?\n\n  Another thing that has constantly driven me crazy, being in a border \nState--a huge border--with Mexico, is that trying to get the Border \nPatrol, INS, and Customs all to work together, trying to get them to \ncross-train so that people can perform various functions, is like \ntrying to get them to use the same toothbrush. In fact, President \nClinton's National Security Adviser talked about his frustration in \ndealing with the INS and Customs and the unwillingness of one agency to \nopen the trunk in working with another agency.\n  Now, look, I understand work rules. I admit I am probably less \nsympathetic to them than most other people. I think if you sign onto a \njob, whatever the job requires, within the limits of human dignity, you \nought to be willing to do. I don't understand negotiating about who \npushes what button or who opens what trunk. To me that seems silly. I \nam not very sympathetic to it. But when we are dealing with national \nsecurity concerns, when the lives of our fellow citizens are at stake, \nwe cannot put up with that business.\n  So all the President is asking for is the power to set aside those \nkinds of agreements in dealing with national security. It is not a \nquestion of being anti-union, it is a question of having concerns that \noverride collective bargaining. We don't have collective bargaining for \nthe Marines because they are about very serious, life-threatening \ncircumstances and tasks. In dealing with homeland security, we are \ndealing with exactly those kinds of circumstances.\n  Finally, the President's proposal asks for personnel flexibility--the \nability to put the right person in the right position at the right \ntime, without waiting for the normal 6 months, and the right to \ntransfer people who are incompetent, and the right to fire people.\n  I understand collective bargaining, and I understand writing in \nrequirements of how the personnel system\n\n[[Page S8043]]\n\nworks. I understand trying to prevent people from being arbitrary and \ncapricious. But the bottom line is, if we are trying to fight and win \nthis war on terrorism, we need to have the ability to hire, fire, and \npromote based on merit in those agencies that are involved. I will give \nyou two examples.\n  A woman FBI agent sends a cable to the home office basically saying \nthat maybe we ought to be concerned about people with terrorist \nconnections who are taking flight training and are focusing on flying \nplanes but not landing them. That actually happened. In the whole \nprocess of trying to absorb massive amounts of information with \nconflicting jurisdiction, nobody ever responded to it. But don't you \nthink we ought to promote that woman? Don't you think we ought to \npromote her out of grade and reward her--not only to reward the fact \nthat she was paying attention to her business, she was alert to a \npotential problem that, God knows, we wish we had been alerted to, and \nwe want to send a signal to others in the FBI and other agencies that \nif you are doing a good job, we are going to reward you.\n  On the negative side--and I don't want to belabor it because I don't \nknow the circumstances and I am not at INS. I don't know the individual \nlife stories of the people involved or the problems they had or the \nbureaucracy they faced. But, look, when we granted visas to terrorists \nwho had their picture on every television screen in the world, whose \nnames are on the front page of every newspaper in America because they \nhad killed over 3,000 of our citizens, and then weeks later we \nprocessed a visa request for these brutal terrorist/murderers, maybe \nsomebody should have been fired. Maybe somebody should have been \ntransferred.\n\n  I know that theoretically in the Federal Government you can fire \npeople, but the reality is that it is virtually impossible. As \neverybody in the Senate knows, fewer than 1 percent of people who are \nfound to be doing totally unsatisfactory work end up being fired in the \nFederal Government, and 80 percent of them, because of the momentum of \nthe seniority system, end up getting raises after they have been deemed \nto be doing failing work.\n  In the Department of Homeland Security, where we are dealing with \npeople's lives, we need the flexibility to promote and reward. And, \nquite frankly, despite all the protests from the labor unions, every \ntime I talk to people in Government agencies who would be affected, \nthey like this flexibility, they like rewarding merit, they believe \nthey would benefit and thrive in this system.\n  I will conclude by simply saying this: The President is not saying do \nit my way or forget it. I think the President has been and will be \nflexible in terms of trying to work out an agreement. I think there is \nroom for flexibility on the whole funding issue and reprogramming and \nthe rights of the legislative branch. But when you get down to the \nability to reorganize, the President is not going to accept a bill that \ngives him less power in the name of national security than the \nPresident had when we created the Department of Energy. He is not going \nto do that, and he should not do it. There is no possibility that the \nPresident is going to accept a bill that takes away emergency powers \nthat he has today to waive collective bargaining agreements in a bill \nthat claims to enhance the President's power to deal with national \nsecurity.\n  Finally, we gave flexibility on personnel under the FAA \nreorganization bill, under the IRS reorganization bill, and under the \nTransportation Security Administration reorganization bill. Yet in a \nbill trying to deal with homeland security, do we think it is less \nimportant than the FAA, or the IRS, or the Transportation Security \nAdministration? Well, obviously, if you look at this bill, we do. So I \ndon't think it is productive for this to degenerate into any kind of \npartisan battle.\n  But the problem is, this is a bill that does not do the job. This is \na bill that we would be better off--if it were adopted in its current \nform--not having. The President is not going to accept this bill, and I \nthink we have reached the moment on a critical issue where we need \nsimply to promote a bipartisan solution, work out these agreements, \ngive the President these three powers he wants, work something out on \nthe appropriations issue for enhanced reprogramming and a partnership, \nand preserve the ability of Congress to control the purse.\n  I think the President, for every one problem he will have with money, \nwill have 100 problems dealing with reorganization and personnel \nflexibility.\n  I am hopeful we can work something out. We are going to be offering a \nseries of amendments. I assume at the end we will offer a substitute. I \nhope that substitute will be broadly supported. Senator Miller and I, \nalong with almost 40 of our colleagues, have introduced the President's \nbill because we wanted to try to promote a compromise moving in the \nPresident's direction.\n  I thank Senator Thompson for his leadership on this issue. As I have \nfollowed what he has had to say, there is not any issue on which I have \na substantive disagreement with him. I look forward to following his \nleadership as we work out these three key issues, but these issues have \nto be dealt with. There cannot be a bill that does not give the \nPresident reorganization flexibility, the ability to override \ncollective bargaining agreements in the name of national security and \npersonnel flexibility. Denying these three powers simply is a denial of \ncommon sense and a denial of the crisis as we all know it exists, and \nthe bill has to be changed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nused by the Senator from Texas not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I was in error when I asked that the \ntime of the Senator from Texas not be charged against anyone. I think \nthat should be charged against the time of Senator Lieberman and \nmyself. I ask unanimous consent that be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I am getting ready to suggest the \nabsence of a quorum again, and I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall we are about to go into not be charged against either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for the \ncourtesies which have been extended to all Senators, myself in \nparticular because I am the one I know most about, naturally, in \nlistening to our concerns with respect to the legislation that is \nbefore the Senate.\n  I am glad Members of this body had the opportunity during the August \nrecess to study the House bill, to study the substitute that will be \nposed eventually by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman, which substitute, of course, is the product of his very \ngreat committee and the product in particular of the ranking member, \nMr. Thompson of Tennessee, on that committee.\n  I proceed today with a great deal of humility, realizing that I am \nnot a member of the committee. I have no particular reason, other than \nthe fact that I am 1 of 100 Senators who speaks on this matter today \nwith no particular insight from the standpoint of being on the \ncommittee which has looked at this legislation. I have read the \nnewspapers. I have read and heard a great deal about what the \nadministration wants. I have done the best I could during the August \nbreak, in addition to several other responsibilities I had, to read the \nHouse legislation and the substitute which will be proposed by Mr. \nLieberman.\n\n[[Page S8044]]\n\n  So I say to the members of the committee, and to Mr. Lieberman and to \nMr. Thompson in particular, I respect the work they have done.\n  I believe one of the two Senators today said there have been 18 \nhearings of the committee. I was not present at those hearings.\n  I respect the work of the committee. I have been a Member of Congress \n50 years. I know something about committees. I know something about \ncommittee hearings. I know something about the time and the energy that \nare put into hearings by the Members, as well as by the staffs of the \nmembers of the committee and the personal staffs of the Senators. I \napproach this subject today somewhat timidly because I am not on the \ncommittee but I am a Senator and I have been very concerned. The reason \nI am here today is that I am very concerned about how we go about \ncreating the Department of Homeland Security.\n  First of all, I am very much for a Department of Homeland Security, \nand I think I made that position clear many weeks ago. I had some \nconcerns with respect to the proposal the House sent over after 2 days \nof debate on the House floor.\n  I had some concerns about the appropriations process. Senator \nStevens, distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, \nand I have joined in informing Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Thompson of our \nconcerns. Mr. Stevens is a member of Mr. Lieberman's committee. We \ninformed them of our concerns in writing. They have taken our concerns, \nstudied them, and for the most part have dealt with our concerns. So \nfrom this moment on, I will have no more to say about the \nappropriations process because the Lieberman bill, in great measure, \nputs that thing right.\n  I have other concerns. I am very concerned President Bush has been \npromoting his Homeland Security by citing the National Security Act of \n1947 as a role model for Government reorganization.\n  In his weekly radio address on June 8, for example, President Bush \nstated that he was proposing ``the most extensive reorganization of the \nfederal government since the 1940s. During his presidency, Harry Truman \nrecognized that our nation's fragmented defenses had to be reorganized \nto win the Cold War. He proposed uniting our military forces under a \nsingle Department of Defense, and creating the National Security \nCouncil to bring together defense, intelligence, and diplomacy.''\n  President Bush is correct to hold up the National Security Act as a \nrole model. Here it is. It is the perfect example of why we must move \nslowly and carefully in reorganizing our government and avoid acting \ntoo swiftly or blindly. A look at the history of the unification of the \narmed forces reveals that government reorganization is not as quick, or \nas simple and easy as President Bush may have implied.\n  Enactment of legislation providing for the unification of the \nmilitary did not occur in a matter of weeks, nor even months, but \nyears.\n  On November 3, 1943, the Army Chief of Staff, General George C. \nMarshall, broke with long-standing War Department anti-unification \npolicy and submitted to the Joint Chiefs of Staff a proposal favoring a \nsingle Department of War. In his book, The Politics of Military \nUnification, Demetrios Caraley writes: ``The conflict over military \nunification that eventually led to the passage of the National Security \nAct of 1947 can be said to have begun November 3, 1943.'' In other \nwords, this was the beginning of what would become a four-year struggle \nin the effort to reorganize our government by unifying our armed \nservices.\n  In April 1944, the War Department submitted a unification proposal to \nthe House Select Committee on Postwar Military Policy. That same month, \nthe Committee began two months of hearings on the creation of a single \ndepartment of the armed forces. The committee concluded that the time \nwas inappropriate for legislation on a single department, strongly \nimplying that such a reorganization might be a distraction from the war \neffort, and, therefore, should wait until the war was over. The \nCommittee report reads in part:\n\n       The committee feels that many lessons are being learned in \n     the war, and that many more lessons will be learned before \n     the shooting stops, and that before any final pattern for a \n     reorganization of the services should be acted upon, Congress \n     should have the benefit of the wise judgment and experience \n     of many commanders in the field.\n\n  I point out that, more than two full years had elapsed since General \nMarshall's proposal, and there had been considerable congressional and \nadministrative activity, including a number of studies, a number of \nalternate proposals, and a number of hearings, yet Congress at this \nstage was nowhere close to approving the reorganization of our \ngovernment.\n  On June 15, 1946: President Truman, in a letter to congressional \nleaders, recommended a 12-point program for unification. But \nconsiderable opposition to reorganization still remained, and as a \nresult, President Truman eventually requested that the Senate drop \nconsideration of military unification until the next session of \nCongress.\n  The next year, February 26, 1947, in a communication to congressional \nleaders, and I was a member of the West Virginia state legislature, \nPresident Truman submitted a unification proposal, which became the \nNational Security Act of 1947, that had been drafted by representatives \nof the armed forces and had been approved by the Secretaries of War and \nNavy, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Did you catch that? President Truman submitted a proposal that had \nbeen drafted, not by four people in secrecy in the basement of the \nWhite House, but by representatives of the armed forces and had been \napproved by the Secretaries of War and Navy, and the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff.\n  What a difference in Administrations! What a difference in attitudes \ntoward government!\n  After President Truman's proposal was introduced in both houses of \nCongress, the Senate Committee on Armed Services began hearings that \nlasted for ten weeks. The House Committee on Expenditures in the \nExecutive Departments also conducted hearings on the proposal that \nlasted from April 2 to July 1, 1947.\n  Meanwhile, on May 20, 1947, the Senate Committee on Armed Services \ncommenced an executive session ``to review the testimony received in \nextensive hearings on the bill and to consider proposed amendments.''\n  Let me say that again: The Senate Committee on Armed Services \ncommenced an executive session--whoa--``to review the testimony \nreceived in extensive hearings on the bill and to consider proposed \namendments.''\n  Again, I call attention to how slowly, how carefully, and how \ndeliberately Congress was proceeding on this important issue involving \nthe national security of our country. Senators can read the report of \nthe Senate Committee on Armed Services on S. 758 which stressed this \nvery point. The report reads, in part: ``In determining the most \nsuitable organization for national security no effort has been spared \nto uncover past mistakes and shortcomings. During the hearings . . . \nall phases of each plan were exhaustively examined.''\n  Let me repeat that. The Senate Committee reported that ``no effort \nhas been spared to uncover past mistakes and shortcomings'' and ``all \nphases of each plan were exhaustively examined.'' The committee was \npointing out that Congress knew what it must do. That there would be no \nrush to judgment. They were not about to be stampeded into unwise \nlegislation. There was no herd mentality there. They knew that what \nthey were doing would help decide the fate of American government and \nAmerican society for decades to come. They knew that, as the Nation's \nlawmakers--and that is what we are, the Nation's lawmakers--they had to \nbe careful and deliberate because so much was at stake.\n  On July 9, 1947, after debate and amendments, the Senate finally \napproved the National Security Act.\n  The House of Representatives was just as careful and deliberate in \nconsidering this reorganization of our Government. The reason, the \nHouse Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments pointed \nout in its report, was that ``both civilian and service witnesses \nadvised against a too-hurried consideration of the bill.''\n  Finally, on July 19, 1947, the House began considering H.R. 4214, the \ncommittees's version of the President's draft bill. It approved the \nmeasure only\n\n[[Page S8045]]\n\nafter considering 17 amendments. Nine of the amendments were approved.\n  On July 24, 1947, after five meetings, a conference committee \nreported a compromise version of S. 758 and so The House adopted the \nconference report.\n  Two days later, President Truman signed the National Security Act \ninto law, one half year after the legislation had been introduced, and \nfour years since General Marshall recommended unification of our armed \nforces.\n  I realize we do not have 4 years to act in this situation. I realize \nthe situations are different in many ways; the circumstances are \ndifferent in many ways. I know that. But this is a government \nreorganization that President Bush holds up as the role model for the \npresent government reorganization which we are considering. The problem \nis that this administration envisions Congress approving in just a few \nweeks a massive reorganization of the Federal Government that involves \n22 agencies and 170,000 Federal workers.\n  The administration should stop reading ``Gulliver's Travels'' and \nstart reading some history, especially the history behind the \nunification of our Armed Forces. If it is going to use that as the role \nmodel, the National Security Act--the reorganization of our military, \nthe establishment of a Department of Defense--we should read the \nhistory behind the unification of these Armed Forces. It is a \ncautionary tale, and one that the administration and we would do well \nto remember.\n  I am very concerned that 30 years from now, Congress will be \nstruggling to rectify the problems that we will be creating with hasty, \nill-considered enactment of the Department of Homeland Security. There \nwas all this rush, there was all this hue and cry that we ought to get \nthis done before Congress goes out for the August recess. The House \npassed this bill after 2 days of floor debate and took off a week \nearlier than the Senate did. Then there was the idea we ought to do \nthis by September 11.\n  What we need to do is to develop a product that works. We need to \nhave legislation enacted by Congress and signed by the President that \nis right, not something that is hurriedly passed just to conform with \nan artificial deadline on the calendar. How much harm could be done in \nthe meantime can be imagined. I am referring to damage to the rights \nand the liberties that we hold most dear: civil rights, labor rights, \nlabor protection, civil liberties of all Americans. I am talking about \ndamage to our constitutional process. We can inflict damage upon the \nconstitutional process if we act in haste, and that damage perhaps \ncannot be and will not be rectified for years to come. We must not \ninflict damage on our constitutional processes.\n  President Bush's proposed Department of Homeland Security is an \nenormous grant of power to the executive branch. I hope that everyone \nwho hears me will understand that--an enormous grant of power to the \nexecutive branch. It constitutes control of 170,000 Federal workers and \na huge piece of the Federal budget. It will mean a major change in the \ngovernmental infrastructure of our Nation.\n  This may be for keeps. This may be the infrastructure that will last \nthrough the lifetimes of at least some of us. And we cannot and must \nnot close our eyes to the threats that are involved here, by well-\nintentioned people I am sure, the threats to the constitutional \nprocesses that have guided this Nation for 215 years and should \ncontinue to guide it in the future.\n  This Constitution is good enough to guide us through whatever \nemergencies may confront this country. We must not cede this power, \npower that the administration wants but not necessarily needs--but the \nadministration wants it. Let's stop, look, and listen and be careful \nwhat we are doing.\n  I wonder how many out of 100 Senators took the time during the recess \nto read the House bill, to read the substitute that is about to be \nproposed by Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Thompson. How many Senators took the \ntime to read and to ponder what we are about to do? I did. I am not an \nexpert on the House bill or the substitute by Mr. Lieberman. I have not \nput as much time, naturally, by any means, in my study of the Lieberman \nsubstitute as has he or his counterpart or the members of that \ncommittee.\n\n  So the members of that committee knew very well what was in the bill. \nBut how many other Senators took the time to sit down and read and mark \nand underline and think about the words, the phrases, the sentences \nthat are included in this substitute and in the underlying bill?\n  Let Senators remember that once we pass a bill in the Senate, which \nwe must and which we will, then we in the Senate--half of the \nlegislative branch, this half, except for the committee conferees--will \nbe out of it. I don't bemoan the fact that I will be out of it, but \nmost of the Senate will be out of it. We will have said our piece. We \nwill have made our press releases. And we will have had an opportunity \nto offer amendments.\n  But how many of us are prepared to offer amendments? How many of us \nhave read this legislation? How many in the media know what we are \ntalking about and what is in this legislation? The people out there, \n280 million of them, who are represented by 100 Senators, do not have \nthe slightest idea what is encompassed in this legislation. They have \nheard the President on the campaign trail talking about this bill: pass \nit, pass it, pass it. They have heard others in the administration. I \ndon't have any criticism of that. They naturally want this bill passed.\n  We need to look at it. We Senators have a duty to study it and to \ntake the time and, if necessary, offer amendments where we believe \namendments should be offered and the Senate must be given the \nopportunity to work its will. And it will work its will.\n  But I am concerned. That is where I am coming from, and I am sure \nthere are other Senators who would be equally concerned if they read \nthese bills. But they have been busy. Senators are very busy people. I \nknow that.\n  In a recent column, David Broder wisely pointed out that because the \nmission of the Department of Homeland Security ``is so large and its \nscale is so vast, it is worth taking the time to get it right.''\n  That is David Broder, and he got it right when he said that. I will \ncontinue with his words.\n\n       It is worth taking the time to get it right. Having the \n     bill on the President's desk by the symbolic first \n     anniversary of the terrorist attacks is much less vital than \n     making the design as careful as it can be.\n\n  Hallelujah. That was David Broder. He is right.\n  Now let me read what he said without my editorial comment. He said: . \n. . the mission of the Department of Homeland Security ``is so large \nand its scale is so vast, it is worth taking the time to get it right. \nHaving the bill on the president's desk by the symbolic first \nanniversary of the terrorist attacks is much less vital when making the \ndesign as careful as it can be.''\n  I remind my colleagues that once the genie is out of the bottle, it \nis gone. It would be difficult to get it back into the bottle. This \nbill is the best, if not the last, opportunity for Congress to make \nsure that we are not unleashing a genie, a very dangerous genie.\n  I realize it is not easy to go against the administration for some of \nmy colleagues, in an election year especially. But our duty to our \ncountry and to future generations compels us to do no less. And I \nintend to do no less than stand on my feet and speak my thoughts. This \nis what separates the men from the boys, the women from the girls, and \nthe statesmen from the politicians.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  What is the time situation with respect to the upcoming vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are going into executive session at 12:30.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Madam President, I hope Senators will take a look at this morning's \nWashington Post. On the front page there is a column by Gregg Schneider \nand Sara Kehaulani Goo, Washington Post staff writers. The headline \nreads as follows:\n\n       Twin Missions Overwhelmed TSA. Airport Agency Strives to \n     Create Self, Stop Terror.\n\n  This story that I am about to take excerpts from tells exactly why we \nought to take time and do this right.\n  I read from the column:\n\n       When a gunman opened fire at a Los Angeles International \n     Airport ticket counter on July 4, the nation's new agency in \n     charge of airport security got its first chance to swing into \n     action.\n\n[[Page S8046]]\n\n       Instead, it claimed the shooting was outside its \n     jurisdiction.\n       After bullets sprayed across the crowded holiday terminal, \n     killing three, the agency's director at the time, John W. \n     Magaw, looked on helplessly as his own spokesmen dismissed \n     the incident as a matter for local police and the FBI. \n     ``That's nuts. That is nuts,'' Magaw said later.\n       But by that holiday, with the nation on edge about a \n     terrorist attack, Magaw had lost control of the \n     Transportation Security Administration. He had run the high-\n     profile, multibillion-dollar agency far astray from what \n     Congress and the Bush administration said they wanted, \n     alienating everyone from local airport operators to \n     commercial airline pilots.\n\n  Now get this. I continue to read:\n\n       The agency simply couldn't keep up with the twin demands of \n     creating itself and devising a system of stopping terrorists.\n\n  There you are in a nutshell. That is the problem.\n\n       Internally, there was tension over the TSA's mission, with \n     a growing core of leaders steeped in law enforcement at odds \n     with political forces demanding customer service. Magaw and \n     his deputies clashed with key members of Congress and the \n     White House over budgets and left airport managers around the \n     country feeling shut out.\n       The fact that the TSA was flat-footed on the day of the \n     most violent attack on U.S. aviation since Sept. 11 \n     underscores how, after nearly a year of building a new \n     federal agency to take over airport security, few broad \n     changes have taken place.\n\n  There you are. That is our problem. We are about to create a new \ndepartment of homeland security, which I am for. I will vote for that. \nThen we are about to create 6 directors, and we are about to set up a \nsuperstructure. In this bill, once we pass the package and send it down \nto the President, we are going to say there it is. You take it. It is \nyours. Then the administration will have the colossal task of \ntransitioning, as I read it, 22 agencies.\n  I was talking with Senator Lieberman this morning. I was told that \nmore likely there will be 28 agencies and offices. There you have it, \nMr. Administration. It is yours. That is what Congress is about to do. \nIt is yours.\n  Can one imagine the chaos that is going to occur when all of these \nagencies are supposed to be transitioned into the department of \nsecurity within 13 months, and the people within them. One-hundred and \nseventy thousand Federal employees will have to become accustomed to a \nnew culture, once they are transitioned. They will have to move their \ndesks, their computers, and their telephones. They will have to get \nacquainted with new associates. They will have new and different \nmissions.\n  When we talk about the 1947 role model of the National Security Act, \nwe are talking about military branches that had the same mission, \noverall. Those were not different missions. These people are going to \nbe put into a brand spanking new, polished-chrome metal piece of toy to \nguard the homeland, and to guard the people. All of these people put \ninto one agency are going to be concerned about their pay scales, their \nworker rights, and their privacy rights--all of those things. There \nthey will be. All yours, Mr. President. Here it is. You asked for it. \nHere it is now so Congress can stand on the sidelines for the next 13 \nmonths.\n  I am saying no. Congress should not stand on the sidelines for the \nnext 13 months. We have a duty under the Constitution to exercise \noversight and to see that the agencies are properly brought into the \nsix directories.\n  I am thinking of the same directorates the committee recommended, the \nsame superstructure. I am saying that is fine. But now, when it comes \nto bringing in the 22 agencies or the 28 agencies or the 30 agencies or \nthe 25 agencies--I have heard all of these numbers; we do not even know \nthe number of agencies--when it comes to fusing those, what are the \ncriteria for this agency or that agency or some other agency or some \npart of that agency? What are the criteria by which somebody is going \nto have to be guided in bringing these agencies into the superstructure \nand making them part of the directorates, which are parts of the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security?\n  Who knows? I have not seen anything in my reading, anything in \nwriting. I have not heard anything in any way by which these 22 \nagencies--I will say 28, since Mr. Lieberman has counted them. What are \nthe criteria and what is going to happen?\n  Look at what the Post is reporting happened to the brandnew, shiny \ntransportation agency, the TSA. And here we are talking about 22 or 25 \nor 28 or 30 more agencies, putting them all in. Here, Mr. President. \nHere is what you asked for. Here is the bill. You take it. That is what \nwe are about to do, and I do not think we should do it.\n  I think Congress should stay in the mix, should continue to exercise \nits oversight, its judgment, give its advice, give its consent, and \nvote up or down as we go along on the procedure.\n  Now, I am going to offer an amendment at some point. I may offer \nseveral amendments, but the first amendment I offer will deal only with \ntitle I, only with title I. But my concern is that Congress has a \nresponsibility, it has a duty to which it must face up, and that duty \nis to keep a hand on this, to maintain oversight. And I think these 22 \nagencies--I will quit using 22; I am going to use Joe Lieberman's \nfigure, 28--these 28 agencies should be phased in, in an orderly \nprocess that gives the Congress the time, as we go along, to look at \nwhat the administration--through this new Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, through his recommendations--recommendations are.\n  Congress should not just hand this thing over lock, stock, and \nbarrel, to this administration, or any other administration, and say: \nHere it is. You take it.\n  So here, in microcosm, is the problem. And we are reading about it \nright here in this Washington Post of today. I won't read the whole \ncolumn right now. I may refer to it again later.\n  But let me proceed now by saying that the homeland security \nlegislation that we will be considering this week has become something \nmuch more than mere legislation. It has become a political windstorm \nblowing down Pennsylvania Avenue and through the Halls of Congress.\n  The President's proposal has been barreling through Congress like a \nMack truck, threatening to run over anyone who dares to stand in its \nway. And Congress, so far, has cleared a path and cheered on this \nrumbling big rig, without stopping to think seriously about where it is \nultimately headed. Now we are going to think seriously about it.\n  The President assures us that he is safely behind the wheel, and that \nall we need to do is give him the ``flexibility''--I use his word, \n``flexibility''--he needs to fight terror immediately, and he will \nhandle it from there.\n  While the President's assurances may help some people sleep better, I \nam left tossing and turning on my pillow at night. I fear terrorism as \nmuch as anyone, and I recognize the need for constructive, decisive \naction in these daunting times. But lately I have also been plagued by \nthe fear that, in the name of homeland security, we may be jeopardizing \nliberties from within our own Government by unwittingly trading in many \nof the constitutional protections which were designed by the Founding \nFathers as safeguards against the dangerous tendencies of human nature.\n  In Federalist No. 48, James Madison wrote:\n\n       It will not be denied that power is of an encroaching \n     nature and that it ought to be effectually restrained from \n     passing the limits assigned to it.\n\n  Now, that is James Madison:\n\n       It will not be denied that power is of an encroaching \n     nature and that it ought to be effectually restrained from \n     passing the limits assigned to it.\n\n  The President is clearly attempting to remove the limits on his \npower. I don't question his good intention. Maybe he doesn't understand \nwhat he is doing. But this is clearly an attempt to remove limits on \nthe Executive's power, and Congress is doing very little, up to this \npoint, to restrain the administration's ambitions.\n  I am alarmed that the President is demanding such broad authority \nover an unprecedented amount of resources and information, while at the \nsame time asking us to eliminate existing legal restrictions to allow \nhim the ``managerial flexibility'' to respond to changing threats. His \nproposal gives the Secretary of Homeland Security almost unlimited \naccess to intelligence and law enforcement information without adequate \nprotections against misuse of such information. I am willing to give \nthe President necessary authority to secure the Nation's safety, but I \nbelieve we can give him flexibility without giving him a blank check.\n\n[[Page S8047]]\n\n  In Federalist No. 48--and Senators and Representatives and other \npeople should read the Federalist Papers once again--in Federalist No. \n48 here is what he said:\n\n       An elective despotism was not the government we fought for. \n     . . .\n\n  Nobody is suggesting there be an elective despotism. But I am \nsuggesting that we better go very carefully, as we legislate on this \nproposal, that we do not release to the executive branch, by \nlegislation, powers that the Constitution guards against.\n  This is what Madison says:\n\n       An elective despotism was not the government we fought for. \n     . . .\n\n  We can, in this Senate, very well pass legislation that ends up \ngiving to any President--I am not just talking about Mr. Bush--the \npowers that amount to an elective despotism. That is what I am \nconcerned about in this legislation--one of the things.\n\n       An elective despotism was not the government we fought for; \n     but one which should not only be founded on free principles, \n     but in which the powers of government should be so divided \n     and balanced among several bodies of magistracy as that no \n     one could transcend their legal limits without being \n     effectually checked and restrained by the others.\n\n  Now, that is what I am saying Congress needs to be aware of. We need \nto be on guard that we do not pass legislation that, in the end, gives \na President--and there is no assurance that this President will be \nPresident forever; he may be President for 2 more years or maybe 6 more \nyears. Who knows. But the Congress must be on guard in this \nlegislation--I know it is very tempting to vote without further delay, \nwithout any argument, vote for a new department of homeland security. \nAnd we ought to have it. But it will be very easy for Congress to pass \nlegislation that, in the end, results in elective despotism. Madison \nwarns us against it.\n  The President's proposal cripples internal oversight offices and \nweakens external legal controls on the Department, including \nunnecessary exemptions from public disclosure laws such as the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act and the Freedom of Information Act, allowing the \nSecretary to exercise his broad authority in relative secrecy.\n  In many of these areas, Senator Lieberman's committee, working with \nSenator Thompson, has brought in a bill that is, in my judgment, much \nbetter than the administration's proposal, which is largely reflected \nby the House bill. And at the end of the day, the House bill will be \nbefore the Senate--at some point, Mr. Lieberman will offer his \nsubstitute--so that the Senate will have before it both the House bill \nand the Lieberman proposal.\n  So what I am saying is not altogether, or even in great part, \ncriticism of the product the committee has given to the Senate. I am \nstating my concerns. We cannot brush aside the House bill. It is going \nto be in conference, and we are going into conference, and these \nconferees are going to be up against the House conferees--the House, \nwhich is under the control of the other party, which is in control of \nthe White House. So I do not envy the challenges that are going to be \nbefore our Senate conferees. I am speaking of my concerns with respect \nto one or both of these measures that will be before the Senate.\n  These exemptions reflect the administration's strong antagonism \ntoward traditional ``good government'' and ``sunshine'' laws that \nattempt to cast light on government activities and subject them to \npublic scrutiny. The administration is seizing on this legislative \nopportunity to weaken these important laws.\n  The administration is attempting to gut the traditional protections \nfor personal privacy and civil rights abuses from the new Department, \nand the bill that was passed by the House of Representatives \neffectively dismantles most of these safeguards. Unfortunately, the \nSenate doesn't do enough, in my judgment, to restore those checks.\n  The Senate bill does require, very generally, that the Secretary and \nthe directorate for intelligence establish rules and procedures for \ngoverning the disclosure of sensitive information. Some of this \nlanguage restricts the use of information to only authorized and \n``official'' purposes, but this restriction is meaningless because the \nvague authority given to the Secretary allows him to claim that almost \nanything he wants to do constitutes an ``official'' purpose.\n  In pressuring Congress to pass homeland security legislation, the \nadministration is using the ``war on terror'' as a red herring to draw \nattention away from the underlying objectives of the administration's \nproposal, which include expanding the regime of secrecy that has been \nestablished by the White House to the 22, 25, 28, or 30 agencies of the \nnew Department of Homeland Security.\n  Once the Department has been legally shrouded in secrecy, the \nPresident can take advantage of his broad access to information and its \nvague mission and authority to command the ``war'' without scrutiny \nfrom Congress or the public.\n\n  The President has proclaimed that we are entering a ``new era,'' one \nthat will resemble the cold war in its concerns for national security. \nHis proposal marks a disturbing start for this era and I am afraid may \nbe a sign of things to come. The cold war began with an iron curtain \ndescending over Europe. Under this bill, the war on terror may have \nbegun with an iron curtain descending around our Government.\n  Congress must not defer to executive judgment alone. Congress must \nnot trust that this administration, or any other administration, will \nalways act in the best interest of the Nation. Absolute trust and \nunquestioning deference are dangerous gifts for the legislature to \nbestow on the executive, even when our leaders have given us no reason \nfor doubt.\n  Good intentions do not guarantee good government. As Madison tells us \nin Federalist No. 51:\n\n       If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If \n     angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal \n     controls on government would be necessary. In framing a \n     government which is to be administered by men over men, the \n     great difficulty lies in this: You first enable the \n     government to control the governed; and in the next place, \n     oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is no \n     doubt the primary control on the government; but experience \n     has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.\n\n  Madam President, Justice Brandeis echoed Madison's warning of the \ndangers of relying on the good intentions of government. He wrote:\n\n       Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to \n     protect liberty when the government's purposes are \n     beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel \n     invasion of their liberty by evil minded rulers. The greatest \n     dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of \n     zeal, well-meaning, but without understanding.\n\n  I suspect that this administration means well in its desire to \nmobilize the Government against terror, but so many in the \nadministration have come lately--not all, but some. I fear that some of \nwhat the administration is asking for is a danger to the people's \nliberty.\n  In our rush to reorganize the Government, we seem to have forgotten \nthe principles upon which the Government was founded. The Constitution \nestablished a system of divided Government, a system that feared \ntyranny more than it favored efficiency. The Constitution's separation \nof powers and checks and balances were not designed to provide \nmanagerial flexibility to any President, Democrat or Republican. They \nwere designed to limit the power of the state over its citizens by \nensuring that individual liberties could not be easily abridged by the \nunchallenged authority of any one branch of Government.\n  President Harry Truman proposed the most dramatic reorganization of \nthe last century, creating the Department of Defense and the CIA in \nresponse to the new threats of the cold war. But even after he presided \nover such a critical moment of national security, he remained skeptical \nof the need for efficiency and flexibility in the executive branch. \nTruman said:\n\n       When there's too much efficiency in government, you've got \n     a dictator. And it isn't efficiency in government we're \n     after, it's freedom in government. . . .\n\n  That is Truman. That is my favorite Democratic President in our time. \nFollowing him came Mr. Eisenhower, who I have--at least lately--come to \nbelieve was the greatest Republican President in our time.\n  I continue with Truman's words:\n\n       And if the time ever comes when we concentrate all the \n     power for legislating and for\n\n[[Page S8048]]\n\n     justice in one place, then we've got a dictatorship and we go \n     down the drain the same as all the rest of those republics \n     have.\n\n  Madam President, the administration's proposal makes clear to me that \nit is not freedom in Government the administration is after.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security will become a human link between \nthe FBI, the CIA, and local police departments, serving as a ``focal \npoint'' for all intelligence information available to the United \nStates. I am concerned that in this role he may be able to circumvent \nexisting legal restrictions placed on those agencies to protect \nindividual privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.\n  The Homeland Security Department will be authorized to draw on the \nresources of almost any relevant agency at the Federal, State, and \nlocal level, ranging from sensitive international intelligence compiled \nby the CIA and the NSA to surveillance of U.S. citizens by the FBI and \nlocal police. Many of these agencies were very purposely kept separate \nand distinct, or were given limited jurisdiction or investigative \npowers, in order to reduce abuses of power. However, when the \nDepartment--this new Department--draws on the resources and information \nof other agencies, it may not necessarily be subject to the same legal \nrestraints imposed on those agencies.\n  In addition, the civil rights officer and the privacy officer \nestablished under the administration's plan to uncover abuses in the \nDepartment are not given enough authority to actually carry out their \njobs. They are essentially advisers with no real investigative or \nenforcement power. Both officers are responsible for ensuring \ncompliance with existing law, but their only legal recourse after \nidentifying a problem or violation is to report the problem to the \nDepartment's inspector general.\n  However, the inspector general, in turn, is under no obligation to \nfollow up on privacy and civil rights complaints, only an obligation to \ninform Congress of any ``civil rights abuses'' in semi-annual reports. \nIf and when the IG does choose to investigate, he will often be unable \nto do so independently as the Inspector General Act intended, because \nthis plan provides that the inspector general will be ``under the \nauthority, direction, and control of the Secretary''--now get that. \nThat ought to be enough to curl your hair. Let me read that again. The \ninspector general will be ``under the authority, direction, and control \nof the Secretary''--meaning the Secretary of Homeland Security--``with \nrespect to audits or investigations, or the issuance of subpoenas, \nwhich require access to sensitive information.'' And the Secretary can \nsay no if he determines certain things, which I can read into the \nRecord--he determines; if he determines, the Secretary; if he \ndetermines no, the inspector general is stopped in his tracks. That is \nit. Is that the way the people in this country want it to be? I do not \nbelieve so.\n  Granting the Secretary control over internal investigations puts the \n``fox in charge of the hen house'' whenever the fox claims a national \nsecurity reason for it.\n  The inspector general can say: I have a national security reason. You \nhave to stop. You cannot investigate further. You cannot subpoena \nwitnesses. You cannot because Congress passed the law that the \nadministration wanted saying you cannot. So you stop right here in your \ntracks.\n  Is that the way the American people want it? No.\n  The President's proposal also lets the fox have his way when he uses \nworking groups--now get this--to investigate or craft policy. Although \nnot included in the Senate bill, the House bill, which will be before \nthe Senate likewise, allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nexempt advisory groups within the Department from the disclosure \nrequirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The practical \neffect of this authority would be to give the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity the ability to conduct secret meetings to craft Department \npolicy, minimizing interference from Congress and the public.\n  This would appear to expand the model of secret policymaking \ncurrently employed in the administration, the most notable example \nbeing Vice President Cheney's secret energy working group.\n  While the Federal Advisory Committee Act does exempt the Central \nIntelligence Agency and the Federal Reserve from disclosure \nrequirements, the justification for doing so cannot support providing \nthe same exemption for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The broad authority and domestic jurisdiction of the Department \ndistinguish it from the CIA which has no authority to invade the \nprivacy of U.S. citizens domestically and whose activities are \ncontrolled more directly by the President in exercise of his \nconstitutional powers over foreign affairs. The exemption for the \nFederal Reserve protects financial information and economic projections \nin order to protect the integrity of the markets.\n  While it may be reasonable to excuse the Fed from this kind of public \ndisclosure, I am not comfortable in allowing the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to set the level of preparedness in complete secrecy in the \nsame way that Alan Greenspan sets interest rates.\n  The Federal Advisory Committee Act already allows waivers for \nsensitive information, so there is no compelling national security \njustification for providing this blanket exemption. Removing this \nexemption would not eliminate the Secretary's ability to convene \ncommittees in secret, but it would make the Secretary and the President \nmore accountable--more accountable--for choosing to do so.\n  The President is authorized under existing law to determine which \ncommittees should be exempt from disclosure for national security \nreasons, and he must explain himself every time he does so. The bill \npassed by the House allows the Secretary to exempt committees at will, \nwhile only paying lipservice to Congress. Both the House bill and the \nSenate bill provide an unnecessary exemption, in my viewpoint, from the \nFreedom of Information Act for critical infrastructure information \nprovided by private corporations.\n  The FOIA requires public disclosure of Government materials on \nrequest, but it already provides exemptions for national security \ninformation, sensitive law enforcement information, and confidential \nbusiness information. The administration's proposal extends these \nexemptions to include any information voluntarily submitted by \ncorporations to the Department. As a result of this exemption, this \ncorporate information could not be released under the Freedom of \nInformation Act for other enforcement purposes, so corporations would \nbe allowed to escape liability for any information they submit.\n  I have argued, Madam President, that parts of this bill should be put \noff to allow enough time for informed deliberation. I reaffirm my \nobjections to rushing into all of these agency transfers and new \ndirectives. However, these secrecy problems have to be addressed also.\n  The President has said that how we respond to this crisis will \ndetermine what kind of legacy we leave. I agree with the President on \nthat point. That is exactly why I suggest to the Members of the Senate \nwe should take time to remember the legacy that we have inherited, a \nlegacy of liberty and limited Government, and preserve these principles \nin the legacy that we will bequeath.\n  This new Department is going to be with us for some time, so we must \nthink beyond the next election and act with an eye to the future. This \nCongress needs to make sure we will have some recourse in the event \nthat the administration's reorganization does not live up to all of its \npromises. Congress has a role to play in the ongoing supervision of the \nFederal Government, and we should not compromise that role by hastily \nsurrendering our constitutional powers.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8048-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8048-S8052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF TERRENCE F.

Under the previous order, the President will \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today the Senate is confirming Terrence \nMcVerry to the United States District Court for the Western District of \nPennsylvania. He is the 73rd judicial nominee of President George W. \nBush to be confirmed by the Senate since July 20 last year. With \ntoday's vote, the Democratic-led Senate has already exceeded the number \nof circuit and district court nominees confirmed in the last 30 months \nof Republican control of the Senate, when 72 judges were confirmed in \nthose 2\\1/2\\ years. Democrats have done more than Republicans did in \nless than half the time.\n  It is revealing that Republicans, with all of their misleading \nstatistics, consistently fail to compare their actual results during \ntheir most recent period of control of the Senate with the progress we \nhave made since the shift in the Senate majority. They do not want to \ncompare their own record over the prior 6\\1/2\\ years with our record of \naccomplishment in evaluating judicial nominees. They do not want to own \nup to their delay and inaction on scores of judicial nominees during \nthe last administration. During the period of Republican control of the \nSenate, judicial vacancies rose from 63 to 110. Since the change in \nmajority, the Democratic Senate has worked hard to help fill 73 of \nthose vacancies.\n  All too often the only claim that we hear about the Republican record \nis that President Clinton ultimately appointed 377 judges, five fewer \nthan President Reagan. Our Republican critics try to obscure the fact \nthat only 245 of those district and circuit court judges were confirmed \nin the 6\\1/2\\ years that the Republican majority controlled the pace of \nSenate hearings and consideration. That averages only 38 confirmations \nper year. Over an 8-year period that would have yielded 304 \nconfirmations. In fact, the Republican majority over the last 6 years \nof the Clinton administration produced on average only 58 percent of \nthe confirmations achieved during the first 2 years of that \nadministration.\n  As of today, the Democratic majority in the Senate has acted to \nconfirm 73 judges, including 13 nominees to the circuit courts. We have \nproceeded to almost double the confirmation rates of the former \nRepublican majority. We have done more in less than 15 months then they \nachieved in their last 30 months in the majority.\n  The reason Republicans do not want to talk about their record and \ncompare apples to apples is because this truth does not fit comfortably \nwith the myth of obstruction by Democrats that they have been working \nso hard to disseminate for their own partisan purposes. This situation \nreminds me of a quote by Adlai Stevenson, who said ``I have been \nthinking that I would make a proposition to my Republican friends . . . \nthat if they will stop telling lies about the Democrats, we will stop \ntelling the truth about them.'' Unfortunately, the persistence of the \nmyth of inaction in the face of such a clear record of progress on \njudicial vacancies by Democrats makes me worry that Republicans are \nfollowing the cynical observation that a lie told often enough becomes \nviewed as the truth. I am confident that Americans understand that \nDemocrats have been fairer to this President's judicial nominees than \nRepublicans were to his predecessor's nominees.\n  Today's vote is another example. The Senate has acted quickly on this \nnomination to the District Court in Pennsylvania. Mr. McVerry was \nnominated in January, received his ABA peer review in March, \nparticipated in a hearing in June, and he was reported out of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee in July. The Judiciary Committee has held \nhearings for 10 district court nominees from Pennsylvania and the \nSenate has confirmed nine of them in just five months. There is no \nState in the Union that has had more Federal judicial nominees \nconfirmed by this Senate than Pennsylvania. I think that the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate as a whole have done well by \nPennsylvania.\n  This is in sharp contrast to the way vacancies in Pennsylvania were \nleft unfilled during Republican control of the Senate, particularly \nregarding nominees in the western half of the State. Despite the best \nefforts and diligence of my good friend from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter, to secure confirmation of all of the judicial nominees from \nevery part of his home State, there were seven nominees by President \nClinton to Pennsylvania vacancies who never got a hearing or a vote.\n  A good example of the contrast between the way the Democrats and \nRepublicans have treated judicial nominees is the case of Judge Legrome \nDavis, a well qualified and uncontroversial judicial nominee. He was \nfirst nominated to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President \nClinton on July 30, 1998. The Republican-controlled Senate took no \naction on his nomination and it was returned to the President at the \nend of 1998. On January 26, 1999, President Clinton renominated Judge \nDavis for the same vacancy. The Senate again failed to hold a hearing \nfor Judge Davis and his nomination was returned after two more years.\n  Under Republican leadership, Judge Davis' nomination languished \nbefore the Committee for 868 days without a hearing. Unfortunately, \nJudge Davis was subjected to the kind of inappropriate partisan rancor \nthat befell so many other nominees to the district courts in \nPennsylvania during the Republican control of the Senate. This year, \nthe Democratic-led Senate moved expeditiously to consider Judge Davis, \nand he was confirmed promptly, five weeks after receiving his ABA peer \nreview, without a single negative vote. The saga of Judge Davis recalls \nfor us so many nominees from the period of January 1995 through July \n10, 2001, who never received a hearing or a vote and who were the \nsubject of secret, anonymous holds by Republicans for reasons that were \nnever explained.\n  The hearing we had earlier this year for Judge Joy Conti was the very \nfirst\n\n[[Page S8050]]\n\nhearing on a nominee to the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Pennsylvania since 1994, despite President \nClinton's qualified nominees to that court. It is shocking to me that \nthis was the first hearing on a nominee to that court in eight full \nyears. No nominee to the Western District of Pennsylvania received a \nhearing during the entire period that Republicans controlled the Senate \nduring the Clinton Administration. One of the nominees to the Western \nDistrict, Lynette Norton, waited for almost 1,000 days, and she was \nnever given a hearing. Unfortunately, Ms. Norton died earlier this \nyear, having never fulfilled her dream of serving on the Federal bench. \nWith the confirmation of Judge Conti, we confirmed the first nominee to \nthe Western District of Pennsylvania since October of 1994. Despite \nthis history of poor treatment of President Clinton's nominees, the \nDemocratic-led Senate continues to move forward fairly and \nexpeditiously. Terry McVerry is the most recent example of our \nwillingness to proceed in spite of recent Republican obstructionism.\n\n  Democrats have reformed the process for considering judicial \nnominees. For example, we have ended the practice of secretive, \nanonymous holds that plagued the period of Republican control, when any \nRepublican Senator could hold any nominee from his or her home State, \nhis or her own circuit or any part of the country for any reason, or no \nreason, without any accountability.\n  We have returned to the Democratic tradition of regularly holding \nhearings, every few weeks, rather than going for months without a \nsingle hearing. In fact, we have held 23 judicial nominations hearings \nin our first 12 and one-half months, an average of almost two per \nmonth. In contrast, during the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control, \nduring each of 30 months they did not hold a nominations hearing on a \nsingle judicial nominee. By holding 23 hearings for 84 of this \nPresident's judicial nominees, we have held hearings for more circuit \nand district court nominees than in 20 of the last 22 years during the \nReagan, first Bush, and Clinton administrations. The opposition party \nwould rather not refer to these facts, which debunk Republican myths \nabout who caused the vacancy crisis and delayed judicial appointments.\n  When the Senate Judiciary Committee reorganized after the change in \nSenate majority, there were 110 judicial vacancies. That included 33 \ncircuit court vacancies, twice the number that existed when Republicans \ntook over the Judiciary Committee in 1995. During the past 13 and one-\nhalf months, another 43 vacancies have arisen, largely due to \nretirements of past Republican appointees to the courts. If Democrats \nhad, in fact, obstructed judicial nominees, as Republicans so often \nclaim, there would now be 153 vacancies in our Federal courts, not the \n80 that currently remain.\n  We have tried to do our best to address the judicial vacancies \nproblem. We have been able to consider district court nominees more \nquickly because they have been generally less controversial and \nideological than this President's choices for the circuit courts. Not \nall of the district court nominees we have considered, however, have \nbeen without controversy. One of the nominees on whom we have proceeded \nreceived a majority ``Not Qualified'' peer review rating from the ABA \ndue to his relative inexperience. Five other district court nominees \nhave received some ``Not Qualified'' votes during the ABA peer reviews. \nThis is despite the fact that the ABA's rating now come after the \nPresident has given his imprimatur to the candidate and peers may be \nchilled from candidly sharing their concerns.\n  A number of President Bush's district court nominees to lifetime \nseats on the Federal bench have also been unusually young and have been \npracticing law for a little more than a decade. Some of them have views \nwith which we strongly disagree. Several of this President's judicial \nnominees seem to have earned their nominations as members of the \nFederalist Society. Others have records demonstrating that they are \npro-life and will actively undercut women's right to choose. Some have \nalready gone on to issue decisions against the privacy rights of women. \nMany of this President's district court nominees have been very active \nin Republican and conservative politics or causes. Still other nominees \nhave been intimately involved in partisan politics or played key roles \nin Republican fundraising. Today, the Senate is confirming a person \nwhose spouse is employed as the treasurer of Senator Santorum's \nelection campaign.\n  The Federal district courts matter. They are the courts of first \nresort, the trial courts where individuals' claims are tried or \ndismissed. Not everyone can afford the costs of appealing a trial court \nruling. Additionally, circuit courts traditionally give great deference \nto the findings of the lower court that examined the claims and \nobserved witnesses first hand, rather than making new factual findings \nbased on a cold record. Of course, matters of law are reviewed by the \ncircuit courts, and their rulings can have a substantial impact on the \ndevelopment of the law, especially with a Supreme Court that hears \nfewer than 100 cases per year.\n  Because we have moved quickly and responsibly on consensus nominees, \nthe number of vacancies is not at the 153 mark it would be at with no \naction, but is down to 80. On July 10, 2001, with the reorganization of \nthe Senate, we began with 110 vacancies, 77 of which were on the \ndistrict courts. Despite the large number of additional vacancies that \nhave arisen in the past year, with the 60 district court confirmations \nwe have had as of today, we have reduced district court vacancies to \n51. That is almost to the level it was at when Republicans took over \nthe Senate in 1995.\n  The opposition party dismisses this achievement in a backhanded way, \nbut it is one of the most significant things we have accomplished for \nthe sake of the Federal courts and for litigants in the Federal courts. \nIt has not been easy to process that many district court nominees in \nlittle more than one year. We have confirmed more of this President's \ndistrict court nominees over the past year than in any of the prior \n6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control. Indeed, we have achieved more \ndistrict court confirmations in the last 13 months than Republicans \naccomplished in all of 1999 and 2000 combined and more than were \nconfirmed during the last 30 months of Republican majority control of \nthe Senate.\n  We have had hearings for more of this President's district court \nnominees than in any year of the Reagan Administration, and he had 6 \nyears of a Senate majority of his own party. Indeed, we have confirmed \nmore of President George W. Bush's district court nominees in these \npast 13 plus months than were confirmed in any year of his father's \npresidency and more than were confirmed during his father's first two \nfull years combined.\n  In contrast to how fairly we have treated this President's Federal \ncourt nominees, consider how poorly nominees were treated during the \nprior 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the Senate. Some district \ncourt nominees waited years and never received a hearing. For example, \nnine district court nominees from Pennsylvania alone never got \nhearings, including then Pennsylvania Common Pleas Court Judge Legrome \nDavis, who was subsequently re-nominated by President Bush and \nconfirmed earlier this year. Four district court nominees from \nCalifornia were never given a hearing by Republicans despite the full \nsupport of their home-State Senators. These are just a few examples of \nRepublican obstruction of judicial nominees. In all, more than three \ndozen of President Clinton's district court nominees never received \nhearings or votes by Republicans.\n\n  Several others received hearings but never were given votes by the \nRepublican-controlled Judiciary Committee. These included six district \ncourt nominees, such as Fred Woocher, a California district court \nnominee and Clarence Sundram from New York. Still others waited \nhundreds and hundreds of days to be confirmed, such as Judge Susan Oki \nMollway of the District Court in Hawaii, whose nomination languished \nfor 913 days before she was confirmed, and Judge Margaret Morrow of the \nDistrict Court for the Central District of California who waited almost \n2 years, 643 days, to be confirmed. Let us not forget Missouri Supreme \nCourt Justice Ronnie White who was delayed twice only to be defeated on \nthe Senate floor, in a sneak attack.\n\n[[Page S8051]]\n\nJudge White had waited 801 days only to be defeated through character \nassassination on the floor of the Senate. In all, nearly 60 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees were blocked, many in the dark of \nnight through secretive, anonymous holds.\n  When confronted with their record Republicans often refer to all \nnominees not getting hearings in 1992. That year, the Senate confirmed \nmore of President George H.W. Bush's judicial nominees than in any year \nof his presidency and confirmed more judges than in any year in which \nthe Republican majority controlled consideration of President Clinton's \nnominees. In 1992, 66 judges were confirmed. So, even though some \nnominations were returned, the Senate in 1992 worked hard to confirm a \nsubstantial number, 66, of new judges in the 10 months they were in \nsession during that presidential election year. By contrast, in 1996 \nwhen the Republicans were in the Senate majority only 17 judges were \nconfirmed all year and none for the vacancies on the courts of appeals. \nIn 2000, the Republican majority in the Senate confirmed only 39 \njudges.\n  When the Senate is working hard to confirm judges, as it was in 1992 \nand since last summer, it may be understandable that not all nominees \ncan be considered. When, as was the case during the Republican \nmajority, the Senate is averaging only 38 confirmations a year and \ngoing months and months without a single hearing, the circumstances are \nquite different. The Republican majority in their 6\\1/2\\ years of \ncontrol of the Senate ensured that they never treated President \nClinton's judicial nominees better than the best year of former \nPresident Bush's Administration--just as they made sure that President \nClinton's total number of judges appointed never reached that of \nPresident Reagan. By contrast, the Democratic majority has reversed the \ndownward spiral and has treated this President's nominees more fairly \nthan the Republican majority treated those of the last President.\n  We have also been confirming this President's judicial nominees at a \nrecord pace. Rather than continue the Republican pace of 38 \nconfirmations a year, we have worked hard to do better. We have been so \nfair to President George W. Bush, despite the past unfairness of \nRepublicans, that if we continue at the current pace of confirmations, \nPresident Bush will appoint 227 judges by the end of his term. If this \nPresident were to serve two terms like Presidents Reagan and Clinton, \nhe would amass 454 judicial appointments, dramatically shattering \nPresident Reagan's all-time record of 382. Some may say we have been \nfoolishly fair, given how Republican treated the nominees of the last \nDemocratic President. But this, too, demonstrates how fair the \nDemocratic Senate majority has been these last 13\\1/2\\ months.\n  When we adjourned for the August recess we had given hearings to 91 \npercent of this President's judicial nominees who had completed their \npaperwork and who had the support of both of their home-State Senators. \nThat is, 84 of the 92 judicial nominees with completed files had \nreceived hearings. Indeed, when we held our last nomination hearing on \nAugust 1, we had given hearings to 66 district court nominees and we \nhad run out of district court nominees with completed paperwork and \nhome-State support. Only two district court nominees were eligible for \nthat hearing. This is because the White House changed the process of \nallowing the ABA to begin its work prior to formal nomination. This \nunilateral change by the White House has already cost the federal \njudiciary the chance to have 12 to 15 more district court nominees on \nthe bench and hearing cases these past 13 months. Many more of the two \ndozen pending nominees may not receive an ABA evaluation in time to be \nconsidered by the Senate this year.\n  On average, the ABA reviews of district court nominees have been \nreceived 59 days from the date of nomination. With the recent delays \nthat we have experienced in the time nominees are taking to complete \nthe Committee questionnaire and the changeover in personnel at the ABA, \nthat time may continue to expand in the few weeks remaining to us \nbefore the recess in October this year. Thus, even as the White House \nprofesses to blame the Senate for not making progress on even more \nnominees, it continues to do all it can to delay the process due to its \nunilateral approach.\n  In January I had proposed a simple procedural fix to allow the ABA \nevaluation to begin at the same time as the FBI investigation, as was \nthe practice in past Republican and Democratic administrations for 50 \nyears. Then the ABA could be in position to submit its evaluation \nimmediately following the nomination. Had this proposal been accepted, \nI am confident there would be more than a dozen fewer vacancies in the \nFederal courts. Instead our efforts to increase cooperation with the \nWhite House have been rebuffed. We continue to get the least \ncooperation from any White House I can recall during my nearly three \ndecades in the Senate.\n  In spite of the obstacles they have put in the way of their own \nnominees through their lack of consultation and cooperation, we have \nbeen able to have a record-breaking year restoring fairness to the \njudicial confirmation process. We have been rewarded with nearly \nconstant criticism from the administration and its allies.\n  White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales dismisses our accomplishments \nwith a terse, one-sentence acknowledgement that Democrats have ``made \nprogress in holding hearings and votes on district court nominees.'' \nWith today's vote, we have already confirmed 60 new Federal trial court \njudges. That is more than were confirmed in 21 of the past 23 years. We \nhave confirmed more district court nominees in these past 13\\1/2\\ \nmonths than were ever confirmed by the Republican majority during their \nprior 6\\1/2\\ years of control of the Senate.\n\n  For example, in 1995, the year the Republicans took over the Senate, \nPresident Clinton nominated 68 district court candidates, but the \nRepublican controlled Senate held hearings for and confirmed only 45 of \nthose nominees. Republicans would call that 66 percent. In 1996, \nRepublicans confirmed only 17 of the district court nominations pending \nand, of course no nominees to the circuit courts. That was 50 percent \nof the district court nominees. In 1997, Republicans allowed only 50 \npercent of the pending district court nominees to be confirmed. In \n1998, they hit their high mark in considering district court nominees \nand allowed 77 percent to be confirmed. In 1999, they were back down to \nallowing the confirmation of slightly over half, 58 percent, of the \ndistrict court nominees to be confirmed. Finally, in 2000, again \nRepublicans allowed only little more than half, or 56 percent, of the \npending district court nominees to be confirmed.\n  In contrast, we have already had hearings for 100 percent of those \ndistrict court nominees who were eligible for a hearing. We have had \nhearings for 66 district court nominees, voted 64 of them out of \ncommittee and, as of today, 60 of them have been confirmed by the \nDemocratic-led Senate.\n  I would like to thank the members of the Judiciary Committee who have \nlabored long and hard to evaluate the records of the individuals chosen \nby this President for lifetime appointments to the Federal courts. The \ndecisions we make after reviewing their records will last well beyond \nthe term of this President and will affect the lives of the individuals \nwhose cases will be heard by these judges and maybe millions of others \naffected by the precedents of the decisions of these judges.\n  While the opposition party seeks to attribute the vacancy crisis in \nthe Federal courts to the Democrats, who only recently became the \nmajority party in the Senate, I remain hopeful that the American people \nwill discover the truth behind such partisan accusations. Republicans \nare trying to take advantage of the vacancies they hoarded while \nwaiting for a Republican President with an ideological approach to \njudicial nominations. Democrats are trying to clean up the vacancies \nmess that the Republican majority created. I am proud of the efforts of \nthe Senate to restore fairness to the judicial confirmation process.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee is working hard to schedule hearings \nand votes on the few remaining judicial nominees, but it takes time to \ndeal with a mess of the magnitude we inherited. I think we have done \nwell by the Federal courts and the American people, and we will \ncontinue to do our best to ensure that all Americans have access to \nfederal judges who are unbiased,\n\n[[Page S8052]]\n\nfair-minded individuals with appropriate judicial temperament and who \nare committed to upholding the Constitution and following precedent. \nWhen the President sends judicial candidates who embody these \nprinciples, we have tried to move quickly. When he sends controversial \nnominees whose records demonstrate that they lack these qualities and \nwhose records are lacking, we will necessarily take more time to \nevaluate their merits.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nconfirmation of Terrence McVerry, who has been nominated to serve as a \nU.S. District Judge for the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n  Terrence McVerry has the breadth of experience and accomplishment we \nlook for in a Federal judge. After graduating from law school, Mr. \nMcVerry served in the U.S. Army Reserves and the Pennsylvania Air \nNational Guard. He then went to work as an assistant district attorney \nfor Allegheny County, prosecuting hundreds of trials with an emphasis \nin major felonies and homicides.\n  Mr. McVerry also has 17 years of civil litigation experience \nrepresenting individuals in a variety of matters including personal \ninjury, real estate, contracts, family matters, estate planning, and \nsmall businesses and corporations.\n  Mr. McVerry has been an able legislator, winning election to the \nPennsylvania House of Representatives in 1979 and serving there for 21 \nyears.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nproceed under Senator Lieberman's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          terrorism insurance\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have to believe that the President is not \ngetting the right information from his staff; otherwise, knowing him, I \ncannot believe he would say some of the things he has said recently.\n  I was running yesterday morning, and on Public Radio I heard a \npreview of the speech the President was going to give before a union in \nPennsylvania. And I thought they must have made a mistake. Then, later \nin the day, I heard him complete that speech, and he went ahead just as \nthey had said on Public Radio.\n  As we consider homeland security and the measures we should take to \ndefend America, I think it is important we talk about terrorism \ninsurance. That is the issue I want to talk about. I believe the \nPresident has not received the proper information from his staff.\n  Following the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon \nabout a year ago, many American businesses have had trouble purchasing \naffordable insurance covering acts of terrorism.\n  As a consequence, many construction projects and real estate \ntransactions have been delayed, interrupted, and in some cases \ncanceled. We are talking about billions of dollars worth of projects \nthat have been stalled, some terminated, solely because of the lack of \nbeing able to purchase terrorism insurance.\n  These problems cost many American workers their jobs and prevent \nbusinesses from being as productive as they could be. Clearly, the lack \nof affordable terrorism insurance has had a harmful effect on our \nNation's already troubled economy.\n  I am glad we are back from our break and the President is back from \nhis vacation. However, as I have indicated, yesterday, the President \nmade some statements relating to terrorism insurance, about the need \nfor Congress to move forward on terrorism insurance, that simply were \nwithout any fact.\n  As millions of students across the country go back to school, I want \nthem to understand that they must speak the truth. I repeat, I do not \nthink the President said what he said yesterday based upon full \nknowledge of all the information.\n  The truth, Mr. President, is Senate Democrats--because I have been \nhere offering the unanimous consent request for months--have been \nleading the effort to pass an effective terrorism insurance bill--and \nwe started on this last year--while Republicans have delayed and \nattempted to thwart this important legislation time after time. The \nPresident should know that. The leadership in the Congress of his party \nhas not allowed us to go forward on this legislation.\n  One of the statements he made before the union is: I am for hard \nhats, not trial lawyers.\n  This is terrorism insurance. We should move it forward. I am \nconfident everyone can see through these statements the President made \nas being without fact.\n  I want to remind him and the people who give him advice--give him \ngood information, good background information so he can speak with the \nfull knowledge of the facts.\n  We are eager to pass terrorism insurance. We have done everything \nwithin our power to do that. This would help workers, businesses, and \nthe Nation's economy.\n  Shortly after the terrorist attacks last year, our colleagues--\nSenators Dodd, Sarbanes, and Schumer--developed a strong bill to help \nbusinesses get the affordable terrorism insurance they badly need.\n  When we attempted to move this bill last December, the minority \nvoiced no fundamental disagreement with the bill but argued over the \nnumber of amendments to be offered. This was done in an effort to \nprevent us from moving forward on this legislation. So we could not do \nit in December. We came right back and started on it. After having had \nmany private attempts to get this legislation moving, we decided to go \npublic and try to move it from the floor, right from where I stand.\n  We tried offering in early spring unanimous consent agreements to \ntake up the terrorism insurance legislation. Again, there was no \nobjection to the base text or that the Dodd-Sarbanes-Schumer bill \nshould be the vehicle we would bring to the floor. They wanted some \namendments. We wanted to treat this as any other legislation. They said \nlet us agree on the number of amendments. Whatever number we came up \nwith wasn't appropriate. We could not move it. Finally, they simply \ndisagreed with bringing up the bill at all.\n  It is the right of the majority leader to decide which bills are \nbrought to the floor. If the minority is opposed, they have the right \nto offer amendments and attempt to modify the text of the bill. We have \noffered to bring the bill up with amendments on each side so everyone \ncould have the opportunity to make changes.\n  Nevertheless, the minority continued to object and further prevented \nus from passing the terrorism insurance legislation.\n  In April, the importance of the terrorism insurance legislation was \nenunciated by Secretary O'Neill in his testimony before the \nAppropriations Committee that the lack of terrorism insurance could \ncost America 1 percent of the GDP because major projects would not be \nable to get financing.\n  Finally, we were able to get an agreement that we could bring the \nbill to the floor. We passed the legislation. And then came weeks and \nweeks of more stalling by the minority. We could not get agreement on \nappointing conferees. We attempted and attempted and attempted. First, \nthey were upset because the ratio was 3 to 2, which is fairly standard. \nThey said they wanted 4 to 3. So we came back\n\n[[Page S8053]]\n\nand said OK, and they still would not agree.\n  Finally, we were able to get agreement on the appointment of \nconferees. But now nothing is happening in the conference. We cannot do \nthat alone. So I hope the record is clear. I know we refer to ``the \npeople downtown''--that is, the government representatives, the \nlobbyists who are concerned about this issue, the real estate and hotel \nowners, and these special interest groups. They know how we have tried \nto move this legislation. I only hope the people who have lost their \njobs and are unable to move forward--these people in Pennsylvania \nyesterday who were told we are holding this up--understand that simply \nis not the truth.\n  So I certainly hope this legislation can be completed and we can have \na bill sent to the President. It is the right thing to do. The \nlegislation is important, and I hope we can do it sooner rather than \nlater.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes of my time now to \nthe Senator from Illinois who, I might say parenthetically, has been an \nextraordinarily thoughtful, constructive participant in the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee's consideration of the question of \nhomeland security and, in that sense, has contributed mightily to the \nproposal we will put before the Chamber tonight. I am glad to yield 15 \nminutes to Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Lieberman for his \nleadership on the Governmental Affairs Committee. I think the record \ndemonstrates that before the President called for the creation of a \nDepartment of Homeland Security, our committee, the Governmental \nAffairs Committee of the Senate, under Senator Lieberman's leadership, \nproposed a law to create such a Department.\n  At the time, it is interesting because it was on a partisan roll \ncall, if I remember correctly, nine Democrats for it, seven Republicans \nagainst it. We argued that a question of this magnitude, a challenge of \nthis gravity, required a separate Department at that moment in time. \nNeither the President nor his loyal followers in the Senate were \nprepared to join us in that effort.\n  So I salute Senator Lieberman for his leadership, and I am happy now \nthat we have reached the point where we are speaking again, as we \nshould when it comes to our Nation's defense, in a bipartisan manner. I \nhope that as we proceed to the debate on this bill, we can gather \ntogether again that same bipartisan force.\n  There is nothing that says Congress or the Senate have to agree on \neverything and, frankly, if we did, it would probably betray the \nprinciples and values of this Nation. But when it comes to our national \nsecurity and defense, particularly the creation of a Department of this \nmagnitude, I think it is all well and good that when the debate ends, \nwe do try to find some common ground.\n  Our Government simply has to change and adapt to the challenge of \ninternational terrorism. A reorganization of this magnitude is not \ngoing to be simple--it is going to take some time--but this Congress is \nup to the task. Throughout our history, from 1789 when the first \nCongress created the first executive branch Departments of State, War, \nand Treasury, to 1988 when the latest Department, the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, was created, Congress has worked to make sure the \nGovernment was organized to do the job the American people asked of it.\n  Protecting our Nation's people is our highest priority. On March 15, \n2001, almost 6 months before the attack on September 11, the U.S. \nCommission on National Security/21st Century, known by the shorthand \nname of the Hart-Rudman Commission, named after its co-chairmen the \ndistinguished former Senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman, released a \nreport entitled ``Road Map For National Security: An Imperative For \nChange.'' The Commission was, unfortunately, prescient in seeing the \nvulnerability of the United States to terrorism. The No. 1 \nrecommendation of the Hart-Rudman Commission was to create a Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  It is worth quoting for the record some of the report that came out \nof the Commission. It says, the combination of unconventional weapons \nproliferation with the persistence of international terrorism will end \nthe relative invulnerability of the U.S. homeland to catastrophic \nattack.\n  These words were written 6 months before September 11. They went on \nin their report to recommend the creation of an independent national \nhomeland security agency, and they suggested there were some agencies \nof Government which naturally would come under the roof and under the \nauthority of this new Department and quite effectively, or at least \nmore effectively, defend the United States.\n  The blueprint they laid out was really the basis for this bill we \nhave before us, the Senate version, the Governmental Affairs version, \nfrom Senator Lieberman. The backbone of the new Department will be \nFEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, along with the \nDepartments guarding our borders and our perimeter. This new Department \neveryone sees as a way to protect our country more robustly.\n  Some have questioned, though, how a new Department and how \nreorganizing Government will really make us any safer. Right now there \nare more than 45 agencies in the Federal Government with some \nresponsibility for homeland security. If we look at it, it is just too \ndiffuse. It cannot be focused. It cannot be coordinated. In the words \nof my friend and former House colleague, Gov. Tom Ridge, we are going \nto, frankly, not have the force multipliers we need that organization \nand coordination will bring.\n\n  Some of my colleagues have charged we are moving too quickly. Well, I \nhappen to agree with the premise that this race to enact this \nlegislation by September 11 of this year, on the 1-year anniversary of \nthat terrible disaster, was precipitous. It would have been a miracle \nif we had been able to create a bill that quickly which would have \nreally met the task. It is better for us to take the additional time to \ndo it right. To meet some self-imposed deadline or some deadline \nimposed by the press or our critics does not make a lot of sense when \nwe are talking about a Department that is going to be facing the \nresponsibility of protecting America for decades to come.\n  As a member of the committee, I want to report to our colleagues that \nI think our committee has done its job. This does not mean we should \nnot debate the issue and deliberate on some alternatives and some \nmodifications. What we have before us is an effort, backed by \nbipartisan work for many years under both Republican and Democrat \nchairmen. This committee has held 18 hearings since last September 11 \nsetting up this new Department. It is a committee that has held a \nseries of hearings over the last 4 or 5 years on the issues that are \ninvolved.\n  I remind my colleagues that this extensive body of work of this \ncommittee and its chairman allowed our committee to report out a bill \non May 22. Once the President decided he wanted a similar Department, \nwe tried to coordinate his intentions with our own. Realizing that all \nwisdom does not reside in one branch of Government or the other, we \nhave listened to the President's suggestions. I am hopeful he will be \nopen to our own.\n  One of the things I included in this as an element that was of \nparticular personal interest related to the whole question of \ninformation technology. The proposal to restructure 28 agencies into a \nnew, unified Homeland Security Department poses a complex challenge to \nintegrate the system's infrastructure of our information technology to \nsupport the new Department's mission.\n  Let me get away from these high falutin' words, high sounding words, \nand get back to the real world where I live, because I am not part of \nthis computer generation. I struggle with my own computers and e-mail \nto try to be up to speed. In the amendment that I adopted, what we are \nreally saying to the Office of Management and Budget\n\n[[Page S8054]]\n\nis: We want you to have a special person, a special group, assigned the \nresponsibility to coordinate the architecture of the computers that are \nsupposed to be cooperating and working together in all of the different \nintelligence agencies.\n  I am sorry to report to the Senate and to the people following this \ndebate that that does not exist today. In fact, it has been a very low \npriority. If we look at the sorry state of affairs of computers at \nagencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, we can certainly \nunderstand the need for this amendment. Currently, each of the agencies \nwe expect to consolidate has its own separate information technology \nbudget and program--the Coast Guard, Customs, FEMA, INS, Secret \nService, Transportation Security Administration, and others. Each one \nhas a unique system that does not necessarily have the capacity to \ncommunicate or coordinate these activities. Frankly, is that not what \nthis debate is all about, so that all the agencies of the Federal \nGovernment will coordinate their resources, their authority, and their \nwisdom into one unified effort to create the force multiplier that \nGovernor Ridge mentioned?\n\n  Because these divergent systems need to be linked, it is important to \nask key questions now to ensure this new Department will help the \nagencies brought together and others outside to coordinate their \ncommunication and share information. It is equally important to \nestablish appropriate links between the Homeland Security Department \nand other agencies, such as the CIA, the National Security Agency, the \nDepartment of Defense, the FBI, the State Department, and State and \nlocal officials, which may not be embraced under the Homeland Security \nDepartment's organizational umbrella.\n  Given the current state of affairs in the Federal information \ntechnology systems reflected in incomprehensible delays in meeting \ncongressional mandates, I think this is long overdue. I will give two \nillustrations of why this is timely.\n  Six years ago, Congress mandated the Customs Department and INS to \nestablish a database to record those exiting the United States with \nvisitor's visas. Those coming into the United States in many instances \nneed visas to be in the United States, and we thought we should keep \ntrack of those who are leaving so we will know the net number of visa \nholders in the United States, which can range in the tens of millions \nat any given time.\n  Six years ago, Congress said to the INS: Keep track of people leaving \nwith a visa. Six years later, it is still not done. It has not been \naccomplished. The inspector general at the Department of Justice tells \nus it is years away.\n  So when Attorney General Ashcroft said, to make America safer, we are \ngoing to take the fingerprints and photographs of all people coming \ninto the United States on a visa, I am sure people around America were \nnodding their heads saying, I guess that is necessary; it is certainly \nreasonable. Well, it is technologically impossible today to do it. We \ndo not have the computer capability to keep track of people leaving the \nUnited States with a visa, let alone the millions coming into the \nUnited States on visas.\n  So for the Attorney General to make that suggestion is to say that he \nis going to go drill for oil on the Moon. It is not going to happen--\nnot until we come a long way from where we are today.\n  We also said, incidentally, to the FBI and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service: We notice that they both collect fingerprints. \nCan they merge their databases so that law enforcement agencies across \nthe Federal Government, across the Nation, around the world, will have \naccess to a common database of fingerprints collected by the United \nStates? We asked them to do that 3 years ago. It still has not been \ndone.\n  So when it comes to information technology, do not delude yourself \ninto believing we are where we ought to be. We are not. The creation of \nthis Department and the amendment which Senator Lieberman and others \nwere happy to accept and said nice things about, I hope will move \nforward in achieving that goal.\n\n  The enterprise architecture and resulting systems must be designed \nfor interoperability between many different agencies. I hope we get \nthis achieved quickly.\n  I have had a great deal of frustration, even anger, over the lack of \nprogress we have made since September 11. To have the new person in \ncharge of information technology from the FBI testify before the \nJudiciary Committee saying it will be 2 years before the FBI is up to \nspeed with their computers is totally unacceptable. Members should not \nstand for that one second. To think one can go to any computer store in \nany major city in America and buy computers with better capability than \nthe computers of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is shameful. That \nexists today; it should change. This bill will be part of the change.\n  Also, I raise another issue briefly. After the events of September \n11, we heard from a number of people--Governor Ridge, Secretary \nThompson of the Department of Health and Human Services--about concern \nfor our Nation's food supply and its vulnerability to attack. We have \nto be mindful and sensitive. I thank Senator Lieberman for including my \nlanguage on food safety and security in this legislation, directing the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security to contract with the \nNational Academy of Sciences to conduct a detailed study to review all \nFederal statutes and regulations affecting the safety and security of \nthe food supply, as well as the current organizational structure of \nfood safety oversight to figure out if we can do it better. I think we \ncan. I believed that for a long time. I pushed for better coordination, \nbetter definition, better objectives for food safety. Now, this is a \ndifferent level. It is not a question of food that can be contaminated \nby natural causes, but food that could be jeopardized and contaminated \nby enemies of the United States. It is part of the same consideration \nbut raises it to a much higher level.\n  I close by thanking Senator Lieberman for his leadership on this \nissue. This reorganization is complicated. Although we are a great \ndeliberative body, we have to roll up our sleeves and deal with it. We \napproach the anniversary of September 11 and know further attacks are \nnot only possible, but in many instances our open society invites them. \nWe do not have the luxury of waiting. If there were another attack \nsince last September 11, this bill would have passed out of here a lot \nsooner. Now that we have the time to do it, let's do it and do it \nright.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman for his leadership, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Durbin for his \nstatement and for the contributions he made substantively to the \nproposal and for his eloquent advocacy for the urgent necessity to get \ntogether and create a Department of Homeland Security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Maine?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume from the time of Senator Thompson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the legislation before \nthe Senate that will result in the most significant reorganization of \nthe executive branch in more than 50 years. The creation of a Cabinet-\nlevel Department of Homeland Security is of fundamental importance to \nour national security. I believe it is one of the most important pieces \nof legislation we will consider during this Congress.\n  In the year since the terrorist attacks on our Nation, much has been \ndone to make our country more secure. Congress has approved billions of \ndollars to secure our borders, protect critical infrastructure, train \nand equip first responders, and better detect and respond to a \nbioterrorism attack. Our brave men and women in uniform have been \nfighting valiantly in Afghanistan and have succeeded in many of the \ngoals in the war against terrorism.\n  The creation of the Department of Homeland Security is another \nimportant step in our efforts to secure our Nation against another \nterrorist attack. This sweeping reorganization dwarfs any corporate \nmerger that you can think of. It involves some 200,000 employees and \nnearly $40 billion in budget. The task before the Senate is truly \ndaunting, and it is important we get the job done right.\n\n[[Page S8055]]\n\n  Currently, as many as 100 Federal agencies are responsible for \nhomeland security. But not one of them has homeland security as its \nprincipal mission. That is the problem with our current organizational \nstructure. With that many entities responsible, nobody is accountable \nand turf battles and bureaucratic disputes are virtually inevitable.\n  If we are to overcome these problems and create a national security \nstructure that can defend our Nation, we must unite the current \npatchwork of agencies into a single new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. This agency would work to secure our borders, help protect \nour ports, our transportation sector, and protect our critical \ninfrastructure. It would synthesize and analyze homeland security \nintelligence from multiple sources, thus lessening the possibility of \nintelligence breakdowns or lack of communication. Furthermore, the new \ndomestic security structure would coordinate Federal communications \nregarding threats and preparedness with State and local governments, as \nwell as with the private sector.\n  Our efforts to create a new Department of Homeland Security will help \nto remedy many of the current weaknesses of the past and thus help to \nprotect us against future terrorist attacks.\n  As a member of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which held \nextensive hearings on the reorganization legislation, I have had the \nopportunity to consider a multitude of ideas and concepts regarding the \ncreation of the new Department. We heard excellent testimony from \nGovernor Ridge, from the Directors of the FBI and the CIA, and from a \nhost of other experts. They all shed light on the problems that are \ncreated by our current disorganization in the area of homeland \nsecurity. They all shed light on the problems that have impaired our \nability to defend our homeland and on the threats that we now face and \ninevitably will face in the future.\n  During the committee's consideration of this bill, I expressed \nconcerns that in our effort to create a new Department, we must be \ncareful to protect the traditional missions, the very important \nmissions of the agencies that are being assembled into this giant new \ndepartment. In particular, I believe the Coast Guard's traditional \nfunctions, such as search and rescue and marine resource protection, \nmust be protected and maintained.\n  Since the tragic events of September 11, the Coast Guard's focus has \nshifted dramatically to homeland security. I talked with Coast Guard \nofficers in Portland, ME, who told me the amount of time they are now \nspending on port security operations and inspecting foreign vessels \ncoming into the harbor in Portland. I have no doubt these are very \nimportant missions and that the Coast Guard plays an essential role in \nhomeland security. And I believe it should play a leading role in the \nnew Department. However, we know the Coast Guard cannot continue to \nfocus on homeland security missions without jeopardizing its \ntraditional focus. I am concerned that if the current resource \nallocation is maintained and the Coast Guard continues to perform these \nnew homeland security responsibilities, its traditional missions will \nbe sacrificed.\n\n  The President's budget goes a long way to try to remedy this problem \nby allocating significant new funds for the Coast Guard. But we also \nneed to make sure the organizational structure in the new Department \nalso safeguards the Coast Guard's traditional mission.\n  For example, prior to September 11, port security missions accounted \nfor approximately 2 percent of the Coast Guard's resources. Immediately \nfollowing the terrorist attacks, the Coast Guard deployed 59 percent of \nits resources to port security and safety missions. As a result, many \nof the aircraft and vessels traditionally used for search and rescue \nwere far removed from their optimal locations for that function. Even \nafter the immediate impact of the September 11 attacks subsided, its \nimpact on the resources of the Coast Guard remained. Indeed, from April \nthrough June of this year, the Coast Guard devoted 9 percent fewer \nhours on search and rescue missions than it did in the year before.\n  Because of the Coast Guard's importance to coastal areas throughout \nour Nation, any reduction in its traditional functions is cause for \ngreat concern. Those of us who represent coastal States know how \nabsolutely vital the mission of the Coast Guard is. Last year alone, \nthe Coast Guard performed over 39,000 search and rescue missions and \nsaved more than 4,000 lives. On a typical day, the Coast Guard \ninterdicts and rescues 14 illegal immigrants, inspects and repairs 135 \nbuoys, helps over 2,500 commercial ships navigate in and out of U.S. \nports, and saves 10 lives. That is on a typical day. In short, the \nCoast Guard's traditional missions are of vital importance and they \nsimply must be preserved.\n  Let me take a moment to talk about the Coast Guard's impact and its \nimportance in my home State of Maine. Each year, the Coast Guard \nperforms about 300 search and rescue missions in my State. These \nmissions are literally a matter of life and death. Since October of \n1999, 14 commercial fishermen have lost their lives at sea. Commercial \nfishing is one of the most dangerous of occupations, and the Coast \nGuard every year saves fishermen who get into trouble. How many more \nwould have died or been injured if the nearest Coast Guard cutter had \nnot been in port? How many more fishermen or recreational boaters will \nlose their lives if the local Coast Guard stations must devote the vast \nmajority of their time to homeland security functions?\n  I agree that the Coast Guard must perform homeland security \nfunctions. The role the Coast Guard is playing in securing our ports is \nvitally important. But it is also vitally important that it not do so \nat the expense of its traditional missions.\n  To respond to this challenge, Senator Stevens of Alaska and I teamed \nup to offer an amendment during the Governmental Affairs Committee \nmarkup of this legislation. We offered a successful amendment to \npreserve the traditional functions of the Coast Guard, even as the \nagency is moved into the new Department of Homeland Security. I want to \nrecognize Senator Stevens and thank him for his leadership on this \nissue, as well as recognize the support of our colleagues who voted for \nour amendment in committee.\n  Our amendment establishes the right balance between homeland security \nfunctions and the traditional missions of the Coast Guard. It ensures \nthat the Coast Guard's non-homeland-security functions shall be \nmaintained after its transfer into the new Department but also provides \nfor flexibility in the event of a national emergency or an attack on \nour Nation.\n\n  The amendment also has the Commandant of the Coast Guard report \ndirectly to the Secretary. In the chairman's draft, he would not have \ndone so. Thus, his role would have been devalued or demoted. Our \namendment, the Stevens-Collins amendment, remedies that problem.\n  Our amendment will help to protect our coastal communities' \neconomies, their way of life, and their loved ones, while Americans, \nwherever they live, can rest assured that the Coast Guard will perform \nits necessary and vital homeland security functions. I believe our \nlanguage strikes the right balance.\n  As we craft this bill, it is also important that we never forget who \nis on the front lines in the event of a national emergency. We learned \non September 11 who responds. It is not the response of people in \nWashington. The people who are on the front lines are our police \nofficers, our firefighters, and our emergency medical personnel. That \nis why we need to make sure the new Department coordinates its \nactivities and supports the activities of the local first responders.\n  I thank Senator Feingold for his leadership in ensuring that the \ninterests of the first responders are ever in our mind. I worked with \nhim as well as with Senator Carper on an amendment in committee that \nstrengthens the role of first responders in homeland security, that \nrecognizes their contributions.\n  We offered an amendment to enhance the cooperation and coordination \namong State and local first responders. The new Department will be \nrequired to designate an employee to be based in each and every 1 of \nthe 50 States to be a liaison to State and local governments. I think \nthat is so important. And it recognizes that this is a joint effort.\n  Similarly, an amendment Senator Carnahan and I offered will help our\n\n[[Page S8056]]\n\ncommunity fire departments by expanding the current grant program known \nas the FIRE Program. As I am sure the Presiding Officer knows, because \nhe represents a rural State, as I do, the FIRE Program has been so \nimportant in helping a lot of our small, rural fire departments upgrade \ntheir equipment and their training.\n  The amendment the Senator from Missouri and I offered in committee \nwould expand the FIRE Program and provide fire departments with the \nability over 3 years to receive maximum grants of $100,000 to hire \npersonnel. When I talk to my fire chiefs at home, they tell me that not \nonly do they need help with equipment and training but they need more \nfirefighters.\n  For those of us who went to New York City, one of the memories I will \ncarry with me forever was talking with the fire commissioner and \nlearning how many firefighters lost their lives on September 11. I will \nnever forget his telling me that more firefighters died on that day \nthan in the previous 70 years of the New York City Fire Department. It \nis the firefighters, the police officers, the emergency medical \npersonnel who are always first on the scene. We cannot forget that \nthese brave individuals will be the first to be called upon if and when \na terrorist attack again occurs.\n  The New Department of Homeland Security is an essential component of \nour response to current and future threats. As the brutal attacks of \nSeptember 11 demonstrated, distance from our enemies and the barriers \nof oceans no longer guarantee the security of our homeland. The bill we \nare considering today is another important step in preserving and \nstrengthening our homeland security. I believe this legislation will \nhelp to make our Nation more secure, and I am hopeful that we will pass \nit quickly after due consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes from the time \ncontrolled by Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are here today for three major reasons. \nThe first is the obvious need to restructure our security to confront \nnew threats that were unanticipated in the cold war. The thought is \nthat we do need to create a Department of Homeland Security. I support \nthat. We are also here today because of the groundbreaking work of \nSenator Lieberman and colleagues on the Governmental Affairs Committee. \nBefore this proposal was invoked by the administration, they were \nworking on it. They were developing through hearings the substance to \nmake the presentation for which we are here today. But finally, we are \nhere today because of Senator Byrd's insistence that we consider this \nvery significant reorganization in the context of our Constitution and \nof our responsibility as Members of the Senate to ensure we maintain \nthe constitutional balance that is the heart of this Government.\n  It would be ironic indeed that in the name of winning the war on \nterror, we lost the very goal we were trying to protect, which is a \nconstitutional government in which all of us play a significant role--\nthe executive, the legislature, and the judiciary.\n  I think it is important, as we consider this legislation, to look \ncarefully and thoughtfully at this proposed reorganization. It is an \nextraordinary combination of governmental entities. Approximately \n170,000 employees will be combined into this new Department. It will \naffect 22 existing agencies. At least 11 full Senate committees have \noversight responsibilities for these existing agencies.\n  This is an extraordinary moment, and we have to act deliberately, \ncarefully, and thoughtfully. That is why I think it is so critical that \nthis debate take place and why it was so important that Senator Byrd \nwas able to indeed encourage and inspire and in many respects direct \nthe debate we are having today.\n  One of the major elements within this organization--there are many, \nand I would like to allude to a few--is the treatment of intelligence. \nWe understood very starkly and very tragically on September 11 that \nintelligence is probably the key to successful protection of the United \nStates, our home. We understood that. And now we have to take that \nlesson and apply it.\n  One of the proposals made by the administration is to create an \nintelligence capacity within the new Department of Homeland Security. I \nagree with that. I think this new Department has to have an \nintelligence capacity. Unfortunately, in terms of the administration's \nproposal, I think there are two clear shortcomings. First, they have \nestablished the intelligence capacity in the context of the \ninfrastructure protection responsibilities of this new Department. \nClearly, intelligence has to go beyond simply protecting our \ninfrastructure.\n  As Senator Lieberman indicated previously in some of his comments, \nthe World Trade Center and other targets were not properly considered \ncritical infrastructure in the United States. But certainly on \nSeptember 11 it was the target of terrorists. I think we have to \ndisassociate the intelligence aspects of the Department in the very \nnarrow view of infrastructure protection.\n  The amendment which Senator Lieberman will propose once we move to \nthe bill will effectively address the issue and the problems.\n  There is also another problem; that is, the administration would only \nallow this intelligence operation within the new Homeland Security \nDepartment to take data provided by other agencies and analyze it. It \ndoes not give that entity the right to reach out and get raw \nintelligence data. I think that has to be a critical responsibility and \na critical authority of this new intelligence division.\n  Again, the bill that I believe Senator Lieberman will submit at the \nconclusion of this debate will have that authority in the Homeland \nSecurity Department. That is critical.\n  The essence here is to have a place in the Government where--as said \nso often because it is so true--all the dots are connected. But you \ncan't do that and rely on the intelligence products of other agencies. \nYou can't do that if your focus is restricted to infrastructure \nprotection.\n  As a result, I think this is illustrative of some of the problems of \nthe administration's proposal, and certainly some of the problems of \nthe House bill. I should point out, as has been pointed out before, \nthat we are now debating whether the Senate will bring it up for \nconsideration.\n  There are other areas that are of concern to me. One has just been \ndiscussed quite articulately by my colleague and friend from Maine, \nSenator Collins; that is the Coast Guard. Here is an agency which, \nafter September 11, has been decisively engaged in port protection. \nPort protection by the Coast Guard has gone from a rather minor \noperation before September 11 to one of their major operations. We have \nall seen that. In my community of Providence, RI, we have the \nNarragansett Bay. We have the Port of Providence. For the first time in \nmy memory--and perhaps since World War II--we are seeing Coast Guard \ncutters escorting LNG tankers through the Narragansett Bay while the \nwhole waterway was shut down by police and the National Guard. That is \na time-consuming operation and one which has been replicated in the 361 \nports of the United States. Also adding to that is the Coast Guard's \nobligation to patrol about 95,000 miles of coastline.\n  The problem, though, is, as my colleague from Maine pointed out, that \nthe Coast Guard has many other responsibilities. She referred to a \ntypical day. On a typical day, the Coast Guard conducts 109 search and \nrescue missions, saves 10 lives, assists 92 boaters in trouble, and \nseizes 169 pounds of marijuana and 360 pounds of cocaine worth about \n$9.6 million. They intercept illegal immigrants coming into the United \nStates. They respond to calls with respect to hazardous chemical \nspills. They inspect and repair boats. They assist nearly 200,000 tons \nof shipping just in the Great Lakes during the winter season alone. \nWhat will happen to these other responsibilities?\n  I know the committee has dealt with this and has tried to strike a \nbalance. But it is an area of concern, and it is an area that \nillustrates the difficulty of combining all of these agencies with the \nmission of homeland security which might trump other legitimate \nmissions. We have to be careful with\n\n[[Page S8057]]\n\nthis. In the course of our debate and discussion, I think we have to \nfocus on this issue and other issues.\n  Much can be said in a similar vein about the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service. Here you have an agency which has two major \nresponsibilities: Protect the borders from illegal entry and at the \nsame time provide assistance to those individuals who are in the United \nStates legally who want to become citizens or who are here on some type \nof temporary protective status and need to be supervised by the United \nStates. Those are diametrically opposed responsibilities.\n  We have to ask ourselves the question: If the INS is part of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, will they emphasize one and de-\nemphasize the other? I think, frankly, most people will assume they \nwill emphasize protecting the borders of the United States. After all, \nthat is probably the most important issue with respect to homeland \nsecurity.\n  What happens to the literally millions of individuals in the United \nStates who legitimately need the services of the INS? Already today, \nthere is a backlog of approximately 5 million cases around the country \nin terms of applications to the INS for clarification of status. \nIndeed, as the National Immigration Forum noted in their words, ``it is \nhard to imagine that a Federal agency whose primary issue is to deter \nterrorism will be able to strike and maintain an appropriate balance \nbetween admitting newcomers and deterring security threats.''\n  We see that these contradictions are replete throughout the \nreorganization. I again think a careful, thorough, and complete \ndeliberation should be attendant to the consideration of this \nlegislation.\n  I would like to mention just briefly a final area, an area which I \nthink will come back again and again; that is, the administration's \nproposal--and the proposal in the House of Representatives--to put up \nsevere barriers to the right of Federal employees to organize \ncollectively and to exercise their rights; and, also, the protection \nfor the Civil Service.\n  We have to be very conscious of this and ask the very fundamental \nquestion: Why are we attempting to undercut provisions for which no \none, I think, has seriously made the case they have interfered with our \nability to conduct the war on terror, to conduct intelligence \noperations?\n  As you probably realize, President Kennedy, 40 years ago, under \nexecutive order, gave Federal employees the right to organize in \ncollective bargaining units. President Nixon expanded those rights in \n1969. In 1978, the Civil Service Reform Act codified most of these \nexecutive orders.\n  Throughout the course of our history, these responsibilities have \nalso given the President the authority to make exemptions for national \nsecurity. And they have made those exemptions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield one additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator.\n  Over the course of our history, certainly in the 40 years, since \nthese rights became established by executive order, there have always \nbeen appropriate exemptions in which the President could, for national \nsecurity reasons, exempt individual employees or groups of employees \nfrom these rights. Our Presidents have done that. As a result, we have \na situation in which I think a classic statement applies: If it is not \nbroke, why are we trying to fix it? And it is not broken.\n  Again, in my final few moments, I heard from my colleague from \nMaine--and I have heard it again and again--those firefighters \nstruggling up the stairs of the World Trade Center were union \nemployees. No one checked with their bargaining agent before going up \nthose stairs. In fact, I don't think they even checked with some of \ntheir captains and battalion commanders. They went up those upstairs \nbecause it was their job and their duty and their lives. And many of \nthem paid with their lives.\n  It is that spirit that emanates from those firefighters that \nencourages and embraces all dedicated civil servants in our Federal \nGovernment. I think to pursue this initiative is really, in a way, a \nslap at them, an insult to what they bring each and every day to their \njobs, to their tasks, to their duty.\n  So I hope we adopt provisions, which I believe the Lieberman bill \nhas, which recognize the right to organize, the right for civil service \nprotections, and also flexibility, for management, by the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time does the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina wish to have?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask the Senator, could you make it 20? Could we try for \n20 to start with?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS: I will try to start with 20.\n  Mr. BYRD. I certainly want to be considerate with this Senator, this \nvery senior Member of the body. And I am glad that he is a Member at \nthis time.\n  Let's say 20 minutes at this point. My time is limited, but let's \nstart with that and see how we come out.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, right quickly, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island was talking about the firemen running up those steps. \nIt brings to mind 4 years ago the creation of the Office of Domestic \nPreparedness by this Congress.\n  We were confronting terrorism long before 9/11. Mr. President, \n144,000 individuals have been through schools in Nevada, New Mexico, \nLouisiana, Texas, and Alabama. There are five big schools there to \ntrain the first responders. And that training has been really salutary \nin the sense that in the state of New York we have had over 17,000 \nfirst responders who were trained in the ODP program. So I say to the \nSenator, many who rushed up those steps had received the training and \nwere responding in accordance with the foreseeability that we had in \nthe congressional branch with respect to terrorism.\n  I jump right quickly, with my time limited, to the hearings that we \nhad. We hear so much about Hart-Rudman. We had hearings in the Senate, \nnot just deciding on Hart-Rudman, that large bureaucracy, but, on the \ncontrary, after 3 days of hearings in the State-Justice-Commerce \nSubcommittee of Appropriations we came down with a further beefing up \nof the Office of Domestic Preparedness. At the present time, ODP has a \nbudget of $1.2 billion. We already have at the desk, unanimously \napproved by the Appropriations Committee and ready for debate, an \nincrease of $1 billion, some $2.2 billion.\n  In short, we were on the floor of the Senate on 9/11 debating \nterrorism. I emphasize that because they go right to the point and say \nthey don't believe in domestic security.\n  We have been working on domestic security since immediately after 9/\n11. I got together--and I must tell this story because it has already \npassed me with respect to the gun crowd--but be that as it may, I sat \ndown with the El Al chief pilot from Israel who flew over from Tel Aviv \nand sat down and talked with us, myself and about four other Senators.\n  At that seating, he emphasized the security of the cockpit door \nbecause I asked him: Sir, how is it that El Al, the airline most \nsubject to be under the gun, where the terrorists do not even wait now, \nfor example, to get to a plane--they shoot up the ticket counter like \nthey did out in Los Angeles--that you have not had a hijacking in 30 \nyears?\n  He said: There is one way to prevent hijackings. Secure the cockpit \ndoor, and never open that door in flight.\n  Let me emphasize, he said: My wife can be assaulted in the cabin. I \nwould go straight to the ground, and law enforcement would meet me \nthere.\n  In flight, you do not want to give responsibility to the pilots for \nlaw and order. You give the pilots the responsibility for flying the \nplane. If they have the responsibility, with a gun, for law and order, \nthen they have made a bad mistake because the pilots cannot prevent a \nplane from being hijacked. The enemy is not a single hijacker. There \nare teams of terrorists, suicidal terrorists, who do not mind losing \ntheir lives. And, yes, you can stop one or two, maybe, but the next \nthree will take that plane over, and you will have a 9/11.\n\n[[Page S8058]]\n\n  I think our responsibility in this particular debate is--in addition \nto going up to New York on Friday, in addition to having the debate \nhere, and a whole day turned over on next Wednesday, which I commend--\nbut the main thing is for us to act and assume the responsibility that \na 9/11 never happens again.\n  Once you secure that door--Delta Airlines has gone along with it, \nJetBlue is going along with it, but we are still debating it.\n  We immediately moved for airline security. We passed it 100-0 in a \nbipartisan bill. You see in the morning paper it is not turf. This \nSenate voted to put the Transportation Security Administration in the \nJustice Department. I was not trying to hold it because I am chairman \nof the Transportation Committee. I have commerce, science, and \ntransportation. I was not trying to hold it in my committee. I voted to \nput it in Justice and defended this position on the House side arguing \nthat Justice would get it up and going.\n  Instead I got a bureaucrat who was more interested in the logo and \nhis office equipment and did not even talk to the airline managers. We \nconfirmed--the pressure was on--before Christmas.\n  We voted without the committee confirming this particular gentlemen. \nWe just reported it out and we had a vote on it without any debate \nwhatsoever. But now we are behind the curve and we have Admiral Malloy \nover there, and I think he is a great man, and I think we can do a lot \nof repairing and we are going to be realistic about what we can \naccomplish. There is no use arguing about what kind of terminal dates \nand everything else. We live in the real world and we must work \ntogether.\n  We put in rail security, we put in seaport security before Christmas \nof last year. You don't find the administration pressuring the House to \nget going to pass it. They are still fussing about fees and taxes over \nthere. They don't want to pay for it. It is domestic politics, \nreelection, not seaport security.\n  So there we are. We can go down the list of all the work we have done \non it, and here comes this bill and what does it do? It organizes every \nentity that did not fail, like the Coast Guard, FEMA, and the \nAgriculture Department and everything else, and ignores the ones that \ndid fail. 9/11 was an intelligence failure, and you will not get that \nout of the Select Committee on Intelligence that is investigating \nbetween the House and Senate because the entities of this \nadministration--I am not saying the President knew anything will not be \nembarrassed. I am sure if the President knew anything he would have put \nmeasures in place to avoid it. But I can tell you here and now that the \ncommittee that is investigating is not going to speak out about the \nintelligence failure because it would reflect, if you please, poorly on \nthe President's management of their FBI, their CIA, their National \nSecurity Agency.\n  I have been on the Intelligence Committee. In fact, I started in this \nwork in 1954 on the Hoover Commission. The same problem we had almost \n50 years ago with the FBI talking to the CIA, and the CIA talking to \nthe FBI, persists today. I have gotten together with Bob Mueller, and \nhe is a good man. He has hired some CIA officials. Last year before \nThanksgiving, we gave him $750 million to clean up his computerization. \nHe reorganized the Department and instituted a Department of Domestic \nIntelligence and now is talking, I understand, to George Tenet, the \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  The CIA failed on 9/11. We already had the blowing up of the World \nTrade Towers almost 10 years ago. But the CIA said we didn't know a \nplane could be used. They did not know a plane could be used? They had \nthe direct record in 1994.\n  In 1994, they had the Islamic group that was going to blow up the \nEiffel Tower. Then, in 1995, they were working on a case out there in \nthe Philippines where they uncovered a plan to blow up 12 planes at one \ntime. The documents revealed that the terrorists, who had links to al \nQaida, planned to ram a plane into the CIA building itself. But now \nthey say they had no idea you could fly a plane into a building. Then \nal-Qaida blew up our embassies and blew up the USS Cole. They knew.\n  Right to the point, they had warned about this crowd so much so that \nthe President actually had on his desk on September 10--the day \nbefore--a plan to attack Afghanistan. We had the intelligence. We just \nwere not paying attention. The FBI also failed. There isn't any \nquestion about that. We know about the flight schools in Arizona. Agent \nWilliams sent notice saying: There is something wrong. These people of \nMideastern descent are trying to learn how to fly. We believe they are \nconnected to fundamentalist groups, something's not right to me.\n  That word never did get up to the head of the FBI or the President of \nthe United States. That was an intelligence failure. But we had the \nwoman--Agent Coleen Rowley, I think her name was. When they arrested \nMoussaoui in Minnesota, they became so exercised she wrote a memo that: \nLook, this fellow doesn't want to learn how to take-off or land. He \nonly wants to learn how to fly. We need to investigate him further. But \nthe Minnesota field office was denied permission for a warrant.\n  Why should we investigate him further? Because he was training to run \na plane into the World Trade Towers. That is the record. I am not on \nany Intelligence Committee. I am not giving you any security \ninformation. If you want any kind of information along that line, there \nis a wonderful article that appeared in Time magazine on May 27, 2002.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Time Magazine, May 27, 2002]\n\n                     How the U.S. Missed the Clues\n\n                          (By Michael Elliott)\n\n       None of this is pretty. In the immediate aftermath of the \n     Sept. 11 attacks, members of the American political \n     establishment stood together, determined to fight the war \n     against terrorism, supporting those in military uniform and \n     the buttoned-down bureaucrats whose job it was to make sure \n     that something so awful would not happen again. Everyone--\n     inside the Bush Administration as well as outside it--knew \n     there had been massive failures of intelligence in the period \n     before the attacks. But after Sept. 11, the Administration \n     earned a reputation for steely-eyed competence, and its \n     political opponents couched their legitimate criticism in \n     language politer than that to which Washington is accustomed. \n     That was then. In the past month, a series of disclosures \n     have cast doubt on the most basic abilities of the national-\n     security establishment. The Administration has looked \n     alternately shifty and defensive; Democrats--some of them \n     presidential candidates-in-waiting--have postured on \n     motormouth TV. And the nation has been forced into a period \n     of painful second-guessing, asking whether Sept. 11 could \n     have been prevented. In August, it turns out, the President \n     was briefed by the CIA on the possibility that al-Qaeda, the \n     terrorist network headed by Osama bin Laden, might use \n     hijacked airliners to win concessions from the U.S. Sources \n     tell TIME that the briefing, which was first reported by CBS \n     News, was in response to a request by Bush for detailed \n     information on the kind of threat posed by al-Qaeda, not to \n     American interests overseas--which had long preoccupied the \n     spooks--but at home. During the period in which the brief was \n     prepared, says a senior intelligence official, the CIA came \n     to the conclusion that ``al-Qaeda was determined to attack \n     the U.S.'' After the strike came, White House sources \n     concede, the Administration made a conscious decision not to \n     disclose the August briefing, hoping that it would be \n     discussed ``in context''--and months later--when \n     congressional investigations into the attacks eventually got \n     under way. And that wasn't the only embarrassing paper kept \n     under wraps. Earlier this month, the Associated Press \n     reported new details from a July 2001 memo by an FBI agent in \n     Pheonix, Ariz., who presciently noted a pattern of Arab men \n     signing up at flight schools. The agent, Kenneth Williams, \n     42, has spent 11 years working in an FBI antiterrorism task \n     force. He recommended an investigation to determine whether \n     al-Qaeda operatives were training at the schools. He was \n     ignored, and after the existence of the memo became known, \n     the FBI insisted that even if it had been acted upon, it \n     would not have led to the detention of the Sept. 11 \n     hijackers. (Only one of them, Hani Hanjour, had trained in \n     Arizona, and did so before Williams focused on flight \n     school.) But sources tell TIME that at least one of the men \n     Williams had under watch--a Muslim who has now left the \n     U.S.--did indeed have al-Qaeda links. And Williams identified \n     a second pair of suspected Islamic radicals now living in the \n     U.S. as resident aliens, the sources say. They are currently \n     under FBI surveillance. As if those missed signals weren't \n     enough, last week it was also disclosed that in August, when \n     the U.S. detained Zacarias\n       Moussaoui--a man the French government knew was associated \n     with Islamic extremists and who apparently wanted to learn to \n     fly\n\n[[Page S8059]]\n\n     jumbo jets but not land them, and has since been charged with \n     complicity in the Sept. 11 attacks--the FBI told nobody in \n     the White House's Counterterrorism Security Group. But the \n     CSG, which comes under the aegis of National Security Adviser \n     Condoleezza Rice, is supposed to coordinate the government's \n     response to terrorist threats.\n       At high levels of government, the awful possibility is \n     dawning that things could have been different. ``If we'd had \n     access to Moussaoui, if we'd had access to the Phoenix memo, \n     could we have broken up the plot?'' asks a White House \n     official who works on counterterrorism. Then he answers his \n     own question: ``We would have taken action, and there's at \n     least a distinct possibility that we may at the very least \n     have delayed it.'' Bush was outraged at the suggestion that \n     he might have been warned about impending strikes and failed \n     to act. To ward off Democratic criticism, Vice President Dick \n     Cheney warned against trying to ``seek political advantage'' \n     from the new revelations; such commentary, he said, ``is \n     thoroughly irresponsible and totally unworthy of national \n     leaders in a time of war.'' He should have saved his breath; \n     the blame game is under way, long before the lessons of all \n     that happened last summer have been absorbed. And one thing \n     we now know: there plenty of blame to go around.\n       George W. Bush, they say, is a quick study, and last summer \n     he needed to be. Threats and warnings of possible terrorist \n     outrages against American interests were howling into \n     Washington like a dirty blizzard. Fighting terrorism hadn't \n     been a top priority in the early months of the \n     Administration; cutting taxes, building a missile shield and \n     other agenda had crowded it out. Bush's national-security \n     aides had been warned during the transition that there was an \n     al-Qaeda presence in the U.S., but in the first months of the \n     Administration, says one official, a sense of urgency was \n     lacking: ``They were new to this stuff.''\n       By the time Bush left for a month's vacation on his ranch \n     in Crawford, Texas, on Aug. 4, that mood had changed. Where \n     the President goes, the responsibilities of office follow, \n     and so, each morning, Bush sat in the ranch office and \n     received the CIA's Presidential Daily Brief. The bried--or \n     PDB, in Langley-speak--is the CIA's chance to mainline its \n     priorities into the President's thinking. Each day, the PDB \n     is winnowed to a few pages; when the President is in \n     Washington, one of two ``briefers''--agency up-and-comers who \n     flesh out the written text--gets to work at 2 a.m. to bone up \n     on background material. The brief itself is delivered at 8 \n     a.m. in front of the President's national-security team. \n     (Sometimes CIA Director George Tenet delivers it himself.) \n     One briefer had moved to Texas for the vacation, and the PDB \n     was transmitted to Crawford over a secure system. At the \n     briefing on Monday, Aug. 6--a day when the Texas heat would \n     reach 100 [degrees]--Bush received a 1\\1/2\\-page document, \n     which, according to Rice, was an ``analytic report'' on al-\n     Qaeda. Included was a mention that al-Qaeda might be tempted \n     to hijack airliners, perhaps so that they might use hostages \n     to secure the release of an al-Qaeda leader or sympathizer. \n     Rice was not present but discussed the briefing with Bush \n     immediately after it had ended, as she always does.\n       They had mush to talk about. Throughout the summer, top \n     officials had become convinced, with a growing sense of \n     foreboding, that a major operation by al-Qaeda was in the \n     works. For many in the loop, it seemed likely that any attack \n     would be aimed at Americans overseas. But sources tell TIME \n     that the Aug. 6 briefing had a very different focus; it was \n     explicitly concerned with terrorism in the homeland. The Aug. \n     6 briefing had been put together, says one official, because \n     the President had told Tenet, ``Give me a sense of what al-\n     Qaeda can do inside the U.S.'' At a press conference last \n     week, Rice said the brief concentrated on the history and \n     methods of al-Qaeda. Since much of the material in it was a \n     rehash of intelligence dating to 1997 and '98, it is doubtful \n     that it was much use in answering Bush's question.\n       According to Rice, there was just a sentence or two on \n     hijacking--and the passage did not address the possibility \n     that a hijacked plane would ever be flown into a building. \n     That was the first of four crucial mistakes made last summer. \n     Administration officials insisted all last week that turning \n     a plane into a suicide bomb was something that nobody had \n     contemplated. But that just isn't so. In 1995, authorities in \n     the Philippines scuppered a plan--masterminded by Ramzi \n     Yousef, who had also plotted the 1993 World Trade Center \n     bombing--for mass hijackings of American planes over the \n     Pacific. Evidence developed during the investigation of \n     Yousef and his partner, Abdul Hakim Murad, uncovered a plan \n     to crash a plane into CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. And as \n     long ago as 1994, in an incident that is well known among \n     terrorism experts, French authorities foiled a plot by the \n     Algerian Armed Islamic Group to fly an airliner into the \n     Eiffel Tower. ``Since 1994,'' says a French investigator into \n     al-Qaeda cases, ``we should all have been viewing kamikaze \n     acts as a possibility for all terrorist hijackings.'' But if \n     Rice's account is accurate, nobody significant in the Bush \n     Administration did.\n       There might have been more discussion of the risks of \n     hijackings in the President's briefing if its writers had \n     known about the Phoenix memo. But they hadn't seen it, nor \n     had anyone in the CIA or the White House. Yet Senator Richard \n     Shelby, the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee, calls the memo, which is said to contain detailed \n     descriptions of named suspects, ``one of the most explosive \n     documents I've seen in eight years.'' The memo, on which the \n     Senate Intelligence Committee was briefed last November, has \n     now become the focus of a huge political row in Washington. \n     Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee--including \n     Republican Arlen Specter, who had an angry exchange over the \n     memo with FBI Director Robert Mueller on Saturday--are \n     desperate to see it, and may yet subpoena it. ``The fact that \n     the Phoenix memo died on Somebody's desk takes your breath \n     away,'' says Senator Richard Durbin, a Democratic committee \n     member from Illinois. ``They just shuffled it off.''\n       Agent Williams wrote the memo on July 5, detailing his \n     suspicions about some Arabs he had been watching, who he \n     thought were Islamic radicals. Several of the men had \n     enrolled at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, \n     Ariz. Williams posited that bin Laden's followers might be \n     trying to infiltrate the civil-aviation system as pilots, \n     security guards or other personnel, and he recommended a \n     national program to track suspicious flight-school students. \n     The memo was sent to the counterterrorism division at FBI \n     headquarters in Washington and to two field offices, \n     including the counterterrorism section in New York, which has \n     had long experience in al-Qaeda investigations.\n       That experience counted for nothing. In all three offices, \n     the memo was pretty much ignored, disappearing into the black \n     hole of bureaucratic hell that is the FBI. That was the \n     second key mistake. Sources tell TIME that the memo was never \n     forwarded--not even to the level of Mike Rolince, chief of \n     the international-terrorism section. ``The thing fell into \n     the laps of people who were grossly overtaxed,'' says a \n     senior FBI official. The G-men claim to have been swamped by \n     tips about coming al-Qaeda operations. But Williams was onto \n     something. The flight students he was tracking were \n     supporters of radical Islamic groups. Some of them, sources \n     say, are believed to be connected to Hamas and Hizballah, \n     terrorist organizations based in the Middle East, while at \n     least one other--who has left the U.S.--had links to al-\n     Qaeda. Another pair mentioned in the memo, neither of whom \n     attended flight school, are the ones under FBI surveillance--\n     which, sources say, is the reason Mueller won't make the memo \n     public.\n       However fevered the analysis of the Williams memo is now, \n     it didn't get much attention when it was written. Last July, \n     FBI headquarters wasn't concentrating on an attack within the \n     U.S. ``Nobody was looking domestically,'' says a recently \n     retired FBI official. ``We didn't think they had the people \n     to mount an operation here.''\n       That was the third huge mistake--and a somewhat baffling \n     conclusion to draw, given the evidence at hand. In spring of \n     2001, Ahmed Ressam, the ``millennium bomber,'' was on trial \n     in Los Angeles, charged with being part of a plot to bomb Los \n     Angeles International Airport and other locations at the end \n     of 1999. In her press conference last week, Rice conceded \n     that in 2001 the FBI ``was involved in a number of \n     investigations of potential al-Qaeda personnel operating in \n     the United States.''\n       But investigators had some reasons for being preoccupied \n     with attacks and threats outside the U.S. Al-Qaeda's most \n     notorious blows against American interests had taken place in \n     Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the sites of the 1998 embassy \n     bombings, and in Yemen, where the U.S.S. Cole was bombed in \n     October 2002. And in the first half of last year, the CSG \n     monitored information suggesting the likelihood of another \n     attack overseas. In June 2001, the State Department issued a \n     worldwide caution warning American citizens of possible \n     attacks. That month, says a recently retired senior FBI \n     official, ``we were constantly worried that something was \n     going to happen. Our best guesstimate was something in \n     Southeast Asia.'' A French investigator involved in al-Qaeda \n     cases confirms the thought. ``The prevailing logic from \n     around 1998,'' he says, ``was that al-Qaeda and bin Laden had \n     very openly designated America as its prime target--but it \n     was a target that it preferred to attack outside the U.S.''\n       By July the level of noise about terrorism from \n     intelligence sources around the world was deafening. The CSG, \n     then chaired by Richard Clarke, a Clinton Administration \n     holdover who was consumed with terrorist threats to the point \n     of obsession, was meeting almost every day. A specific threat \n     was received on the life of Bush, who was due to visit Genoa, \n     Italy, for a G-8 summit that month. Roland Jacquard, a \n     leading French expert on terrorism, says that when Russian \n     and Western intelligence agencies compared notes before the \n     summit, they were stunned to find they all had information \n     indicating that a strike was in the offing. When the Genoa \n     summit passed without incident, says a French official, \n     attention turned to the possibility of attacks on U.S. bases \n     in Belgium and Turkey. Then, at the end of July, Djamel \n     Beghal, a Franco-Algerian al-Qaeda associate, was picked up \n     in Dubai on his way from Afghanistan back to Europe. Beghal \n     started talking and implicated a network of al-Qaeda \n     operatives in Europe, who, he said, were planning to blow up \n     the American embassy in Paris. (Beghal, who has since been \n     extradited to France, has said his confession was coerced.) \n     ``We shared everything we knew with the Americans,'' says a \n     French justice official.\n\n[[Page S8060]]\n\n       They may have shared too much. At least in France, \n     investigators now acknowledge that Al-Qaeda may have been \n     involved in a massive feint to Europe while the real attack \n     was always planned for the U.S. ``People were convinced that \n     Europe remained the theater for Islamic terrorists,'' says \n     Jacquard. ``It's anyone's guess whether that was a technique \n     to get people looking in the wrong place. But that's what \n     happened.''\n       By the beginning of August, the President had made his \n     request for a briefing on domestic threats. One of them was \n     about to be uncovered. And therein lay the fourth mistake. On \n     Aug. 16, Moussaoui was arrested in Minnesota for an \n     immigration violation, just a day after the staff at the \n     flight school where he was training told the FBI of their \n     suspicions about him. The Minnesotans weren't alone; when \n     American officials checked with their French counterparts, \n     they discovered that Moussaoui had long been suspected of \n     mixing in extremist circles. (The Zelig of modern terrorism, \n     Moussaoui has been associated with al-Qaeda networks \n     everywhere from London to Malaysia.) The FBI started urgently \n     investigating Moussaoui's past; agents in Minneapolis sought \n     a national-security warrant to search his computer files but \n     were turned down by lawyers at FBI headquarters who said they \n     didn't have sufficient evidence that he belonged to a \n     terrorist group. Immediately after Moussaoui's arrest, agents \n     twice visited the Airman Flight School in Norman, Okla., \n     where he had studied before heading to Minnesota; two of the \n     Sept. 11 hijackers had visited Norman in July 2000. The \n     FBI did inform the CIA of Moussaoui's arrest, and the CIA \n     ran checks on him while asking foreign intelligence \n     services for information. But neither the FBI nor the CIA \n     ever informed the counterterrorism group in the White \n     House. ``Do you think,'' says a White House antiterrorism \n     official, ``that if Dick Clarke had known that the FBI had \n     in custody a foreigner who couldn't speak English, who was \n     trying to fly a plane in midair, he wouldn't have done \n     something?''\n       Since at least two of the four failures--those involving \n     Moussaoui and the Phoenix memo--can be laid at the door of \n     the FBI, the bureau is feeling the heat. ``The FBI has a long \n     pattern of not sharing information with others,'' says a \n     former Clinton Administration official. ``Now it's not even \n     sharing the information with itself.'' Mueller, who knew \n     about the Phoenix memo shortly after Sept. 11, plainly did \n     not anticipate the criticism it would engender. Since it \n     became public, officials have defensively pointed out that if \n     the bureau had tried to track down all Muslim flight-school \n     attendees, it would have been accused of racial profiling. \n     White House officials defend Mueller; he is ``tenacious about \n     changing things,'' says one, who admits, ``You can't change a \n     culture that's 60 years in the making overnight.'' But on \n     Capitol Hill the bureau is running out of friends. ``I have \n     no doubt that the FBI needs reform,'' said Senate Republican \n     leader Trent Lott last week.\n       Yet when the blame gets assigned, as it will now that a \n     joint congressional investigation into Sept. 11 is getting \n     down to work, the FBI won't monopolize it. The ugly truth is \n     that nine months after huge weaknesses in the national \n     security system were revealed, they remain unaddressed. In \n     Washington, says a senior Clinton Administration official, \n     ``information just moves through stovepipes,'' never getting \n     pooled by different agencies until it is too late. The \n     intelligence services were built to fight the cold war, not \n     an enemy that flits from Afghan caves to apartments in \n     London. The division between domestic and international \n     security made sense when the former was concerned with what \n     criminals did and the latter with foreign countries. But some \n     criminals are now as powerful as countries, and some \n     countries are run by criminals.\n       Nine months ago, the appointment of Tom Ridge as Homeland \n     Security czar was billed as the shake-up Washington needed. \n     So far, he has been more of a mild foot stamp than an \n     earthquake. Instead of real reform, the Administration has \n     resorted to its usual mode: attempting to control warring \n     satrapies from the White House. The remarkable aspect of last \n     week's events in Washington was the unintended revelation \n     that Rice is the true manager of counterterrorism policy. In \n     the past, the National Security Council got into trouble when \n     it adopted an operational role rather than one of analysis \n     (think Oliver North), and for Bush this identification of one \n     of his closest advisers with the operational failures of \n     counterterrorism policy could yet be politically troubling.\n       Among his supporters, however, the President still rides \n     high. Bush's simple, passionate argument--that he would never \n     have sat idly if he had known what was coming on Sept. 11--\n     helped stiffen spines. Republicans pointed out that members \n     of congressional intelligence committees get the same \n     information the President receives in his PDB and yet had not \n     made a fuss about the Aug. 6 briefing. That claim was \n     disputed; Tom Daschle, the Democrat's leader in the Senate, \n     insisted the Senate and the Administration did not have \n     ``identical information'' about al-Qaeda threats.\n       In a sense, the spat over who got what version of which \n     memo epitomizes Washington at its worst. The capital at its \n     best would appreciate that the most important question isn't \n     what Bush (or anyone else) knew before Sept. 11; it is what \n     the Administration and Congress have and have not done to fix \n     a broken system. But November and the midterm elections, you \n     may have noticed, are only six months away. Washington is \n     reverting to form.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Time magazine got into it very thoroughly--much more so \nthan the committee that has been leaking. I was disappointed Sunday \nwhen I heard my distinguished colleague from Tennessee say: No, he \nwould not take a polygraph test.\n  I am an old trial lawyer. You are not going to convict my client on a \npolygraph test. We used it in the Hoover Commission 50 years ago, and \nit is an indicator. I wanted to make sure the staff on the Intelligence \nCommittee--as I found out, I had been doubledealed by the CIA and was \ntold: I cannot give you that information, Senator, because your staff \ndoes not have the appropriate clearance.\n  Before you serve here as a Capitol policeman, you have to take a \npolygraph, and also before you serve in the FBI, CIA, and Secret \nService--go down the list--but not the staff of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  So I learned that in a war you never ask your man to do something you \ndo not do yourself first. So I went over to take a polygraph test. To \nthe very first question, I started off my answer ``in my humble \nopinion'' and the needle went right off the chart. I flunked. It took 2 \nhours and they gave me a chance again, and after that 2-hour test, I \npassed it and came back and I still brought it up that as a member of \nthe Intelligence Committee, they do not have the appropriate clearance. \nIf they want to know where the leaks are, go to the committees.\n  Mr. President, the National Security Agency failed. They had all \nkinds of warnings about al-Qaida. They had Arabic friends over there. \nThey got the word on September 10 in Arabic that ``the match is about \nto begin,'' but they didn't translate the Arabic into English until \nSeptember 12.\n  Now comes the National Security Council. It is interesting that in \n1947 we had the same problem of coordination--instituting not only the \nCIA, but the 1947 National Security Council that the function of the \nCouncil shall be to advise the President with respect to the \nintegration--that is joining--of domestic, foreign, and military \npolicies relating to the national security, so as to enable the \nmilitary services and the other Departments and Agencies of Government \nto cooperate more effectively in matters involving national security.\n  If you don't have a President right at the catbird seat pointing to \nthem and saying you either talk and coordinate with each other or else \nyou are out, it is not going to be done. You can pass all the bills you \nwant in the U.S. Congress. You are just passing another entity for \nfinger-pointing. They need correlation again and again.\n  Here is exactly what the President said in the National Security \nPresidential directive he made. I had a copy of it here. It is with \nrespect to ordering the bush National Security Council. Incidentally, \nwhat I am saying I had said to him at the Cabinet table over 2 months \nago. But on February 13--I ask unanimous consent that this National \nSecurity Presidential directive of February 13, 2001, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  National Security Presidential Directives--NSPDs, the White House, \n                     Washington, February 13, 2001\n\n\n                             Memorandum for\n\n     The Vice President\n     The Secretary of State\n     The Secretary of the Treasury\n     The Secretary of Defense\n     The Attorney General\n     The Secretary of Agriculture\n     The Secretary of Commerce\n     The Secretary of Health and Human Services\n     The Secretary of Transportation\n     The Secretary of Energy\n     Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency\n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget\n     United States Trade Representative\n     Chairman, Council of Economic Advisers\n     Director, National Drug Control Policy\n     Chief of Staff to the President\n     Director of Central Intelligence\n     Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency\n     Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs\n     Assistant to the President for Economic Policy\n     Counsel to the President\n     Chief of Staff and Assistant to the Vice President for \n         National Security Affairs\n\n[[Page S8061]]\n\n     Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy\n     Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\n     Chairman, Council on Environmental Quality\n     Chairman, Export-Import Bank\n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\n     Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard\n     Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n     Chairman, Nuclear Regulatory Commission\n     Director, Peace Corps\n     Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation\n     Director, Defense Intelligence Agency\n     President, Overseas Private Investment Corporation\n     Chairman, Federal Communications Commission\n     Commissioner, U.S. Customs Service\n     Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration\n     President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board\n     Archivist of the United States\n     Director, Information Security Oversight Office\n     Subject: Organization of the National Security Council System\n       This document is the first in a series of National Security \n     Presidential Directives. National Security Presidential \n     Directives shall replace both Presidential Decision \n     Directives and Presidential Review Directives as an \n     instrument for communicating presidential decisions about the \n     national security policies of the United States.\n       National security includes the defense of the United States \n     of America, protection of our constitutional system of \n     government, and the advancement of United States interest \n     around the globe. National security also depends on America's \n     opportunity to prosper in the world economy. The National \n     Security Act of 1947, as amended, established the National \n     Security Council to advise the President with respect to the \n     integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies \n     relating to national security. That remains its purpose. The \n     NSC shall advise and assist me in integrating all aspects of \n     national security policy as it affects the United States--\n     domestic, foreign, military, intelligence, and economics (in \n     conjunction with the National Economic Council (NEC)). The \n     National Security Council system is a process to coordinate \n     executive departments and agencies in the effective \n     development and implementation of those national security \n     policies.\n       The National Security Council (NSC) shall have as its \n     regular attendees (both statutory and non-statutory) the \n     President, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, and the \n     Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. The \n     Director of Central Intelligence and the Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff, as statutory advisors to the NSC, \n     shall also attend NSC meetings. The Chief of Staff to the \n     President and the Assistant to the President for Economic \n     Policy are invited to attend any NSC meeting. The Counsel to \n     the President shall be consulted regarding the agenda of NSC \n     meetings, and shall attend any meetings when, in consultation \n     with the Assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs, he deems it appropriate. The Attorney General and \n     the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall be \n     invited to attend meetings pertaining to their \n     responsibilities. For the Attorney General, this includes \n     both those matters within the Justice Department's \n     jurisdiction and those matters implicating the Attorney \n     General's responsibility under 28 U.S.C. 511 to give his \n     advice and opinion on questions of law when required by the \n     President. The heads of other executive departments and \n     agencies, as well as other senior officials, shall be invited \n     to attend meetings of the NSC when appropriate.\n       The NSC shall meet at my direction. When I am absent from a \n     meeting of the NSC, at my direction the Vice President may \n     preside. The Assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs shall be responsible, at my direction and in \n     consultation with the other regular attendees of the NSC, for \n     determining the agenda, ensuring that necessary papers are \n     prepared, and recording NSC actions and Presidential \n     decisions. When international economic issues are on the \n     agenda of the NSC, the Assistant to the President for Nation \n     Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for \n     Economic Policy shall perform these tasks in concert.\n       The NSC Principals Committee (NSC/PC) will continue to be \n     the senior interagency forum for consideration of policy \n     issues affecting national security, as it has since 1989. The \n     NSC/PC shall have as its regular attendees the Secretary of \n     State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of \n     Defense, the Chief of Staff to the President, and the \n     Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (who \n     shall serve as chair). The Director of Central Intelligence \n     and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall attend \n     where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and \n     expertise are to be discussed. The Attorney General and \n     the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall \n     be invited to attend meetings pertaining to their \n     responsibilities. For the Attorney General, this includes \n     both those matters within the Justice Department's \n     jurisdiction and those matters implicating the Attorney \n     General's responsibility under 28 U.S.C. 511 to give his \n     advice and opinion on questions of law when required by \n     the President. The Counsel to the President shall be \n     consulted regarding the agenda of NSC/PC meetings, and \n     shall attend any meeting when, in consultation with the \n     Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, \n     he deems it appropriate. When international economic \n     issues are on the agenda of the NSC/PC, the Committee's \n     regular attendees will include the Secretary of Commerce, \n     the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to \n     the President for Economic Policy (who shall serve as \n     chair for agenda items that principally pertain to \n     international economics), and, when the issues pertain to \n     her responsibilities, the Secretary of Agriculture. The \n     Chief of Staff and National Security Adviser to the Vice \n     President shall attend all meetings of the NSC/PC, as \n     shall the Assistant to the President and Deputy National \n     Security Advisor (who shall serve as Executive Secretary \n     of the NSC/PC). Other heads of departments and agencies, \n     along with additional senior officials, shall be invited \n     where appropriate.\n       The NSC/PC shall meet at the call of the Assistant to the \n     President for National Security Affairs in consultation with \n     the regular attendees of the NSC/PC. The Assistant to the \n     President for National Security Affairs shall determine the \n     agenda in consultation with the foregoing, and ensure that \n     necessary papers are prepared. When international economic \n     issues are on the agenda of the NSC/PC, the Assistant to the \n     President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to \n     the President for Economic Policy shall perform these tasks \n     in concert.\n       The NSC Deputies Committee (NSC/DC) will also continue to \n     serve as the senior sub-Cabinet interagency forum for \n     consideration of policy issues affecting national security. \n     The NSC/DC can prescribe and review the work of the NSC \n     interagency groups discussed later in this directive. The \n     NSC/DC shall also help ensure that issues being brought \n     before the NSC/PC or the NSC have been properly analyzed and \n     prepared for decision. The NSC/DC shall have as its regular \n     members the Deputy Secretary of State or Under Secretary of \n     the Treasury or Under Secretary of the Treasury for \n     International Affairs, the Deputy Secretary of Defense or \n     Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the Deputy Attorney \n     General, the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget, the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, the Vice \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Deputy Chief of \n     Staff to the President for Policy, the Chief of Staff and \n     National Security Adviser to the Vice President, the Deputy \n     Assistant to the President for International Economic \n     Affairs, and the Assistant to the President and Deputy \n     National Security Advisor (who shall serve as chair). When \n     international economic issues are on the agenda, the NSC/DC's \n     regular membership will include the Deputy Secretary of \n     Commerce, A Deputy United States Trade Representative, and, \n     when the issues pertain to his responsibilities, the Deputy \n     Secretary of Agriculture, and the NSC/DC shall be chaired by \n     the Deputy Assistant to the President for International \n     Economic Affairs for agenda items that principally pertain to \n     international economics. Other senior officials shall be \n     invited where appropriate.\n       The NSC/DC shall meet at the call of its chair, in \n     consultation with the other regular members of the NSC/DC. \n     Any regular member of the NSC/DC may also request a meeting \n     of the Committee for prompt crisis management. For all \n     meetings the chair shall determine the agenda in consultation \n     with the foregoing, and ensure that necessary papers are \n     prepared.\n       The Vice President and I may attend any and all meetings of \n     any entity established by or under this directive.\n       Management of the development and implementation of \n     national security policies by multiple agencies of the United \n     States Government shall usually be accomplished by the NSC \n     Policy Coordination Committees (NSC/PCCs). The NSC/PCCs shall \n     be the main day-to-day fora for interagency coordination of \n     national security policy. They shall provide policy analysis \n     for consideration by the more senior committees of the NSC \n     system and ensure timely responses to decisions made by the \n     President. Each NSC/PCC shall include representatives from \n     the executive departments, offices, and agencies represented \n     in the NSC/DC.\n       Six NSC/PCCs are hereby established for the following \n     regions: Europe and Eurasia, Western Hemisphere, East Asia, \n     South Asia, Near East and North Africa, and Africa. Each of \n     the NSC/PCCs shall be chaired by an official of Under \n     Secretary or Assistant Secretary rank to be designated by the \n     Secretary of State.\n       Eleven NSC/PCCs are hereby also established for the \n     following functional topics, each to be chaired by a person \n     of Under Secretary or Assistant Secretary rank designated by \n     the indicated authority:\n       Democracy, Human Rights, and International Operations (by \n     the Assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs);\n       International Development and Humanitarian Assistance (by \n     the Secretary of State);\n       Global Environment (by the Assistant to the President for \n     National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President \n     for Economic Policy in concert);\n       International Finance (by the Secretary of the Treasury);\n       Transnational Economic Issues (by the Assistant to the \n     President for Economic Policy);\n       Counter-Terrorism and National Preparedness (by the \n     Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs);\n\n[[Page S8062]]\n\n       Defense Strategy, Force Structure, and Planning (by the \n     Secretary of Defense);\n       Arms Control (by the Assistant to the President for \n     National Security Affairs);\n       Proliferation, Counterproliferation, and Homeland Defense \n     (by the Assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs);\n       Intelligence and Counterintelligence (by the Assistant to \n     the President for National Security Affairs); and\n       Records Access and Information Security (by the Assistant \n     to the President for National Security Affairs).\n       The Trade Policy Review Group (TPRG) will continue to \n     function as an interagency coordinator of trade policy. \n     Issues considered within the TPRG, as with the PCCs, will \n     flow through the NSC and/or NEC process as appropriate.\n       Each NSC/PCC shall also have an Executive Secretary from \n     the staff of the NSC, to be designated by the Assistant to \n     the President for National Security Affairs. The Executive \n     Secretary shall assist the Chairman in scheduling the \n     meetings of the NSC/PCC, determining the agenda, recording \n     the actions taken and tasks assigned, and ensuring timely \n     responses to the central policymaking committees of the NSC \n     system. The Chairman of each NSC/PCC, in consultation with \n     the Executive Secretary, may invite representatives of other \n     executive departments and agencies to attend meetings of the \n     NSC/PCC where appropriate.\n       The Assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs, at my direction and in consultation with the Vice \n     President and the Secretaries of State, Treasury, and \n     Defense, may establish additional NSC/PCCs as appropriate.\n       The Chairman of each NSC/PCC, with the agreements of the \n     Executive Secretary, may establish subordinate working groups \n     to assist the PCC in the performance of its duties.\n       The existing system of Interagency Working Groups is \n     abolished.\n       The oversight of ongoing operations assigned in PDD/NSC-56 \n     to Executive Committees of the Deputies Committee will be \n     performed by the appropriate regional NSC/PCCs, which may \n     create subordinate working groups to provide coordination for \n     ongoing operations.\n       The Counter-Terrorism Security Group, Critical \n     Infrastructure Coordination Group, Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction Preparedness, Consequences Management and \n     Protection Group, and the interagency working group on \n     Enduring Constitutional Government are reconstituted as \n     various forms of NSC/PCC on Counter-Terrorism and National \n     Preparedness.\n       The duties assigned in PDD/NSC-75 to the National \n     Counterintelligence Policy Group will be performed in the \n     NSC/PCC on Intelligence and Counterintelligence, meeting with \n     appropriate attendees.\n       The duties assigned to the Security Policy Board and other \n     entities established in PDD/NSC-29 will be transferred to \n     various NSC/PCCs, depending on the particular security \n     problem being addressed.\n       The duties assigned in PDD/NSC-41 to the Standing Committee \n     on Nonproliferation will be transferred to the PCC on \n     Proliferation, Counterproliferation, and Homeland Defense.\n       The duties assigned in PDD/NSC-36 to the Interagency \n     Working Group for Intelligence Priorities will be transferred \n     to the PCC on Intelligence and Counterintelligence.\n       The duties of the Human Rights Treaties Interagency Working \n     Group established in E.O. 13107 are transferred to the PCC on \n     Democracy, Human Rights, and International Operations.\n       The Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group \n     established in E.O. 13110 shall be reconstituted, under the \n     terms of that order and until its work ends in January \n     2002, as a Working Group of the NSC/PCC for Records Access \n     and Information Security.\n       Except for those established by statute, other existing NSC \n     interagency groups, ad hoc bodies, and executive committees \n     are also abolished as of March 1, 2001, unless they are \n     specifically reestablished as subordinate working groups \n     within the new NSC system as of that date. Cabinet officers, \n     the heads of other executive agencies, and the directors of \n     offices within the Executive Office of the President shall \n     advise the Assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs of those specific NSC interagency groups chaired by \n     their respective departments or agencies that are either \n     mandated by statute or are otherwise of sufficient importance \n     and vitality as to warrant being reestablished. In each case \n     the Cabinet officer, agency head, or office director should \n     describe the scope of the activities proposed for or now \n     carried out by the interagency group, the relevant statutory \n     mandate if any, and the particular NSC/PCC that should \n     coordinate this work. The Trade Promotion Coordinating \n     Committee established in E.O. 12870 shall continue its work, \n     however, in the manner specified in that order. As to those \n     committees expressly established in the National Security \n     Act, the NSC/PC and/or NSC/DC shall serve as those committees \n     and perform the functions assigned to those committees by the \n     Act.\n       To further clarify responsibilities and effective \n     accountability within the NSC system, those positions \n     relating to foreign policy that are designated as special \n     presidential emissaries, special envoys for the President, \n     senior advisors to the President and the Secretary of State, \n     and special advisors to the President and the Secretary of \n     State are also abolished as of March 1, 2001, unless they are \n     specifically redesignated or reestablished by the Secretary \n     of State as positions in that Department.\n       This Directive shall supersede all other existing \n     presidential guidance on the organization of the National \n     Security Council system. With regard to application of this \n     document to economic matters, this document shall be \n     interpreted in concert with any Executive Order governing the \n     National Economic Council and with presidential decision \n     documents signed hereafter that implement either this \n     directive or that Executive Order.\n\n     [signed: George W. Bush]\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You will find in there that 11 functional coordinating \ncommittees within the council itself, chaired by the National Security \nCouncil. Among them are committees on counterterrorism and national \npreparedness, chaired by Condoleezza Rice, to Advisor to the President \nfor National Security Affairs. You have another committee on \ncounterproliferation and homeland defense, which the President of the \nUnited States thought was necessary in February of last year, chaired \nby Condoleezza Rice. There is another one on intelligence and \ncounterintelligence, again chaired by Condoleezza Rice.\n  Later we see President's National Security Advisor on the TV saying: \nWe did not get anything specific. In fairness to her, she is an expert \nin foreign policy. She used to instruct a course, I understand, at \nStanford. She has never served in law enforcement or counterterrorism. \nBut it is time to get real. This bill does not directly deal with the \nentities that failed. It is about running around, like my Navy friend \nused to say, ``when in danger, when in doubt, run in circles scream and \nshout.''\n  The administration propose this big bureaucracy. I have 110,000 of \nthem already at DOT. I have been working on transportation security of \nthe airlines, the rails, and the seaports. How are you going to get a \ndepartment full of midlevel personnel in charge if you cannot get the \nExecutive level, the Presidential level, engaged in active management. \nI told the President of the United States: Mr. President, I want you to \nget hourly reports on the homeland security intelligence as you receive \nthose hourly political reports from Carl Rove. He knows what is going \non politically in this country. I want him to know what is going on \nintelligence-wise with respect to homeland security, but we do not have \nthat.\n  What we have is another finger-pointing agency. As Harry Truman said: \nThe buck stops here. He is the one who brought in the 1947 initiative \nto reorganize for national security. He did not mind assuming that \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. President, do you think if you were President that you would \ndepend on the Department of Homeland Security for your intelligence \nanalysis? No, no, that is not going to ever happen. One, that \nDepartment is only going to be fed what the President says to feed \nthem. The FBI is not going to tell them everything. The CIA is not \ngoing to tell them everything. It is a culture. We have to break down \nthat culture, but the only place we know they are not afraid to tell is \nthe National Security Council of the President of the United States.\n\n  The Secretary of the Homeland Defense Department would not even know \nwhat to ask for. They do not have any kind of intelligence collection. \nThey do not have the authority or resources to do that. They would \ncreate another analysis department, but it will not function properly \nunless it is fused. There has to be a fusion, an integration, as they \nsaid in 1947, of domestic and foreign intelligence so they know where \nto act. We have read in the newspapers where they are getting their \nmoney for terrorism, outfitting Canada and so on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  My time is limited, so I will close with the idea that, we can pass \nthis bill ipso facto, word for word--either bill--this afternoon, and 4 \nor 5 years from now after they have had a chance to organize, we can \nhave another 9-11. We are not going to prevent it with this particular \nmeasure.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 additional minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is all right, Mr. President. I will yield the time \nback and come back in on the debate. This is\n\n[[Page S8063]]\n\nonly a motion to proceed. I work with them. I can tell you the \nresistance of the FBI talking to the CIA--that is not in this bill--but \nwe have to have a President get them together and make sure information \nis fused. There is a resistance. We have had meetings on port security. \nI cannot get the FBI to attend those meetings. I am going to get on Bob \nMueller about that because I have his appropriation, but they do not \nwant to get together. They are looking for crime. They are not looking \nfor prevention. They want to catch somebody. When crimes are committed \nthey are called into action. While we hope crimes are never committed, \nthe FBI serves the nation by responding when crimes are committed. We \nmust work to prevent terrorist attacks. That is the new culture, the \nnew role to be taken on.\n  The President has to play the game of President, be the chief \nexecutive. Mr. President, I say to Senator Byrd, in his mind, does he \nthink he would depend on the Department of Domestic Security for making \na decision? He is not going to depend on that Department or any other, \nexcept for the National Security Council.\n  There is no substitute for the CIA being on the Council or for the \nFBI being on the Council, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of \nHomeland Security. Put him on the National Security Council. Let's \nbegin to emphasize the domestic side of foreign policy and \ninternational threats.\n  That is what has to be done, and it has to be done at the White \nHouse. You cannot run all over the country fundraising; you have to go \nto work. That is one fault with this particular President. I cannot put \nhim to work. I see him out with flags, military people, policemen, \nfiremen, and others. Carl Rove has him. I would like to get hold of \nhim, and we could get this Government going. He has to go to work and \nbring them in and say: I want to make sure I know what I am doing. And \nthis Department does not help him know what he is doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from New York \nwish?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New \nYork, Mrs. Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I rise to join \nSenator Byrd in speaking about our homeland security needs. Our \ncolleague from South Carolina always teaches me something whenever I \nhave the pleasure and privilege of hearing him speak in this Chamber.\n  New Yorkers particularly owe Senator Byrd a great debt of gratitude \nbecause he and his very worthy staff have done a tremendous amount of \nwork to help New York recover and rebuild from the tragedy of September \n11.\n  As we appear today in this Chamber, I cannot help but remark that \nSenator Byrd has been focused on homeland security from the moment I \nfirst spoke with him on September 12 around 7 a.m. after we knew the \nfull extent of the damage, and I was going up to see what had happened \nin New York for myself. He has been extremely understanding and also \nvery knowledgeable about what it was going to take to make us more \nsecure.\n  I also thank Senator Lieberman for his tremendous efforts in trying \nto craft legislation that will make us safer. We are not just doing \nthis for a political exercise or just to reorganize for the sake of \nreorganizing, but we know there are serious issues to be addressed, \nsome of which Senator Hollings spoke about.\n  I do support the idea of a Homeland Security Department, but I come \ntoday to recognize the seriousness of the issues that should be \naddressed while we are trying to determine what it is we need to do to \nmake our Government more prepared.\n  There are a number of issues, and my colleagues have raised quite a \nfew of them, but I want to focus on one particular aspect of our \nhomeland security, and that is the resources that our frontline \nfirefighters, police officers, and emergency responders need to be the \nsoldiers to defend our homeland security. Just as we support our men \nand women in uniform who are doing a very important job extremely well, \nfrom Afghanistan to the Middle East to the Far East, we have to do the \nsame for our local homeland defenders.\n  I have been disappointed in the disconnect between rhetoric and \nresources from the administration. We certainly have had many heartfelt \nand moving moments where words have captured our feelings.\n  When it comes to providing the resources that our police, our \nfirefighters, and our emergency responders need, I think the \nadministration has fallen short. That was certainly clear over the \nAugust recess when the President chose not to sign the emergency \ndesignation for the $5.1 billion supplemental appropriations bill, \nwhich included $2.5 billion for improving our homeland security.\n  That number did not come out of thin air. It was the result of \nhearings, testimony, and evidence presented by people on the front \nlines. A number of people from New York who were in our police \ndepartment and our fire department, who had been there on September 11, \nwho understood what we needed to be well prepared, came down to set \nforth a very clear agenda that they hoped the Federal Government would \nhelp them meet.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill, for example, would have given \nour first responders $100 million so that police and firefighters would \nhave communications systems that could talk to each other. We found \nout, tragically, on September 11 that we did not have that, and New \nYork is not alone in not having what is called interoperability between \nthe police and firefighter radio systems.\n  There would have been $150 million in additional FIRE Act grant \nfunding to help fire departments improve their emergency preparedness, \nand there would have been $90 million to track the long-term health \ncare of those who responded at Ground Zero, not just so we fulfill our \nobligation to take care of these brave men and women but also so we can \nbe better prepared to take care of all of our first responders.\n  I am not alone in thinking the President's refusal to sign the \nemergency designation was a terrible mistake. The International \nAssociation of Firefighters has voiced its concern in very clear, \nunmistakable language. I know they are particularly passionate about \nthis issue because they lost so many of their colleagues.\n  In his August 20 letter to President Bush, the International \nAssociation of Firefighters general president, Harold Schaitberger, had \nthis to say:\n\n       I would be dishonest if I did not convey our anger, concern \n     and growing doubt about your commitment to us . . . No one, \n     not even the President, has the right to pontificate about \n     his or her commitment and respect for firefighters while \n     ignoring our legitimate needs.\n       With all due respect, support entails more than kind words.\n\n  The President said he was exercising fiscal discipline by not making \nthe emergency designation and said that this was, in his view, wasteful \ncongressional spending; that $5 billion was not an emergency even if it \nwent to the kind of emergency needs and services that we know we are \nlacking.\n  I have to respectfully disagree. I think we do face an emergency. We \nare rushing through this legislation because clearly we think we face \nan emergency. But the real emergency is not in Washington to reorganize \na huge Government department. The real emergency is in the police \nstations and the firehouses and the emergency rooms of America. That is \nwhy I am concerned that when the Congress goes through the kind of \nprocess it did to arrive at a need for $5.1 billion and it is totally \ndisregarded, then why on Earth would we want to give up congressional \noversight and authority in setting the agenda to protect our country?\n  I believe it is imperative we do everything we can in setting up this \nDepartment to get the money to where it needs to go. We have to get the \ndollars where the responsibility rests.\n  When a disaster occurs, whether it is man-made or accidental, we do \nnot call the White House. We do not even call the Senate or the \nCongress or the Governor's office. In most instances, we call 911.\n  It is clear the kind of support we need for direct Federal homeland \nsecurity funding needs to be a part of any homeland security defense \nprogram.\n  We have a heavy responsibility in Washington, not just to talk the \ntalk\n\n[[Page S8064]]\n\nbut to walk the walk with our first responders. We have to give them \nthe equipment and the resources and the training they need. According \nto the U.S. Conference of Mayors, since September 11 cities have \ninvested almost $3 billion in added security costs for equipment, \novertime, and training. As of this date, with the exceptions of New \nYork and Washington, DC, which suffered so grievously on September 11, \nnot one city has received a single dime to cover these additional \ncosts.\n  Some bioterrorism funding--about $1.1 billion--has been dispersed to \nthe States, and that helps, but that does not answer the need that our \nfirefighters, police officers, and emergency responders have.\n  I think it is clear, if we are going to be debating this Department, \nlet us talk about the real needs that are out there. We have to be sure \nwe follow the clear example that has been set by communities in trying \nto shift funds to meet their emergency needs. We have to help them \nshoulder these additional burdens. Clearly, the Federal, State, and \nlocal governments are at partnership in preparing, in being \nresponsible, and then finally in responding. But if they do not have \nthe resources, they cannot do the job.\n  So as we debate this Department, let us join with the people on our \nfront lines who understand what they really need--groups such as the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, and the \nNational Association of Counties. Let us support direct Federal funding \nto local communities. Let us do it in the form of a community \ndevelopment block grant. Let us follow the money where it needs to go.\n  From my perspective, it is imperative we debate resources, not just \nreorganization. It would be a cruel deception to pass something called \nHomeland Security Department reorganization, which we all know is going \nto take years to untangle to try to get focused and to be effective, \nand not provide the dollars that our frontline defenders need.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. This is compounded because the administration's budget \ncalls for eliminating money that would go to our police, firefighters, \nand local law enforcement; eliminating more than $500 million from the \nCOPS program; eliminating entirely Federal funding for hiring new so-\ncalled COPS officers; eliminating and cutting other essential programs \nsuch as the local law enforcement block grant. This makes no sense to \nme.\n  It is fine to have this abstract, theoretical, philosophical, even \nconstitutional debate, as important as it is--and I believe with all my \nheart it is a critical debate--but let us not kid ourselves: If we do \nnot get resources where it counts, we are not going to be better \nprepared, we are not going to be better defended. I hope as we debate \nhomeland defense, we also recognize the obligation we owe to those men \nand women who would answer the call today when it is sent out.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank Mrs. Clinton, the distinguished \nSenator from New York, for her very appropriate, meaningful, and \nforceful remarks in connection with this matter and in connection with \nother matters she has addressed. And I thank Senator Hollings, the \nchairman of the committee which has jurisdiction over transportation, \nthe chairman of the appropriations subcommittee which has jurisdiction \nover the State, Justice, and Commerce Departments and other agencies; \nand thanks to Senator Reed for his excellent presentation.\n  This time is going on my time, which is all right. I am prepared to \nyield to the distinguished senior Senator from Washington, who sits on \nthe Appropriations Committee and who presides over the Transportation \nSubcommittee of that committee with a high degree of dignity and poise, \nand someone who always brings to the committee's attention and to the \nSenate's attention the length and breadth of her great knowledge that \nshe acquires through the holding of hearings, through the study she \ngives to the budget requests that come before the committee. I yield 15 \nminutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his leadership on this issue and for yielding me the time today.\n  On June 6, President Bush addressed the American public, informing \nthe public he had changed his mind. After months of rejecting just such \na proposal, he now saw the benefit of organizing a new Department of \nHomeland Security. His aides had handed him a plan. To his eyes, it was \na good plan and one that should be implemented.\n  However, something else happened that week as well that happens all \ntoo frequently in America. The Coast Guard, one of the agencies that \nwould be merged into the President's new Department of Homeland \nSecurity, was performing search and rescue operations across the \nNation.\n  In my home State of Washington, the Coast Guard was dispatching \nhelicopters and motorboats throughout Willapa Bay to search for three \nmissing Fort Lewis soldiers. On the evening of June 1, their 20-foot \npleasure craft washed ashore in Bay Center, WA. Unfortunately, those \nsoldier's bodies were recovered the next morning.\n  As I look today at the President's request, I am very mindful of the \nimpact it could have on the Coast Guard's ability to carry out other \nmissions like search and rescue.\n  We need to be responsive to the President's request. We need to give \nthis and future administrations the tools they need to better secure \nAmerica. However, we cannot sacrifice the critical safety work of the \nCoast Guard for the incomplete plan the President's aides drew up in \nthe basement of the White House.\n  I rise today because I am deeply concerned that in our rush to do \nsomething about homeland security, we may well overlook the \nconsequences it will have on the safety and security of all Americans. \nFrankly, given what I have seen so far, I have very real reasons for \nconcern. Of course, I believe, like all my colleagues, that we need to \ndo everything we can to make sure our Government and our military can \nmeet the challenges since September 11. We have to focus considerable \nenergy and resources on addressing those challenges.\n  Those who want to harm us will look for new ways to exploit our \nweaknesses. We have to do better. The world has changed. We must adapt. \nBut we must balance the needs of our country.\n  In my role as chairman of the Appropriations Transportation \nSubcommittee, I have worked very hard to provide the resources to meet \nour needs at our borders, at our seaports, airports, and throughout our \nNation's transportation infrastructure. Often, that has meant pushing \nthis administration to support the necessary funding, sometimes without \nsuccess.\n  We are moving forward, and we are making America more secure. The \nSenate has followed a deliberate process, and the leadership of Senator \nByrd has been critical to this endeavor. He has made sure that we move \nforward responsibly to meet the new challenges facing our Nation. But \nlet's face it, it takes a while to get even the simple things right. I \nhave been working with the Transportation Security Administration for \nmonths on airline security, and even the smallest things have taken a \nwhile to work out.\n  Look at what we face at our northern border. It took many months and \nwe had to put a lot of pressure on this administration just to get the \nNational Guard deployed at the northern border to fill the gaping holes \nin our border security left by years of negligence. It then took many \nmore weeks to get our guardsmen armed, secure. Securing our border is \nessential, but so is ensuring the efficient flow of people, goods, and \nservices across our border with our friends in Canada. Canada is our \nNation's largest trading partner. Many millions of people in both \ncountries depend on that trade for their livelihoods. If we do the \nwrong thing, the loss of jobs in our border communities will be \ndevastating.\n\n  How will the Department of Homeland Security, envisioned by the \nPresident, balance the complexity of those competing needs of the \nAmerican people? We do not know. We are supposed to trust this \nadministration.\n\n[[Page S8065]]\n\n  Now the administration wants to rush through a homeland security bill \nwhich was drawn up by a handful of White House aides. It is the largest \nGovernment reorganization since 1947. Look at what has happened in the \nHouse since the President submitted his proposal. The standing \ncommittees looked at the proposal and saw major problems. The House \nTransportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee unanimously voted to \nkeep the Coast Guard out of that new Department. Based on their \nexpertise and their research, the standing committee saw the clear need \nto maintain the Coast Guard outside of the new Department.\n  What happened? The select committee ignored that recommendation and \nput a rubber stamp on the President's original proposal. In fact, \nseveral times the standing committees made constructive improvements to \nbills, only to see their recommendations rejected by the select \ncommittee.\n  The administration wants to rush this proposal through Congress. \nAnyone who raises a legitimate question is immediately derided as \n``trying to reserve turf.''\n  This is not about turf. It is about safety. It is about a young Coast \nGuardsmen who climbed aboard foreign vessels in the open seas, not \nknowing what they may find. It is about TSA security agents who are \ntrying to make sure that passengers attempting to board our planes do \nnot pose a security threat. I am proud to work to try to provide them \nwith some job security just as they work hard to protect our Nation's \nsecurity.\n  These are real questions that need to be answered. This afternoon, I \nraise some of those questions because there is a lot at stake for the \npeople I represent and for every American. I want to make sure we do \nthis right. So far, I have not gotten the answers I need.\n  I have two major concerns. First, we have not yet figured out how to \nfulfill our traditional missions and the new security missions at the \nsame time. If we combined all these various agencies into one massive \nDepartment with a primary mission of homeland security, how are we \ngoing to meet the traditional needs across the board?\n  Let's look at the Coast Guard, just one agency. Since September 11, \nthe Coast Guard has shifted resources away from traditional missions to \nhomeland events. That is an appropriate response, but it comes at a \ncost. Unfortunately, it means the Coast Guard is spending less time \ninterdicting drugs and illegal migrants, enforcing fishery and marine \nsafety laws, and protecting our marine environment.\n  But the traditional missions have not disappeared. We still need the \nCoast Guard to keep drugs and the illegal migrants off our shores. We \nneed them to protect our environment. And we need them to protect the \nlives of our fishermen and the integrity of our fishing grounds. \nFrankly, even without the new security needs, we have a long way to go \nto meet even those basic missions.\n  I am concerned we are rushing into a new organization that could \ncompromise our ability to meet all the challenges we are facing. What \nwill be the commitment from the Department of Homeland Security to \nprotecting our marine environment or enforcing our fisheries laws or \nconducting search and rescue operations? If the administration \ncontinues to play budget games and underfund the Department, as it has \ndone so far with the TSA, will the scarce dollars go only to security \nand not to traditional missions?\n  Right now, we cannot even get the basic facts. I would like to know \nhow much of the current Coast Guard budget is going toward homeland \nsecurity. On July 9, the Coast Guard Commandant said 40 percent of the \nCoast Guard's operating budget goes to the missions of the new \nDepartment. A few weeks later, on July 30, the Commandant said almost \n50 percent of the Coast Guard's budget went to homeland security. That \nis a difference of at least $350 million. That number matters because \nthe boats and resources used for homeland defense are often the very \nsame ones needed for search and rescue and other missions.\n  I am not raising this to criticize Admiral Collins. He is doing an \nexcellent job. I work closely with him. But it shows how difficult it \nis to get even the most basic questions answered as we look at this new \nDepartment. The answers matter because the vast majority of Americans \nlive in coastal States or along the Great Lakes or inland waterways, \nand every American is impacted when the Coast Guard slows down its work \nstopping illegal drugs. To include the Coast Guard in the new \nDepartment will impact the lives of millions of people. I think we need \nto explore these questions closely. Simply put, we have not done a good \njob meeting our traditional missions and security missions at the same \ntime. I would like to know how one massive Department, focused \nprimarily on security, will help us meet the needs out there.\n\n  Second, I am very concerned about accountability and authority over \neverything from the staff of the new Department to its budget. The \nadministration has asked for unprecedented power and control over this \nproposed Department. Some of the demands for power over workers really \ntrouble me. The President wants changes in the personnel rules so he \ncan have flexibility. Is the President suggesting that today's \nunionized border agents are not doing an adequate job or that today's \nunionized Customs officials are not responding to new mission \nrequirements in a timely manner? If that is what he is suggesting, then \nhe is wrong.\n  I have been on the border. I have met with the Border Patrol and \nCustoms agents. These professionals are our sons and daughters, they \nare our neighbors, they are our friends, they are our husbands, and \nthey are our wives. They serve the American people selflessly, often \njeopardizing their own health and safety. I do not think those who \nserve in the Department of Homeland Security should be second-class \ncitizens, given a lower level of rights and respect.\n  In addition to dramatic new control over workers, the administration \nwants the power to move the money around without congressional input. \nLet me tell you, given what I have seen so far, this is pretty scary \nnews for families in Washington State. Right now, as a United States \nSenator, I can fight to make sure the needs in my State are being met. \nAs elected Members of Congress, we know the needs in our communities \nand we are accountable to our voters. But the administration now wants \naccountants in the Office of Management and Budget to decide what is \nimportant to the people of my home State of Washington. If that \nhappens, my constituents will lose out at a cost to their safety and \nsecurity.\n  Let's just look at what happened with the supplemental appropriations \nbill. Under the leadership of Chairman Byrd, the Appropriations \nCommittee held unprecedented and comprehensive hearings on how to best \nmeet our obligations to the American people. We spent countless hours \nhearing from national and local experts. We passed the funding to meet \nthe needs before us. Congress passed that funding, but then the \nPresident eliminated more than $5 billion of it. With a wave of his \nhand, over the August break, the President eliminated funding that we \nhere in Congress considered critical, after many hours of hearings, to \nprotecting the American public.\n  He eliminated $11 million from Coast Guard operations. The President \neliminated, with a wave of his hand, $262 million for critical Coast \nGuard procurement, including funding for coastal patrol boats for our \nsecurity. The President eliminated $150 million for our Nation's \nairports, as they are working so hard to meet the December deadline for \ninstalling explosive detection devices. And the President eliminated \n$480 million from its already shortchanged Transportation and Security \nAdministration.\n  The Office of Management and Budget has not been a good advocate for \nthe people of my home State of Washington. Given that record, I am very \nreluctant to give OMB dramatic new power over the safety and security \nof my constituents. The OMB originally blocked the Coast Guard's \ndesperately needed improvements to the marine 911 system. When they \nbrought it to their attention, the OMB changed its policy, but under \nthe President's plan there is no way for us in Congress to address the \narbitrary decision made by the OMB. Granting the President dramatic new \nauthority is not just a bureaucratic exercise. It has real consequences \nfor the people I represent. I take that responsibility very seriously.\n\n[[Page S8066]]\n\n  If we are not going to figure out how all the functions are going to \nbe performed and we can't tie money to functions, this reorganization \nmay consign many functions to death, as we saw when the President \neliminated $5.1 billion in homeland security funding.\n  In closing, we need to better define the missions of the various \nagencies, and we need to make sure they continue to fulfill their \ntraditional missions. It is essential for our economic security and our \nphysical safety. The House bill does not strike a balance, and we have \nto do better. We need to really understand the consequences of this \nproposal and ensure that it will actually increase our homeland \nsecurity and not jeopardize our citizens in other ways.\n  I believe this has not been thought out enough and we should \ncertainly not race to put a rubberstamp on such an incomplete proposal. \nI think every Senator feels pressure to do something, anything, about \nhomeland security. But it is much more important to do the right thing.\n  I look forward to having a good debate about the new Department of \nHomeland Security. There are a lot of serious questions, and I look \nforward to hearing some serious answers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator who \nis a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, as I have already \nindicated, for her exceedingly incisive remarks which reflect the high \ndedication that this Senator always brings to her work. I personally \nappreciate it, as the chairman of the committee. She is a fine member \nof that committee, and she has lived up to those--and far better--\nencomiums than I have been able to deliver today.\n  How much time does the distinguished senior Senator from New York \nwish to have?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will 15 minutes be all right?\n  Mr. BYRD. Let's try 15 minutes and hope that will do the job.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. Before my friend from Washington \nState leaves the floor, I want to thank her for her leadership on this \nissue. I particularly thank our distinguished leader, the senior \nSenator from West Virginia, for his leadership on this issue.\n  The Senate, at certain times, has an important role--at all times it \nhas important roles, but there is an important role that it has now, \nand that is for the Senate to be, of course, what one of the Founding \nFathers called the cooling saucer. If there was ever a time where there \nwas a need for that cooling saucer that the Senate should be and has \nbeen through its history in its finest moments, it is now. That is \nbecause we face a whole new challenge in these United States, a \nchallenge that says every one of our citizens is on the front line.\n  This new war on terrorism means that small groups of bad people can \ndo real damage in our homeland. Until 9/11, this was something that was \nunknown to us. There were battlefronts and there was the homefront, but \nnow the homefront is the battlefront, and the battlefront is the \nhomefront and that demands dramatic and significant changes in our \nGovernment.\n  If the senior Senator from West Virginia were not here, we probably \nwould have just rolled over and we would not have had the kind of \ndebate we are having.\n  He knows his history, whether it be of the Roman Senate or of the \nU.S. Senate or all the various Senates in between. I was going to ask \nhim--because my family and I just visited Venice--about the Venetian \nSenate, to see how that compared. I didn't even know Venice had a \nSenate until I visited, but we will get that history lesson at another \ntime. We have more pressing issues now.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is bringing the Senate to its best. He \nis not being obstructionist. He is not saying no. He is simply saying \nnot to rush on such a major piece of legislation that is going to \ninvolve the most dramatic reorganization of the Government in history, \non a major piece of legislation that is called on to defend us in \nbrand-new ways.\n  We no longer just have the battlefront, but we have the homefront. My \ncitizens from New York believe they are on the battlefront. They walk \ninto a subway car and they worry what might happen. A plane flies \noverhead and they worry what might happen. They look at a reservoir or \npowerplant and they worry what might happen. This is not a time to rush \nthings through because the very safety of our citizens is at stake.\n  When government was founded, when men and women got off their knees \nand founded government, it had two purposes: To protect from foreign \ninvasion and keep the domestic tranquility. For the first time, those \ntwo issues were combined.\n  A lengthy and worthy debate of the Senate is what is called for and \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, whom we all admire so, \nhas summoned the best in us and asked us to do that. I am proud to get \nup here and ask for that.\n  I would also like to praise my good friend from Connecticut. He has \nput together an excellent piece of legislation that talks about the \nSenate's prerogatives, not just today but as we go forward. It says a \nsingle man, albeit elected, the only man elected by all the people--the \nonly person elected by all the people, so far, the President of the \nUnited States--should have some power. But this is not what the \nFounding Fathers intended. He should not be allowed to take one from \none agency and put it in another. He should not be allowed to move \nemployees from one place to another without the approval of the \nCongress.\n\n  I regret to say that the House moved all too quickly. I am glad \nSenator Lieberman and his committee have had a chance to improve on the \nHouse legislation, and to improve on it in a very significant way in \nmajor areas that the Senator from Connecticut has outlined.\n  What I am saying today is that we have to go beyond that as well and \naddress some of the substantive areas of security--not simply how we \nreorder the Government and rearrange it, and not simply the balance of \npower between the President, the Senate, and the House, which is very \nimportant and worthy of debate--Senator Lieberman has put his oar in \nthe water on that one and given it a powerful stroke, if we pass his \nproposal--but also to debate some of the substance of homeland \nsecurity. I fear that if we simply rearrange the agencies and run away \nfrom spending the extra dollars we have to spend to make our homeland \nmore secure, we will have not done the full job. That is why I feel so \nstrongly about having a continued debate.\n  Let me mention a few areas where I have had some expertise in that \nsubstantive area. No matter what you do about rearranging and putting a \ndepartment here and a department there, we will still not be secure \nunless we delve into those departments.\n  One which I am going to touch on briefly is a computer system \nthroughout the Justice Department. Recognizing that we are not \nreorganizing the FBI or the CIA, let me focus on the areas where we \nare, such as the INS. Our computer systems are totally backward. We had \na hearing in my Judiciary subcommittee which has oversight over the FBI \nwhere we showed that the computer systems of the FBI cannot search for \ntwo words. They can search for the word ``flight'' and for the word \n``school,'' but they cannot search for the words ``flight school.'' \nSomething is dramatically the matter. The INS computers--we are moving \nthe INS around--are just as bad, and maybe worse. Until we update those \ncomputers, all sorts of bad people with bad intentions will be able to \nget into this country even though another part of the Government knows \nthey are bad. We should be addressing that problem when we are doing a \nhomeland security bill.\n  Then let me talk about the issue that is of greatest concern to me, \nwhich is, frankly, the issue that seems to be of great concern to our \nPresident, and rightfully so. To me, the worst danger I can conceive of \nthat could befall us in this war on terrorism is that a terrorist group \ncould smuggle a nuclear weapon, or a few, into this country and \ndetonate them. As horrible as 9/11 was, as aching as my city and State \nare, it would pale before the damage of a nuclear explosion in downtown \nNew York, or downtown Chicago, or downtown Houston, or downtown Los \nAngeles, San Francisco, Boston, Kansas City, or anywhere else.\n\n[[Page S8067]]\n\n  Yet right now, if, God forbid, a terrorist group should get hold of \nsuch a nuclear weapon either by purchasing it from the few powers that \nhave them that we are worried about--Pakistan, Russia, and, down the \nroad, Iraq, if they develop enough U-238--that weapon could be smuggled \ninto this country, say, on one of the large containers that are \nunloaded from our ships or brought through the borders--Canadian and \nMexican--on trucks, with virtually no detection. What a surprising \nthought. It is no longer that a missile would deliver such a bomb or \nthat a plane would deliver such a bomb but, rather, that it would come \nacross our border at ground or water level. That is a frightening \nthought.\n\n  The good news is we can do something about it. The good news, when \nyou talk to the scientists at Brookhaven National Lab out on Long \nIsland or Argonne Lab in the suburbs of Chicago, is they say we could \ndevelop a device that could at a distance of 40 or 50 feet detect \nnuclear weapons, if they, God forbid, should be smuggled into this \ncountry, because nuclear radioactivity involves gamma rays which can \npierce all but lead. To deal with surrounding the bomb in lead, you can \njust use an x-ray detection device. The x ray would detect the lead. \nThe problem is, they have the technology to do this, but it is only \ndone in lab conditions in cyclotrons and atom smashers.\n  We need it to go through every container that comes into America. \nRight now, the only way you can detect radiation is through a Geiger \ncounter. Unfortunately, a Geiger counter has to be placed maybe 3 feet \nfrom the radioactive source. You can't go into every one of these big \ncontainers with a Geiger counter and push it up against every crate--\nThere are probably 30, 40, or 50 crates in each container; there are \nhundreds of containers on these ships and thousands that come across by \ntruck--without bringing commerce to a standstill.\n  The alternative is to develop a device that would do this 40 or 50 \nfeet away, and then install it on every crane that either loads or \nunloads a container bound for the United States, or that is here in the \nUnited States, and put it on every toll booth for a truck that goes \nover the Canadian border or Mexican border. The cost of developing this \ndevice is probably about $500 million, and then probably another $1 \nbillion to install it.\n  The good senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner--obviously not of \nmy party--and I have legislation that would begin to do this, that \nwould start the research.\n  For the love of me, why can't we get support for this? Why isn't the \nWhite House supporting this? We are very worried about Iraq producing \nnuclear weapons. We should be. But why aren't we making our homeland \nsecure from the delivery of those nuclear weapons? Maybe it won't be \nIraq. Maybe it will be Iran. Maybe it will be North Korea. Maybe it \nwill be someone else we can't even think about.\n  I think we should be able to debate that proposal on the floor of \nthis Senate--not a year from now but now. I feel the urgency of this. \nThe safety of our citizens is at stake. If it takes an extra day or \ntwo, so be it. That is the role of the Senate.\n  Why doesn't the White House get behind this kind of proposal? For \nsome reason, they won't. I think it is because they don't want to spend \nthe money, as amplified by the recent almost virtual pocket veto of the \n$5 billion that was part of the appropriations bill. But I will bet if \nyou ask each American if they would spend $1 billion to prevent nuclear \nweapons from being smuggled into our country and the worst kind of \ncatastrophe imaginable to befall us, they would all say yes. If asked, \nmy 99 colleagues would say yes.\n  That is the kind of thing we are trying to do here--not be \nobstructionists. The Senator from West Virginia, as the leader of our \nband here, has made it clear he doesn't want to be an obstructionist. \nThe Senator from Connecticut has made it clear he believes we have to \ndo things to improve the legislation.\n  I ask that we continue to debate this legislation. I understand we \nhave time constraints. Those are real. I understand that. I understand \nwe cannot debate this bill for 3 or 4 months right now. But we don't \nhave to have an artificial deadline that it must be finished by next \nweek. If we think that deadline is needed, let us stay in session, go \nin early, and stay in late until the major amendments are dealt with. I \nam confident my colleagues from Connecticut and Tennessee will deal \nwith those amendments in a fair way. They are not trying to say it is \ntheir way or no way. In fact, that is why we have bills, and that is \nwhy we have them debated. But the reorganization of Government agencies \nis an important issue. I agree with it. I am supportive of it. But I do \nnot think it is the only issue facing homeland security.\n\n  And for our President--and I respect him and repeat that every New \nYorker owes him a debt of gratitude for being so helpful in the $21 \nbillion this Senate so generously voted for and the House voted for--\nbut when he says the Senate is getting in the way, that the Senate \nbetter pass his bill his way, not the way I would want or the Senator \nfrom Connecticut would want or, in fact, the Senator from Tennessee \nwould want, he is not being fair, not just to the Senate but to the \nAmerican people because we do have a crisis. It is a slow crisis; it is \nan insidious crisis.\n  Unfortunately, for politicians, the incentives are backward; in other \nwords, we all love to allocate money, build a school, and get up there \nand say: Here is a school. But what is our goal with homeland security? \nWhat do we want to happen? Nothing. We are very successful if nothing \nhappens. And that provides negative incentives or perverse incentives \nfor the political process. That is the real worry.\n  If we were to put $3 billion into the northern border, if we were to \nput $1 billion into the INS computer system, if we were to spend $1 \nbillion to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional \nseconds to finish my thought.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  If we were to spend another $1 billion on nuclear weapons, I think it \nwould be worth it. I think the American people would be for us. I may \nbe wrong, but at least I would like the chance to debate and vote on \nissues I consider to be urgent, pressing needs for my constituency in \nmy State that I love so, and for the people of the United States, for \nthe country I love so.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from New York for a very \nthoughtful statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, be recognized at 5 \np.m. for a period of 10 minutes, out of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the President wants the Congress to grant \nthe administration the authority to write its own civil service system, \nregardless of what has been written in current law, that would apply \nonly to Federal workers within a new Department of Homeland Security.\n  As I have expressed before on this floor, I am concerned that these \nchanges mask the administration's larger hidden agenda, an agenda that \nwould have the Federal Government function more like a big corporation. \nWe all certainly ought to be concerned about that idea, given our \nrecent experience with the inner workings of big corporations.\n  I come, Mr. President, from the coalfields of southern West Virginia, \nnot from a corporate boardroom. So I approach this with a different \nperspective than the administration, quite obviously. Before I would \never vote to approve a homeland security measure, I would want to know \nmore about the working conditions of its prospective employees. Will \nthe employees who currently enjoy collective bargaining rights continue \nto enjoy those same rights at the new Department? Will these employees \nhave complete whistleblower protections?\n  Before I vote to approve a homeland security measure, I want to know \nabout the pay system. How will the payroll systems and personnel \nsystems be merged into the new Department? How would the special pay \nrates, already in existence at the separate\n\n[[Page S8068]]\n\nagencies, coordinate or be replaced by a pay system if one were to be \nimplemented? What will be the hiring procedures? What will be the \nfiring procedures in this vast new order?\n  Presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer says these new procedures are \nneeded to enable managers to fire workers who drink on the job. Would \nthey also be able to fire workers because they join a union, because \nthey vote Democratic, because they have red hair or no hair or lots of \nhair or white hair?\n  The administration argues that the Secretary for Homeland Security \nwill require significant flexibility in the hiring and firing process \nbecause, for example, according to the administration, existing due \nprocess and appeal rights make it impossible to fire or demote Federal \nemployees who are poor performers.\n  But this and other claims are simply not true. A report by the \nnonpartisan Partnership for Public Service recently stated:\n\n       [W]hat is missing from the current debate . . . is the \n     institutional experience government has accumulated with \n     Title 5 modifications that have already successfully allowed \n     government agencies to emulate high-performing workplaces--\n     without compromising merit principles, including protections \n     against politicized personnel decisions.\n\n  Mr. President, the fact is, the administration currently enjoys broad \nflexibilities when it comes to the Federal workforce. A report by the \nCongressional Research Service points out:\n\n       Executive branch departments and agencies currently have \n     considerable flexibility to perform personnel functions in \n     such areas as recruiting, hiring, compensation, promotion, \n     training, and retention. The extent to which the departments \n     and agencies are using the flexibilities is unknown.\n\n  ``Unknown.''\n  One of the most important protections granted by the civil service \nsystem, that could be eliminated under the President's proposal, is for \nwhistleblowers. Remember Franklin's whistle? Remember the story about \nBenjamin Franklin's whistle, that he paid too much for his whistle? I \nam talking about whistleblowers, just now.\n  The day the President made the announcement of his newfound support \nfor a Department of Homeland Security was the very day that an FBI \nwhistleblower, Coleen Rowley, was to testify before Congress on the \nembarrassing failures of that agency leading up to the September 11 \ntragedy. It is clear the administration hoped to limit coverage of that \nhearing by offering its secret plan that was hatched in the bowels of \nthe White House to establish a new Department of Homeland Security, on \nthe same day--a plan, I might add, that would not provide its employees \nthe same level of protection with regard to whistleblowers as that FBI \nagent enjoyed that day.\n  Whistleblower protections are essential to protect Federal employees \nagainst managerial reprisals for lawfully disclosing information they \nbelieve demonstrates a violation of law or mismanagement of authority.\n  The President seemed to agree with this principle when he issued an \nexecutive order on January 20, 2001, that required all Federal workers \nto obey their duty and report fraud, waste, and abuse.\n  Excessive secrecy enforced by repression can threaten national \nsecurity by covering up Government breakdowns that sustain unnecessary \nvulnerability to terrorism. An example from the post-September 11 \nperiod provided by the American Federation of Government employees is \nilluminating. In testimony before the House Select Committee on \nHomeland Security, American Federation for Government Employees \nPresident, Bobby L. Harnage, Sr., provided the following story, and I \nquote from his testimony:\n\n       In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, two \n     union officers of the National Border Patrol Council--border \n     agents Mark Hall and Mark Lindenmann--went on the NBC Today \n     Show and testified before Congress to speak out against \n     security on the United States northern border. They said that \n     despite all the talk, no new agents had been placed on the \n     northern border and that agents were not making criminal \n     background checks on people caught entering the United States \n     illegally. These statements prompted the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service supervisors to propose to summarily \n     fire the agents, stating in internal e-mails that ``the \n     President of the local union deemed it necessary to \n     independently question our readiness in a public forum,'' \n     that ``managers must take a stance which bears no tolerance \n     of dissent,'' and that managers must ``view resistance from \n     rank and file as insubordination.''\n\n  Well, this is what employees are often up against when they speak out \nagainst the company line, even when the company line involves the \nsecurity of the United States.\n  Without knowledge that the union would represent them and that an \nimpartial whistleblower hearing process was in place to review \nsubsequent INS actions against them, we can be sure that they never \nwould have said a word and Congress would never have heard the truth of \nwhat was really happening on the northern border of the United States.\n  Before the August recess, Congress overwhelmingly approved state-of-\nthe-art corporate whistleblower protection as an encouragement for \nprivate sector workers to defend America's financial markets. Our \nhomeland security requires similar rights for Government workers to \nmake disclosures in defending American families against terrorism. \nWithout full whistleblower protections in place, Congress would have \nhad a difficult time in the past learning of the problems associated \nwith governmental reorganizations, and there have been some serious \nproblems in our recent history.\n  As a rule of thumb, it is important to remember that Federal \nGovernment reorganizations have been difficult to accomplish. As James \nM. Lindsay, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, recently said:\n  History suggests we never get reorganizations right the first time, \nand this is an especially ambitious proposal. A lot of follow-through \nwill be needed to make it work.\n  Recent experience in providing the executive branch with flexibility \nin establishing a new Government agency holds great lessons for what we \nare being asked to do today. This flexibility failed in an identical \nexperiment at the Federal Aviation Administration in which Congress \ngave the flexibility to replace merit system and collective bargaining \nprocedures with so-called superior management alternatives. The result \nwas chaos. Personnel disputes rose sharply, morale plummeted, and the \nmishmash of employee organizations sprang up to replace coherent labor-\nmanagement dialog in disputes from all directions.\n  In the year 2000, Congress learned the obvious lesson and restored \nthe merit system's due process procedures and remedies. What about the \nnew Transportation Security Agency that was created last year? Congress \nreluctantly agreed to the administration's request for exceptions to \nthe civil service system for employees at the new agency because they \nwanted to streamline personnel procedures to allow faster hiring and \nprovide for flexibility and shifting people among jobs as the new \nagency was established. That sounds familiar, doesn't it?\n  The results have been mixed at best. Recall that just a few short \nweeks ago the administration fired its hand-picked director of the new \nTransportation Safety Administration, John W. McGaw, only 6 months \nafter the agency was established. Creating an effective and efficient \nDepartment of Homeland Security and retaining the basic rights of \nFederal workers are not mutually exclusive.\n  I am not here to say our civil service system is perfect, but I do \nsay that using the security of the United States and the rights of \nFederal workers as a bargaining chip to further a political agendum is \nsimply unacceptable. What an irony that this administration is using an \nattack by terrorists who have no respect for the rule of law or the \nrights of workers as a justification for us not to respect our own laws \nor the rights of workers.\n  So I am grateful for this opportunity today to speak on this issue. I \nam grateful for the opportunity for the Senate to address the issue. I \nask the distinguished Senator from Wyoming if he wishes to speak.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I do.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n[[Page S8069]]\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to comment for a few minutes on the \nsubject that is before the Senate. I am not a member of the committee. \nI have not spent as much time on it as have others. But I think there \nare probably different views and we have heard the same views now for \nquite a long time. Perhaps it would be well to talk a little bit about \nsome of the other points of view that might be available and might be \ndiscussed later. I understand this is not actually on the issue but, \nrather, on a motion to proceed thereto. It is a very important issue, \nof course.\n  Nothing could be more important than homeland security. We have \ntalked about it and we continue to talk about it at great length. The \nfact is, it is a high priority, certainly, for all of us to protect the \nhomeland. In order to do that, we need to have a homeland security \ndepartment with the most effective management that we can have, the \nmost effective employees, and a system that works as effectively as \npossible. So we support plans that protect workers through civil \nrights, equal opportunity guarantees, whistleblower protections, and \nall those fundamental rights which will be kept. Accountability is also \na must, and giving the department flexibility in hiring and firing and \ncreating a powerful deterrent for others to ensure they don't engage in \nbehavior that would endanger homeland protection.\n  The bill now before us will compromise national security and place \nmore importance, frankly, on bureaucracy and bureaucratic security than \non national security. That really is not the issue here.\n  This is not a new issue. The President has the authority in every \nother agency, but there seems to be an inclination to be able to roll \nit back for the Department of Homeland Security. Under this bill, the \nPresident would have more flexibility to make decisions--or should \nhave--for reasons of national security, and for HUD, for the Department \nof Education, he would have more than he does under this proposal. That \nseems strange to me. This is a proposal that deals with those kinds of \nemergencies--the things that are changeable--and flexibility needs to \nbe there.\n  So it seems to me that without some basic flexibility to manage, \nfreedom to hire the right people, fire the wrong people, that national \nsecurity would be at risk and not be secure. Here are some examples. \nThe Senate bill prevents the President from holding services \naccountable. Last month, two America West pilots showed up to work \ndrunk. They showed up on Monday and were fired on Tuesday. If they had \nbeen INS personnel, it would have taken 18 months--540 days--to be held \naccountable. These are the kinds of issues with which we have to deal. \nThis is not the normal effort. There is a bottom line that the \nPresident does need to have sufficient flexibility. After all, it is \nthe President and the people in the executive branch who are going to \ndo the job. What we do is give them the opportunity and the flexibility \nto do it.\n\n  Certainly there are controls. These controls will not be gone. But we \nhave to provide the opportunity to the person who will be responsible \nfor carrying out this role. It is easy to sit here and talk about all \nthe restraints we should have because we do not have to do that job; \nsomeone else does.\n  The Senate bill does not provide the new Department budget transfer \nauthority. Without transfer authority, if intelligence indicated \nterrorists were developing a new type of biological weapon, the \nSecretary would be unable to transfer funds from one division to \nanother to acquire additional medicines or vaccines or improve \ndetection equipment. It does not provide the flexibility to attract, \nhire, and reward good performance or hold poor performers accountable. \nThat is what we need to do in all of Government, but more particularly \nin this Department where they are going to face issues they have never \nbefore faced.\n  The Office of Personnel Management reports it can take up to 5 months \nor more to hire a new Federal employee and 18 months to terminate. If \none is not getting the job done, is this what we want in homeland \ndefense? I do not think so.\n  The bill does not provide for reorganization authority. The Senate \nbill will prevent the new Secretary from consolidating inspection work \nof the Customs Service, Border Patrol, and Agriculture inspectors at \nour ports of entry, leaving the current seam between these activities. \nFrankly, that has been the weakness in our system since September 11--\nthere is information here, there is information there, and we need to \nbring it together in a seamless way, and that is one of the strengths \nand one of the purposes of this whole operation. Yet this bill will not \nallow that to happen.\n  It will strip the President of existing authority to act to preserve \nnational security. The Senate would take away the President's existing \nauthority to exempt agencies in the new Department of collective \nbargaining requirements where national security requires it. Ever since \nPresident Jimmy Carter used this important national security authority \nin time of war--we are in a war of terrorism. To weaken the President's \nauthority seems to be contradictory of where we are or where we need to \ngo.\n  Certainly, there needs to be great discussion, and I admire the \nemphasis and effort that has been made. I certainly respect the \njudgment everyone brings to this Chamber, but there are differences of \nview, and they ought to be reflected, and they will be reflected, in \nthe bill. We are getting the impression today, however, that there is \nnothing right about the bill, that the way the President has requested \nit is all wrong, and that cannot be the case. There has to be a \nbalance, and I am sure there will be an effort to strike a balance.\n  Of course, we have to recognize rules that do protect Federal \nworkers. And, indeed, there should be rules. They represent the best in \nAmerica, and they deserve strong civil service protections under the \nPresident's plan. Employees of the new Department will continue to be \nprotected by important civil service laws, rules, and regulations that \nprotect them against discrimination on the basis of age, disability, \nrace, color, or religion. Those protections will be there, protected by \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act, the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, the Social Security Act, the Civil Rights Act, the Hatch \nAct, Government ethical standards, and they should continue, and indeed \nthey will.\n  I know this is a very important issue. I know also that many Senators \nhave worked very hard and are seeking to do what they believe is best \nto put together this homeland defense bill. But I do believe there has \nto be some recognition that this is different, that we are asking the \nexecutive branch to carry out a job that is unusual in a different \ntime. It has to have some flexibility so that the decisions to \naccomplish what it is all about can be made. That is what the President \nand those who have put together this original proposition are for.\n  A letter has been written by the former Governor of Pennsylvania that \nlays out the need for these flexibilities very persuasively. I happen \nto agree. Certainly there are limits to what we want to do, but we do \nwant to make this a successful effort and give those who are in charge \nof handling it the flexibility to make it work. I hope we will balance \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I know Senator Boxer is expected around 5. I would \nlike to speak for a few moments until then.\n  I thank my colleague from Wyoming for his statement. To pick up on \nwhat he said, that one might get the impression listening to the debate \nthat there was not anything good in this bill--specifically in the \nPresident's proposal on homeland security--there is a natural way, when \namendments are filed, to focus on where we disagree, where the \namendment disagrees with the underlying bill. But there is a big \niceberg under the surface on which there seems to be disagreement. On \nthat there is great agreement. In fact, I believe, though it is hard to \nquantify this, that more than 90 percent of the bill the Governmental \nAffairs Committee approved in late July is exactly the same as what \nPresident Bush desires. It is quite similar to the bill the Democratic \nmajority on the committee adopted by a 9-to-7 vote in May which, in \nturn, is similar to the proposal of\n\n[[Page S8070]]\n\nthe commission headed by our colleagues, former Senators Gary Hart and \nWarren Rudman.\n  There is enormous agreement on what I would say are the guts of this \nbill and the guts of a new Department of Homeland Security: Coordinate \nthe disparate agencies that are now disorganized, overlapping, creating \ngaps and vulnerabilities that terrorists took advantage of on September \n11 and will again unless we close those gaps and eliminate those \nvulnerabilities. We cannot let that happen. Border security agencies \nare being brought together; emergency response is being centralized, \nworking much more closely with State and local officials; \ninfrastructure protection; intelligence, most important, to create that \none place where all the dots come together so that we can see the \nterrorist plots before they are carried out and stop them; science and \ntechnology. Let's use the brain power, the innovation, as the Defense \nDepartment has, to make us as successful in the battle to defend the \nAmerican people at home as those technological innovations have made us \nabroad in the fight in pursuit of our principles and our national \ninterest.\n  Most of this proposal enjoys broad bipartisan support. There are a \nfew parts of the proposal right at the center which are in dispute. I \nunderstand the President does not support our proposal for a strong \nintelligence division in the new Department. It is critically important \nto break down the barriers that existed and still exist, to some \ndegree, between the FBI, the CIA, local law enforcement, and State and \nlocal law enforcement as opposed to Federal law enforcement; bring all \nthose dots together on one table so they can see the outline of what is \ncoming and stop it before it happens.\n  There is dispute from the White House on our national office to \ncombat terrorism because we want the nomination of the director of that \noffice to be approved by the Senate. So these are real disputes related \nto homeland security.\n  The dispute that is going on now and the question of civil service \nrights is not relevant. I hate to see it stand as an obstacle in the \npath to adopting legislation creating a Department of Homeland Security \nwhich, as I say, will give the President at least 90 percent of what he \nwants in this new Department. In fact, far from limiting the authority \nof the new Secretary of Homeland Security with regard to the management \nflexibility that that Secretary has, our legislation protects the \nexisting flexibility in law.\n  The new Secretary would be able to remove employees for poor \nperformance, transfer employees as needed, reward and give bonuses to \nthose who perform ably. In fact, we add by this legislation to the \nexisting management flexibility that the new Secretary would have \nbecause of a bipartisan amendment worked on very hard and thoughtfully \nby Senator Voinovich and Senator Akaka which would give the President \nand the Secretary of Homeland Security new powers to reward employees, \nattract top talent and reshape the workforce. It is quite an advance.\n  So far from limiting the management flexibility of the new Secretary, \nwe are increasing it beyond what any other Secretary has today, and we \ngive the administration an open invitation, specifically in the letter \nin regard to the legislation we are proposing, by requiring the \nSecretary to come back every 6 months and to offer legislative \nrecommendations.\n  We specifically enumerate this again on personnel management that \nemerges from the experience the Secretary has over those 6 months.\n  We have to remember that the civil service system evolved for a \nreason. It was designed to create some accountability, to protect the \nFederal workforce from favoritism, from patronage, from politicization, \nby creating a transparent framework for a merit-based personnel system. \nObviously, it is not perfect. That is why we included these major \nreforms in the bill we reported out of our committee. But to \nessentially discard it, as the President's proposal would do, to give \nthe Secretary and the President effectively unlimited authority to \nrewrite the civil service rules, would be a real step backward.\n  A lot of this has to do with accountability. Accountability is an \nimportant goal in our public life and our public service. When people \nare being taken from the place where they work now--28 different \nagencies and offices, the Customs Service, the Coast Guard, the \nTransportation Security Agency, FEMA--and they are brought into this \nnew Department, I think most managers in the private sector would want \nto do it in a way that would encourage those employees to believe we \nare all on the same team and we expect the most from them, we are going \nto work with them.\n  By pulling away these civil service protections, I think we are going \nto have exactly the opposite effect. At a time when the average worker \nwould naturally be anxious about a change of office or status, we are \ngoing to hang a sword over their heads that says no more civil service \nprotection; they will lose their rights and, at worst, their job \nwithout the right to protest and seek review.\n  Responding to the Senator from Wyoming, I say he is right, that some \nof our colleagues have not said enough positively either about the \nPresident's proposal particularly, because it is embraced in so much of \nwhat the committee will bring to the floor.\n\n  There are these disagreements. I hope we can work them out. I hope \nwhere they are fundamental, we can put them off for 6 months and do the \nurgent work, which is to get this bill done.\n  Let me say a word while I am speaking about items in dispute that I \nhope can be put off. This is the question of collective bargaining. I \nmust say I have learned a lot about this. I have not been involved in \nsome of these questions for a while, and I learned that collective \nbargaining rights were extended to Federal employees for the first time \nin 1962 by Executive order of President Kennedy and then were embraced \nin statute in 1978 under President Carter. In both the Executive order \nand the statute, there was a provision made that reflected, I think, \nspecial concerns during the cold war which said that if the President \ndetermined that union membership in a given agency or office was \ninconsistent with national security, the President could remove the \nright to collectively bargain without giving a reason other than to say \nit was inconsistent with national security, without any right of review \nor appeal by the employees who were therefore losing a basic right, \nwhich is to join a union.\n  I do point out that Federal employees can neither strike nor in most \ncases do they negotiate for their salaries, which are usually set by \nstatute.\n  I am going to stop for a moment and ask my friend and colleague from \nPennsylvania whether he would like to address the Senate on the motion \nbefore us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I had not expected to address the Senate on this issue, \nbut I never turn down an invitation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Should I rescind my offer?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator could, but not after it has been accepted.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Go right ahead. We both learned that at the same law \nschool.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Lieberman and I went to the same law school, and \nI think he knows one can rescind an offer, but not after it is \naccepted. At that point, it is too late.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am pleased to have the Senator have the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am glad to see the legislation on homeland security on \nthe floor. This is historic legislation. As the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut has said, this is maybe the most important bill that \nwill come out of his committee during his tenure. It is my hope we can \nmove through the bill, go to conference, and have legislation on the \nPresident's desk which the President can accept.\n  One of the key points at issue is the way the analysis of \nintelligence is going to be structured, and it is my hope that we will \nbe able to take a step at this time on reforms which have long been in \nthe making.\n  When I chaired the Intelligence Committee in the 104th Congress, I \nproposed legislation which would have brought under one umbrella the \nCIA and all of the intelligence agencies. There is on the President's \ndesk now a similar proposal. It would be acceptable to this Senator to \nhave that umbrella control really anywhere, but the\n\n[[Page S8071]]\n\nturf wars which are well-known to be endemic and epidemic in this city \nhave prevented that kind of umbrella or overview.\n  The proposal which I think is indispensable is not to change the \noperation of the CIA or the FBI or the Defense Intelligence Agency or \nNational Security, but when it comes to analysis, to bring it all \ntogether so that the analysts are under one umbrella. I believe that \nhad there been an umbrella prior to September 11, 2001, there is a good \nchance that 9/11 could have been prevented.\n  We know by hindsight about the FBI report out of Phoenix, and about \nthe young man who had Osama bin Laden's picture on his wall while \nstudying flight training, as well as other indicia of connections to \nOsama bin Laden. We know about the application for a warrant under the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act of Zacarias Moussaoui, which \nwould have yielded very substantial information about his connections \nto al-Qaeda. We know about the two at Kuala Lumpur, known to the CIA, \nbut not communicated to the FBI or Immigration and Naturalization \nService in a timely way. We know of the information from the National \nSecurity Agency on September 10, a threat, that was not translated \nuntil September 12. There are other factors at issue here where we \ncould have connected the dots, as the metaphor is used.\n\n  This bill is a very substantial undertaking. I discussed the matter \non a number of occasions with the distinguished Senator from Tennessee \nwho raises a valid consideration that this bill may be going too far in \nthe sense that it takes in a great deal of territory. It does that. \nHowever, the question is, When will it be done, if not now?\n  The business of consolidating Federal agencies is a Herculean task \nfacing all sorts of obstacles, and it is only the event of 9/11 and the \nthreat of another 9/11 which is a motivating factor to make these \nenormous changes.\n  Earlier today I heard the Senator from Tennessee say next year would \nbe time enough to study the intelligence agencies. There is one big \nproblem with that: The Senator from Tennessee will not be here next \nyear. We need to take advantage of his skill this year.\n  Perhaps almost as important as the skill of the Senator from \nTennessee is the momentum which we have. I have offered to give him \nsome tips on his new job. I saw a headline in the paper the other day, \n``Senator Thompson Demoted to District Attorney.'' First of all, I do \nnot know that it is a demotion because I have held that position. \nHowever, that is what the headline said, Senator Thompson demoted.\n  I was surfing on Sunday. It is hard to surf and not see Senator \nThompson or Senator Lieberman, or both of them. Senator Thompson was in \na heated exchange with former Secretary Eagleburger, and then the \nprogram was interrupted for some entertainment. I thought Secretary \nEagleburger and Senator Thompson were entertaining. They put on a \nportion of this television show. I wonder how many ex-district \nattorneys in the Senate turned down that television contract before \nSenator Thompson got it?\n  At any rate, Senator Thompson was sitting behind a big desk in a \ndimly lit room and two assistant district attorneys approach him. I \ncould not get the gist of it entirely, but I guess the thrust of it was \nsomeone in the room was in favor of legalizing drugs. The comment was \nmade: What about our war on drugs? This District Attorney Thompson \nsaid: We have to have a war on something in Congress for people to be \nelected.\n  It seemed a little cynical for him to turn on his colleagues even \nbefore he is on his new payroll. I trust the Ethics Committee would not \nlet him be on the payroll yet, although he is doing those shows.\n  Back to a serious vein, this is the time to do it. I talked to \nGovernor Ridge after a meeting he had with the President today. I have \nsupplied him with language and I sent a copy of it to Senator Lieberman \nand a copy to Senator Thompson. The President wants to be sure that the \nPresident has the authority to continue to work with the CIA as he \nalways has. Absolutely, he should have that authority. He does have \nthat authority. There is nothing we can do in legislation that would \nchange it. The change in the language was made to have the analysis \ngroups under one umbrella, subject to the President's direction to the \ncontrary.\n  An earlier draft stated the reverse, that the President can direct \nall of these intelligence agencies to coordinate. You cannot wait for \nthe President to make a direction. He is too busy to do it. The \ngeneralization has to be that they will be working together under one \numbrella, and they will be coordinating the analysis, but this must be \nmade explicit in statute. If the President wants to change that, of \ncourse he can. I do not think he needs that authority in the statute, \nbut I am pleased to eliminate any question about it. It is my hope we \ncan find some common ground on that question.\n\n  Washington, DC, has a way of having matters slide if we do not strike \nwhile the iron is hot. It is hard to get anything done in Washington, \nDC, while the iron is hot. However, when it cools off, it is \nextraordinarily difficult. It has been a long time and many efforts \nhave been made to bring these agencies together. It is a limited \njuncture to call on the analytical sections to be under one umbrella.\n  Homeland security will do a lot in response to another 9/11, but if \nthat happens, it is really a very sad situation. Ninety-nine percent of \nour effort needs to be made to prevent it. If we have to respond to \nanother 9/11, we are in deep trouble. Maybe something even more serious \nmay occur--not that 9/11 was not serious enough, but it may involve \nweapons of mass destruction. Who knows what it may involve. We have a \nvery heavy responsibility to do everything we can to prevent it. When \nwe look at what was known before, with the dots there, and the \npossibility of putting them together, that is what we have to work \ntoward.\n  I have worked a lot with the principals on this issue. I had the \nopportunity to serve on the Governmental Affairs Committee. I know the \nwork of Senator Thompson, who was chairman, and Senator Lieberman, who \nis now chairman. We have structured this to accommodate all of the \ncompeting interests.\n  I think it will probably be a long day before Senator Lieberman will \nmake an ex parte invitation for me to speak again. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I do not regret the acceptance by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, and I thank him very much for his remarks. He went right \nto the heart of one of the most important debates we will have on the \nbill, which is how do we structure the intelligence division of this \nnew Department to make sure that we never again look back, as we have \nnow after September 11, and say these barriers to communication between \nthe FBI, the CIA, a whole bunch of people, if those barriers had been \nbroken, and all the information was in one place, we might well have \nbeen able to prevent September 11. We have to have it within our power \nto do that.\n  I understand some of the concerns of the White House, but I do think \nthe phrasing that Senator Specter has talked about is just right. I \nhope he may play a role in bringing us all together on this. I thank \nhim, also, for the fact that he was my lead cosponsor; I was his lead \ncosponsor in October of last year when we introduced the original \nversion of the bill creating the Department of Homeland Security which, \nin fairness, was based in good measure on the recommendation of the \nHart-Rudman Commission. I look forward to his active participation in \nthis debate and the days ahead.\n  Under a previous order, I believe Senator Boxer was to be recognized \nnext, with the time to be taken from Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Lieberman for all his hard work on this \nbill, and Senator Thompson as well. I thank Senator Byrd because in his \n50 years in Congress, he has seen a lot and he has raised some very \nimportant issues at which this Senate ought to look. I rise to say \nthank you to him and to make note that when Senator Lieberman first \nbrought the concept of Homeland Security and a Cabinet-level position \nfor Tom Ridge, this administration was not for that in any way, shape, \nor form.\n\n[[Page S8072]]\n\n  It is my understanding not having been on the committee, to my \nsadness--maybe if I was, I would have had more to say in how this bill \nwould come about--my understanding is that not one Republican voted for \nthe first version of that bill in the committee itself.\n  So we see a real transition from something that was an idea Senator \nLieberman had, the Democrats supported, to one that has been embraced, \nwith some very important differences that will come out on this \nfloor. I want to talk to some of those, as well as some of my own \nconcerns.\n\n  I have been in elected life now for 26 years--not as long as Senator \nByrd, but long enough to know that reshuffling a structure doesn't \nnecessarily mean you are going to solve your problem. As a matter of \nfact, it could in many ways make people less accountable, hiding under \nmore layers of bureaucracy. So I approach this debate with an attitude \nthat basically says I am not so sure about this.\n  I think what Senator Byrd is trying to do here by speaking with some \nof us who have some of these problems with the bill is to try to see if \nwe can let the Senate work its will and shape this so it does not \nbecome an unwieldy bureaucracy that will be not more accountable but \nless accountable.\n  We all know what brought us together as a country was what happened \non September 11. We will never forget it, and we will commemorate it. \nBut I agree with those who say we have to do this right. It would be a \ndisservice to those who were so adversely impacted if we were to set \nsome artificial deadline for restructuring of the Government, a \nrestructuring which is so huge that a Brookings Institution scholar, \nPaul Light, said:\n\n       I would rank it the No. 1 reorganization in American \n     history in terms of difficulty.\n\n  My view is this should be done right. We should keep congressional \naccountability in the process and not give up the very important powers \nwe have under the Constitution, the checks and balances, not just for \nthis administration but for any administration.\n  It is interesting to hear President Bush's own words. He says it is \nthe most extensive reorganization of the Federal Government since the \n1940s.\n  The amendment is 350 pages. I say to Senator Lieberman, I believe he \nhas done an incredible job of improving the bill from the House \nversion, and I certainly shudder to think if that House version were to \nbecome law because it has a lot of serious problems. So I say straight \nout to Senator Lieberman, thank you for your work in this regard.\n  Senator Conrad made a point today to some of us, stating he had heard \nfrom the OMB Director way before September 11 that changing the civil \nservice protections was one of the things this administration has \nalways wanted to do and that all the things that are contained in the \nHouse bill, as they would pertain to the employees of this new \norganization, are not new things to this administration. They have \nwanted to break the back, if you will, of whistleblower protection in \nother cases. They have wanted to break the back of any type of \ncollective bargaining.\n  As we know, Federal employees cannot strike, nor should they. That is \nnot an issue. But this administration would like to weaken the \nprotections that do belong to Federal employees.\n  I think Senator Lieberman made a very good point when he said, in a \nconversation with some of us in leadership, that the protections in his \nbill that are afforded to the Federal employees who would work in \nhomeland defense are the very same protections that are afforded to the \nDepartment of Defense civilian employees.\n  So it seems to me a rather cruel thing to say you are creating a \nDepartment that, next to the Department of Defense--and maybe even in \nsome cases, in some circumstances, even more--for these people who \nwould be put in the line of fire, that we would, as one of the first \nthings, look at weakening the rights they are afforded and make them \nsecond-class citizens. This is very disturbing to me.\n\n  Think back to September 11, to the heroes of September 11. They were \nnot anyone in this Chamber. They were not anyone in the back room \nwriting this bill. They were working people. They were people, yes, who \nwere afforded the protections of collective bargaining; yes, afforded \nthe protections of union membership. They never looked at their watch \nand said: Oh, gee, I have been on the 74th floor of the World Trade \nCenter, and now I have worked 8 hours and I am coming down.\n  I just think it is most unfortunate that the President would not take \nthis opportunity to keep us together here, focused on protecting our \nmagnificent country and the people who reside therein, and instead use \nit as an opportunity to get through some of the things he was unable to \nget through in other bills. It is very disturbing to me.\n  I think Senator Lieberman has shown tremendous leadership in standing \nstrong for those protections. Again, the heroes of September 11 were \nunion members. The heroes of September 11 never let us down. How do you \ncreate a new Department such as this and undercut these employees when \nthey need to be at their top performance level, where they need to have \nthe best morale, where they need to believe they are not treated worse, \ncertainly, than any other Federal employee?\n  There are other things Senator Lieberman did in this bill that I \napplaud. A weakening of the Freedom Of Information Act that is in the \nHouse bill--that would have been a mess for us. Many of our communities \nwant to know what chemicals are polluting their air, ground, and water. \nAgain, some in the House use this as a way to weaken that act and say: \nWe cannot give out that information; the terrorists may get it. A \nmother of little children needs to know if there is arsenic in a plant, \nif there is a harmful pollutant at a plant. Therefore, I am very \npleased that, with Senator Leahy's help, where he was able to fix this, \nthat is not a problem.\n  For the remainder of my remarks, I focus on the Federal Emergency \nManagement Administration and a couple of other agencies that were just \nlifted and taken lock, stock, and barrel into this new, enormous \ncreation called the Department of Homeland Security. In California, we \nsuffer from every kind of natural disaster you can imagine, from \nearthquakes to fire, to flood, to drought, to pestilence. We see it \nall. Unfortunately, we see it often.\n  People sometimes say to me: Senator, why do people want to stay in \nCalifornia? Every other month, you are having another crisis.\n  I guess you have to just be there to understand. You are living in an \narea that is God's gift to the world. With that beauty come all these \nproblems.\n  The bottom line of it is, we, unfortunately, have a terrible share of \nthese disasters. Putting the Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration, lock, stock and barrel, into this new Department I just \nthink is going to be a real problem for us. Why not just take those \nfolks in the Department who would work on homeland security but leave \nthe others in place?\n  It took many years to straighten out the problems of FEMA. I have \ngone through the worst of it. Under President Clinton and under James \nLee Witt, we saw a tremendous uplifting of FEMA's morale. They know \nwhat they are doing now. All of us, Democrats and Republicans, have \nbenefited from that. Our people have benefited from that. Now we are \nmoving this, lock, stock and barrel, and I am very worried about \naccountability.\n  Others have spoken of the Coast Guard. I feel the same way about \nthat. Search and rescue--last year, the Coast Guard saved 530 lives in \nCalifornia. I know how important they are to homeland security, but the \nsame thing should apply here. You do not have to lift the whole thing \nup, lock, stock, and barrel.\n  We also have the INS situation, where the immigration and \nnaturalization services are very far behind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 2 additional minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Byrd. Now that he is here, I can tell him \nhow much I appreciate his raising the red flags.\n  The INS, backlogged with processing immigration--good people, kind \npeople, family people. It seems to me, again, we should have done this \nin a little bit of a different way.\n  If we really want to do something for homeland security, I would \nrather see\n\n[[Page S8073]]\n\nus spend the $5 billion that we passed in this Senate that spoke to the \nneed of homeland security and aviation security. We need more machines \nto check bags for bombs. We know the things we need to do at our ports. \nWe lack the infrastructure. Instead of spending time moving pegs on a \nboard and lifting agencies from one desk to another, I would rather go \nback and send the President that $5 billion and say to him that we \ndon't understand why he refused to spend this money. If he is so \nconcerned about homeland security, why did he say he wasn't going to \nspend this? He said it was bad for the economy because of the deficit.\n  I was an economics major. One thing we know is that if the Government \nspends and invests in the needs of the people, such as homeland \nsecurity, it is going to create thousands of jobs, and it would do \nsomething that is important. It doesn't help the economy to sit on that \nmoney. Frankly, it does not help the economy or homeland security if \nyou create a big bureaucracy and they have no place to even put these \npeople. And, by the way, if they are just going to be changed in name \nonly, it is very confusing to me why we are doing this.\n  From all of my years in public life, I think we could have done this \nin a very lean and mean way. We could have made this a Cabinet-level \nposition, which most of us supported. If the President wanted it to \nhappen, he could have said we are going to have people dispatched who \nreport to Tom Ridge and to each of these agencies and start to bring \nback and forth to him what we need to do in those agencies.\n  I thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a lot of serious \nquestions about this.\n  I thank my colleagues for their consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we have had a good discussion on this \nmotion to proceed.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for doing what he has done. I will say publicly \nwhat I told him privately before the recess: I thought he was doing all \nof us a favor by slowing us down a little bit. There was an awful lot \nof talk about we must get this done by September 11 for symbolic \nreasons, and symbolism is important. But it is not nearly as important \nas it is to get this right. We will not get it right forever. We will \nbe dealing with it probably for some time to come. But it is important \nto get it as right as we can. I think it is very important that we take \nthe time necessary to do that. We can disagree as to how long is enough \ntime. But I do think we can all agree that in retrospect, we were kind \nof headed toward a stampede there for a little while where we wanted to \nget something passed so we could say we got something passed. That \nreceives short-term benefits maybe to us but it doesn't do much in \nterms of long-term benefits to the country. I think we are where we \nneed to be now. We have come back. We have had a chance to digest this, \ndiscuss it, debate it in a public forum, and now to discuss it here on \nthe floor.\n  Senator Byrd made some very interesting and valid points about things \nthat we need to consider. He, I think rightfully, pointed out that the \nNSA creation was probably the model that not only the President is \ngoing by, but the model that we all can have in terms of importance and \nin terms of how long it takes to put these things together. It took a \ngood while to put the National Security Agency together. I believe it \ntook 6 months between the time the bill was introduced and the time \nthat it was passed. I point out that it was after a war. I do think \nprobably Congress had a little more leisure during those days than we \nhave. It was 2 years after the war. Of course, we are just beginning \nour endeavor. We don't have quite the leisure that perhaps the Congress \ndid at that time.\n  We have been considering the overall concept one way or another, \nformally or informally, for some time. The Gilmore Commission came in \nDecember of 2000 with a recommendation for a Homeland Security \nDepartment. The Hart-Rudman Commission came out in February, I believe, \nof last year, with a recommendation. We didn't pay enough attention to \nit soon enough. But it was out there. It was discussed and considered \nat that time. Congress, from time to time, has certainly considered \nmany of the component problems that have led to this bill.\n  For example, the problems with the INS are certainly no secret. We \nhave been dealing with that. We have been dealing with other problems \nthe Government has.\n  I suggest the time is ripe, and there is no reason now for us not to \naddress this issue after we have had a full-fledged discussion. I think \nthe analogy to the Transportation Security Administration that was \nreferred to and that was referred to in the newspaper today is a good \none. I think it shows the difficulty that we have when we establish an \nagency that is having to recreate itself on the one hand and do the job \non the other simultaneously. That is a very good point. What we are \ndoing here in terms of the Department of Homeland Security is TSA \nenlarged in many respects.\n  That leads me to perhaps a slightly different conclusion. That leads \nme to the conclusion that what we need to do to avoid that problem is \nto give the people who are in charge and have the responsibility for \nmaking sure this works the tools they can use to make it work. We had a \ncivil service organization system, and we had a management system, the \nparadigm for which was established many years ago. We live in a \ndifferent world now. That is what the President is talking about when \nhe is talking about managerial flexibility and having the tools with \nwhich to manage this thing.\n\n  If you talk to corporate leaders who have undergone transitions that \nare much less complicated than what we are doing, they talk about how \ndifficult it is and how important it is to have the right kind of \nculture but also to have the managerial talent, the managerial \nwherewithal and flexibility to address those thousands of problems and \ndifficulties that you are going to have in trying to pull all these \nfactors together. These corporate managers don't even have Congress to \nanswer to or deal with or worry about. Certainly, when it comes to \nGovernment, Congress cannot deal with each of these issues.\n  We have to either trust our leadership to the point of giving them \nsome managerial flexibility or not. I think that is what we are doing \nhere. That is what this is all about. It is not a major grant of new \npower; it is a granting of power by Congress after thorough \ndeliberation to better manage what Congress is establishing within the \ndiscretion of Congress, and having the annual appropriations process, \namong other hearings and considerations, in which to evaluate what is \ngoing on. I think we have to give that kind of authority if we are \ngoing to place on these people the kinds of responsibilities that we \nare placing on them.\n  There has been a concern expressed about personal liberties. \nDemocracy always has to--especially a democracy under attack--balance \nthe national security of the country with the personal liberties that \nwe hold so dear. I think we have done a pretty good job of that. Some \nof the things that the administration has done have been somewhat \ncontroversial. They are not really reflected in this bill. This bill \nreally doesn't deal with any of those things. But I do think it is \nappropriate to point out that in other times President Lincoln \ninstituted habeas corpus. President Roosevelt had internments, and \nthings of that nature. Other Presidents have taken rather severe action \nwhen they deemed it necessary in times of war and in times of national \nsecurity. We are not even approaching things of that nature. And we are \nnot really even approaching the subject matter in this bill.\n  So I respectfully suggest that there is no danger here of giving the \nPresident too much power. The danger, quite frankly, is that we are \nestablishing a new Department that is complex, multifaceted, and is \ngoing to be difficult to organize without giving the President some \nauthority that several other Government agencies already have, that the \nCongress has already given them.\n  We will have an opportunity to discuss this later when appropriate \namendments come up. But in the area of national security, and in the \narea of flexibility with regard to some of these agencies, what the \nPresident is basically asking for is the same authority that prior \nPresidents have had in the national security area, and the same\n\n[[Page S8074]]\n\nauthority for this new Department that other Department heads already \nhave. So I do not think we need to concern ourselves overly about that. \nBut I will say that it is refreshing to stand on this floor, to sit and \nlisten to someone such as Senator Byrd talk about first principles, \ntalk about the basic function of government, talk about the things the \nforefathers concerned themselves with, and the things we should concern \nourselves with as we go forward with this bill. But I suggest that it \nis time we go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-four minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I begin my closing remarks where I should begin, by \nthanking Senator Lieberman and Senator Thompson for the leadership they \nhave demonstrated in holding hearings, in holding the markups, in \nexploring the questions that were asked, in attempting to find \nsolutions to questions and concerns and problems that occurred to them \nthrough others and sometimes not through others. I thank these two \nSenators who represent, I believe, the finest.\n  I have been a Member of the body now 44 years next January 3, the \nLord willing. The fine old woman who raised me taught me to say that: I \nwill do thus and so or so and so, the Lord willing. Of course, that \ncomes from the Book of James, the 4th chapter, and the 14th and 15th \nverses: Don't say that you will go to a city tomorrow and that you will \npurchase thus and so and that you will do thus and so, but say, the \nLord willing, you will go and do thus and so.\n  And I thank these Senators. I am glad that the Good Lord has \npermitted me to live in this age when we can have Senators who acquire \nthe high qualities of the two Senators who are about to manage the \nlegislation that will create a Homeland Security Department.\n  I favor the creation of a Homeland Security Department. And I think \nthat the Senate within the next few minutes should vote unanimously to \nproceed to take up this legislation. That is the way it should be done. \nLet's take it up, and then let the Senate work its will.\n\n  I thank the two leaders for their cooperation in helping to bring \nthis about and in providing a time and an opportunity when we can mull \nover and talk about and decide these great questions that confront us.\n  I would have resisted going to the bill had the motion been made \nprior to the August recess. I would have resisted with all of my heart \nand all of my strength. But I do not resist going to the bill now. With \nthe Senate in recess, we have had a month in which to read the House \nbill, which largely reflects the administration's position, to read \nalso the legislation that has been reported from Senator Lieberman's \nand Senator Thompson's committee. And I have taken occasion to do just \nthat.\n  Now, when we proceed to take up the House bill, it will be done, and \nthen, at some point, presumably early on, Senator Lieberman will offer \nhis substitute. He will offer the committee of the committee which he \nchairs. And the Senate will then have both bills before it. The \nunderlying measure will be the House bill. And then there will be the \nsubstitute, which will be a clean bill reported by Senator Lieberman's \ncommittee. So the Senate will have before it both bills. Senators may \nproceed to amend the underlying bill. They may proceed to amend Senator \nLieberman's bill, the substitute. We will have both bills before us.\n  I call to the attention of Senators that once we pass this bill, \nwhatever the bill is that the Senate passes--I am not saying I am going \nto vote for it; I may--but whenever the Senate passes legislation \ndealing with the creation of a Department of Homeland Security, then \nthat is the last time the Senate will visit the matter until the \nlegislation comes back from the committee of conference. And that \nlegislation will be in the form of a conference report, which cannot be \namended. Senators will have to take that measure, then, up or down.\n  So this is it. This is our chance, and our only chance, to fully \ndiscuss and amend the legislation. And I hope Senators will approach \nthe matter in that vein, realizing that the product that emanates from \nthis Senate, after whatever time we take to debate and vote on it, will \nbe the final product the Senate itself will have had an opportunity to \nmold and to amend. That is it.\n  We are going to have to live with that. I have been greatly concerned \nabout the legislation, as I have read it, that the House has passed, \nand with particular reference to title VIII of that bill, which I will \nnot go into now.\n  But I have been greatly concerned. I am concerned that the \nConstitution and its principles and the rights and privileges that flow \nfrom that great document--which has no equal in the world as far as \ngovernmental, organic documents are concerned, no equal----\n  I am concerned that those rights and prerogatives that flow from that \ndocument will have been impinged upon. I am greatly concerned about the \nconstitutionality, in whole or in part, of some of the things that we \nare about to do--if we do them--that are particularly contained in the \nHouse bill.\n  Now, we may pass legislation that is unconstitutional, and if it is \nnever tried out in courts, it may be out there and there may not come \nan occasion where there is a case or controversy which goes to court. \nBut I say that we have a responsibility.\n  I used to hear Sam Ervin, that eminent jurist and great late Senator \nfrom North Carolina, say that we in the Senate have a duty to determine \nin our own minds the constitutionality of measures that we pass.\n  That is why I joined with Senators on both sides of the aisle in \nbringing the line-item veto and pushing that matter to a decision by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. Of course, we didn't have standing, as the \nCourt determined, but we did proceed; but those who did have standing \nwere pursuing it. Thank God, somebody pursued it, and I say thank God \nto the Supreme Court of the United States for throwing out that bad \nlegislation. I said it was bad and the Court agreed.\n  Here we are today with legislation that can certainly be dangerous in \nmany ways. I have talked about some of those things, and I will have a \nfurther opportunity. But before I proceed with my final prepared \nremarks, let me thank Senator Thompson and Senator Lieberman. I thank \nSenator Thompson for his closing remarks today, and I also thank \nSenator Lieberman. These are gentlemen and I respect them as gentlemen. \nThey have high and noble principles. That cannot be said of all men, of \ncourse.\n  We are here today because nearly 11 months ago, 19 men commandeered 4 \naircraft. Their goal we know all too well. They crashed one aircraft \ninto the Pentagon. One hurtled into the north tower of the World Trade \nCenter. Another tore into the south tower a few minutes later. The men \nand women aboard the final plane, after learning of the fate of the \nothers, decided to resist the hijackers. They knew that, in all \nlikelihood, they were about to die. But they entered into the embrace \nof death willingly after having decided to do what they could do to \nprevent the untimely and abrupt death of other men and women.\n  I have no doubt, as we were taken out of this Capitol that day, \nushered out by the policemen here, that that last plane was coming to \nhit this Capitol or the White House--one or the other. I just know in \nmy own mind that it was headed here. But those men and women on that \nplane died for us. Their plane crashed in rural Pennsylvania. If not \nfor the heroic efforts of those men and women, we would have scores of \nadditional names to remember as victims of the worse terrorist attack \nin the history of our country.\n  We are here today debating because of those 19 hijackers. We are here \nbecause of the rescue workers who moved so quickly, so selflessly, so \nvaliantly to save lives, only to lose their own while carrying out \ntheir duty. We are here because of those thousands of men and women \nwho, on September 11, 1 year ago, were sitting at the desks, walking \nthrough the halls, doing their jobs, only to have such brutality bring \nto an end their precious lives, and so abruptly. They never had time to \nsay good-bye to their loved ones. We are here, Senators, because we can \nnever forget that day and because we never want this Nation to have to \ngo through and experience the horrors of that day again.\n\n[[Page S8075]]\n\n  In many ways, the creation of a new Department of Homeland Security \nwill serve as a legacy to those more than 3,000 men and women who had \nlost their lives on that clear fall day 1 year ago. We must not rush to \ncreate a department in the memory of those who lost their lives on \nSeptember 11. If that Homeland Security Department does not better \nprevent another attack, what becomes of the sacrifice of those lives \nalmost 1 year ago? If in the rush to create a new department we make \nAmericans more vulnerable to attack while the transition is going \nforward rather than less, what kind of a legacy does that leave? What \ntribute does this Congress and this President pay to the victims of \nSeptember 11 if we only tangle the lines of homeland security rather \nthan straighten them and strengthen them?\n  I believe that much is to be said in gratitude to Senator Lieberman \nand Senator Thompson and their committee for their efforts to \nstraighten the lines. I honor and respect and pay tribute to these \nSenators and to the product which they have given this Senate and which \nwe will soon be discussing. But having been in various and sundry \nlegislative branches at the State and local levels and at the Federal \nlevel, I know there is no committee, including the one I chair, that \ncan be perfect.\n  As an experienced legislator, I look at this product in that fashion. \nIt is a good product. It is a much better product than that which the \nHouse has sent us after 2 days of floor debate. But I think the full \nSenate can do better.\n  I believe that if we act in haste to pass this legislation, then we \npay no tribute, we honor, no memory.\n  The legislation creates a new Department of Homeland Security. It is \noriginally based on the plan of four men--not exactly the committee of \nfive which wrote the Declaration of Independence. It is quite a \ndifferent group. I don't say that disparagingly of the four fine men \nwho came up with this idea in the bowels of the White House. But the \nlegislation to create a new Department is based on the plan that \noriginally was hatched in the subterranean caverns of the White House--\nfour men, fine men, sitting in the depths of the White House, trying to \ncounter mounting political pressures. These four men have done nothing \nmore, really, than shuffle boxes on a piece of paper.\n\n  The administration calls this the largest reorganization of \nGovernment since World War II. I say it is the largest reorganization \nof Government since our constitutional Framers sat at the Convention in \n1787. They reorganized the Government under the Articles of \nConfederation. Under that Government, under the Articles of \nConfederation, the Congress was the legislative, the executive, and the \njudicial. So those men reorganized the Government and gave to the \nvarious States, to vote on in their ratifying conventions, this product \nthat was signed by those men in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787.\n  That was the first reorganization. That was the greatest \nreorganization because no longer do we operate under the Articles of \nConfederation but we operate under the Constitution of the United \nStates. So now we have come to another reorganization proposal, the one \nwe have been discussing.\n  Terrorists have the advantage of knowing when they will strike, where \nthey will strike, and how they will strike. Law-abiding men and women \ndo not know when the terrorists will attack, where they will attack, or \nhow they will attack. If the truth be told, there is no department that \nthis Congress can conceive that alone can save Americans from terrorist \nattacks. Moving a few squares on a flowchart will not, on its own, save \nlives.\n  I remain suspicious about a complex, extensive reorganization plan \noriginally authored only by a group of four men in absolute secret, a \nplan which we are told was not revealed until the day the President \nrevealed it, at which time several of the Department heads, whose \nDepartments would be affected by the plan, had not been contacted and \nnot been consulted. That is what I understand from reading the press. \nSo I remain suspicious about a complex, extensive reorganization plan \nauthored only by a group of four men in absolute secret. I believe such \na plan is likely--likely--to be politically motivated somewhere along \nthe line. There is an old fiddle tune I used to play, ``Somewhere Along \nthe Line.''\n  I hope that is not true. I hope the motivations were pure, but should \nwe not all be a little suspicious of this process? Congress should be \nespecially careful, given the way this plan was formulated. We ought to \nconsider our actions thoroughly and realize that the steps we take in \nthe next few weeks will have ramifications for decades to come.\n  In the past few weeks, as the House select committee has held its \nhearings and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee has drafted its \nplan, the focus has not been on how to best save lives. Rather, the \nfocus, in part at least, has been on the ``bureaucratic turf wars'' \nthat have developed. Should Secret Service be in, or should Secret \nService be out?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The time under the Senator's \ncontrol has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have need for a few more minutes. May I \ncall upon the mercy of the distinguished Senator who chairs this \ncommittee, if he has time, if he would let this poor Senator from the \nhills of West Virginia have a few more minutes?\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator is moving me. I say to Senator Byrd, \nobviously I do not want to cut him off. I guess in return I ask for a \ncertain amount of mercy because I hope to leave in an hour to attend an \nevent at my daughter's school. The Senator may proceed as he will. I do \nnot intend to use the rest of my time, and I hope Senator Byrd will \nfinish with as much dispatch as he can and still make his points.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend from West Virginia yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering, with the three managers of the bill here on \nthis phase of the debate, if we can agree on what time we are going to \nvote today. The time runs out at 6:37 p.m. It is my understanding that \nSenators Thompson and Lieberman will be willing to give back some of \ntheir time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes, Senator Thompson has concluded his remarks. When \nSenator Byrd has finished, I will have concluding remarks that will go \nno longer than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Is Senator Byrd going to speak for 10 minutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, let me put it this way. As far as I am concerned, we \ncan vote now. As far as I am concerned, we can vote by voice. I intend \nto vote to proceed to take up this measure, but Senators have been told \nwe would vote. I will stop editorializing on my own remarks and read \nwhat I have prepared and sit down.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Fine. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. So the answer is we do not have a time certain.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. But no later than 6:36 p.m.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman, Senator \nLieberman, for his generosity.\n  What about the Secret Service, should it be in or out? What about the \nCoast Guard? Why is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms left \nout? While the 170,000 men and women targeted to move into this new \nDepartment try to figure out where the desks and telephones will be, \nthe Nation's homeland defense system may be far less effective, not \nmore.\n  We in the Congress must insist on more information about the fine \ndetails, such as what this plan means for the separation of powers, why \none agency was selected while others were left out. We must take time \nto determine if this approach is the best approach or if it is little \nmore than cherry-picking the best agencies while leaving others behind.\n  There will be those who charge that by moving to slow this \nlegislation, I and others are endangering the lives of Americans and \nthat we are thinking about our pet projects in our own States. What a \nsorry, empty claim to make. This Congress, at the urging of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee which I chair, has added $15 billion for \nhomeland security over the course of the past 8 months. That funding \nhas helped us to take immediate steps to make Americans safer from \nattack and to better prepare our response efforts should another attack \noccur.\n  That funding paid for more than 2,200 agents and inspectors to guard \nour\n\n[[Page S8076]]\n\nlong, porous borders with Canada and Mexico. The foreign student visa \nprogram, which has been identified as one of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service's chief loopholes, is undergoing a tighter \ntracking system because of funding that Congress included in its first \nhomeland security funding package within 3 days after the tragedy \noccurred in New York City.\n  Across this country, local police officers, firefighters, and \nemergency medical teams are receiving new training and equipment to \nhandle threats that before last fall they hardly considered possible. \nFederal law enforcement also benefited from the work of this Congress. \nBecause of the funding initiated by the Appropriations Committee, the \nFBI started to hire hundreds of new agents. More than 300 additional \nprotective personnel were hired to protect the Nation's nuclear weapons \ncomplex. Air marshals have been hired to protect our planes. Seven \nhundred and fifty food inspectors were hired to ensure the safety of \nthe meals served at America's kitchen tables. We have paid for smallpox \nvaccines and health department training. We are tightening security at \nour seaports and purchasing new bomb-detecting equipment at our \nairports. We are taking steps to protect American lives now, today, and \nnot just waiting for a bureaucratic shuffle to protect us.\n  Congress, the elected representatives of the people, have done this. \nCongress also acted to provide additional emergency funding to \nstrengthen terrorism prevention and to give much-needed aid to first \nresponders at the local level. But President Bush has refused to spend \nsome of these critical funds because he and OMB Director Mitch Daniels \nwant to make a point about budget discipline.\n  If the President is really serious about preventing terror, as he \nsays he is, he should not play politics with this important funding, \nwhich by the signature of his name could have been released to the \npeople at the local levels, throughout the land, for the protection of \nthe people and the protection of the infrastructure of our country.\n  Members of Congress and the President would like to be able to tell \nthe public that they honored the victims of September 11 by creating a \nnew Department for Homeland Security on the anniversary of the tragedy. \nThat is understandable for politicians. But as Senator Thompson pointed \nout, we want the right product. We want to take the time and do the job \nright.\n  In a few days, Americans will pause to remember the moment when the \nairplanes struck the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the \nPennsylvania field. We will remember the mothers and fathers, the \nbrothers and sisters, the firefighters, the police officers, the \nambulance drivers. We will remember all of those who lost their lives \nin those tragic moments. But as we craft this legacy to their lives, we \nowe them more than a press release. We owe them our best judgment. We \nowe them rational, responsible action. We owe them a legacy that may \ntruly save other lives, the lives of the people and the families of \nthose who died, the progeny of those fathers whose lives were wiped out \nin the batting of an eye.\n  Based on what we know about the legislative proposals before us, \nthere can be no assurance that such a legacy will ever result. I am \nconcerned that the monument that will result from this effort may be \none of weakened protections for America's civil servants, one that may \nallow the security that is our goal to buckle under the weight of an \nadministration's untold agenda. What will this legislation do to the \npeople's rights, to the first amendment, to the second amendment, the \nthird or fourth? Do we know what this bill does to the fundamental \nprotections embodied in the Constitution?\n  I am concerned about what we do not know about what has been kept \nfrom us by an administration adept at dealing in the shadows. I am \nconcerned that this bill goes too far to protect the privacy of the \nWhite House and not far enough to protect the privacy of law-abiding \ncitizens outside the White House.\n\n  We are being pressed to pass this legislation to protect American \nlives, but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded to the new threats \nit may present to our laws and our constitutional system if we pass the \nlegislation for which the administration has asked.\n  Each of us has an obligation not just to put a new banner over a \ncollection of agencies but to ensure that those agencies work together \nto protect the American people. Reorganizations of any size have a \ntendency to drift, to veer off course. A reorganization of the \nmagnitude envisioned is likely to careen out of our control if we do \nnot take the necessary steps to keep it on track. We cannot throw up \nour arms in celebration at the moment a bill is signed into law and \nwalk away wrapped in the folds of glory. If that is all we do, we will \nsurely drop the reins.\n  This Senate must do everything within its power now to ensure that \nthe promise embodied in this proposed reorganization is kept. We must \nfocus beyond the mere creation of a new Department and grapple with the \ndetails of its implementation. We should insist on a clear \nunderstanding of the mission of the new Department. We should know the \ncriteria that are used to determine which agencies will be part of it. \nWe should insist that the constitutional rights of the people are \nprotected. We should insist on assurances that this administration will \nnot use this reorganization as a cover to dismantle worker protections. \nWe should insist that the important non-homeland-security work of the \ntransferred agencies is not sacrificed as those agencies assume new \nmissions.\n  Senators know of my great respect and fondness for history of the \nancient Romans. Montesquieu first pointed the way, and having read a \ngreat deal of Montesquieu's work, I came to the conclusion that \nMontesquieu must have been right because he loved the history of the \nancient Romans. As a matter of fact, he wrote a history of the ancient \nRomans. So I decided I would do some of that reading, too.\n  I close with a quotation. Gaius Petronius Arbiter, a Roman poet and \nadvisor to Nero, is reported to have said:\n\n       We trained hard . . . but it seemed that every time we were \n     beginning to form into teams we would be reorganized. I was \n     to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation \n     by reorganizing; and a wonderful method it can be for \n     creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, \n     inefficiency and demoralization.\n\n  What a quotation from a Roman 2,000 years ago, and more. Before we \nrush ahead with so many questions unanswered, let us ensure that the \nproduct of our work is not just an illusion but substance. If it is a \nmonument we are building, let it be one that will endure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I simply thank the very able Senator \nfrom West Virginia for once again calling on the Senate to face these \nvery fundamental questions that are involved and which he has been \nspeaking to in the course of the day. I think it behooves all of our \ncolleagues not only to have listened to the able Senator but to go back \nand read his remarks and to consider them carefully and thoughtfully as \nwe address this major legislation.\n  Now we are embarked, of course, on creating a new Department, but we \nneed to be very careful in how we do it. We need to be very thorough in \nhow we do it. We need to be very thoughtful in how we do it.\n  I commend the chairman of the committee, the able Senator from \nConnecticut, because I think he has brought all of those qualities to \nthis legislation that he has now brought forth in the Senate.\n  There are very important questions involved here in terms of how the \npolitical system works and how the checks and balances work and what \nthe allocation of powers is. Some say this is a fight over turf or over \nprerogatives. It is no such thing. This is trying to resolve the most \nbasic questions about how our system of self-government is to work and \nwhat the balance is to be between the legislative and the executive \nbranches; indeed, the judicial branch is drawn into this, as well.\n  I hope as we address this legislation in the days to come, my \ncolleagues keep in mind the analysis and the history which the Senator \nfrom West Virginia has brought to the floor today. I express my deep \nappreciation once again. He reminds us of the fundamental questions we \nconfront and of the importance of rising to this occasion.\n\n[[Page S8077]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for the generous remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I agree with my friend from Maryland: The Senator from \nWest Virginia has made a contribution here with his thoughtful \nleadership over the years, of course, and his thoughtful statements \ntoday. Even when I do not meet the statements with personal agreement, \nI know he forces me to think about fixed premises that I may bring to \nthe debate, as well as everyone in this case, and that will make the \nproduct of our deliberations better than it would otherwise be.\n  I was thinking about the quote at the end of Senator Byrd's remarks. \nIt is true that reorganization or reform can sometimes not be in the \ninterest of progress and can be a cover for disorganization and an \nexcuse for inaction more broadly.\n  I do want to argue that this proposal that has come out of the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, which builds on work that had been done \nby the Hart-Rudman Commission, which meshed with recommendations from \nthe White House, is a necessary reorganization.\n  The current state of reality in our Federal Government is that we are \ndisorganized. It is in some ways dysfunctional as it comes to \nprotecting the security of the American people from a threat we have \nimagined, we have seen some small evidence of over the years. But on \nSeptember 11 we were shocked from our lethargy and our apathy and our \ntolerance of disorganization, seeing the painful personal consequences \nof that disorganization--almost 3,000 Americans dead only because they \nwere Americans, struck in a vicious and savage and cunning way only \nbecause they were Americans. They did not have the courage to take us \non on a conventional field of battle but struck an undefended target \nfull of innocent Americans.\n  That disorganization can no longer be tolerated. I have a sense of \nurgency about this. I look at the evidence we have accumulated about \nthe various ways in which our intelligence and law enforcement \npersonnel could have cooperated, could have shared information prior to \nSeptember 11. I wonder, could we have prevented this from happening? I \nlook at the way in which we have tolerated disorganization and overlap \nat our borders with failures of the various Federal agencies there and \ninability even to communicate with one another. I look at our ports, \nwith 95 percent of the goods coming into the United States of America. \nMost people are shocked by this number: 95 percent come in by ship, yet \nthe Customs Service is able to truly inspect only 1 percent of the \ncontainers coming in.\n  I could go on and on about airport security pre-September 11 and \nsecurity of our financial systems, cybersystems, and all the rest. We \nare just not organized to prevent what happened on September 11 from \never happening again.\n  In this regard, I have the echo in my mind of a meeting I attended \nsome months ago with families of victims of September 11, mostly \nfamilies of victims because most of them were from Connecticut, some \nfrom New York, who died in the World Trade Center. The plaintive \nquestion they asked me was, how could this have happened? I do not want \nto ever be in a position to face another group of fellow Americans who \nask me again, how could this have happened?\n  I make no claims that adoption of the bill that our committee has \nreported on will be a guarantee against terrorism. I suppose if someone \nhas so little regard for their own life and other lives that they are \nprepared to strap bombs around themselves and walk into a crowd, that \nis not easy to stop. But something as well planned, as comprehensive, \nwith as many contacts with private sector bodies, including flight \ntraining schools and public agencies, we should be able to prevent. The \nonly way to begin to do it is to create a structure that is \naccountable, that has a uniform chain of command, and that will put \npeople in place to overcome the gaps the terrorists took advantage of \non September 11.\n\n  That is why I have urgently brought this matter to the floor, with \nthe wonderful bipartisan group of members of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee who contributed substantially to the product on the floor, \nand the various Members of the Senate on both sides with whom we have \nworked on parts of this proposal. There were 18 hearings, 3 or 4 days \nof committee meetings and markup. A lot of work has been done on this, \nbuilding on work that had been done years before by others, as to how \nwe can best protect the American people from terrorism.\n  It is time to proceed. We have had a very good opening day of debate. \nObviously, there are some differences of opinion regarding the pace of \naction in Congress or whether the executive branch is seeking or being \ngiven too much authority, whether one or another agency that is \nconsolidated by this bill should be consolidated, how strong our \nintelligence division should be in this Department, how much should we \nbring matters together. Should we give this President and his \nsuccessors unprecedented authority over civil service and Federal \nemployees?\n  All of these matters, I know, will be directly discussed in the days \nahead. And many of them, if not all of them, will be subjects of \namendment before this Chamber. This is a big bill. It is a big proposal \nwhich responds to an urgent problem. As others have said, it would be \nthe largest reorganization of the Federal Government in 50 years, since \nthe post-World War II reorganization of our national security \napparatus. That is what the reality of our times requires. It is why we \nneed the debate we will have in the days, and perhaps weeks, ahead.\n  In the paper today, there is a story that our intelligence service is \nworking with foreign intelligence services and has tracked the movement \nof gold, substantial amounts of gold, apparently owned by al-Qaida, \nfrom Pakistan through Iran, the United Arab Emirates, into Sudan, where \nit may be in Khartoum now. What does this tell us? That the enemy is \nout there, that we won a victory, a great victory, in Afghanistan, but \nthat was only the first battle of the war.\n  Again, the enemy is not out there on a field of battle where we can \nsee them, or in ships at sea. They are in the shadows. They have not \ndiminished their intention to strike at America, and Americans only, \nbecause we are America and Americans. Now we, as the representatives of \nthe American people here in Congress, we draw ourselves together, to \nhave our debate, have our discussion, but in the end, to do what we \nmust do to create a Department of Homeland Security that will be a \nstrong line of defense against al-Qaida and anyone else out there \nintending to strike at the American people here at home.\n  One thing I do know, in the midst of all the debate, is we are ready \nto proceed. We have had a good opening day. Many more days of debate \nwill come. But on the specific motion before us now, the motion to \nproceed, I am sure we are ready to vote.\n  I yield whatever remaining time I have and I ask for the yeas and \nnays on the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to proceed. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I would like to make some brief remarks \nabout the nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen of Texas who has been \nscheduled for a vote in the Judiciary Committee as early as this \nThursday. I cannot say strongly enough how important this vote is for \nthe future of the Judiciary and this Senate.\n  With the attempt by some to introduce ideology and base politics into \nthe confirmations process, today a sword of Damocles hangs over the \nfuture of nominations and our constitutional role and no vote will hint \nthe future more than this upcoming vote on Justice Owen.\n  Justice Owen has been attacked with orchestrated deceptions, \ndistortions and demagoguery, yet she has the American Bar Association's \nunanimous rating of well qualified.''\n  In preparing for Justice Owen's vote, I again commend to my \ncolleagues the words of Senator Biden when he said some years ago that:\n\n       [Judicial confirmation] is not about pro-life or pro-\n     choice, conservative or liberal, it is not about Democrat or \n     Republican. It is about intellectual and professional \n     competence to serve as a member of the third co-equal branch \n     of the Government.\n\n  Allow me to make just some brief remarks on the allegations made \nagainst Justice Owen which she clarified both in the hearing and in \nanswers to written questions since then.\n  First, and most outrageously, it was said that she delayed in issuing \nan opinion in a car accident case involving a boy who subsequently died \nand that he died while waiting for her decision. And that she raised an \nissue, court venue, not previously raised by the lawyers.\n  The truth is that Justice Owen wrote an opinion for the majority in \nthat case just 5 days after the majority reached a decision. The boy \ndied 3 years later. And venue is automatically at issue when the \npetition is for a new trial and it was both briefed and argued by the \nlawyers, as was the case. That's the truth.\n  There is no use in holding hearings and asking written questions if \nwe ignore the answers.\n  Second, she has been accused of being a `` judicial activist'' who \npursues an outcome-based result.\n  The truth is that she is a judicious judge who never digresses from \nthe rules of precedent and legal construction. She always grounds her \ndecision in binding authority or judicial rules of decision. The charge \nthat she is a judicial activist is a cynical trick of words from \nWashington lobbyists who have made their careers defending court \ndecisions of real judicial activists who never let the words of the \nConstitution stand between them and their social engineering.\n  Another falsehood is that she is anti-abortion and is out to defeat \nabortion rights.\n  The truth is that Owen has never stated her personal views and has \nruled in one case for Planned Parenthood and against Operation Rescue \npro-life protestors. In the parental involvement cases, Owen repeatedly \napplied Roe v Wade and the Supreme Court cases and used them to \ninterpret the legislature's choice of words in the statute.\n  It is said that in her parental notice cases, Owen sought to limit \nabortion rights.\n  The truth is that no abortion right is affected by giving mere notice \nto parents. And over 600 bypasses of notice have been granted by the \ncourts under the standards Owen and her court established. The Texas \nSupreme Court merely debated the guidelines for lower courts to apply \non a brand new law. The Court sought to effect the legislature's \nintent: to protect parental involvement rights, the right of parents to \nguide their children and protect them from harm was at stake, not \nabortion.\n  Justice Owen has been called an ideologue who is out of the \nmainstream.\n  The truth is that Owen was twice elected in Texas, the last time with \n83 percent of the vote. She is a quiet, modest person, who leads her \nChurch choir, and had to be convinced to leave a lucrative law practice \nto become a judge. She was unanimously rated well-qualified, the \nhighest rating of the ABA, despite the ABA's pro-abortion stance.\n  It was noted that Justice Owen dissents too often and rules in favor \nof corporations and big money.\n  The truth is that she has dissented fewer than 10 percent of the \ntime, that's half the average for any current U.S. Supreme Court \njustice. She is an umpire who calls the balls and the strikes as they \nare. It is silly to suggest that she is pro-bat or pro-ball, pro-batter \nor pro-pitcher.\n  Let's speak truth to power.\n  The main reason Justice Owen is being opposed, is not that personal \nviews are being falsely ascribed to her, they are, but rather because \nshe is a woman in public life who is believed to have personal views \nthat some maintain are unacceptable for a woman in public life to have.\n  Such penalization is a matter of the greatest concern to me because \nit represents a new glass ceiling for women jurists just as they \napproach the tables of our high courts after long-struggling careers. \nSuch treatment will have a chilling effect on women jurists that will \nkeep them from weighing in on exactly the sorts of cases that most \ninvite their participation and their perspectives as women.\n  On abortion, the truth is that, rather than being an activist foe of \nRoe, Justice Owen repeatedly cites and follows Roe and its progeny as \nauthority.\n  Moreover, her opponents portray her as a pro-life activist, when all \nshe has ever done is rule on a parental involvement law, popular with \nover 80 percent of the American people. The bottom line is that they \nare blinded to anyone who will not abide by abortion on demand even for \nlittle girls, without parents ever knowing.\n  I hope my colleagues will treat Justice Owen fairly when the vote \ncomes. As they say back home in Utah, I hope they will choose the \nright.\n  But I warn them, the American people will hear of the result, and I \nwarn them also, a sword of Damocles will hang over the Senate and the \nfuture of the Judiciary Committee when that vote comes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8078-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8078-S8079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE HONORABLE JESSE BROWN\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to learn of the \nuntimely death of Jesse Brown on August 15, 2002. I was aware of \nJesse's struggle with Lou Gehrig's disease, and know that friends, \nveterans and government officials across the Nation had Jesse and his \nfamily in their thoughts and prayers.\n  Jesse was an individual for whom I had the highest regard. He was \ntruly a\n\n[[Page S8079]]\n\ndistinguished American who not only made considerable sacrifices for \nhis country as a Marine in Vietnam, but continued to serve our country, \nespecially the veterans of our Nation through his service as Executive \nDirector of the Disabled American Veterans and later as Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs for 5 years in the cabinet of President Clinton.\n  It was during his tenure as VA Secretary that I worked more closely \nwith Jesse and had the opportunity to learn of his commitment to our \nnation's veterans particularly to improve the medical care services to \nveterans. During a visit to the community of Grafton, ND for the \ndedication of an outpatient clinic, I had the opportunity to see first \nhand Jesse's concern and compassion for our veterans and their \nfamilies. I was particularly impressed with his commitment to make \ncertain that our veterans living in the rural and more remote areas of \nour country had the resources and access to the best VA medical care \npossible.\n  Jesse Brown represents the very best of America, he was a U.S. Marine \nwith a distinguished service record in Vietnam, a disabled veteran, a \ndevoted family member, a distinguished public servant, and an \nindividual that represented the very best qualities and character in \nAmerica. He is a role model for the coming generations and for us all. \nI hope our younger Americans will have an opportunity to know Jesse \nover time, to learn of his sacrifices and accomplishments on behalf of \nall Americans. Jesse deserves our highest respect and admiration.\n  My prayers and thoughts are with the Brown family members at this \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8079-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Madam President, I rise today to thank Angela Marshall-\nHofmann, who has worked on my staff for more than a decade.\n  I first met Angela in 1990. She was a reporter for the school \nnewspaper at Eastern Montana College during her freshman year. Angela \nmet me at the Billings airport to do an interview, and after the \ninterview was over, she indicated she would like to be an intern in my \nBillings office.\n  I told her to come in--and she did such a great job that when a part-\ntime position opened up, we hired her. She continued to work in the \nBillings office until she graduated from college.\n  During her time in the Billings office, Angela began to develop an \ninterest in trade issues. She worked on setting up a state visit by \nseveral Ambassadors, and helped draft an export manual for Montana's \nsmall businesses.\n  During her senior year of college, she was encouraged to apply for \nthe Rotary Club's International Scholarship. There is always a talented \npool of students in Montana that applies for that prestigious \nscholarship--and Angela won it. She used it to study in France for a \nyear, and continued to focus on international trade.\n  When she came back from France she went to law school in Missoula and \nbegan work in our Missoula office. During her time there she got \ninvolved with the Mansfield Center and helped to plan their \ninternational conferences, including one in China.\n  In 1997, Angela finally came east to work in our Washington, DC \noffice, with a portfolio that included both agriculture and trade \nissues. During that time, she organized and traveled on trade missions \nto Asia and to South America.\n  Angela has always been one of the best multitaskers I know. When she \nworked in the Missoula office, she was going to law school and teaching \ndance classes--and doing great at all three.\n  These days, I think she has taken multitasking to a new level. With \ntwin babies Marshall and Stephen at home and all of her \nresponsibilities at work, she still manages to thrive.\n  And not only does Angela thrive, she does so with a positive attitude \nthat makes her one of the most pleasant people to work with. I doubt \nthere is anyone who has a bad thing to say about her. And after all her \nyears on Capitol Hill--that is really saying something.\n  I was perhaps most proud of Angela, however, when she was asked this \nyear to be the commencement speaker at Montana State University in \nBillings--formerly Eastern. She spoke as one of MSU's most \ndistinguished alumni. I believe she inspired the graduating students to \nachieve and accomplish many great things--as Angela has.\n  Angela has truly done it all--from intern, part-time staffer, and \nreceptionist, to legislative assistant, and now international trade \ncounsel to the Senate Finance Committee. She has worked on issues that \nare vital to Montana, including softwood lumber an agriculture. She has \nhelped pass historic legislation, including Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations for China and this year's Trade Act.\n  Angela--thank you for your years of hard work, for your dedication to \nthe State of Montana, and for the service to your country. You will \ntruly be missed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8079-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8079-S8080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   IN RECOGNITION OF THE CENTENNIAL OF BIG BASIN REDWOODS STATE PARK\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 100th anniversary of the creation of California's oldest \nState park, Big Basin Redwoods State Park, located 25 miles northwest \nof Santa Cruz. Big Basin holds the distinction of being home to the \nlargest continuous stand of Ancient Coast Redwoods south of San \nFrancisco.\n  Big Basin Redwoods State Park was the first of California's 269 State \nparks to be set aside by the State legislature in September, 1902. Its \ncreation was the result of a turn of the century community organizing \ncampaign. San Jose photographer Andrew P. Hill gathered a group of \nwriters, educators and women's club members for an exploratory \nexpedition to the Santa Cruz Mountains, the area we know today as Big \nBasin. They formed the Sempervirens Club and began lobbying for \npreservation of the area as a public park. Their intention was to save \nthese trees for posterity.\n  Today we celebrate the foresight and dedication of Andrew P. Hill and \nhis friends. Big Basin Redwoods State Park is seen as the birthplace of \nthe movement to save California's coastal redwoods and the birthplace \nof the entire State park system.\n  This system contains magnificent diversity and beauty ranging from \nthe majestic forests of Northern California to the sun-baked deserts of \nSouthern California and from the vibrant blue surf of the Pacific \nshoreline to the glorious peaks of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range.

Mr. President, I pay tribute to a great \nCalifornian, Samuel ``Skip'' Keesal, Jr. Skip will be honored by \nLeadership Long Beach with its prestigious Excellence in Leadership \nAward on October 3, 2002.\n  ``Excellence in Leadership'' aptly describes Skip Keesal and his long \nand distinguished career. Since founding the law firm of Keesal, Young \nand Logan in 1970, he has tried more than 250 cases, has been named a \n``Best Lawyer in America'' for both his civil and maritime work, and \nwas invited to join the distinguished International Academy of Trial \nLawyers. The awards and acknowledgments he has won are too numerous to \nfully review and place him among the most honored lawyers in America. \nIndeed, Skip's career is worthy of an award for ``Excellence in \nLeadership.''\n  Skip Keesal could easily win a second ``Excellence in Leadership'' \naward for his exemplary community work. He serves on the boards of \ndirectors for many community organizations that serve children, provide \ncommunity healthcare and educate young people. His work has helped the \nCity of Long Beach prosper and its residents to live better, healthier \nlives.\n  Skip and his wife, Beth, have three adult children. I know all will \njoin Skip in celebrating this award. I congratulate Skip Keesal and \nencourage him to keep up his very good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8080-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    INLAND AGENCY'S 33D ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on October 12, 2002, the Inland \nAgency will celebrate 33 years of outstanding service to Riverside, San \nBernardino, Inyo and Mono Counties. I would like to take a moment to \nacquaint my colleagues with this organization's exceptional record of \nservice to the community.\n  Since 1969, Inland Agency has provided a wealth of programs and \nservices for the community's diverse populations. It serves more than \n132,000 individuals through its health, youth violence prevention and \ncommunity strengthening programs.\n  In the area of health care, the agency has a caregivers' program, a \nhealth insurance counseling program geared toward seniors, and a \nprogram called the Desert Sierra Breast Cancer Partnership that has \nprovided education and free breast cancer screenings to thousands of \npeople.\n  In efforts to reduce youth violence and make sure children are led in \nthe right direction, Inland Agency provides education, violence \nprevention training for children and their parents, and administers \nafter-school programs so that students have a safe, nurturing place to \ngo after the school bell rings. I am proud to note that the Community \nPeace Program, through its education to thousands of children this \nyear, has helped reduce crime in the community. In addition, the agency \ntakes a step further with its Project YES program, which strengthens \nchildren's academic and leadership abilities so they can be well \nprepared for a bright future ahead.\n  Not only does the Inland Agency reach out to individuals, but it also \nseeks to make a difference in the communities it serves. Through its \nCommunity Tool Box program in Adelanto, the agency gives community \nmembers the tools they need to strengthen and improve their \nneighborhoods and make them better places to live.\n  It is clear that Inland Agency exemplifies the best in American \ncommunity spirit in all it does. I extend my very best wishes to each \nstaff member and volunteer for improving the quality of life for \nthousands of people, and I wish them all many more years of continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8080-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORIAM: DANIEL LEE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to share with the Senate the memory of one of my \nconstituents, Daniel Lee, who lost his life on September 11, 2001. Mr. \nLee was 34 years old when the plane he was on, American Airlines Flight \n11, was hijacked by terrorists. As we all know, that plane crashed into \nthe World Trade Center, killing everyone on board.\n  Daniel Lee grew up in Palm Desert, CA. He was a carpenter and a \ndrummer in a local southern California band. He met his wife, Kellie, \nin 1991 at a rock concert in which he was playing the drums. They were \nmarried October 7, 1995 and their first child, Amanda Beth, was born \nDecember 11, 1998.\n  Mr. Lee was a dedicated and successful set carpenter in the music \nindustry, known to work 20 hour days when necessary. He worked with \nmany talented musicians including Neil Diamond, Barbra Streisand, \nN'Sync, Aerosmith and Yanni. He was touring with the Backstreet Boys \nwhen, on September 11, 2001, he left to fly home to be with his wife as \nshe was a about to give birth to their second child. Allison Danielle \nLee was born September 13, 2001.\n  Kellie Lee recalls Dan's bright, relaxed and charming smile. ``He was \ncaring, loving, funny and romantic. He loved being a dad and was so \nexcited about having another child on the way,'' she says. One of his \nspecial joys was getting friends together for barbeques and pool \nparties,'' Kellie remembers.\n  Dan Lee is survived by his wife, Kellie Lee, his daughters, Amanda \nand Allison, mother and stepfather Elaine and John Sussino, brothers \nJack Fleishman and Stuart Lee and sister, Randi Kaye.\n  None of us is untouched by the terror of September 11, and many \nCalifornians were part of each tragic moment of that tragic day. Some \nwere trapped in the World Trade Center towers. Some were at work in the \nPentagon. And the fates of some were sealed as they boarded planes \nbound for San Francisco or Los Angeles.\n  I offer today this tribute to one of 51 Californians who perished on \nthat awful morning. I want to assure the family of Daniel Lee, and the \nfamilies of all the victims, that their fathers and mothers, sons and \ndaughters, aunts, uncles, brothers and sisters will not be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8080-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8080-S8081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SOUTH DAKOTA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER CELEBRATES 100 YEARS OF SERVICE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, it is with great honor that I \nrise today to congratulate the South Dakota Developmental Center, SDDC, \nfor its 100 years of service.\n  The SDDC was established in 1899 by the South Dakota State \nLegislature as the Northern Hospital for the Insane. The Center \naccepted its first admissions in 1902 to meet the needs of individuals \nwith developmental disabilities for the State of South Dakota. One \nHundred years later, the Center continues to serve South Dakota and the \nneeds of its citizens.\n  Over the last century, the South Dakota Developmental Center in \nRedfield, SD has provided quality services to individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities who do not have the option of receiving care \nfrom a community-based center. To meet the needs of its patients, \nservices are provided by specialists from many areas of health care, \nincluding Audiology, Optometry, Chemical Dependency Counseling, \nDentistry, Nutrition, Teaching, Physical Therapy, Pharmacy, Nursing, \nPsychiatry, Speech Pathology, Vocational Instruction, Mental Health \nTherapy, and Occupational Therapy. These staff members enable the SDDC \nto meet the needs of its diverse population, and help them reach their \nultimate goal, a higher level of independence.\n  This year also marks 100 years of partnership between the local \ncommunity and the SDDC. Currently, the SDDC employs more than 400 \nstaff, making them a major employer in the Redfield area. The impact of \nSDDC on the local economy cannot be overstated. The SDDC not only \nprovides quality jobs to more than 400 individuals, but indirectly \nhelps sustain numerous community businesses, organizations, and public \nservices.\n\n[[Page S8081]]\n\n  I am pleased to announce that the South Dakota Development Center is \nplanning a centennial celebration on September 20, 2002. The centennial \ncelebration includes a rededication of several buildings on campus, an \naward ceremony, a luncheon, special afternoon activities, and an \nevening social at the local VFW for returning former employees, \ndignitaries, special guests and friends.\n  I am proud to have this opportunity to honor the South Dakota \nDevelopment Center for its 100 years of outstanding service. It is an \nhonor for me to share with my colleagues the exemplary leadership and \nstrong commitment to individuals with developmental disabilities that \nthe South Dakota Development Center has provided. I strongly commend \ntheir years of hard work and dedication, and I am very pleased that \ntheir substantial efforts are being publicly honored and \ncelebrated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8081-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO NORMAN TATE: DELAWARE'S FIREMAN OF THE YEAR\n\n   Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, over the past year, our Nation \nhas endured heartbreak and celebrated heroes, especially the members of \nthe fire service who, in a very profound sense, became the face of \nAmerica on that fateful day last September.\n  In my State of Delaware, we celebrate a very special hero of our fire \nservice, Norman Tate, who has been chosen as the 2002 Delaware \nVolunteer Fireman's Association Fireman of the Year.\n  The truth is, Norm Tate has earned this award--and could have \nreceived it deservedly--in any number of years. He has been a \nfirefighter with the Seaford Volunteer Fire Department since 1959, and \nnow holds Life Member status. He has served in, literally, every \nadministrative office of his department, and on the ambulance squad; he \nhas twice been named Seaford's Fireman of the Year--the only member \never, in a century-long history, to receive the award more than once, \nand again, he could have received it, and deserved it, just about any \nyear.\n  Norm has also been the Fireman of the Year for Sussex County and for \nthe Delmarva Volunteer Fireman's Association, and was instrumental in \nsetting up the Delaware Volunteer Fireman's Association, DVFA, State \nConference. He did the hard organizational and persuasive work of \ncommittee chairman, and has been honored with the title of President \nEmeritus of DVFA.\n  Beyond the fire service, Norm Tate has been a leader in the Seaford \nLions Club, and received the Lion of the Year Award. He also received \nthe ``Voice of the Blue Jays'' award for outstanding service to the \nSeaford School District, and the Distinguished Service Award from the \nCity of Seaford.\n  In short, Norman Tate defines citizen-leadership. He is the \nextraordinary ordinary American who becomes a hero, not by ambition but \nin response to the needs of his community and his country. He has a \ndeep sense of responsibility, as well as pride, arising from his \ncitizenship; he looks for opportunities to help; he undertakes service \nas a privilege.\n  Norm Tate is being honored as Delaware's Volunteer Fireman of the \nYear, as his beloved Seaford Volunteer Fire Department celebrates 100 \nyears of service to the community. There could not be--at Seaford or in \nany fire company a more appropriate honoree in such a meaningful \nanniversary year.\n  Norm Tate is, quite simply, the best, and as the fellow citizens he \nhas served so well, we in Delaware are proud to honor him; as his \nfriend, I am privileged to know him, and blessed by the influence of \nhis generous and gracious spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8081-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, ATLANTA, GEORGIA\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, 27 years ago the National \nMedical Association and other prominent organizations endorsed the \ndevelopment of the Medical School at Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA. \nThis came in light of studies that revealed, first, a severe shortage \nof African-American and other minority physicians in the United States, \nparticularly in Georgia, and, second, that African-Americans suffered \ndisproportionately from major diseases. Since its inception, Morehouse \nSchool of Medicine has worked to help solve our Nation's healthcare \ncrisis by graduating top-quality physicians who dedicate themselves to \nserving the more than 32 million people in this country who live in \nmedically neglected communities. Seventy percent of Morehouse School of \nMedicine graduates practice in underserved communities.\n  The entering M.D. class has grown from 24 students in 1978 to its \ncurrent 44. Each year, more than 20,000 Georgians who are disadvantaged \nare served by approximately 30 community health promotion projects \nsponsored by Morehouse School of Medicine. These projects include \nprevention initiatives associated with substance abuse, teen pregnancy, \ngeriatric services, cancer, lead poisoning, and violence prevention. In \naddition, Morehouse School of Medicine faculty provides about 75,000 \npatient encounters per year in community clinics throughout \nmetropolitan Atlanta. The student body of Morehouse School of Medicine \ncontinues to excel. For the past few years, 100 percent of the school's \nfamily medicine residents have passed their board exams in their first \nsitting.\n  These accomplishments grow out of strong leadership, beginning with \nthe vision of Dr. Hugh M. Gloster of Morehouse College and Morehouse \nSchool of Medicine's founding dean and first president, Dr. Louis W. \nSullivan, and continuing with Dr. James R. Gavin, the current \npresident. Since its inception in 1975, Morehouse School of Medicine \nhas established a four-year medical education program, a master of \npublic health program, a Ph.D. program in the biomedical sciences, \nseven residency programs, and several centers of excellence. These \ncenters include the Neuroscience Institute, the Cardiovascular Research \nInstitute, and the NASA/Space Medicine and Life Science Research \nCenter, the first of its kind at a minority medical institution.\n  Today we celebrate the new home of one of those centers of \nexcellence, the National Center for Primary Care. This state-of-the-art \nfacility will house an exceptional team of administrators, educators, \nand researchers devoted to eliminating health disparities in this \ncountry.\n  Georgia should, indeed, be grateful for this new jewel in our crown. \nUnder the guidance of former Surgeon General David Satcher, Director of \nthe National Center for Primary Care, this healthcare think tank is \npoised to educate and illuminate for decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8081-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8081-S8082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ON THE DEDICATION OF THE YSMAEL R.

Madam President, on September 6, the new Ysmael R. \nVillegas Middle School will be dedicated in Riverside, CA. This day \nwill hold a particularly special meaning for the people of Riverside, \nas this new school is named for one of the community's most \ndistinguished military heroes, Staff Sgt. Ysmael R. Villegas, an \nHispanic-American killed in the line of duty during World War II. He \ndied only one day before his 21st birthday and received the \nCongressional Medal of Honor for his bravery.\n  Sergeant Villegas, a resident of Casa Blanca in the Riverside \ncommunity, received the prestigious Congressional Medal of Honor for \nhis valiant bravery while defending our country in the Philippines. His \ncitation, in part, reads:\n\n       He moved boldly from man to man, in the face of bursting \n     grenades and demolition charges, through heavy machinegun and \n     rifle fire, to bolster the spirit of his comrades. As he \n     neared his goal, he was hit and killed by enemy fire. Through \n     his heroism and indomitable fighting spirit, Staff Sergeant \n     Villegas, at the cost of his life, inspired his men to a \n     determined attack in which they swept the enemy from the \n     field.\n\n  It is clear from these words that Sergeant Villegas was truly a great \nAmerican war hero. The people of Riverside have every reason to \nmemorialize him and I am pleased that the Alvord Unified School \nDistrict will give him this lasting legacy.\n  As the Alvord Unified School District and the City of Riverside \ncelebrate the dedication of the Ysmael R. Villegas Middle School, I \nextend my best wishes\n\n[[Page S8082]]\n\nto all those who made this important day possible.

Madam President, I rise today on behalf of the \npeople of the State of Ohio to congratulate Ohio Attorney General Betty \nMontgomery and her staff for being selected to receive the 2002 \nAmerican Bar Association, ABA, Pro Bono Publico Award.\n  In May 2000, Betty Montgomery unveiled an office-wide Pro Bono \nInitiative to provide legal assistance for low-income seniors and \nhospice patients across Ohio. Through this program, participating staff \nattorneys offer their time and talents to provide legal assistance to \nthose who can't afford it. Once training is completed, attorneys are \nallowed to provide their services at no charge for up to 40 hours a \nyear. Services provided by assistant attorneys general include wills, \ngeneral powers of attorney, durable powers of attorney for health care, \nand other ``end-of-life'' legal issues.\n  Since the program's inception, 125 assistant attorneys general, 20 \nparalegals, and 15 secretaries have answered the call to help \nunderserved Ohioans handle their legal matters. To date, the office has \nserved 625 clients by providing them with 1,235 healthcare powers of \nattorney, living wills, powers of attorney, and wills.\n  This year, the Attorney General's office is one of five recipients of \nthe ABA Pro Bono Publico Awards. The Pro Bono Publico Awards were \nestablished by the ABA in 1984 and are presented annually by the ABA \nStanding Committee on Pro Bono and Public Service to recognize lawyers, \nlaw firms and corporate law departments for extraordinarily noteworthy \ncontributions in extending legal services to the poor and \ndisadvantaged.\n  This is not the first time that the Attorney General's office has \nbeen honored for these services. In 2001, the Columbia Bar Foundation \nand Association recognized the program with its award for Outstanding \nPro Bono Service by a Governmental Agency. In addition, the Ohio Legal \nassistance Foundation and the Ohio Bar Association presented the \nAttorney General's office with the 2001 Presidential Award for Pro Bono \nService.\n  I am proud to have worked with my friend, Betty Montgomery, when I \nwas Governor of Ohio. Her unwavering commitment to serving the people \nof Ohio through pro bono services is vital towards maintaining a \njustice system that is meaningful to all segments of society. This \nprogram serves as a testament to our founding fathers' belief in a \nsystem of equal justice for all.\n  I believe that every lawyer has an ethical and professional \nobligation to provide pro bono services. It is my hope that this sets a \nchallenge for lawyers statewide and sends the message that \nparticipating in pro bono programs is an ideal that is embraced by \nleaders in the legal community. Betty Montgomery has certainly led the \nway in this endeavor. I am proud of her accomplishment and I \ncongratulate Attorney General Montgomery and her staff on their \ndedication to providing pro bono services to all of Ohio's \ncitizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8082-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8082-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8082-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the Senate of January 3, 2001, the Secretary \nof the Senate, on August 2, 2002, during the recess of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 3009.

A Senate joint resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee relative to the Y-12 \n     National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee; to the \n     Committee on Armed Services.\n       Whereas, the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, \n     Tennessee is a highly valuable resource to this state and the \n     nation, performing work of a delicate nature with extreme \n     precision and employing uniquely skilled and dedicated \n     professionals who have committed themselves to important \n     national security and scientific endeavors; and\n       Whereas, the Y-12 Plant, in conjunction with the Oak Ridge \n     National Laboratory and other federal facilities in Oak \n     Ridge, has developed into an economic development engine, \n     spinning off new businesses and serving as a testing ground \n     for new technologies; and\n       Whereas, the Work for Others Program has brought many \n     federal contracts to Oak Ridge, allowing Y-12 employees to \n     update and hone their skills while producing materials for \n     the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Navy, among \n     others; and\n       Whereas, the nation's nuclear defense policy is dependent \n     upon Y-12's ability to safely and securely maintain the \n     stockpile of nuclear materials and to preserve the now \n     fragile capabilities of the plant; and\n       Whereas, Y-12 employees have skills in the safe management \n     and handling of nuclear materials that are unduplicated \n     anywhere in the world; these skills have been gained over \n     long periods of employment and training and must be passed on \n     to a new generation of highly educated and skilled workers; \n     and\n       Whereas, while the site managers have been able to restart \n     many operations that had previously been suspended, the \n     continued safe disarmament and storage of weapons being \n     removed from the national nuclear stockpile depend upon Y-\n     12's revitalization; and\n       Whereas, many of the facilities at the plant were built \n     during the development of the Manhattan Project, and much of \n     the equipment is more expensive to maintain than operate; the \n     employees of the 21st century require advanced machinery; and\n       Whereas, modernizing facilities and equipment will better \n     equip the plant's employees to meet and adjust to the demands \n     of the 21st century and the U.S. Department of Energy, to \n     attract more and different kinds of private-sector work, and \n     to support and encourage new, private-sector economic \n     development and scientific advancement; and\n       Whereas, the safety of Y-12's employees and the \n     environmental security of the region depend on Y-12's having \n     facilities that meet the current safety requirements of the \n     federal government; Now, therefore,\n       Be it resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred Second \n     General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives Concurring, That this General Assembly hereby \n     urges the United States Congress and the President of the \n     United States to fully fund the facilities modernization of \n     the Y-12 Plant in the Fiscal Year 2003 federal budget; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That enrolled copies of this resolution be \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the \n     United States of America; the President and the Secretary of \n     the United States Senate; the Speaker and the Clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives; and to each member of \n     Tennessee's Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-286. A joint resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of California relative to social health maintenance \n     organizations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 27\n\n       Whereas, Government spending for nursing homes, home health \n     care, and prescription drugs is rising at a rate of almost 10 \n     percent a year, faster than the overall medical health care \n     inflation rate of 4.3 percent for November 2000; and\n       Whereas, the growth of long-term care expenditures, \n     estimated at 2.6 percent nationally on an annual basis \n     coupled with the growing number of older Americans, will \n     significantly increase costs to the nation's Medicaid and \n     Medicare programs; and\n       Whereas, innovative and cost-effective models of care are \n     needed to address the needs of aging Americans; and\n       Whereas, in the federal Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, \n     Congress mandated the social health maintenance organization \n     (social HMO) demonstration, which has since benefited over \n     125,000 individuals; and\n       Whereas, the social HMO demonstration has been reinforced \n     and expanded by Congress in 1987, 1990, 1993, 1997, and 1999; \n     and\n       Whereas, the social HMO is a community-based appraoch to \n     integrating acute and long-term care for older Americans; and\n       Whereas, the primary purpose of the social HMO is to \n     finance, provide, and coordinate additional services as an \n     extension of benefits covered by Medicare and Medicaid, \n     thereby helping frail seniors live safely in their own homes \n     and avoid costly skilled nursing home placement; and\n       Whereas, the social HMO targets individuals at risk for \n     nursing home placement and chronic illnesses; and\n       Whereas, the social HMO supplements the standard benefits \n     required of Medicare+Choice with essential benefits, \n     including geriatric-specific case management, adult day care, \n     personal care, homemaker services, nutrition support, and \n     medication management; and\n       Whereas, sixty-eight percent of nursing home costs are \n     financed by Medicaid, avoiding or delaying longer nursing \n     home stays and directly saving federal and state funds, by \n     reducing Medicaid nursing home expenditures; and\n       Whereas, California has 3.3 million residents aged 65 years \n     and older, and is home to the largest elderly population in \n     the country; and\n       Whereas, the number of California aged 60 years and older \n     is projected to grow 154 percent over the next 40 years; and\n       Whereas, the fastest growing population group in California \n     is aged 85 years and older; and\n       Whereas, only one social HMO exists in California, serving \n     over 48,000 seniors, of which 10,300 are eligible for nursing \n     home placement; and\n       Whereas, the Senior Care Action Network (SCAN), the only \n     social HMO in California, has been able to maintain these \n     skilled nursing home-certifiable seniors in their own homes \n     by providing home and community-based programs and services; \n     and\n       Whereas, SCAN members are 53 percent less likely than their \n     counterparts in other health care programs to have a long \n     nursing home stay; and\n       Whereas, SCAN offers financial savings and security to \n     older adults, their families, and taxpayers by alleviating \n     anxiety about exhausting personal savings for long-term care \n     by providing a benefit package that includes in-home \n     services; and\n       Whereas, the permanency of the social HMO as a benefit \n     option under the Medicare+Choice program will allow \n     organizations like SCAN to provide comprehensive services to \n     seniors anywhere in the nation; and\n       Whereas, the social HMO will serve as a national model of \n     cost-effective care that provides older Americans with \n     greater health, independence, and dignity; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California hereby urges the President and Congress of the \n     United States, the federal Department of Health and Human \n     Services, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n     to do all of the following:\n       (a) Affirm the intent of the social HMO program to provide \n     services for frail and chronically ill seniors.\n       (b) Fully support the transition of the social HMO \n     demonstration into a permanent benefit option as part of \n     Medicare+Choice.\n       (c) Include Medicaid beneficiaries in the social HMO \n     Medicare+Choice option.\n       (d) Allow the social HMO option to offer comprehensive \n     services in addition to fundamental Medicare benefits.\n       (e) Approve and support a payment methodology needed for \n     the advanced care for the nation's frail and chronically ill \n     elderly; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the United States Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare \n     and Medicaid Services, and to each Senator and Representative \n     from California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-287.

Experts in \n     many fields have come to accept the wisdom of utilizing state \n     expertise and resources to deal with problems that are best \n     addressed locally rather than from Washington, D.C.; and\n       Whereas, The management of public forest lands is another \n     area that should be turned over to states through a program \n     of block grants, Michigan, with more public forests than any \n     other state in the eastern portion of the country, has \n     compiled an impressive record of success in the management of \n     its resources. The conditions of Michigan's state forest \n     acreage is a model for other parts of the country; and\n       Whereas, There are several sound reasons why forest \n     management would be more efficiently and productively managed \n     by the state instead of the federal government. State \n     management offers flexibility, rather than a ``one size fits \n     all'' approach; shorter lines of communication; better \n     communication within local regions; and generally lower \n     overall costs. State control over forest operations in \n     Michigan will more accurately reflect our citizens' historic \n     sense of commitment and investment in this vitally important \n     resource; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to turn over the management of federal lands to the \n     states through a block grant program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-293.

Instead, a god, deity, or spirit has bestowed on \n     every citizen of the United States of America the inherent \n     worth and dignity embodied in and protected by the \n     Constitution and the Bill of Rights of the United States of \n     America; and\n       Whereas, The Pledge of Allegiance recognizes that we are \n     one nation of diverse and unique peoples within fifty \n     separate states undivided in our dedication to the principles \n     of freedom, liberty, and justice; and\n       Whereas, The Pledge of Allegiance reiterates the guarantees \n     of liberty and justice mandated by the Bill of Rights; and\n       Whereas, The flag of the United States of America is a \n     representation of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution \n     and the Bill of Rights, as well as the free people who \n     willingly sacrificed their lives and their freedoms to \n     protect and preserve those freedoms; and\n       Whereas, The Pledge of Allegiance teaches students to \n     cherish, preserve, and protect the republic dedicated to the \n     preservation of freedom, liberty, and justice; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the people of the state of \n     Michigan, acting through the Senate, do hereby call upon the \n     United States Supreme Court to overturn the 9th U.S. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals decision to ban the recital of the Pledge of \n     Allegiance in public schools; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the justices of the United States Supreme Court, the \n     President of the United States, and the members of the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-294.

A resolution adopted by the House of Delegates of \n     the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative \n     to Medicare and oral anti-cancer drugs; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 19\n\n       Whereas, cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and \n     mortality in the Commonwealth and throughout the nation; and\n       Whereas, cancer is disproportionately a disease of the \n     elderly, with more than half of all cancer diagnoses \n     occurring in persons age 65 or older; persons who are often \n     dependent on the federal Medicare program for provision of \n     cancer care; and\n       Whereas, treatment with anti-cancer drugs is the \n     cornerstone of modern cancer care, and elderly cancer \n     patients must have access to potentially life-extending drug \n     therapy; and\n       Whereas, the Medicare program's coverage of anti-cancer \n     drugs is limited to injectable drugs or oral drugs that have \n     an injectable version; and\n       Whereas, the nation's investment in biomedical research has \n     begun to bear fruit with a compelling array of new oral anti-\n     cancer drugs that are less toxic, more effective, and more \n     cost-effective than existing therapies, but, because these \n     drugs do not have an injectable equivalent, they are not \n     covered by Medicare; and\n       Whereas, the lack of coverage for these important new \n     products leaves many Medicare beneficiaries confronting the \n     choice of either substantial out-of-pocket personal cost or \n     selection of more toxic and less effective treatments that \n     are covered by Medicare; and\n       Whereas, Medicare's failure to cover oral anti-cancer drugs \n     leaves at risk many beneficaries suffering from blood-related \n     cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma, as well as \n     cancers of the breast, lung, and prostate; and\n       Whereas, certain members of the United States Congress have \n     recognized the necessity of Medicare coverage for all oral \n     anti-cancer drugs and have introduced legislation in the \n     107th Congress to achieve that result (H.R. 1624 and S. 913); \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, That the Congress of \n     the United States be urged to enact legislation requiring \n     Medicare to cover all oral anti-cancer drugs; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     the Secretary of the Health and Human Services, the \n     Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services, and the members of the Virginia Congressional \n     Delegation so that they may be apprised of the sense of the \n     House of Delegates of Virginia in this matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-299. A resolution adopted by the House of Delegates of \n     the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative \n     to the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century \n     (TEA-21), will expire on September 30, 2003; and\n       Whereas, the six-year federal authorization legislation \n     provides guidelines, budget allocation formulas, and maximum \n     budget limits for transportation spending; and\n       Whereas, TEA-21 provided for new budget categories to be \n     established for highway and transit spending, effectively \n     establishing a budgetary ``firewall'' between each of these \n     programs and all other domestic discretionary programs to \n     ensure that transportation trust funds can be used only for \n     transportation spending; and\n       Whereas, authorizations for federal-aid highway and highway \n     safety construction programs funded from the Highway Account \n     of the Highway Trust Fund will be increased or decreased \n     whenever the highway firewall amount is adjusted to reflect \n     changed estimates of Highway Account revenue, that is, the \n     budget authority will be aligned with the revenue; and\n       Whereas, this Revenue, Aligned Budget Authority has \n     resulted in increased federal transportation funding to \n     Virginia since FY 2000; and\n       Whereas, during the last reauthorization (TEA-21), Virginia \n     was successful in increasing its return on contributions to \n     the federal transportation trust fund from approximately 79 \n     percent to 90.5 percent; and\n       Whereas, Virginia's current federal return rate of 90.5 \n     percent is the lowest return level from the federal \n     transportation trust fund in the nation; and\n       Whereas, Virginia taxpayers continue to subsidize other \n     states' transportation programs through Virginia's low rate \n     of return on contributions to the federal transportation \n     trust fund; and\n       Whereas, the proposed reauthorization of federal aid for \n     surface transportation programs provides an ideal opportunity \n     to ensure that future methods of apportioning federal \n     transportation funds are equitable and fair; and\n       Whereas, adequate support for the National Highway System \n     (NHS) is necessary to provide consistent mobility and \n     economic\n\n[[Page S8089]]\n\n     benefits for all states throughout the nation, and to ensure \n     that Virginia's citizens are able to connect with other \n     citizens throughout the nation; and\n       Whereas, adequate support for the National Highway System \n     and other transportation systems in Virginia is equally \n     essential to the numerous and sizable U.S. military bases and \n     other facilities that are located within the Commonwealth, \n     for which an adequate and efficient transportation system is \n     critical to effectively and promptly distribute, supply, and \n     deploy military assets to meet and respond to the imperatives \n     of national defense; and\n       Whereas, a streamlined transportation program is needed to \n     provide flexible funding to allow states and their local \n     partners to respond to specific state and local needs; and\n       Whereas, Congress directed the U.S. Department of \n     Transportation in the TEA-21 legislation of 1998 to implement \n     significant environmental regulatory streamlining so that \n     transportation projects could receive federal review and \n     approval in an expedited manner; and\n       Whereas, the federal review and approval process for \n     transportation projects has not been shortened despite the \n     environmental streamlining mandate of TEA-21; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates. That the Congress of \n     the United States be urged to reauthorize the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century, provide for increased equity \n     in the distribution of federal highway funds to the states, \n     and reduce complexity of and time required for compliance \n     with federal environmental regulations related to highway \n     construction. In reauthorizing the federal surface \n     transportation program, the Congress is also urged to provide \n     fair and equitable distribution of highway funds to states \n     and increase the return to the Commonwealth to at least the \n     national average, ensure that firewalls between the \n     Transportation Trust Fund and other federal spending be \n     maintained, continue Revenue Aligned Budget Authority, and \n     meaningfully streamline federal environmental and other \n     regulations to expedite project review and highway \n     construction; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President of the \n     United States Senate, and the members of the Virginia \n     Congressional Delegation in order that they may be apprised \n     of the sense of the House of Delegates of Virginia in this \n     matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-300. A resolution adopted by the House of Delegates of \n     the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative \n     to expanding the use of federal historic preservation tax \n     credits to qualified owner-occupied structures; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 22\n\n       Whereas, the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Credit \n     Program currently provides federal income tax incentives for \n     rehabilitation of historic income-producing properties; and\n       Whereas, legislation currently pending in the United States \n     Congress will expand the program by providing a credit \n     against income tax to individuals who rehabilitate historic \n     homes or who are the first purchasers of rehabilitated \n     historic homes for use as a principal residence; and\n       Whereas, passage of the pending legislation could have many \n     beneficial effects in Virginia, including encouraging \n     additional protection of historic buildings, returning \n     underutilized buildings to local tax rolls, and providing a \n     boost to efforts to improve older neighborhoods; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, That the Congress of \n     the United States be urged to expand use of federal historic \n     preservation tax credits to qualified owner-occupied \n     structures; and, be it\n       Resolved Further. That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President of the \n     United States Senate, and the members of the Virginia \n     Congressional Delegation in order that they may be apprised \n     of the sense of the House of Delegates of Virginia in this \n     matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-301. A House joint resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Illinois relative to inland waterway \n     transportation; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 54\n\n       Whereas, the State of Illinois borders or contains over \n     1,000 miles of the inland waterway system; and\n       Whereas, Many of Illinois' locks and dams are more than 60 \n     years old and only 600 feet long, making them unable to \n     accommodate modern barge tows of 1,200 feet long, nearly \n     tripling locking times and causing lengthy delays and \n     ultimately increasing shipping costs; and\n       Whereas, The use of 1,200-foot locks has been proven \n     nationwide as the best method of improving efficiency, \n     reducing congestion, and modernizing the inland waterways; \n     and\n       Whereas, The construction of the lock and dam system has \n     spurred economic growth and a higher standard of living in \n     the Mississippi and Illinois river basin, and today supplies \n     more than 300,000,000 tons of the nation's cargo, supporting \n     more than 400,000 jobs, including 90,000 in manufacturing; \n     and\n       Whereas, More than 60% of American agricultural exports, \n     including, corn, wheat, and soybeans, are shipped down the \n     Mississippi and Illinois rivers on the way to foreign \n     markets; and\n       Whereas, Illinois farmers, producers, and consumers rely on \n     efficient transportation to remain competitive in a global \n     economy, and efficiencies in river transport offset higher \n     production costs, compared to those incurred by foreign \n     competitors; and\n       Whereas, The Upper Mississippi and Illinois lock and dam \n     system saves our nation more than $1,500,000,000 in higher \n     transportation costs each year, and failing to construct \n     1,200-foot locks will cause farmers to use more expensive \n     alternative modes of transportation, including trucks and \n     trains; and\n       Whereas, According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, \n     congestion along the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers is \n     costing Illinois and other producers and consumers in the \n     basin $98,000,000 per year in higher transportation costs; \n     and\n       Whereas, River transportation is the most environmentally \n     friendly form of transporting goods and commodities, creating \n     almost no noise pollution and emitting 35% to 60% fewer \n     pollutants than either trucks or trains, according to the \n     U.S. EPA; and\n       Whereas, Moving away from river transport would add \n     millions of trucks and rail cars to our nation's \n     infrastructure, adding air pollution, traffic congestion, and \n     greater wear and tear on highways; and\n       Whereas, Backwater lakes created by the lock and dam system \n     provide breeding grounds for migratory waterfowl and fish; \n     and\n       Whereas, The lakes and 500 miles of wildlife refuge also \n     support a $1,000,000,000-a-year recreational industry, \n     including hunting, fishing, and tourism jobs; and\n       Whereas, Upgrading the system of locks and dams on the \n     Upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers will provide 3,000 \n     construction and related jobs over a 15-20 year period; and\n       Whereas, In 1999 Illinois was the leading shipping state, \n     with more than 66,000,000 tons of Illinois products, \n     including grain, coal, chemicals, aggregates, and other \n     products, representing a value of more than $8,000,000,000; \n     and\n       Whereas, 109,000,000 tons of commodities including grain, \n     coal, chemicals, aggregates, and other products were shipped \n     to, from, and within Illinois by barge, representing \n     $16,000,000,000 in value; and\n       Whereas, An additional 136,000,000 tons of commodities pass \n     Illinois' borders on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, \n     representing a value of more than $43,000,000,000; and\n       Whereas, Shippers moving by barge in Illinois realized a \n     savings of approximately $1,000,000,000, compared to other \n     transportation modes; and\n       Whereas, Illinois docks shipped products by barge to 20 \n     states and received products from 18 states; and\n       Whereas, Barges moving to and from Lake Michigan use the \n     O'Brien Lock, with the Chicago Lock passing over 36,000 \n     recreation vessels and over 410,00 passengers on over 13,000 \n     commercial passenger vessels; and\n       Whereas, There are approximately 364 manufacturing \n     facilities, terminals, and docks on the waterways of \n     Illinois, representing thousand of jobs in the State; \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     Second General Assembly of the State of Illinois, the Senate \n     concurring herein, That we recognize the importance of inland \n     waterway transportation to Illinois agriculture and to \n     industry in the State, the region, and the nation, and that \n     we urge Congress to authorize funding to construct 1,200-foot \n     locks on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois River System; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this Resolution be \n     delivered to the President Pro Tempore and the Secretary of \n     the United States Senate, the Speaker and the Clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the Chair of the \n     Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n     the Chair of the House Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure, and to the Illinois congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-302.

Through his dedication, Cesar \n     Chavez built not only a union but a movement of all races to \n     continue the endless struggle to fight for workers' rights, \n     civil rights and human rights; and\n       Whereas, Cesar Chavez was a role model for all workers, \n     especially for Latinos and their children; and\n       Whereas, Cesar Chavez taught us to use power in the \n     nonviolent manner and to employ this principle to secure \n     justice for all workers in the labor movement; and\n       Whereas, His death on April 23, 1993 brought the Latino \n     community together to continue his struggle to obtain justice \n     and to secure a better life by organizing unions at the \n     workplace; and\n       Whereas, A resolution is pending in the United States \n     Congress to establish a national holiday in memory of Cesar \n     Chavez: Now, therefore,\n       Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of Kansas, the \n     House of Representatives concurring therein: That we urge the \n     adoption of the United States House of Representatives \n     Concurrent Resolution No. 3 providing for a national holiday \n     honoring Cesar Chavez and that this holiday be celebrated on \n     Cesar Chavez's birthday, March 31; and\n       Be it further resolved: That the Secretary of State send \n     enrolled copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives and to each member of the Kansas \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-304.

In this time of war, \n     especially, we are shocked that an expression of devotion and \n     loyalty to our nation's flag and all it represents should be \n     suppressed by a three-judge panel of the most reversed United \n     States Court of Appeals; and\n       Whereas, The Ninth Circuit's ruling that the words ``under \n     God'' somehow represent the establishment of an official \n     state church in violation of the Establishment Clause of the \n     United States Constitution is ludicrous. No state church has \n     been established in the nearly five decades since those words \n     were added to the Pledge of Allegiance. The freedom to \n     believe and practice any religion, or to believe and practice \n     no religion at all, is an ingrained part of our society. The \n     purportedly terrible impact of reciting ``under God'' in our \n     Pledge of Allegiance, should a person choose to do so, has \n     not and will not happen; and\n       Whereas, Should the Ninth Circuit fail to correct this \n     ruling, the United States Supreme Court should reverse this \n     ruling as a gross misinterpretation of our Constitution and \n     astounding lack of common sense. Our flag unites us, \n     regardless of our heritage. Our Pledge of Allegiance to our \n     flag, which represents all the freedoms we cherish and \n     defend, must be preserved; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we condemn the decision of the \n     Ninth United States Circuit Court of Appeals that ruled that \n     the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the judges of the Ninth United States Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, the justices of the United States Supreme Court, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-306. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to designating \n     October 2002 as Respect Month and October 30, 2002, as \n     Respect Your Neighborhood Day; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 244\n\n       Whereas, For over ten years, the state of Michigan has \n     recognized October as Respect Month, a time for adults with \n     influence over young people to talk with them about respect; \n     and\n       Whereas, The state of Michigan has proclaimed October 30 as \n     Respect Your Neighborhood Day, a time for people of all ages \n     to launch projects that encourage respect for one another and \n     serve their communities as a whole; and\n       Whereas, this has led young people to participate in such \n     projects including the clean up of vacant lots and helping \n     senior citizens; and\n       Whereas, In 1998, the City Councils of Detroit and Highland \n     Park voted to make Respect Month and Respect Your \n     Neighborhood Day permanent occasions in their cities and to \n     request the President and the Congress of the United States \n     to proclaim such occasions on a national level; and\n       Whereas, In 1999, the Highland Park School Board made a \n     similar request; and\n       Whereas, Encouraging adults to help create an atmosphere of \n     respect may avert tragedies and save lives. The recent \n     horrors on September 11, 2001, and the shootings in schools \n     like Columbine are prime examples of why prevention is \n     crucial; and\n       Whereas, Such tragedies demonstrate why it is imperative \n     that adults with influence over children communicate basic \n     tenets of respect and demonstrate ways in which serving our \n     communities can help maintain the dignity of all members of \n     society; and\n\n[[Page S8091]]\n\n       Whereas, Respect Month will function as a time to \n     positively model respect, promote respect, and encourage \n     youth and their peers to do the same for each other, their \n     communities, and mankind; and\n       Whereas, Adults who can have an impact on children by \n     putting an emphasis on the meaning of and the need for \n     respect in society are invaluable to this cause, and \n     character education brings about a greater respect and \n     appreciation for all. The meaning of respect is ascertained \n     during childhood, and the exhibiting of respect by adults is \n     of great importance; and\n       Whereas, Proclaiming Respect Month and Respect Your \n     Neighborhood Day will encourage service projects and conflict \n     resolution courses, which are two ways to combat poor self-\n     esteem and lack of self-respect which can lead to violence; \n     and\n       Whereas, The existing diversity in our communities must be \n     admired, appreciated, and valued, but without respect, this \n     society will not achieve its full potential; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the members of this \n     legislative body commemorate October 2002 as Respect Month \n     and October 30, 2002, as Respect Your Neighborhood Day on a \n     permanent basis in the state of Michigan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge President George W. Bush and the \n     Congress of the United States to make such proclamations for \n     the country as a whole; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the U.S. \n     Senate, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-307.

Reservations.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following reservations, which shall be \n     included in the instrument of ratification.\n       (1) The United States of America does not consider itself \n     bound by Article 11(1) of the Protocol to the extent that \n     United States law permits the limited taking of flora and \n     fauna listed in Annexes I and II--\n       (A) which is incidental, or\n       (B) for the purposes of public display, scientific \n     research, photography for educational or commercial purposes, \n     or rescue and rehabilitation.\n       (2) The United States has long supported environmental \n     impact assessment procedures, and has actively sought to \n     promote the adoption of such procedures throughout the world. \n     U.S. law and policy require environmental impact assessments \n     for major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality \n     of the human environment. Accordingly, although the United \n     States expects that it will, for the most part, be in \n     compliance with Article 13, the United States does not accept \n     an obligation under Article 13 of the Protocol to the extent \n     that the obligations contained therein differ from the \n     obligations of Article 12 of the Convention for the \n     Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the \n     Wider Caribbean Region.\n       (3) The United States does not consider the Protocol to \n     apply to six species of fauna and flora that do not require \n     the protection provided by the Protocol in U.S. territory. \n     These species are the Alabama, Florida and Georgia \n     populations of least tern (Sterna antillarum), the Audubon's \n     shearwater (Puffinus lherminieri), the Mississippi, Louisiana \n     and Texas population of the wood stork (Mycteria americana) \n     and the Florida and Alabama populations of the brown pelican \n     (Pelicanus occidentalis), which are listed on Annex II, as \n     well as the fulvous whistling duck (Dendrocygna bicolor), and \n     the populations of widgeon or ditch grass (Rupia maritima) \n     located in the continental United States, which are listed on \n     Annex III.\n       Section 3. Understanding.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following understanding, which shall be \n     included in the instrument of ratification:\n       The United States understands that the Protocol does not \n     apply to non-native species, defined as species found outside \n     of their natural geographic distribution, as a result of \n     deliberate or incidental human intervention.

A bill to enhance the operation of the AMBER Alert \ncommunications network in order to facilitate the recovery of abducted \nchildren, to provide for enhanced notification on highways of alerts \nand information on such children, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I am introducing today with my \nfriend from California, Senator Feinstein, legislation to improve the \ncurrent system of AMBER Alert plans that exist in various States. Our \nlegislation recognizes the tremendous job that those involved in AMBER \nalerts are playing and we seek to build on their efforts.\n  In 1996, 9-year-old Amber Hagerman of Arlington, Texas was abducted \nand brutally murdered. Her death had such an impact on the community \nthat local law enforcement and area broadcasters developed what is now \nknown as AMBER Alert, America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response. \nAn AMBER alert is activated by law enforcement to find a child, when a \nchild has been abducted. An Alert triggers highway notification and \nbroadcast messages throughout the area where the abduction occurred.\n  As we have seen this summer, AMBER plans in different communities \nhave worked to bring children home safely. To date, AMBER Alert has \nhelped recover 27 children nationwide. Many communities and states have \noutstanding AMBER plans, however, the vast majority of States do not \nyet have comprehensive, statewide coverage and lack the ability to \neffectively communicate between plans. This is a critical issue \nparticularly when an abducted child is taken across State lines.\n  The bill I am introducing today establishes an AMBER Alert \nCoordinator within the Department of Justice to assist States with \ntheir AMBER plans. An AMBER Alert Coordinator is needed to address \nsituations such as the recent examples of interstate travel with \nabducted children. We have witnessed several successful stories of \nAMBER plans helping to recover a child within a region, however, many \ngaps exist between the various AMBER plans around the country. The \nAMBER Alert Coordinator will facilitate appropriate regional \ncoordination of AMBER alerts, particularly with interstate travel \nsituations, and will assist states, broadcasters, and law enforcement \nin setting up additional AMBER plans.\n  The AMBER Alert Coordinator will set minimum, voluntary standards to \nhelp states coordinate when necessary. The AMBER Alert Coordinator will \nhelp to reconcile the different standards for what constitutes an AMBER \nalert. In doing so, the Coordinator will work with existing \nparticipants, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, local and state law enforcement and broadcasters to define \nminimum standards. Overall, the AMBER Alert Coordinator's efforts will \nset safeguards to make sure the AMBER alert system is used to meet its \nintended purpose.\n  In addition, the bill provides for a matching grant program. The \ngrant program will help localities and states build or further enhance \ntheir efforts to disseminate AMBER alerts. To this end, the matching \ngrant program will fund road signage and electronic message boards \nalong highways, dissemination of information on abducted children, \neducation and training, and related equipment.\n  Our bill has the strong support of the National Center of Missing and \nExploited Children and the National Association of Broadcasters, who \nplay essential roles in the AMBER Alert system. I urge the Senate to \nact expeditiously on this legislation to further protect America's \nchildren.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join Senator \nHutchison in introducing legislation that will save children's lives by \nexpanding the existing AMBER Alert program nationwide.\n  AMBER Alerts are official bulletins broadcast over the airwaves to \nenlist the public's help in tracking down abducted children facing \nimminent danger from their kidnappers.\n  The power of the AMBER alert can be seen in the recent kidnapping of \nTamara Brooks and Jacqueline Marris.\n  On August 1, 2002, twenty-four hours after the State of California \nlaunched its statewide AMBER Alert program, Tamara Brooks, 16, and \nJacqueline Marris, 17, were abducted from their vehicles at gunpoint in \nLancaster, CA.\n  Shortly thereafter, the California Highway Patrol issued an AMBER \nAlert on the girls disappearance.\n  Within the next few hours, concerned members of the community called \ninto CHP hotlines, delivering a flurry of crucial tips that helped \nlocate the suspect.\n  A driver on state Highway 178 spotted the abductor's stolen white \nbronco in Walker Pass, approximately 70 miles east of Bakersfield.\n  Two hours later, a CalTrans worker spotted the suspect on Highway \n178, and,\n  A Kern County animal control officer spotted the Bronco on a local \ndirt road.\n  Based on these tips, sheriff's deputies located the girls and their \nabductor, Roy Ratliff, in a vehicle in a dry riverbed, just 12 hours \nafter the abduction.\n  Ratliff was killed during an exchange of gunfire with sheriff's \ndeputies, and the girls were returned home safely.\n  The AMBER Alert system and the effective work of the Kern County \nSheriff's Department may be the only reasons those girls are alive \ntoday.\n  Children abducted in States without an AMBER Alert system, however, \nmay not have been so fortunate.\n  That is why we are introducing this legislation, to spur the \ndevelopment of State and local AMBER plans across the country so we can \nincrease the chances that children abducted by strangers can be \nreturned home safely.\n  Each year, more than 58,000 children in the United States are \nabducted by non-family members, often in connection with another crime.\n  In the most dangerous type of child abduction, stranger abduction, \nfully 40 percent of children are murdered.\n  Speed is crucial to any effective law enforcement response to these \nmost deadly cases.\n  According to a study by the U.S. Department of Justice, 74 percent of \nchildren who were abducted, and later found murdered, were killed \nwithin three hours of being taken.\n  AMBER Alerts are a proven weapon in the fight against stranger \nabductions, especially in those cases where an abducted child is facing \nan imminent threat of harm.\n  The program is named after nine-year-old Amber Hagerman who was \nkidnapped and murdered in Arlington, TX in 1996.\n  The power of the AMBER alert system is that an alert can be issued \nwithin minutes of an abduction, disseminating key information of the \ncrime to the community at large.\n  Nationally, since 1996, the AMBER Alert has been credited with the \nsafe return of 29 children to their families, including one case in \nwhich an abductor reportedly released the child after hearing the alert \nhimself.\n  These are 29 families who didn't have to suffer the pain of losing a \nloved one. Twenty-nine families who didn't have to bury a child.\n  Since the State of California first adopted AMBER alerts a month ago, \nthe State has issued 13 AMBER alerts. Each of the AMBER Alerts \nconcluded with the missing child being united with their families.\n  Eight of these alerts involved stranger abductions. Four involved \nfamily members, and one case is considered a false alarm.\n  I would like to describe two of these cases: the rescue of four-year-\nold Jessica Cortez from Los Angeles and 10-year-old Nichole Timmons \nfrom Riverside.\n  Jessica disappeared from Echo Park in Los Angeles on August 11, 2002.\n  But when Jessica's abductor took her to a clinic for medical care, \nreceptionist Denise Leon recognized Jessica from the AMBER Alert and \nnotified law enforcement.\n  Without the publicity generated by the alert, Jessica could have been \nlost to her parents forever.\n  Nichole Timmons was kidnapped from her Riverside home on August 20.\n  In Nichole's case, an Alert was issued not just in California, but in \nNevada as well.\n  A tribal police officer in Nevada spotted the truck of Nichole's \nabductor and stopped him within 24 hours of the abduction.\n\n[[Page S8095]]\n\n  He was found with duct tape and a metal pipe.\n  The AMBER Alert enabled Nichole to return home safely to her parents.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is simple, yet very \nimportant.\n  First, it would establish a national coordinator for AMBER Alerts in \nthe Department of Justice to expand the network of AMBER Alert systems \nand to coordinate the issuance of region-wide AMBER Alerts.\n  We need regional coordination of AMBER Alert because, as we saw in \nthe case of Nichole Timmons, abductors of children may cross State \nlines as they flee crime scenes.\n  Second, the bill would establish grant programs in the Department of \nJustice and the Department of Transportation to provide for the \ndevelopment of AMBER Alert systems, electronic message boards, and \ntraining and education programs in states that do not have AMBER \nAlerts.\n  To date, AMBER Alert systems exist in only 15 States and 32 local and \nregional jurisdictions. This bill would help the expansion of AMBER \nAlerts to new jurisdictions.\n  Third, the bill directs the Department of Justice to establish \nminimum standards for the coordination of AMBER alerts between \njurisdictions.\n  Minimum standards are needed because many of the existing AMBER plans \nhave slightly different standards for an AMBER Alert, such as when to \nissue an alert.\n  Without a common standard, sharing AMBER Alerts between states will \nbe difficult.\n  I would also like to stress what the bill does not do.\n  It is the specific intent of this bill not to interfere with the \noperation of the 50 State and local AMBER plans that are working so \nwell.\n  Participation in regional AMBER plans is only voluntary, and any plan \nthat wishes to go it alone may still do so.\n  The bill also does not change the very strict criteria of the AMBER \nAlert.\n  AMBER Alerts are successful because they are issued rarely, and only \nwhen strict criteria are met.\n  A typical AMBER Alert is only issued when a law enforcement agency \nconfirms that a stranger abduction has occurred, the child is in \nimminent danger, and there is information available that, if \ndisseminated to the public could assist in the safe recovery of the \nchild.\n  The effectiveness of the system depends on the continued judicious \nuse of the alert so that the public does not grow to ignore the \nwarnings.\n  This bill is carefully designed to preserve the Alert's ongoing \neffectiveness.\n  In sum, through this legislation, we can extend to every corner of \nthe nation a network of AMBER Alerts that will protect our children.\n  If we can set up a program that will increase the odds that an \nabducted child can return to his or her family safely, then I believe \nthe program will be well worth it.\n  We know the AMBER Alert system works. We know that every community in \nAmerica should have access to it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senators Kay Bailey \nHutchison (R-TX) and Diane Feinstein (D-CA) in introducing the \n``National AMBER Alert Network Act of 2002'' which will extend the \nAMBER Alert (America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response) system \nacross our Nation. The recent wave of child abductions across our \nNation, including the kidnaping of Elizabeth Smart in my own home state \nof Utah, has highlighted the need for legislation to enhance our \nability to protect our Nation's children against predators of all \ntypes.\n  When a child is abducted, time is of the essence. All too often it is \nonly a matter of hours before a kidnaper commits an act of violence \nagainst the child. Alert systems, such as the AMBER Alert system, \ngalvanize entire communities to assist law enforcement in the timely \nsearch for and safe return of child victims.\n  The AMBER Alert system was developed in 1996 in Texas after 9-year-\nold Amber Hagerman was kidnaped. To date, the system has been credited \nwith the recovery of 27 missing children. Nonetheless, only 16 States \nhave adopted statewide AMBER Alert systems. Just this year, my home \nState of Utah adopted a statewide alert program aimed at preventing \nchild abduction called ``Rachel Alert.'' The program was named after \nyoung Rachel Runyan who was abducted and later found murdered.\n  We recently witnessed the success of the AMBER Alert system in \nCalifornia. There the AMBER system was used to broadcast the \ndisappearance of Nichole Timmons who was safely recovered in the \nneighboring state of Nevada after she was recognized. In another recent \nCalifornia case, the AMBER Alert system was used when Tamera Brooks and \nJaqueline Marris were kidnapped. Just hours after their abduction, and \nminutes before their possible murder, the two young women were found.\n  The legislation we introduce today will enhance our ability to \nrecover abducted children by establishing a Coordinator within the \nDepartment of Justice to assist States in developing and coordinating \nalert plans nationwide. The Act also provides for a matching grant \nprogram through the Department of Justice and the Department of \nTransportation for highway signs, education and training programs, and \nthe equipment necessary to facilitate AMBER Alert systems.\n  I support the National AMBER Alert Network Act and other legislative \nproposals that will improve our ability on a national level to combat \ncrimes against children. For that reason, I will introduce in the \ncoming days comprehensive legislation that will enhance existing laws, \ninvestigative tools, criminal penalties and child crime resources in a \nvariety of ways. I believe Congress must do all it can to ensure that \nwe devote the same intensity of purpose to crimes committed against \nchildren, as we do to other serious criminal offenses, such as those \ninvolving terrorism.\n  We have no greater resource than our children. I invite the \nDepartment of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other \nentities and professionals who are charged with protecting our children \nto work with me to improve our Federal laws and to assist States in \ndoing the same.\n  I commend Senator Hutchison for her tireless efforts on behalf of \nchildren and families and urge my colleagues to work with us to enact \nthis critical legislation which will increase the chances that future \nvictims of child predators will be found swiftly and returned home \nsafely.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 2897. A bill to assist in the conservation of marine turtles and \nthe nesting habitats of marine turtles in foreign countries; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Marine \nTurtle Conservation Act of 2002.''\n  Marine turtles were once abundant, but now they are in serious \ntrouble. Six of the seven recognized species are listed as threatened \non endangered under the Endangered Species Act, and all seven species \nhave been included in Appendix I of the Convention on International \nTrade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, CITES. Because \nmarine turtles are long-lived, late-maturing, and highly migratory, \nthey are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of human exploitation \nand habitat loss. In addition, for some species, illegal trade \nseriously threatens wild populations. Because of the immense challenges \nfacing marine turtles, the resources available to date have not been \nsufficient to cope with the continued loss of nesting habitat due to \nhuman activities and the resulting diminution of marine turtle \npopulations.\n  The Marine Turtle Conservation Act of 2002 is modeled after the \nsuccessful Asian Elephant Conservation Act, the African Elephant \nConservation Act, and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. These \nacts have established programs within the Department of the Interior to \nassist in the conservation and preservation of these species around the \nworld. More than 300 projects have been funded and generated millions \nof dollars in private matching funds from sponsors representing a \ndiverse group of conservation organizations. The projects range from \npurchasing anti-poaching equipment for wildlife rangers to implementing \nelephant conservation plans to aerial monitoring of the Northern white \nrhinoceros.\n\n[[Page S8096]]\n\n  The Marine Turtle Conservation Act of 2002 will assist in the \nrecovery and protection of marine turtles by supporting and providing \nfinancial resources for projects to conserve nesting habitats of marine \nturtles in foreign countries and marine turtles while they are found in \nsuch habitats, to prevent illegal trade in marine turtle parts and \nprojects, and to address other threats to the survival of marine \nturtles. The bill authorizes $5 million annually to implement the \nprogram.\n  This legislation will help to preserve this ancient and distinctive \npart of the world's biological diversity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 2898. A bill for the relief by Jaya Gulab Tolani and Hitesh Gulab \nTolani; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise to introduce a private relief \nbill that would provide permanent legal resident status for Hitesh \nTolani and his mother, Jaya Tolani, who face voluntary removal from \nthis country.\n  I feel that the Tolanis' case presents a compelling need for \nlegislative action. Hitesh Tolani, who is a scholarship student at \nWofford College in Spartanburg, SC, came to the United States with his \nmother, Jaya, and father, Gulab, in 1984. When Hitesh arrived in this \ncountry, he was a toddler. Hitesh has a younger brother, Ravi, who was \nborn here and is a United States citizen.\n  The Tolanis' efforts to become United States citizens was beset by \ntragedy. Gulab's brother, who served as a sponsor, died during the \nfamily's efforts to become legal permanent residents. Furthermore, just \ndays before Gulab was to interview in New York in hopes of gaining \nlegal permanent resident status for himself and his family, he passed \naway. Jaya was left with no way to legalize her or Hitesh's status. In \nthe same year in which Gulab died, Jaya was also diagnosed with breast \ncancer. In the midst of these difficulties, Jaya was left with very few \nalternatives.\n  When Hitesh learned of his illegal status, he made the decision to \nturn himself into the authorities. After removal proceedings commenced, \nHitesh and Jaya sought relief in the form of cancellation of removal. \nIn order to succeed in this effort, it must be shown that the removal \nwould result in ``exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.'' In this \ncase, the Immigration court found that the Tolanis' case did not rise \nto this level of hardship. The court came to this conclusion despite \nthe fact that Hitesh has lived the vast majority of his life in the \nUnited States and is in the middle of his college studies. If forced to \nleave the country, Hitesh's studies will be significantly interrupted, \nand he will be required to return to a land that he does not remember. \nAdditionally, Hitesh will be placed at a social and educational \ndisadvantage because he is not fluent in the Hindi language.\n  During this important time in Hitesh's life, he will leave the only \nhome that he has ever known. Yet the events surrounding his entry into \nthe United States were completely out of his control. Hitesh has done \nnothing but contribute in positive ways to his hometown community of \nIrmo, SC, and the Wofford College community. He has demonstrated \nexcellent moral character and has always been a model student.\n  Relocation to India would also create extreme hardship for Jaya, who \nis in remission from breast cancer. She would have to abandon her \nclothing store business in South Carolina and return to a land that she \nhas not seen for twenty years. She also faces the potential breakup of \nher family due to the status of her youngest son, Ravi, who is a U.S. \ncitizen. Ravi would be forced to go to India with the rest of his \nfamily or face the prospect of foster care. Ravi is not fluent in \nHindi, but is very proficient in English. Ravi is also an asthmatic who \nmust periodically use an inhaler machine. He would be subject to \nunhealthy air quality in Bombay, the city where the Tolanis' closest \nrelatives reside and the place where they would settle.\n  The Tolani family appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and \nthe Immigration Judge's decision was affirmed without comment. The \nfamily is now appealing to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, but \nthe standard of review is deferential, making this an uphill climb for \nHitesh and Jaya.\n  I have always been a strong proponent of enforcing our Nation's \nimmigration laws. However, the Tolanis' case represents one of those \nrare instances where removal would be unjust. The Tolani family, if \nforced to leave this country, will face exceptional hardship. Hitesh is \na fine young man and an outstanding student. Through no fault of his \nown, he faces the prospect of leaving the only home that he has ever \nknown. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2898\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), \n     Jaya Gulab Tolani and Hitesh Gulab Tolani shall be held and \n     considered to have been lawfully admitted to the United \n     States for permanent residence as of the date of enactment of \n     this Act upon payment of the required visa fees.\n\n     SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.\n\n       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Jaya Gulab \n     Tolani and Hitesh Gulab Tolani, as provided in section 1, the \n     Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to \n     reduce by the appropriate number during the current fiscal \n     year the total number of immigrant visas available to natives \n     of the country of the aliens' birth under section 203(a) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. BREAUX):\n  S. 2899. A bill to establish the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area, \nLouisiana; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, today I rise, along with Senator \nBreaux to introduce a bill to establish the Atchafalaya National \nHeritage Area in Louisiana. This legislation has particularly special \nmeaning to those of us from Louisiana because of the importance of the \ncultural and natural resources of the Atchafalaya region to the Nation.\n  This legislation would establish a framework to help protect, \nconserve, and promote these unique natural, cultural, historical, and \nrecreational resources of the region. Specifically, the legislation \nwould establish a National Heritage Area in Louisiana that encompasses \nthirteen parishes in and around the Atchafalaya Basin swamp, America's \nlargest river swamp. The heritage area in south-central Louisiana \nstretches from Concordia parish to the north, where the Mississippi \nRiver begins to partially flow into the Atchafalaya River, all the way \nto the Gulf of Mexico in the south. The thirteen parishes are: St. \nMary, Iberia, St. Martin, St. Landry, Avoyelles, Pointe Coupee, \nIberville, Assumption, Terrebonne, Lafayette, West Baton Rouge, \nConcordia, and East Baton Rouge. This boundary is the same area covered \nby the existing Atchafalaya Trace State Heritage Area.\n  This measure will appoint the existing Atchafalaya Trace Commission \nas the federally recognized ``local coordinating entity.'' The \ncommission is composed of thirteen members with one representative \nappointed by each parish in the heritage area. Both the Atchafalaya \nTrace Commission and the Atchafalaya Trace State Heritage Area were \ncreated by the Louisiana Legislature a number of years ago. The \nAtchafalaya Trace State Heritage Area program currently receives some \nState funding, and already has staff working at the Louisiana \nDepartment of Culture, Recreation & Tourism, DCRT, under Lieutenant \nGovernor Kathleen Blanco. State funds were used to create the \nmanagement plan for the heritage area, which followed ``feasibility \nanalysis'' guidelines as recommended by the National Park Service. \nTherefore, the recently-completed management plan need only be \nsubmitted to the Secretary of the Interior for approval as this \nlegislation would recognize an existing local coordinating entity that \nwill oversee the implementation of this plan. We are very proud that \nthis state heritage area has already completed the complicated planning \nprocess, with participation of local National Park Service \nrepresentatives, while using a standard of planning quality equal to \nthat of existing national heritage\n\n[[Page S8097]]\n\nareas. All at no cost to the Federal Government.\n  Please let me also emphasize that this legislation protects existing \nprivate property rights. It will not interfere with local land use \nordinances or regulations, as it is specifically prohibited from doing \nso. Nor does this legislation grant any powers of real property \nacquisition to the local coordinating entity or heritage area program. \nIn addition, the legislation does not impose any environmental rule or \nprocess or cause any change in Federal environmental quality standards \ndifferent from those already in effect.\n  Heritage areas are based on cooperation and collaboration at all \nlevels. This legislation remains true to the core concept behind \nheritage areas. The heritage area concept has been used successfully in \nvarious parts of our nation to promote historic preservation, natural \nand cultural resources protection, heritage tourism and sustainable \neconomic revitalization for both urban and rural areas. Heritage areas \nprovide a flexible framework for government agencies, \nprivate organizations and businesses and landowners to work together on \na coordinated regional basis. The Atchafalaya National Heritage Area \nwill join the Cane River National Heritage Area to become the second \nNational Heritage Area in Louisiana, ultimately joining the 23 existing \nNational Heritage Areas around the Nation.\n\n  The initiative to develop the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area is \nan outgrowth of a grassroots effort to achieve multiple goals of this \nregion. Most important among these is providing opportunities for the \nfuture, while at the same time not losing anything that makes this \nplace so special. Residents from all over the region, local tourism \nagencies, State agencies such as the DCRT and the Department of Natural \nResources, the State legislature, Federal agencies including the \nNational Park Service and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, parish \ngovernments, conservation and preservation groups, local businesses and \nlocal landowners have all participated in this endeavor to make it the \nstrong initiative it is today. These groups have been very supportive \nof the heritage area effort, and as time moves on, the heritage area \nwill continue to involve more and more of the area's most important \nresource, its people.\n  I would also like to give you a brief overview of the resources that \nmake this place significant to the entire country. Not only is it \nimportant to our Nation's history but it is also critical to \nunderstanding America's future. The name of the place itself--\nAtchafalaya, comes from the American Indians and means ``long river.'' \nThis name signifies the first settlers of the region, descendants of \nwhom still live there today.\n  Other words come to mind in describing the Atchafalaya: mysterious \ndynamic, multi-cultural; enchanting, bountiful; threatened and \nundiscovered. This region is one of the most complex and least \nunderstood places in Louisiana and the Nation. Yet, the stories of the \nAtchafalaya Heritage Area are emblematic of the broader American \nexperience. Here there are opportunities to understand and witness the \ncomplicated, sometimes harmonious, sometimes adversarial interplay \nbetween nature and culture. The history of the United States has been \nshaped by the complex dance of its people working with, against, and \nfor, nature. Within the Atchafalaya a penchant for adventure, \nadaptation, ingenuity, and exploitation has created a cultural legacy \nunlike anywhere else in the world.\n  The heart of the heritage area is the Atchafalaya Basin. It is the \nlargest river swamp in the United States, larger than the more widely \nknown Everglades or Okefenokee Swamp. The Atchafalaya is characterized \nby a maze of streams, and at one time was thickly forested with old-\ngrowth cypress and tupelo trees. The Basin provides outstanding habitat \nfor a remarkably diverse array of wildlife, including the endangered \nAmerican bald eagle and Louisiana black bear. The region's unique \necology teems with life. More than 85 species of fish, crustaceans such \nas crawfish, wildlife including alligators; an astonishing array of \nwell over 200 species of birds, from waterfowl to songbirds, forest-\ndwelling mammals such as deer, squirrel, beaver and other commercially \nimportant furbearers all make their home here. Bottomland hardwood-\ndependent bird species breed here in some of the highest densities ever \nrecorded in annual North American Breeding Bird Surveys. The Basin also \nforms part of the Mississippi Valley Flyway for migratory waterfowl and \nis a major wintering ground for thousands of these geese and ducks. In \ngeneral, the Atchafalaya Basin has a significant proportion of \nNorth America's breeding wading birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises, \nand spoonbills. Some of the largest flocks of Wood Storks in North \nAmerica summer here, and the southern part of the Basin has a healthy \npopulation of Bald Eagles nesting every winter.\n\n  The region's dynamic system of waterways, geology, and massive \nearthern guide levees reveals a landscape that is at once fragile and \nawesome. The geology and natural systems of the Atchafalaya Heritage \nArea have fueled the economy of the region for centuries. For decades \nthe harvest of cypress, cotton, sugar cane, crawfish, salt, oil, gas, \nand Spanish moss, have been important sources of income for the \nregion's residents. The crawfish industry has been particularly \nimportant to the lives of Atchafalaya residents and Louisiana has \nbecome the largest crawfish producer in the United States. Sport \nfishing and other forms of commercial fishing are important here, too, \nbut unfortunately, natural resource extraction and a changing \nenvironment have drastically depleted many of these resources and \nforced residents to find new ways to make a living.\n  Over the past century, the Atchafalaya Basin has become a study of \nman's monumental effort to control nature. After the catastrophic \nMississippi River flood of 1927 left thousands dead and millions \ndisplaced, the U.S. Congress decreed that the U.S. Army Crops of \nEngineers should develop an intricate system of levees to protect human \nsettlements, particularly New Orleans. Today, the Mississippi River is \ncaged within the walls of earthern and concrete levees and manipulated \nwith a complex system of locks, barrages and floodgates. The \nAtchafalaya River runs parallel to the Mississippi and through the \ncenter of the Basin. In times of flooding the river basis serves as the \nkey floodway in controlling floodwaters headed for the large population \ncenters of Baton Rouge and New Orleans by diverting waters from the \nMississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico. This system was sorely tested \nin 1973 when floodwaters threatened to break through the floodgates and \npermanently divert the Mississippi River into the Atchafalaya. However, \nafter this massive flood event, new land started forming off the coast. \nThese new land formations make up the Atchafalaya Delta, and is the \nonly significant area of new land being built in the United States. \nThese vast amounts of Mississippi River sediment are also raising \nfilling in the Basin itself, raising the level of land in certain areas \nof the basin and filling in lakes and waterways. And to demonstrate \njust how complex this ecosystem is, one only needs to realize that just \nto the East of the Delta, Terrebonne parish, also in the heritage area, \nis experiencing some of the most significant coastal land loss in the \ncountry.\n  Over the centuries, the ever-changing natural environment has shaped \nthe lives of the people living in the basin. Residents have profited \nfrom and been imperiled by nature. The popular cultural identify of the \nregion is strongly associated with the Canjuns, descendents of the \nFrench-speaking Acadians who settled in south Louisiana after being \ndeported by the British from Nova Scotia, (formerly known as Acadia). \nTwenty-five hundred to three thousand exiled Acadians repatriated in \nLouisiana where they proceeded to re-establish their former society.\n  Today, in spite of complex social, cultural, and demographic \ntransformations, Cajuns maintain a sense of group identify and continue \nto display a distinctive set of cultural expressions nearly two-\nhundred-and-fifty years after their exile from Acadia. Cajun culture \nhas become increasingly popular outside of Louisiana. Culinary \nspecialties adapted from France and Acadia such as etoufee, boudin, \nandouille, crepes, beignets and sauces thickened with roux, delight \nfood lovers well\n\n[[Page S8098]]\n\nbeyound Lousiana's borders. Cajun music has also ``gone mainstream'' \nwith its blend of French folk songs and ballads and instrumental dance \nmusic, and more recent popular country, rhythm-and-blues, and rock \nmusic influences. While the growing interest in Cajun culture has \nraised appreciation for its unique traditions, many of the region's \nresidents are concerned about the growing commercialization and \nstereotyping that threatens to diminish the authentic Cajun ways of \nlife.\n\n  While the Atchafalaya Heritage Area may be well known for its Cajun \nculture, there is an astonishing array of other cultures within these \nparishes. Outside of New Orleans, the Atchafalaya Heritage Area is the \nmost racially and ethnically complex region of Louisiana, and has been \nso for many year. A long legacy of multiculturalism presents \ninteresting opportunities to examine how so many distinct cultures have \nsurvived in relative harmony. There may be interesting lessons to learn \nfrom here as our nation becomes increasingly heterogeneous. The \ncultural complexity of this region has created a rich tapestry of \nhistory and traditions, evidenced by the architecture, music, language, \nfood and festivals unlike anyplace else. Ethnic groups of the \nAtchafalaya include: African-Americans, Black Creoles, Asians, Chinese, \nFilipinos, Vietnamese, Lebanese, Cajuns, Spanish Islenos, Italians, \nScotch-Irish, and American Indian tribes such as the Attakapa, \nChitimacha, Coushatta, Houma, Opelousa and Tunica-Biloxi.\n  This heritage area has a wealth of existing cultural, historic, \nnatural, scenic, recreational and visitor resources on which to build. \nScenic resources include numerous State Wildlife Management Areas and \nNational Wildlife Refuges, as well as ten designated state scenic \nbyways that fall partially or entirely within the heritage area. The \nOffice of State Parks operates three historic sites in the heritage \narea, and numerous historic districts and buildings can be found in the \nregion. There are also nine Main Street communities in the heritage \narea. Outdoor recreational resources include two State Parks and a \nmultitude of waterways and bayous. Hunting, fishing, boating, and \ncanoeing, and more recently birdwatching and cycling, are popular ways \nto experience the region. Various visitor attractions, interpretive \ncenters and visitor information centers exist to help residents and \ntourists alike better understand and navigate many of the resources in \nthe heritage area. Major roads link the heritage area's central visitor \nentrance points and large population centers, especially New Orleans. \nMuch of the hospitality industry servicing the Atchafalaya exists \naround the larger cities of Baton Rouge, Lafayette and Houma. However, \nmore and more bed and breakfasts and heritage accommodations, such as \nhouseboat rentals, are becoming more numerous in the smaller towns and \nrural areas.\n  These are just some of the examples of the richness and significance \nof this region. This legislation will assist communities throughout \nthis heritage area who are committed to the conservation and \nappropriate development of these assets. Furthermore, this legislation \nwill bring a level of prestige and national and international \nrecognition that this most special of places certainly deserves.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2899\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide that bonuses and other extraordinary or \nexcessive compensation of corporate insiders and wrongdoers may be \nincluded in the bankruptcy estate; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I come to the floor today to introduce \nlegislation that will bring more accountability to corporate officers \nand directors when a company goes bankrupt. This bill contains \nsubstantially the same language I had in an amendment I filed to the \ncorporate reform bill that we passed into law a couple of months ago, \nbut unfortunately my bankruptcy amendment was not considered. My \nlegislation, the ``Corporate Accountability in Bankruptcy Act'', would \nclarify that the bonuses and other excessive compensation of corporate \ndirectors and wrongdoers can be brought back into a bankruptcy estate \nwhen a company goes bankrupt. This legislation is equitable because \ncorporate officers and those individuals that have engaged in \nwrongdoing and violated the securities and accounting laws should not \nbe able to make outrageous amounts of money off of a company which has \ngone bankrupt, while the company's employees, shareholders and \ncreditors are left carrying the burden of the bankruptcy. Furthermore, \ncorporate officers and insiders shouldn't be allowed to get bonuses and \nloans when a company has done so poorly to go bankrupt. They don't \ndeserve that kind of excessive compensation. The plain fact is that \ncorporate officers and those who engage in illegal activity should not \nbe allowed to benefit where their actions have contributed to the \ndownfall of the company. I don't think that's fair, and my bill would \nensure that there is some equity in terms of who gets left holding the \nbag when a company goes bankrupt.\n  Currently, the Bankruptcy Code permits a trustee to recover assets \nwhich a debtor has previously distributed to creditors within a certain \ntime period prior to the filing of a bankruptcy petition. This allows a \ntrustee to increase a debtor's assets for the fair treatment and \nequitable distribution of assets among all creditors, as well as to \nhelp shore up a debtor's assets during a reorganization.\n  Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code allows a trustee to recover assets \nfrom an insider made within a year of the filing of a bankruptcy \npetition. However, the Bankruptcy Code does not clearly establish that \nthis section applies to bonuses and other extraordinary or excessive \ncompensation of insiders, officers and directors. A cursory review of \nthe case law by my staff and the Congressional Research Service \nindicates that the courts have not developed this issue, and that \nrelevant case law is not dispositive on the matter of whether bonuses \nand excessive compensation are avoidable in bankruptcies of publically \nheld companies.\n\n  In addition, section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code allows a trustee to \nrecover transfers of assets, made within one year, where there has been \na fraudulent transaction or where a debtor has received less than what \nis reasonably equivalent in value. Here too, the Bankruptcy Code is not \nclear as to whether this section applies to the bonuses and other \nextraordinary or excessive compensation of officers, directors or other \ncompany employees who have violated securities laws or engaged in \nillegal accounting practices when their conduct, but not their \ncompensation, has led to the company's bankruptcy. Similarly, the case \nlaw is not dispositive on this matter either.\n\n[[Page S8100]]\n\n  I think everyone would agree that a trustee should be able to recover \nthese kinds of assets when a company goes bankrupt. Corporate bigwigs \nand wrongdoers shouldn't be able to keep their bonuses, loans or other \nexcessive compensation when a company goes under. Corporate \nmismanagement and irresponsibility should not be rewarded, and the bad \nguys need to be held accountable.\n  So I think that we need to clarify the Bankruptcy Code in order that \nbonuses, loans, and other extraordinary or excessive compensation that \nthe company has given to the insiders and wrongdoers can be drawn back \ninto the bankruptcy estate.\n  My legislation is simply and straightforward. The Corporate \nAccountability in Bankruptcy Act would specifically provide in section \n547 of the Bankruptcy Code that a trustee may recover bonuses, loans, \nnonqualified deferred compensation, and any other extraordinary or \nexcessive compensation as determined by the court, made to an insider, \nofficer or director and made within one year before the date of the \nfiling of the bankruptcy petition.\n\n  In addition, the Corporate Accountability in Bankruptcy Act would \nspecifically provide in section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code that a \ntrustee may recover bonuses, loans, nonqualified deferred compensation, \nand any other extraordinary or excessive compensation, as determined by \nthe court, paid to an officer, director or employee who has committed \nsecurities or accounting violations, within 4 years of the filing of \nthe bankruptcy petition. My bill extends the present one year reach-\nback period for fraudulent transfers in the Bankruptcy Code to 4 years, \nI did that because a majority of states have adopted a 4 year time \nperiod or the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act which allows for a 4 year \ntime frame. I believe that these changes to section 548 are fair \nbecause they are tied to excessiveness and wrongdoing. Simply said, \nillegal acts should not be rewarded with a big fat paycheck.\n  The point of this bill is that corporate officers and wrongdoers \nshould not be able to keep bonuses, loans and other excessive \ncompensation when the company goes under and others, employees, \ncreditors and investors, are left holding an empty bag through no fault \nof their own. It's just not fair. So I hope that my colleagues will \nsupport the Corporate Accountability in Bankruptcy Act to make the \nBankruptcy Code clear that corporate bigwigs and wrongdoers cannot \nunjustly enrich themselves and their excessive compensation and loans \ncan and will be brought back into the bankruptcy estate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2901\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 6101 West Old Shakopee Road in Bloomington, \nMinnesota, as the ``Thomas E. Burnett, Jr. Post Office Building''; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nAmerican hero. Tom Burnett, Jr. was a beloved husband and father, an \nadored son, and an able business leader. He was a person who would not, \nand did not, sit quietly as terrorists carried out their plan last year \non September 11.\n  I am introducing a bill today, along with my colleague from \nMinnesota, Senator Dayton. Our bill would designate a U.S. Postal \nService facility in Bloomington, MN as the ``Thomas E. Burnett, Jr. \nPost Office Building.'' It is a companion proposal to a bill introduced \nby our House colleague, Representative Jim Ramstad, whose district \nincludes Bloomington.\n  Tom Burnett, Jr., who grew up in Bloomington, was aboard United \nFlight 93 on September 11 of last year. America owes Tom a deep debt of \ngratitude for his bravery on that day. It is possible that Members of \nCongress, including myself, could owe him our very lives. We will never \nknow for sure. Tom is believed by investigators to have been among \nthose passengers who kept the hijackers from crashing Flight 93 into a \nnational landmark, most likely the White House or the Capitol. That, of \ncourse, would likely have resulted in many more deaths than already \noccurred that day. Instead, as we all know, Flight 93 crashed in a \nPennsylvania field.\n  After listening to the tape from the flight's black box, law \nenforcement officials have described a desperate struggle aboard the \nplane. As FBI Director Mueller said after being briefed on the contents \nof the tape, ``We believe those passengers were absolute heroes, and \ntheir actions during this flight were heroic.''\n  Tom Burnett, Jr. was 38 years old when he died. A 1986 graduate of \nthe Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota and a \nmember of Alpha Kappa Psi fraternity, he had shown selfless leadership \nbefore. As a quarterback at Thomas Jefferson High School in \nBloomington, Tom's inspired play led his team to the conference \nchampionship game in 1980. He was a successful business leader as chief \noperating officer for a medical device manufacturer in California.\n  We will never forget the ultimate sacrifice of Tom and many other \nheroes last September 11. Our thoughts and prayers today are with Tom's \nfamily: his wife Deena; their daughters Madison, Halley and Anna-Clair; \nhis parents Thomas, Sr. and Beverly; and his sisters Martha O'Brien and \nMary Margaret Burnett. Bloomington will be proud to have this post \noffice named for Tom Burnett, Jr. We all are proud of this son of \nMinnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/03/senate-section/article/S8100-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4471.
