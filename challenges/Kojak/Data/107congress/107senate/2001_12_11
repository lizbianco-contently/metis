DiMario, Public \nPrinter\n\n[[Page S12818]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to express my enthusiastic support \nfor the three judicial nominees the Senate is about to consider. All \nthree are extremely well-qualified nominees who have distinguished \nthemselves with hard work and great intellect. I think they will do \ngreat service for the citizens of our country.\n  One of the nominees we are considering today is John Bates. Mr. Bates \nhas compiled an impressive resume during his 25-year legal career, \nhaving masterfully handled complex litigation in both the public and \nprivate sectors. He began his career with a federal district court \nclerkship, then joined the highly regarded Washington, D.C. firm of \nSteptoe & Johnson as an associate. In 1980, he left private practice to \nbecame an Assistant United States Attorney here in D.C. He developed a \nspecialization in handling complex civil cases, eventually rising to \nbecome chief of the office's civil division.\n  After 15 years at the U.S. Attorney's Office and a detail to the \nOffice of the Independent Counsel investigating Whitewater, Mr. Bates \nreturned to the private sector in 1998, joining the D.C. firm of Miller \n& Chevalier as a member. Despite the demands of his legal practice, he \nhas demonstrated a true commitment to his community through his service \non the Board of Directors of the Washington Lawyers' Committee on Civil \nRights and Urban Affairs. The breadth and depth of Mr. Bates's legal \ncareer will serve him well as a federal district court judge here in \nthe District of Columbia.\n  Another one of our district court nominees is Kurt Engelhardt, who \nhas been nominated to be a federal district judge in the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana. During his 15-year legal career, Mr. Engelhardt \nhas handled a wide array of civil litigation cases, including \ncommercial litigation, bankruptcy, and casualty and professional \nmalpractice defense work.\n  In 1995, the Conference of the Louisiana Court of Appeal Judges \nnominated Mr. Engelhardt to serve on the Judiciary Commission of \nLouisiana, which is the body of the Louisiana Supreme Court responsible \nfor hearing allegations of ethical violations by state judges and \nmaking disciplinary recommendations. This appointment reflects the high \nesteem in which Louisiana's judges hold Mr. Engelhardt. I am confident \nthat his demonstrated exercise of sound judgment will bring honor and \nfairness to the federal bench.\n  Julie A. Robinson has been nominated for the federal bench in the \nDistrict of Kansas. She graduated from the University of Kansas School \nof Law and then went to work as a law clerk to the Chief Bankruptcy \nJudge for the District of Kansas. She must have liked that clerkship \nfor the last six years, she has been sitting as a Bankruptcy Judge on \nthat very same court, and also currently serves as a Judge on the Tenth \nCircuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel. In between, Judge Robinson gained a \nwealth of both criminal and civil experience as an Assistant U.S. \nAttorney in the District of Kansas. Judge Robinson is a Fellow of the \nAmerican Bar Foundation and sits on many committees as a member of the \nNational Conference of Bankruptcy Judges, the Kansas Bar Association, \nand as a past president of the Board of Governors for the University of \nKansas School of Law. She is currently a Master of the Sam Crow Inn of \nCourt. Judge Robinson's obvious skills, work ethic, and devotion to her \nprofession make it clear that the people of Kansas will be well served \nwith her on the District Court bench.\n  It is a pleasure to speak on behalf of these nominees prior to their \nvotes. I encourage my colleagues to vote for their confirmation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is, Will the Senate \nadvise and consent to the nomination of John D. Bates, of Maryland, to \nbe a U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia? On this \nquestion, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich), \nthe Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Hagel), and the Senator from Oklahoma \n(Mr. Inhofe) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nOklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) would vote ``yea.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 97, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 361 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--97\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Hagel\n     Inhofe\n     Voinovich\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am about to make a unanimous consent \nrequest on these judges. I want people to know the three judicial \nnominations before us today fill vacancies in the District of Columbia, \nthe eastern district of Louisiana, and Kansas. When we act favorably on \nthese nominations, we will have confirmed 24 Federal judges since July, \nincluding 6 to the courts of appeals.\n  I mention that because when I became chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee in July, Federal court vacancies were rising to 111. Since \nJuly, we have worked very hard. The Senate has been cooperative. We \nhave confirmed two dozen judges. We are lowering the number of \nvacancies. In fact, since I became chairman, we have had 19 additional \nvacancies arise. But we have not only outpaced this high level of \nattrition, we have lowered the vacancies to under 100. Of course, we \nwould not have had nearly as many vacancies had the Senate confirmed \nthe judges nominated by President Clinton.\n  We have made progress and outpaced attrition. We have filled \nvacancies. We are moving forward. I thank Senators on both sides of the \naisle who have helped so much on this, who have worked with us even \nwhen we had to move out of the Senate office buildings because of \nanthrax attacks and the September 11 attacks. We have kept going. \nContrary to what one person said on TV, inaccurately, and I assume by \nmistake, this weekend about not keeping up with attrition, we not only \nhave kept up with attrition, we have outpaced attrition.\n  We will try to keep that number moving in the right direction. In \nspite of the upheavals we have experienced this year with the shifts in \nchairmanship, the delay in reorganizing the Senate and assigning \nMembers to the committees, the vacancies that have arisen since this \nsummer, the need to focus our attention on responsible action in the \nfight against international terrorism and the threats and dislocations \nof the anthrax attacks, we are making progress.\n  Far from taking a ``time out,'' as Republicans were suggesting, this \nCommittee has been in overdrive since July and we redoubled our efforts \nafter September 11, 2001.\n  During the last 6\\1/2\\ years when a Republican majority controlled \nthe process, the vacancies rose from 65 to at least 103, an increase of \nalmost 60 percent.\n  Since July, we have been making strides to reverse that record and \nhave worked hard to reduce vacancies below the 111 vacancies that \nexisted in July.\n  In addition to the three nominations being considered by the Senate \ntoday, another three nominations to vacancies on the District Courts in \nNew Mexico, Arizona and Georgia are on the Senate Executive Calendar, \nand another five nominations were included in a hearing last Wednesday.\n  If the Committee is able to report those nominations and the Senate \nacts favorably on them before recessing for\n\n[[Page S12819]]\n\nthe year, we will have confirmed 32 judges since July and 28 since the \nAugust recess. This is more judges than were confirmed after the August \nrecess in any of the last 6\\1/2\\ years. It would be more judges than \nwere confirmed in the first year of the Clinton administration and \ninclude twice as many judges to the Courts of Appeals as were confirmed \nthat year.\n  It would be more than twice as many judges as were confirmed in the \nfirst year of the first Bush administration, including more judges to \nthe Courts of Appeals.\n  The President has yet to send nominations to fill more than half of \nthe current vacancies. This is a particular problem with the 71 \nDistrict Court vacancies, for which 50--more than--70 percent--do not \nhave nominations pending.\n  We have been able to reduce vacancies over the last 6 months through \nhard work and a rapid pace of scheduling hearings. Until I became \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee, no judicial nominees had been \ngiven hearings this year. No judicial nominees had been considered by \nthe Judiciary Committee or been voted upon by the Senate.\n  After almost a month's delay in the reorganization of the Senate in \nJune while Republicans sought leverage to change the way judicial \nnominations had traditionally been considered and abruptly abandoned \nthe practices that they had employed for the last 6\\1/2\\ years, I \nnoticed our first hearing on judicial nominees within 10 minutes of the \nreorganization resolution being adopted by the Senate.\n  I have previously noted that during the 6\\1/2\\ years that the \nRepublican majority most recently controlled the confirmation process, \nin 34 of those months they held no confirmations for any judicial \nnominees at all, and in 30 other months they conducted only a single \nconfirmation hearing involving judicial nominees.\n  Since the Committee was assigned its members in early July, 2001, we \nhave held confirmation hearings every month, including two in July, two \nduring the August recess, two during December and three hearings during \nOctober. Only once during the previous 6\\1/2\\ years has the Committee \nheld as many as three hearings in a single month.\n  On the other hand, on at least three occasions during the past 6\\1/2\\ \nyears the Committee had gone more than five months without holding a \nsingle hearing on a pending judicial nominee. We have held more \nhearings involving judicial nominees since July 11, 2001 than our \nRepublican predecessors held in all of 1996, 1997, 1999 or 2000. In the \nlast six months of this extraordinarily challenging year, the Committee \nhas held 11 hearings involving judicial nominees.\n  Last week the Committee held its tenth hearing on judicial \nnominations and yesterday I chaired our eleventh since the Committee \nwas assigned its membership on July 10, 2001. During the three months \nsince September 11, the Judiciary Committee has held seven judicial \nconfirmation hearings--the same number that the Republican majority \nheld in all of 1999 and one more than they held in all of 1996. Since \nJuly we have held hearings on 34 judicial nominees, including seven to \nthe Courts of Appeals.\n  Since September 11 we have held hearings on 27 judicial nominees, \nincluding four to the Courts of Appeals.\n  Working with the Majority Leader and the Deputy Leader, I have \nadopted a practice for the second half of this year of working with all \nSenators and with the Administration to try to fill an many judicial \nvacancies as possible. To date we have succeeded in confirming 24 \njudges.\n  We have persevered through extraordinary circumstances during which \nthe Senate building housing the Judiciary Committee hearing room was \nclosed, as were the buildings housing the offices of all the Senators \non the Committee. We persevered through a partisan filibuster \npreventing action on the bill that funds our nation's foreign policy \ninitiatives and provides funds to help build the international \ncoalition against terrorism.\n  We showed patience and resolve when at our November hearing a family \nmember of one of the nominees grew faint and required medical \nattention. That hearing was completed after attending to those medical \nneeds.\n  We have accomplished more, and at a faster pace, than in years past. \nEven with the time needed by the FBI to follow up on the allegations \nthat arose regarding Judge Wooten in connection with his confirmation \nhearing, we have proceeded much more quickly than at any time during \nthe last 6\\1/2\\ years. Thus, while the average time from nomination to \nconfirmation grew to well over 200 days for the last several years, we \nhave considered nominees much more promptly.\n  Measured from receipt of their ABA peer reviews, we have confirmed \nthe judges this year, including the Court of Appeals nominees, on \naverage in less than 60 days. So, we are working harder and faster than \npreviously on judicial nominations, despite the difficulties being \nfaced by the nation and the Senate.\n  We have also completed work on a number of judicial nominations in a \nmore open manner than ever before.\n  For the first time, this Committee is making public the ``blue \nslips'' sent to home State Senators. Until my chairmanship, these \nmatters were treated as confidential materials and restricted from \npublic view. We have moved nominees with less time from hearings to the \nCommittee's business meeting agenda, and then out to the floor, where \nnominees have received timely roll call votes and confirmations.\n  The past practices of extended unexplained anonymous holds on \nnominees after a hearing have not been evident in the last six months \nof this year as they were in the past. Indeed over the past 6\\1/2\\ \nyears at least eight judicial nominees who completed a confirmation \nhearing were never considered by the Committee but left without action.\n  Likewise, the extended, unexplained, anonymous holds on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar that characterized so much of the last 6\\1/2\\ years \nhave not slowed the confirmation process this year. Majority Leader \nDaschle has moved swiftly on judicial nominees reported to the \ncalendar.\n  Once those judicial nominees have been afforded a timely rollcall \nvote, the record shows that the only vote against any of President \nBush's nominees to the federal courts to date was cast by the \nRepublican Leader.\n  With respect to law enforcement, I have noted that the administration \nwas quite slow in making United States Attorney nominations, although \nit had called for the resignations of United States Attorneys early in \nthe year.\n  Since we began receiving nominations just before the August recess, \nwe have been able to report, and the Senate has confirmed, 57 of these \nnominations. We have only a few more United States Attorney nominations \nreceived in November and December, and await approximately 30 \nnominations from the Administration. These are the President's nominees \nbased on the standards that he and the Attorney General have devised.\n  I note, again, that it is most unfortunate that we still have not \nreceived even a single nomination for any of the United States Marshal \npositions. United States Marshals are often the top federal law \nenforcement officer in their district. They are an important front-line \ncomponent in homeland security efforts across the country. We are near \nthe end of the legislative year without a single nomination for these \n94 critical law enforcement positions.\n  It will likely be impossible to confirm any United States Marshals \nthis year having not received any nominations in the first 11 and one-\nhalf months of the year.\n  In the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, some of us have \nbeen seeking to join together in a bipartisan effort in the best \ninterests of the country.\n  For those on the Committee who have helped in those efforts and \nassisted in the hard work to review and consider the scores of \nnominations we have reported this year, I thank them. As the facts \nestablish and as our actions today and all year demonstrate, we are \nmoving ahead to fill judicial vacancies with nominees who have strong \nbipartisan support. These include a number of very conservative \nnominees.\n  The nominations before the Senate today are John Bates for the \nDistrict of Columbia, Julie Robinson for the District Court in Kansas, \nand Kurt Engelhardt for the District Court in the Eastern District of \nLouisiana.\n\n[[Page S12820]]\n\n  Before I became Chairman, the last confirmation to the District Court \nfor the District of Columbia was that of Judge Ellen Huvelle. Despite \nbeing a distinguished judge in the D.C. Superior Court for nearly a \ndecade, her nomination was pending for almost seven months before she \nreceived a hearing. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly had similar \ncredentials and suffered even worse delays. Judge Kollar-Kotelly also \nserved as a distinguished local judge. Her confirmation, nonetheless, \nrequired two nominations over two years before she was finally \nconfirmed in 1997. She was not confirmed for eight months after her \nconfirmation hearing. Of course, she has now replaced Judge Jackson as \nthe judge in charge of proceedings on the government suit and proposed \nsettlement of that legal action against Microsoft.\n  Despite nominees for vacancies on the District Court for the District \nof Columbia over the past several years, no nomination to this District \nCourt had received a hearing in over two years. Things changed this \nJuly. First, we moved expeditiously to consider the nomination of Judge \nReggie Walton to one of those longstanding vacancies. I chaired an \nunprecedented August recess hearing for Judge Walton and he was \nconfirmed in September. Now we are proceeding, with the support of \nRepresentative Norton, to fill a second longstanding vacancy on the \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. John Bates will be the \nsecond confirmation to the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia in the last three months, after years of inaction.\n  The vacancy that is being filled by Judge Robinson is one that \nexisted before I became chairman. Indeed, last year the President had \nnominated Keith Gary Sebelius in anticipation of that vacancy.\n  In the last 6 months of last year Mr. Sebelius was not included in a \nhearing and his nomination died without Committee action and without \nSenate action when it was returned to the White House last December. \nLast year the Republican majority held only two hearings involving only \nseven District Court nominees in July and no hearings for any other \njudicial nominees in August, September, October, November or December, \nin spite of the vacancies and pending judicial nominations to fill \nthem. This year, during the same time frame, the Committee has held 11 \nhearings involving 34 judicial nominations of which 27 have already \nbeen reported favorably to the Senate.\n  With respect to the vacancy in Kansas, Senators Roberts and Brownback \nwrote to me in October enclosing a letter from the Chief Judge of that \nDistrict indicating that the vacancy combined with medical leave for a \nsenior Judge had created a serious problem in that District. Chief \nJudge Lungstrum noted in his letter to Senator Roberts that the \nDistrict in Kansas was without an active judge it its Topeka division. \nJust as we responded quickly to the Chief Judge of the District Court \nin Montana and the Chief Judge of the District Court in the Eastern \nDistrict of Kentucky, we have responded to Chief Judge Lungstrum. Judge \nRobinson was included in a hearing on November 7 and reported by the \nCommittee last month.\n  With respect to the vacancy on the Eastern District of Louisiana, \nthat vacancy predated my chairmanship, as well. I recall the nomination \nin 1997 of Judge Lemelle to a vacancy on that court, the hearing held \non his nominations more than 11 months later and his confirmation later \nstill that year. I am glad to work with Senators Breaux and Landrieu to \nhelp fill another vacancy on that important court and to be able to do \nso within one-third the time it took to confirm the last judge to this \nDistrict.\n  I am proud of the work the Committee has done on nominations, and I \nam proud that by the end of today we will have confirmed 24 judges. I \nhope that by the end of this session that total will rise to about 30 \nas the Committee continues its work on the nominations heard last week \nand the Senate confirms the additional three nominees previously \nreported by the Committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to respond to remarks by my good \nfriend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from Vermont, about the \npace of moving judicial nominees. Now, at the outset, I should say I am \npleased that we are moving the few judges we have moved to date. \nHowever, despite the confirmation of three Federal judges today, the \nnumber of vacancies in the Federal judiciary remains at nearly 100--not \nfar from where it has hovered ever since the Democrats assumed control \nof the Judiciary Committee. This is no victory--the vacancy rate still \nstands at a staggering 11.3 percent.\n  In 1997, Senator Leahy remarked:\n\n       For the past several months I have spoken about the crisis \n     being created by the almost 100 vacancies that are being \n     perpetuated on the Federal courts around the country and the \n     failure of the Senate to carry out its constitutional \n     responsibilities to advise and consent to judicial \n     confirmations. . . . Confirming Federal judges should not be \n     a partisan issue. The administration of justice is not a \n     political issue. Working together, the Senate should do our \n     constitutionally mandated job and proceed to confirm the \n     judges we need for the Federal system.\n\n  I couldn't agree more with these sentiments. One hundred vacancies in \nthe Federal judiciary is nothing to brag about, especially when there \nare 40 nominees waiting to fill these gaps. Some of these nominees have \nbeen waiting for hearings as long as seven months, and it is evident \nthat most, if not all, of them will not get a hearing and vote this \nyear.\n  Maybe some of my colleagues forget that earlier in the year when we \nattempted to move the first of President Bush's judicial nominees, some \non the other side of the aisle objected that we were moving too fast \neither they wanted the ABA to do an evaluation before they would allow \nus to move or it was a fight over the now infamous blue-slip process. I \nsay this in response to claims that somehow it is the Republicans' \nfault for not confirming judges earlier this year.\n  I am not the only one who has noticed that the Committee is making \nslow work of its job this year. In a November 30 editorial, the \nWashington Post declared that the Committee should hold more judicial \nconfirmation hearings, concluding that ``[f]ailing to hold them in a \ntimely fashion damages the judiciary, disrespects the president's power \nto name judges and is grossly unfair to often well-qualified \nnominees.''\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee during 6 years of the Clinton \nAdministration, I responded to the vacancies in the Federal judiciary \nby holding hearings and votes on judges. As a result, 377 Clinton \nappointees are sitting on the Federal bench today. So, in contrast to \nthe claims I have heard today, the present vacancy rate is not the \nresult of any failure to confirm Clinton nominees. Instead, it is a \ndirect result of the failure to confirm Bush nominees.\n  What is important to note is that at the end of the 106th Congress, \nthere were only 67 vacancies in the federal judiciary for which there \nwas a total of 41 nominees--some of whom were not nominated until very \nlate in the year. Today, of course, there are nearly 100 vacancies, but \nthe Senate has confirmed only 24 judges. So I believe it's fair to say \nthat the pace of confirmations has not kept up with attrition.\n  I am pleased that we are taking these steps with the confirmation of \nthree federal district judges. There are three more judicial nominees \nawaiting floor votes, and seven more judicial nominees awaiting a \nCommittee vote, including one circuit judge. I urge my Democratic \ncolleagues to act to confirm at least these nominees before the end of \nthe session, and work with us to move the roadblocks they have erected \nin the confirmation process of all the other nominees, particularly \nthose circuit court nominees who have been pending since May.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if nobody has any objection, I ask \nunanimous consent that we vacate the yeas and nays on the next two \nnominations and that the Chair put the question of each one of them \nseparately to the body on a voice vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, what was the request?\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I could respond to the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, my request is that we vacate the yeas and nays on the next \ntwo nominations and that we bring them up separately now and that the \nbody be allowed to vote on them by voice vote.\n\n[[Page S12821]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I ask unanimous consent that an article from the front \npage of yesterday's New York Times regarding the ripples of September \n11 widening in retailing and the extraordinary impact of September 11, \nnot just at ground zero but broadly across the country on small \nbusinesses, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 10, 2001]\n\n                 Ripples of Sept. 11 Widen in Retailing\n\n                           (By Edward Wyatt)\n\n       On West Eighth Street in Greenwich Village, shoe salesmen \n     stand forlornly on the sidewalk in front of \n     Leather, smoking cigarettes and staring blankly \n     into the distance, wondering where all the customers have \n     gone.\n       Down the block, Raja Chaani, the manager of India Imports, \n     and two of his employees sit on stools in a sprawling space \n     chock-full of leather jackets, silk scarves and Indian curios \n     but devoid of customers.\n       Across the street, at Man Plus, Sonny Shahani and three \n     other salesmen spend their time rearranging sweaters and \n     calculating how much their commissions have fallen. And at \n     House of Nubian, no one but a few Internet shoppers is buying \n     Negro League jackets and hats, or buttons with pictures of \n     black leaders like Malcolm X and Haile Selassie.\n       While it was expected that small businesses near the site \n     of the World Trade Center would suffer from the terrorist \n     attack on Sept. 11, which displaced 100,000 potential \n     customers from office buildings in the area and thousands \n     more from their homes, wider economic damage from the attack \n     is still rippling outward from ground zero.\n       The national economy, of course, was already slowing before \n     Sept. 11. But the attack sent shudders through small \n     businesses, not only in New York City but also across the \n     nation. Some economic forecasters say they believe a wave of \n     business failures in New York and elsewhere could come soon \n     after the first of the year, as retailers and other \n     entrepreneurs succumb to the continuing lack of new business \n     in what is traditionally their busiest season.\n       ``I've been on this street for 15 years, and it's never \n     been this bad,'' said Kawal Bhatia, whose family owns \n     Leather, a shoe and leather goods store at 22 West \n     Eighth Street which, despite its name, does not have a Web \n     site. ``In past years, no matter how bad it was the rest of \n     the year, at least you knew you would cover all your losses \n     with the holiday shoppers.'' But on a recent Friday, he said, \n     ``I did $25 worth of business.''\n       Last week, Mr. Bhatia put up a new sign: ``Store Closing.''\n       Small businesses, including many retail establishments, \n     account for two of every five jobs in New York City and \n     roughly half of all jobs statewide, so the drought among \n     small-business owners presages economic pain that is likely \n     to spread far beyond Lower Manhattan. And while numerous \n     grant and loan programs have sprung up to help small \n     businesses recover from the disaster, business owners have \n     complained, in a growing chorus, that the grants are too \n     small to stem their losses and that loan agencies are not \n     approving loans.\n       On Eighth Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the \n     Americas, for example, roughly two miles north of ground \n     zero, businesses that depend on people who travel into the \n     city to shop have been devastated. The block, the professed \n     shoe district of Manhattan, has for decades served as a \n     crucible for small businesses, a place where shoe and leather \n     goods shops have mixed with funky clothing emporiums serving \n     an eclectic mix of college students, tourists and New Yorkers \n     in search of bargains. But tourists have stopped coming, and \n     retail sales not just in the Village but across the city have \n     been suffering.\n       Economists say it is too early to tell just how many small \n     businesses are likely to end up closing or in Bankruptcy \n     Court, but they say that the signs are not good.\n       ``I think there is a strong likelihood that come the first \n     quarter, small businesses that are holding on by the seat of \n     their pants may not be able to hold on anymore without some \n     outside assistance,'' said Ian E. Novos, senior director for \n     economic consulting service of KPMG.\n       A report assessing the economic impact of Sept. 11 that was \n     prepared for the New York City Partnership, by KPMG and SRI \n     International, another consulting firm, predicted that for \n     the next two years, small businesses' sales would continue to \n     fall short of what was expected before the trade center \n     attack. Employment among small businesses will continue to \n     fall through the first quarter of next year, the report said.\n       During the recession of the early 1990's, in a downturn \n     that was short-lived by historical standards, business \n     failures in New York State peaked at more than 6,000 \n     companies per year, according to Dun & Bradstreet. The \n     failures involved less than 1 percent of the small businesses \n     operating in the state. In 1997, the most recent year for \n     which data is available, there were roughly 1.2 million small \n     businesses operating in New York State, according to state \n     statistics. (Federal data on small businesses, using \n     different measurement criteria, put the number at about half \n     that.)\n       The 1990's recession lacked some of the ingredients of \n     today's problems--most important a cataclysmic event that \n     sent jobs streaming away from Lower Manhattan, immediately \n     closed off spigots of corporate spending and sent consumers \n     into a kind of anti-spending shock. Since the disaster, the \n     United States Small Business Administration has approved only \n     about one in three applications for disaster loans. Those \n     loans have provided $164 million to more than 2,000 \n     businesses so far, but the approval rate is well below the \n     rates of 50 percent to 64 percent that have followed other \n     major disasters over the past decade.\n       Hector V. Barreto, the administrator of the S.B.A., told \n     the House Committee on Small Business on Thursday that the \n     loan approval statistics were a result of what was a very \n     different disaster. But he also agreed to review all loan \n     applications that had been rejected in New York so far, to \n     see if the agency's loan standards, which often rely on cash \n     flow and the value of tangible property, had been applied too \n     rigidly.\n       Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, which inflict \n     property damage mostly on homes and homeowners, the World \n     Trade Center attack did most of its property damage in a \n     small area around ground zero. Most of the loans requested \n     and made have been for economic injury to businesses in a far \n     wider geographic area, stretching over several counties near \n     New York City.\n       Economic disaster loans to businesses account for three-\n     quarters of the disaster loans approved so far, compared with \n     20 percent after events like the flooding of the Red River of \n     the North, in North Dakota in 1997, and Tropical Storm \n     Allison in Texas and Louisiana earlier this year. Economic \n     injury loans require more documentation of losses and of a \n     borrower's ability to repay them than property damage loans \n     do.\n       A bill that would ease eligibility rules for disaster loans \n     as well as create a grant program to go with the loan program \n     was recently sent to the full House of Representatives by the \n     House Committee on Small Business.\n       Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, whose district includes \n     parts of Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens and who is the \n     ranking Democrat on that committee, said the current loan \n     program needed to be revised as the bill would require \n     because the existing loan program ``is not suitable for the \n     new reality of this disaster.''\n       Some businesses that have been turned down for loans say \n     they cannot fathom whom the loan program is supposed to help, \n     if not them. Carla Behrle, who designs, manufactures and \n     sells custom-made leather clothing from a shop on Franklin \n     Street in TriBeCa, said she was told by S.B.A. officials \n     that her application would be rejected because her \n     business did not have enough cash flow to make the loan \n     payments of $143 a month.\n       ``Some people spend more than that on cigarettes,'' said \n     Ms. Behrle (pronounced BURR-lee), who does not smoke. She \n     said the agency did not seem to take into account her plans \n     for the money, which included relocating her business, which \n     had revenues of about $125,000 last year, and shifting her \n     focus to wholesale sales, eliminating her retail store.\n       ``I spent hours and hours filling out all this paperwork,'' \n     she said. ``If I had known what I know now, I would have put \n     my energies elsewhere.''\n       Other entrepreneurs complain that the city and state \n     efforts to restore the economy are tailored to the needs of \n     large corporations rather than to small businesses. They note \n     that when Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani \n     appointed members of the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment \n     Corporation last month, corporate and political interests \n     were well represented, but no representatives of small \n     business from downtown Manhattan were included.\n       Asked what he would say to people who operate small \n     downtown businesses that are ailing, John C. Whitehead, the \n     newly appointed chairman of the group, said: ``I don't know \n     what we say to them, but we want to keep them and we don't \n     want them to be discouraged. I think there is assistance \n     available for them.''\n       Carl Weisbrod, president of the Downtown Alliance, which \n     represents businesses in the financial district and around \n     the trade center site, said the redevelopment agency's \n     ``primary mission is going to be repairing the \n     infrastructure'' and creating a physical environment that \n     will draw customers back to small businesses downtown.\n       Whether small businesses downtown can wait for those \n     improvements, which could easily take years, is uncertain. On \n     West Eighth Street, merchants up and down the block who are \n     not covering their expenses say their landlords have so far \n     refused to give them a break on their rents.\n       At Mofa Shoes, Moses, the manager, who would not give his \n     last name, spoke woefully of the outlook. ``This used to be \n     the shoe capital of the world,'' he said. ``We'd get \n     customers who came to Eighth Street from Italy, Brazil, \n     Spain. Now, well, you see. The street is empty.''\n\n\n[[Page S12823]]\n\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I heard the Senator from Arizona. I \nrespect what he said in trying to characterize some discussions as \nnegotiations. But I have been here for 18 years. Senator Bond has been \nhere I think just about as long. He is the ranking member. He and I \nhave worked together when he has been chairman and I, ranking member, \nand vice versa. The Small Business Committee is probably the least \npartisan committee of the Senate. We don't do anything if it isn't \nbroadly by consensus. Eighteen members of our committee are cosponsors \nof this legislation. Sixty-two Senators are cosponsors of this effort \nto bring emergency assistance to small businesses of this country. We \nhave now been waiting for 2 months while this bill has been held up by \nthe great process of rolling holds and rolling theories of objection.\n  While the Senator from Arizona politely characterizes it as a \nnegotiation, there is nothing to negotiate based on what we have been \noffered. It is a basic gutting of the entire approach that is supposed \nto be in the form of a compromise. We are not to going to do that with \n62 cosponsors of a piece of legislation that provides emergency \nassistance to businesses that need it.\n  Let me quote briefly from yesterday's New York Times. It said the \nfollowing:\n\n       While it was expected that small businesses near the site \n     of the World Trade Center would suffer from the terrorist \n     attack on Sept. 11, which displaced 100,000 potential \n     customers from office buildings in the area and thousands \n     more from their homes, wider economic damage from the attack \n     is still rippling outward from ground zero. . . . Some \n     economic forecasters say they believe a wave of business \n     failures in New York and elsewhere could come soon after the \n     first of the year, as retailers and other entrepreneurs \n     succumb to the continuing lack of new business in what is \n     traditionally their busiest season. . . . while numerous \n     grant and loan programs have sprung up to help small \n     businesses recover from the disaster, business owners have \n     complained, in a growing chorus, that the grants are too \n     small to stem their losses and that loan agencies are not \n     approving loans. Since the disaster, the United States Small \n     Business Administration has approved only about one in three \n     applications for disaster loans . . . [an] approval rate well \n     below the rates . . . [of] other major disasters over the \n     past decade.\n       Carla Behrle, who designs, manufactures and sells custom-\n     made leather clothing from a shop on Franklin Street in \n     TriBeCa, said she was told by SBA officials that her \n     application would be rejected because her business did not \n     have enough cash flow to make the loan payments of $143 a \n     month. ``Some people spend more than that on cigarettes,'' \n     said Ms. Behrle, who does not smoke. She said the agency did \n     not seem to take into account her plans for the money, which \n     included relocating her business, which had revenues of about \n     $125,000 last year, and shifting her focus to wholesale \n     sales, eliminating her retail store. ``I spent hours and \n     hours filling out all this paperwork,'' she said. ``If I had \n     known what I know now, I would have put my energies \n     elsewhere.''\n\n  Clearly, the administration's approach is not working.\n  We have seen documented over the past months by a number of different \narticles from the Bureau of National Affairs and the Washington Post \nthat this bill is being held up by the administration and by two \ncolleagues in the Senate who are suggesting there are a series of \ndifferent reasons for doing so. The last time there was an objection, \nSenator Kyl said he would return to the floor and explain why later. He \nnever returned, and he didn't explain why. But we have had a different \nset of explanations in the course of our conversations.\n  I have heard people say it is not that they really have an objection \nto the bill but they are acting as an agent, holding it so it can be \nreviewed, that they don't really have a hold on the bill but they have \nan objection to the process. Then we heard that it is duplicative of \nthe administration's approach and it helps medium-sized and large \nbusinesses. Then we heard that perhaps the defaults will be too high.\n  My personal favorite excuse for the delay is that some people want to \nremove the hold but they can't get into the quarantined office in order \nto get the necessary paperwork to submit to remove the hold, and so on, \nand so on--anything to try to run out the clock.\n  The clock is running out on a lot of small businesses in the country. \nI believe that every single excuse offered to date for not proceeding \nforward on this bill is subject to an analysis that completely \ndismisses that particular excuse.\n  We need to pass S. 1499, the American Small Business Emergency Relief \nand Recovery Act of 2001. I emphasize that the key word is \n``emergency.'' Small businesses need help now. They have needed it \nsince the terrorist attacks three months ago.\n  However, as documented in several articles over the past months, from \nthe Bureau of National Affairs to the Washington Post, the \nAdministration and two of our colleagues in the Senate do not see the \nproblems of small business as urgent. They have played games with the \nlivelihoods of small business owners and their employees by putting \n``holds'' on S. 1499 and therefore blocking passage of legislation to \nhelp small businesses.\n\n  On November 27, I moved to bring S. 1499 up for a vote. Senator Kyl \nobjected and said that he would explain why later. He never returned to \nthe floor. I hope that he will do so today.\n  Addressing the concerns of those opposed to this bill as reported in \nthe press or told to small businesses calling to urge passage of S. \n1499 is a moving target. One day it's too expensive. Next it's that \nthey have no objection to the bill, but they are an ``agent,'' holding \nit so it can be reviewed, or, they don't have a ``hold'' on the bill, \n``they have an objection to the process.'' Next it's duplicative of the \nadministration's approach, and it helps medium-sized and large \nbusinesses. Then it's that defaults will be too high. My personal \nfavorite is that they want to remove the hold but they can't get into \ntheir quarantined office to get the necessary paperwork to submit to \nremove the hold. And so on, and so on, and so on, anything to run out \nthe clock.\n  Let me explain why these objections are not well-founded:\n  No. 1, Senator Kyl and the administration contend that this bill \ncosts too much. Senator Kyl was quoted as saying in the Congressional \nQuarterly on November 28: ``We have a debt situation in this country \nright now. This bill is a big deal. It costs too much.'' Let me just \nstate the obvious--small business is not what caused our debt \nsituation. Even leveraging money to provide loans and venture capital \nand counseling through the SBA is not what caused our debt situation. \nIn fact, the SBA suffered disproportionately in budget reduction for \nFY2002 compared to other Departments. The President's fiscal year 2002 \nbudget cut funding for the SBA anywhere from 26 to 40 percent depending \non how you look at it.\n  Why the big difference? It is a 40-percent cut if you count the \nPresident's request to move the SBA disaster loan program out of SBA, \nSLASH the disaster loan part of the budget from $826 million to $300 \nmillion, and RAISE the interest rates on disaster victims. That's \nright, if the Bush administration's fiscal year 2002 budget had been \nimplemented, the very program that Senator Kyl and the administration \nare claiming is the answer to the problems of small businesses, would \nnow be underfunded, and would be charging small business disaster \nvictims 5.4 percent versus the current 4 percent. Luckily, Senator Bond \nand I were successful earlier this year in passing a budget amendment \nto restore that funding.\n  Let me go back to the comment, ``This bill costs too much.'' This \nbill costs too much compared to what? Compared to the $15 billion that \nwill be given to the airline industry? Compared to the estimated $4.75 \nbillion that Senator Kyl's S. 1500 would provide in tax credits for \nairplane tickets? Compared to the administration's approach of \nessentially declaring the entire Nation a disaster area and providing \ndisaster loans nationwide?\n  The Congressional Budget Office has informally scored S. 1499 as \ncosting $860 million. Compared to the Kerry-Bond approach, Senator \nKyl's bill costs 5.5 times more. Compared to the Kerry-Bond approach, \nthe administration's approach through disaster loans costs almost 5 \ntimes more--4.67 times, to be exact.\n  The administration's approach through economic injury disaster loans \nhas a subsidy rate--that's the net cost to the taxpayer of running the \nprogram--of anywhere from 14 percent to 17 percent, depending on whose \nestimate you use. The Kerry-Bond approach, which provides the majority \nof assistance through the 7(a) loans, has a\n\n[[Page S12824]]\n\nsubsidy rate of 3 percent. The Kerry-Bond approach is more cost-\neffective.\n  In practical terms, if we fully funded this bill, for $860 million we \ncould leverage more than $25 billion in loans and venture capital to \nfill the market's gap in lending. To provide an equal amount of access \nto capital through the disaster loan program would cost taxpayers about \n$3.5 billion. These charts illustrate on a State-by-State basis how \nmany small business will be helped by S. 1499 through 7(a) and 504 \nloans, and how much capital will become available in each state. For \nexample, under this bill, more than 1,700 small business in Arizona \ncould get loans to help recover from the terrorist attacks and the \nworsening economy. Under the administration's approach, only one small \nbusiness has been helped in Arizona since September 11.\n  No. 2, Senator Kyl contends this bill hasn't had sufficient review. \nAccording to the Washington Post, Senator Kyl says ``it is not a hold, \nbut part of his role as chairman of the GOP steering committee to \nreview bills that are being hustled through at the end of the session \nto make sure they have been properly `vetted.' `I'm just an agent,' '' \nKyl said.\n\n  Let me set the record straight on the process. This bill hasn't been \n``hustled through.'' It was drafted with the input of small business \norganizations, trade associations and SBA's lending and counseling \npartners through more than 30 meetings and conference calls--conference \ncalls because we couldn't ask folks to fly in the immediate weeks after \nthe attacks. It is cosponsored by 18 of the Small Business Committee's \nmembers. And overall 62 Senators, including 20 Republicans, have joined \nme in cosponsoring S. 1499.\n  On October 15, S. 1499 was cleared by both cloakrooms. It would have \npassed by unanimous consent that night if OMB hadn't called at the last \nminute and asked the GOP leadership to put a hold on the bill so that \nSBA could introduce its own solution the next day. On October 16, the \ncommittee sat down with staff from the SBA and incorporated changes to \nS. 1499 to address their concerns. Nevertheless, when the GOP \nleadership lifted its hold, Senator Kyl put a hold on the bill for the \nRepublican Steering Committee. They have now held this emergency \nlegislation for almost 2 months.\n  On the House side, the Committee on Small Business passed the \ncompanion to S. 1499 by unanimous consent. There's nothing hustled \nabout this bill. It was moved quickly because it is emergency \nlegislation. It is a good bill because it can do a lot of good for a \nlot of people. It is being held because of shameful politics. If \nSenator Kyl and other members of the Republican Steering Committee want \nto vote against the bill, then we should give them the opportunity. I \nsay let's bring this bill up for a vote. Small businesses have a right \nto know exactly who is working against them and who is working for \nthem. And the Republican Steering Committee should know that blocking \nthis emergency small business bill because of politics, or because they \noppose the process, doesn't hurt me or Senator Bond, it doesn't hurt \nour Committee or the Democrats; it hurts small businesses and puts in \njeopardy the jobs of thousands of Americans.\n  Has anyone looked at the unemployment rates? Over the past 2 months, \nthe nation has lost 799,000 jobs. According to an article in the \nChristian Science Monitor yesterday, Monday, December 10, the jobless \nrate is now at 5.7 percent and economists expect it to peak out next \nyear at between 6.5 and 7 percent.\n  No matter how many tax credits we provide, if people don't think they \nwill have a paycheck and are pessimistic about job prospects, they're \nnot going to spend. The Consumer Confidence Index has declined for 4 \nstraight months. According to Lynn Franco, director of the Conference \nBoard's Consumer Research Center: ``Widespread layoffs and rising \nunemployment do not signal a rebound in confidence anytime soon. With \nthe holiday season quickly approaching, there is little positive \nstimuli on the horizon.''\n  No. 3, Senator Kyl contends the defaults will be too high. If that \nwere true, it would be reflected in the Congressional Budget Office's \ncost assessment of this bill. Subsidy rates for guarantee loan programs \nfactor in not only fee income derived from the borrowers and lenders, \nbut also the estimated defaults and recoveries. As I said earlier, the \nmajority of loans to be made through this bill will be made through the \nSBA's 7(a) program. The subsidy rate for this program with incentives \nis estimated by CBO to be 3 percent. So, for every $100 loaned, it will \ncost $3. That does not indicate excessive default rates. And according \nto the administrator of SBA, the program is performing so well that in \nthe President's fiscal year 2003 budget, OMB will reduce the subsidy \nrate for 7(a) loans by 50 percent.\n  No. 4, Senator Kyl contends this bill is duplicative. It is not \nduplicative. The administration did adopt and implement a couple of \nprovisions of the Kerry-Bond bill by expanding access to economic \ninjury disaster loans through regulations. However, their approach is \nnot comprehensive enough to help the range of small businesses with \nvarying degrees of problems. As reported in the New York Times on \nOctober 31, ``more than half of the small businesses in New York City \nthat have applied for Federal disaster loans since the World Trade \nCenter attack have had their applications rejected, resulting in one of \nthe lowest loan-approval rates in recent years among communities that \nhave had to grapple with large-scale disasters.''\n  While I am glad that the administration finally acted to help small \nbusinesses, their approach is not getting at the problem. Their \napproach doesn't defer payments or allow refinancing. Ours does. The \nadministration didn't meet with small business groups when shaping \ntheir approach. We did. The administration didn't sit down with \nSenators Schumer and Clinton and ask how they could be of particular \nhelp to those businesses in ground zero. We did. Consequently, these \nare reasons why small business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce are pushing for passage of the Kerry-Bond bill.\n  Let me give you insight into the damage suffered by just one group of \naffected small businesses: the chauffeured ground transportation \nindustry. That industry used to employ about a 160,000 people. Since \nSeptember 11, they have laid off approximately 80,000--half the jobs. \nAgain, that's just one of many industries in trouble. If Senator Kyl's \noffice, the members of the Republican Steering Committee and the \nadministration listened to or read the letters from the United \nMotorcoach Association or the National Limousine Association, they \nwould know that they need working capital to keep their businesses \nalive until they can restructure or until more normal business \nconditions return. And to have sufficient working capital, the ones in \nthe New York and New Jersey that make their bread and butter from \nbusiness from JFK Airport, La Guardia Airport, and Newark Airport need \ndeferments. And they need to be able to refinance their debt. They \naren't asking for hand-outs. They are asking for loans that they will \npay back. The SBA is supposed to help small businesses. The \nadministration's approach isn't working, so it is our responsibility to \ntailor SBA's programs so that together they can effectively address the \nneeds of small businesses.\n  Let me read this quote from an article in the Wall Street Journal \npublished on Tuesday, November 6, 2001. They are the words of Mr. John \nRutledge, chairman of Rutledge Capital in New Canaan, CT, and a former \neconomic advisor to the Reagan administration:\n\n       Interest rate reductions alone are not enough to jump-start \n     this economy. We need to make sure cheaper credit reaches the \n     companies that need it . . . The Fed is cutting interest \n     rates--but the money isn't reaching capital-starved small \n     businesses because Treasury regulators are cracking down on \n     bank loans. Credit rationing, not interest rates, is the real \n     problem with the economy. . . . This problem didn't start on \n     September 11. For more than a year U.S. banks have been \n     closed for business lending. Unless the current Bush \n     administration takes steps to restore bank lending to small \n     businesses and heal the asset markets now, the economy will \n     stay weak.\n\n  No. 5, Senator Kyl contends this bill helps medium-sized and large \nbusinesses. This bill does not help medium-sized and large businesses. \nFor 1 year only, S. 1499 allows businesses for certain industries in \nlimited areas--the areas hardest hit--New York, Virginia and the \ncontiguous areas designated as\n\n[[Page S12825]]\n\ndisasters--to be considered small for purposes of accessing disaster \nloan assistance. In addition, like the administration's own legislative \nrequest in the DoD appropriations bill now pending in conference, S. \n1499 gives discretion to the Administrator to raise any size standards \nnot named in this bill to respond to the higher costs in New York City. \nThese businesses are included in those eligible for assistance in order \nto compensate for the unique magnitude of their damage and the \nexpensive markets they are in. The ones named in this bill were created \nin cooperation with the New York City Economic Development Corporation \nthrough the offices of Senators Schumer and Clinton. For example, S. \n1499 raises the size standards for restaurants from $5 million to $8 \nmillion. Annual revenues of $5 million for a restaurant in States like \nArizona or Massachusetts or Florida might seem like a medium-sized or \nlarge business, but according to Mayor Giuliani's staff, it could be \nmerely a fancy coffee shop in Manhattan. In order to really help small \nbusinesses in New York City, the city recommended raising the size \nstandard to $8 million. These are loans, not grants, and it makes sense \nto take advice from those experts who know the markets of their small \nbusinesses.\n  Travel agencies have been hard hit in all of our States. Raising the \nsize standard from $1 million to $2 million is not excessive. In fact, \nthe travel agents want to know why we can help the airlines but not \nthem.\n  Size standards need to keep pace with inflation. The current \nstandards are inadequate under normal market conditions, much less a \ndisaster of this gravity and so unique in nature.\n  No. 6, the administration contends that the Kerry-Bond approach \ndisplaces the private sector. Weighing in on this bill for the first \ntime in writing almost 2 months after S. 1499 was introduced, here's \nwhat the Administrator said to me in a letter dated November 30: ``SBA \nis also concerned with Section 5 and Section 6 of S. 1499. . . . \n[because it] could make government guaranteed small business loans more \nattractive than conventional loans, potentially displacing private \nsector options.''\n  I think the administration has our proposals confused. It is the \nKerry-Bond approach that uses 5,000 plus private-sector lenders who are \nexperienced at making SBA loans to help deliver this assistance to \nsmall businesses. It is the administration's approach that makes loans \ndirectly from the SBA, which cuts out the private sector.\n  This bill does not cost too much. This bill is not duplicative of \nwhat the administration has already put into place. This bill does not \nencourage defaults. This bill does not help big businesses. This bill \ndoes not cut out the private sector. This bill has not been rushed \nthrough the Senate. On the contrary, this emergency legislation has \nbeen blocked from being considered for 2 months.\n  I want to emphasize that this obstruction should not be blamed on all \nRepublicans. My colleague Senator Bond has worked in earnest to pass \nthis bill, and the bill has 20 Republican cosponsors. I greatly \nappreciate their cooperation, and I know small businesses, their \nemployees and the groups that represent small business appreciate their \nsupport. If they really want to prove their support, before we adjourn \nfor the holiday, they will vote in favor of invoking cloture, and they \nwill vote in favor of the bill when it comes up for a final vote.\n  It ought to be the subject of a debate in the Senate. We ought to \nhave a vote. Let the Senate do its work. We could dispense with this \nbill in 3, 4 hours or less. If someone wants to bring an amendment, let \nthem bring an amendment. We have an opportunity to be able to do that.\n  The Senator from Arizona was quoted in the Congressional Quarterly on \nNovember 28 saying:\n\n       We have a debt situation in the country right now. This \n     bill is a big deal. It costs too much.\n\n  Let me state the obvious. Small business is not what caused the debt \nin this country. Even leveraging money to provide loans and venture \ncapital and counseling through the SBA is not what caused our debt \nsituation. In fact, the SBA suffered disproportionately in budget \nreductions for fiscal year 2002 compared to other departments. The \nPresident's budget cut the funding for SBA anywhere from 26 to 40 \npercent, depending on how you make the analysis.\n  Senator Bond and I came in with an amendment. I am pleased to say we \nwere able to try to prevent that cut. But let me go back to the comment \nof the Senator from Arizona that it costs too much.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I ask the Senator from Massachusetts a question; will \nhe yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. KYL. Since the Senator has invoked my name on several occasions \nand not made it clear when he was connecting various criticisms to my \nname, I would like the opportunity to respond. The problem is, as the \nSenator knows, we have a 10:30 briefing on a very important subject. I \nwould like the opportunity prior to that time to be able to respond to \nthe comments. Could the Senator advise if he thinks that might be \npossible before 10:30?\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I want my colleagues to take part in \nthis.\n  My colleague introduced a bill himself that provides tax credits for \nairplane tickets that costs five times this bill; $4.75 billion the \nSenator's bill costs. What are we talking about when we talk about \n``costs too much?'' Let me ask the Senator from Arizona, could we bring \nthis bill to the floor of the Senate within the next couple of days? I \nwill curtail my comments, if we could get an agreement to bring this \nbill to the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts \nthat he knows very well the administration has significant objections \nto the bill as written, that the President announced almost immediately \nafter September 11 emergency programs for small business loans, that \nthe White House believes that is sufficient under the circumstances \ntoday, and that the bill is too expensive for the needs of the people \nabout whom the Senator has talked.\n  Therefore, until there is more willingness than the Senator has \nexpressed--and the Senator has made it clear there is no willingness to \ncompromise--then the answer to the question is no.\n  I would also be pleased to talk about the other subject, the travel \nand tourism tax credit, as part of the stimulus package, if the Senator \nwished to further yield on that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to the Senator from Arizona, all of the \nanalysts, all of the small business entities, the Chamber of Commerce \nof the United States and others, do not find what the administration is \ndoing adequate. And the President did not, as you say, announce almost \nimmediately after September 11 emergency programs for small business \nloans. The administration waited more than 1 month to act, and they did \nso after OMB put a hold on S. 1499. The consensus of the community is \nthat the administration's response is simply not adequate.\n\n  They didn't sit down and talk with the same groups we did in putting \nthis bill together. They didn't reach out to the Senators from New York \nto find out what the needs of the city were in doing this the way we \ndid. We have done that, and we have even incorporated provisions into \nthe bill to address concerns by the administration. The Senate deserves \nto have an appropriate debate notwithstanding. There are plenty of \nthings we debate on that the President does not agree with, the White \nHouse does not agree with.\n  I ask my colleague from Missouri whether or not in his judgment he \nthinks what the administration is doing is adequate. Without losing my \nright to the floor, I ask him if he might respond to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I concur wholeheartedly with my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts. The needs of small business are great. Not only the \nsmall businesses directly impacted in New York and in Virginia by the \ntragic terrorist actions, but many other small businesses throughout \nthis country are suffering. I think every Member of this body can tell \nyou about general aviation companies in their States who\n\n[[Page S12826]]\n\nwere shut down, put out of business for up to a month, some even longer \nbecause of the FAA restrictions. The bill we have sponsored is very \nmodest, $851 million. We are talking about the need.\n  We just passed $40 billion in relief. We passed another $20 billion \non Friday night, an allocation of $20 billion for antiterrorism. We are \ntalking about a stimulus that could be anywhere from $40 to $80 \nbillion.\n  The beauty of 1499 is that it only spends money if the small \nbusinesses that have been crippled as a result of this terrorist action \nwill borrow the money and put it to work hiring people, buying goods, \ngetting the economy moving again. It is absolutely critical. I ask my \ncolleagues to let us debate the bill. Let us bring out the problems on \nthe floor.\n  If the administration were ultimately to decide we have not made the \ncase, then they still have the right to veto it. We cannot get into the \ndetails of this legislation. My last count was we had 64 Members--at \nleast we have over 60 Members supporting the bill. It is something we \nneed to do this month because small businesses may be out of business, \nif they are not already, by the time we get back next year. I urge my \ncolleagues to let us debate the bill.\n  I also join with my colleague from Arizona in saying that it is \nabsolutely unconscionable that we not act on the nomination of Eugene \nScalia, ultimately qualified to be the lawyer for the Secretary of \nLabor. If people have objections to him, let them bring them to the \nfloor. I don't think they will withstand the scrutiny of the light of \nday. We have just a few days remaining. It is very important that we \nact on the Secretary of Labor nomination, the lawyer the President \nselected, who is adequately qualified and deeply committed to this \ncause.\n  It is absolutely essential that we act now to provide small business \nthe stimulus it needs by making it easier to get over the hurdles that \nhave been caused by the terrorist acts of September 11 to borrow money \nto get back in business to expand their business. I hope we can vote on \nboth of these measures.\n\n  I strongly support my colleague from Massachusetts on the need to \nmove to 1499 and my colleague from Arizona on the need to move to the \nappointment of Eugene Scalia. I hope we can get on with both of them.\n  Mr. KERRY. I say to my colleague from Arizona, the administration's \napproach proceeds through the economic injury disaster loans. It has a \nsubsidy rate--That is a net cost to the taxpayer of running the \nprogram--of anywhere from 14 to 17 percent, depending on whose estimate \nyou use. The base is 14 percent.\n  The Kerry-Bond approach, which provides the majority of assistance \nthrough the 7(a) program loans, has a subsidy rate of 3 percent. So the \nadministration's approach is a 14- to 17-percent cost to the taxpayer. \nOur approach is 3 percent to the taxpayer.\n  In practical terms, if you fully funded this bill, you could leverage \nmore than $25 billion in loans and in venture capital to address the \nmarket gap in lending.\n  Let me say to the Senator from Arizona, under our bill, Arizona could \nmake 1,700 small business loans right now. Under the administration's \nprogram, only one business in Arizona has had any help since September \n11. That is the difference between the bills. The cost to the taxpayer \nis less and the coverage is greater. And the leverage is higher. It is \na more effective and cost-effective piece of legislation.\n  While I am glad the administration finally acted on this program, \ntheir approach does not allow refinancing. The administration approach \ndoes not allow deferral of payments. I remember in 1991, when we had \nthe RTC and the savings bank problem, we had a lot of programs that \nwere falling.\n  I am sorry to see the Senator leave. I would love to see if we could \nget agreement to proceed forward.\n  Well, Madam President, I hope the record is clear that small \nbusinesses in this country could be significantly helped if we were to \nproceed forward with this legislation. We now understand that the \nadministration and some in the Republican caucus--I regret to say it--\nare unwilling to proceed forward to help small businesses with a \nprogram that would be more effective than what is happening now.\n  Let me give an insight into some of the damage suffered. You can look \nat the ground transportation industry, at travel, and at others, all of \nwhich have viable industries, but they need help to be able to tide \nthem over in order to proceed forward. It seems to me that providing \nthem with working capital is an essential ingredient.\n  Let me quote from the Wall Street Journal of November 6. These are \nthe words of John Rutledge, chairman of Rutledge Capital in New Canaan, \nCT, and a former economic adviser to President Reagan:\n\n       Interest rate reductions alone are not enough to jump-start \n     this economy. We need to make sure that cheaper credit \n     reaches the companies that need it. . . . The Fed is cutting \n     interest rates--but the money isn't reaching capital-starved \n     small businesses because Treasury regulators are cracking \n     down on bank loans. Credit rationing, not interest rates, is \n     the real problem with the economy. . . .\n\n  That is exactly the same problem we faced in 1989, 1990, and 1991 \nwhen we had failures in the savings and loan and the banking industry, \nand we had an entity called Recall Management come in to try to process \nsome of the small loan portfolios. What happened is a whole lot of \nviable businesses got lumped into the bad loans so that the viable \nbusinesses were, in effect, put into a category where they could not \nget the credit they needed simply to tide them over. We lost thousands \nof jobs. Viable business was liquidated because of bad judgment. That \nis precisely the situation in which we are now putting people. People \nwho have a viable business, who simply need to ride out this momentary \ndownturn, which all of us know was exacerbated by the events of \nSeptember 11, need small amounts of working capital in order to be able \nto tide over their workers, to be able to pay the various legal \nobligations they have to stay in business.\n  If you don't want to create a cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy, \nwhere you drag your economy down as a consequence of not helping all of \nthese small businesses to be able to sustain those jobs, this is the \nway to do it. If you provide emergency small business lending in a way \nthat is in keeping with the emergency efforts in the past, the \nstandards of the SBA will still be met. These are not throw-away loans. \nThese are loans that can leverage some $25 billion of economic activity \nin the country. That is why this legislation has 62 cosponsors in the \nSenate.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/11/senate-section/article/S12826-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12826-S12836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      AGRICULTURE, CONSERVATION, AND RURAL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will resume consideration of \nCalendar No. 237, S. 1731, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1731) to strengthen agricultural producers, to \n     enhance resource conservation and rural development, to \n     provide for farm credit, agricultural research, nutrition, \n     and related programs, to ensure consumers abundant food and \n     fiber, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are going to be in a posture very \nquickly where we will be able to start doing things other than just \ntalking about the farm bill. Amendments will be offered and, hopefully, \nwe will complete this most important legislation very quickly.\n  What I wanted to come to the floor today to talk about is what has \nappeared in newspapers all over America today, including a Washington \nPost editorial. Syndicated columns all over America are running \narticles today talking about something going on in Washington that is \nsimply invalid. But I think, as far as I am concerned, kind of the \nculmination, or the synthesis of all these articles and columns and \neditorials in America today appeared in the New York Times this \nmorning. That editorial has a headline: ``Tom Daschle Isn't the \nProblem.''\n\n[[Page S12827]]\n\n  I will make no editorial comment about this editorial. I will read \nit:\n\n       The closing days of this year's Congressional session have \n     brought forth a wild Republican campaign to demonize Senator \n     Tom Daschle. It almost seems as if the G.O.P. is holding a \n     contest to see who can most often use the word \n     ``obstructionist'' to describe him. The attacks--including \n     ads in Mr. Daschle's home state of South Dakota featuring \n     side-by-side photographs of him and Saddam Hussein--are a \n     sure sign of the Senate majority leader's effectiveness in \n     blocking President Bush's hard-right agenda. Today Mr. Bush \n     meets with Mr. Daschle at the White House, where they can \n     move beyond vilification to legislation.\n       The word ``obstructionist,'' voiced over the weekend by \n     Vice President Dick Cheney, has an unreal ring. Perhaps Mr. \n     Cheney was in a remote, secure location when, after Sept. 11 \n     and with Mr. Daschle's help, Congress passed a use-of-force \n     resolution, a $40 billion emergency spending bill, an airline \n     bailout, a counterterrorism bill and an airport security \n     bill. The Senate has also passed 13 appropriations bills and \n     its own version of education reform and a patients' bill of \n     rights. The two things that Mr. Cheney cited that the Senate \n     had ``obstructed'' were legislation to drill for energy in \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and a ``stimulus'' bill \n     to give out huge tax breaks to corporations and rich people.\n       Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush have called for bipartisan \n     cooperation in Congress. Yet when asked, the vice president \n     declined to disavow the attack ads running in South Dakota \n     that accused Mr. Daschle of helping the Iraqi dictator by \n     blocking the destruction of the Alaska reserve.\n       The suspicion is growing in some quarters in Washington \n     that Mr. Bush may not really want economic stimulus \n     legislation. How else to explain that the White House is \n     sticking with a bill, passed by the House, that many \n     Republicans say privately they would just as soon abandon? \n     The effect of spending less than $100 billion to jolt a $10 \n     trillion economy is likely to be small, and the unnecessary \n     tax breaks aimed at corporations and the wealthy would make \n     the nation's upcoming deficits even worse. But there are some \n     good ideas in some versions of the stimulus bill that should \n     be passed, irrespective of their large-scale economic impact. \n     These pieces would provide unemployment and health benefits \n     to laid off workers who desperately need help after Sept. 11.\n       If Mr. Bush continues to be inflexible on the economic \n     package, Mr. Daschle should switch tactics and attach the \n     health and jobless benefits to some other bill before \n     Congress adjourns near Christmas. It would be a travesty to \n     ignore the real needs of the most vulnerable Americans at a \n     time like this one. You might even say it was obstructionist.\n\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Indiana.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, I will be happy to yield to the distinguished \nSenator.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the distinguished ranking member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, we would like to set a time for moving to the \nlegislation. The leader, because some items were not ready, asked that \nit be debate only. I will wait until the Republican side checks, but I \nwill propound a unanimous consent request that the debate only stop at \n11 a.m. or 11:15 a.m. I wanted to alert my colleague, and I will check \nwith his side to see if that is OK.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Let me respond to the distinguished leader. That will be \nfine as far as I am concerned. My understanding was we were going to \ncommence the debate after the third rollcall vote. I point out the \ndrafting of a new bill is not completed even as we speak. Legislative \ncounsel is still working on it somewhere.\n  Whenever it does emerge, that is what we ought to do so we can \nfinally offer amendments and get on with it. I am merely going to speak \nto the bill, given the instructions that we were going to have general \ndebate on the agriculture bill until 11. Once the Senator propounds the \nrequest, I certainly will be agreeable.\n  Mr. REID. I will propound that as soon as we check with the \nRepublican Cloakroom.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I want to make general comments about the \nfarm bill. I appreciate the distinguished chairman of our committee, \nSenator Harkin, and others are even at this moment involved in drafting \na new bill. At some point, my understanding is they will come forward \nwith a substitute for the entire bill which is now before us. I am not \nsupercritical of this procedure, although it does raise some questions \non our side. We have not seen the new text and will not see the new \ntext for some time, apparently. It is still in the hands of legislative \ncounsel, I am advised, working its way through.\n  I make this point because this has characterized the procedure, \nunfortunately, in the committee and on the floor. Members may or may \nnot wish to know what is in the farm bill. I think it is important. \nVery clearly, there are many Members who want to debate and pass the \nfarm bill and fairly rapidly. They are joined by those outside this \nChamber.\n  I cite, for example, the December 8, 2001, issue of Congressional \nQuarterly, in which the headline is ``Fear of Budget Constraints and \n2002 Galvanizes Farm Bill Supporters.''\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The specter of a tight Federal budget next year with less \n     money for farm subsidies has agricultural lobbyists and their \n     allies in Congress pushing for final action on a farm bill \n     before lawmakers leave this month.\n       Lobbyists fear that if Congress waits until 2002 when the \n     current authorization bill expires, then the $73.5 billion in \n     new spending for agricultural programs over the next 10 years \n     that was set aside by this year's budget resolution might \n     vanish. ``We have never before had this hammer over our \n     heads, like the loss of this money,'' said Mary Kay Thatcher, \n     lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau Federation. However, \n     with little time left lawmakers say finishing a bill could be \n     difficult.\n\n  Indeed, it could, and the bill is not even available as of this \nmoment. It was announced yesterday with a great deal of certainty that \nafter three rollcall votes this morning, we would be on the farm bill, \nwe would be offering amendments presumably to the text that came out of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee. As of this moment, we are not \noffering amendments because we are awaiting a new bill.\n  While we await the new bill, other things also are occurring outside. \nI note that CBO announced that the Federal deficit for October and \nNovember of this fiscal year, for 2 months--the fiscal year we are now \nin--unfortunately, amounted to $63 billion. That is $28 billion more in \ndeficit than last year. It is the first time the Government has run a \ndeficit this size since 1997, which was the last time the Federal \nGovernment ran a deficit for the entire fiscal year.\n  This simply underlines the fact that CBO is not alone in pointing out \nwe are in a deficit year. We did not expect to be in such a predicament \nat the beginning of the year. Indeed, when the President of the United \nStates gave his State of the Union Address to a joint session of the \nCongress, he talked about $3 trillion of surpluses over a 10-year \nperiod, and the allocation to solve Social Security and Medicare reform \nproblems, and for a very generous education bill that he and many \nMembers of this body were proposing.\n  In fact, CBO earlier in the year prophesied a potential surplus of \nover $300 billion, scaled down to something less than $200 billion by \nsummertime, $50 billion as we proceeded in the post-September 11 \nperiod, and now it is apparent we are headed for a deficit.\n  That does not change the context of this debate one whit. Proponents \nof the bill, fastening on to a budget resolution adopted early this \nyear, said we have pinned down $172 billion over 10 years, $73.5 \nbillion over baseline, over the normal expenditures that have been \noccurring year by year in the agriculture bills. It is there.\n  I and others have pointed out it really is not there. Members may \ndelude themselves that somehow, because this is December 11, we are \nunable to foresee the future and understand that life has changed; that \nwe are in a deficit because of recession, because of war expenditures, \nbecause of all sorts of emergencies that still lie ahead of us as we \ntry to meet these emergencies with our President.\n  Yet even in the face of this, as the Congressional Quarterly article \npoints out, agricultural lobbyists, perhaps aided and abetted by even \nSenators on occasion, believe we need to have the debate and complete \nthe debate to pin this money down, money which, in my judgment, is no \nlonger there. There is an Alice-in-Wonderland quality about the debate.\n\n[[Page S12828]]\n\n  I say simply that at some point, even though $63 billion of deficit \nhas occurred in 2 months, another 2 months will pass and CBO will have \nanother prophecy that will be even more bleak, in my judgment. At that \npoint, however, in the event the Senate has acted, the Senate and House \nhave conferred, and the President has signed a bill, whether we have \nthe money or not, it will add to the deficit. That must be the \ncalculation of those who are looking at this presently.\n  The administration has not really weighed in on the budget side thus \nfar, and proponents of the bill will point that out, that essentially \nthere have been plans offered, that the administration apparently \nsupports, that seem equally as expensive as the chairman's bill.\n  At some point, however, all of us have to make judgments as to what \nis fiscally sound, where priorities ought to lie in this situation. \nEventually, as we get into the bill, I want to ask Senators, as they \nare thinking about their preparation and how they size this up--I \nappreciate that many Senators will approach this bill on principle \nalone. Some would say--not many--some would say very frequently \nagriculture bills are very parochial bills. We each look after our own \nStates, and that is what we ought to do.\n  If this is the case, I think it is important, as Gannett News Service \npointed out in an article by Carl Weiser on December 6, 2001, that \nunder the current legislation--which the new farm bill, of course, \nwould revise--\n\n       Six States--Iowa, Illinois, Texas, Kansas, Nebraska and \n     Minnesota--collected almost half the payments in 1999.\n\n  It was not dissimilar in 2000, for that matter, according to GAO.\n  Farm bills, as they are now written, are subsidies, essentially, for \nthe row crops--corn, wheat, cotton, rice, now with very generous loan \nrates for soybeans--and are concentrated on States that have that type \nof agriculture. By and large, the payments do not become very generous \nfor those who are involved in livestock or in vegetables, in timber, \nand other situations.\n  I point out Senators may want to take a look at their chart which can \nbe found on the Environmental Working Group Web site. For example, the \nState of California, with 74,126 farms, is second only to Missouri and \nIowa on this chart, but in California, only 9 percent of all the 74,000 \nfarm families receive Government subsidies. As a matter of fact, only 7 \npercent of farmers in Massachusetts, 9 percent in Nevada, 7 percent in \nNew Jersey, and in the State of Washington only 20 percent of the \n29,000 farmers in that State receive anything in these programs.\n  For example, if one were to take a look at the State of Iowa, 75 \npercent of farmers receive subsidies; in the State of Kansas, 65 \npercent; in my home State of Indiana, 52 percent. We are sort of fair \nto middling; half of us farmers receive subsidies, the other half do \nnot.\n  As I pointed out earlier in the debate, roughly 40 percent of farmers \nbenefit from these programs, while 60 percent do not. If you happen to \nrepresent a State in which, as in California's case, 91 percent do not \nparticipate, it is hard for me to understand how you would be \nenthusiastic about these formulas because essentially this is an income \ntransfer from some persons in the United States--taxpayers--to a very \nfew taxpayers who are the beneficiaries. In this case it is quite a \nlarge transfer. We are talking about $172 billion over 10 years of \ntime. Not only are most of the payments concentrated, almost half of \nthem in six States, but in those States the concentration is rather \nprofound.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator from Indiana yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I will be happy to yield to the distinguished leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the period \nunder which the farm bill is being considered for debate purposes only \nend at the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the distinguished leader and I appreciate his \ncourtesy in allowing me to complete these remarks.\n  Madam President, I pointed out the concentration of these payments in \nsix States. But within those States, the concentration is fairly \nsubstantial. For instance, in the State of the distinguished leader, 10 \npercent of the farmers who receive payments receive 55 percent of the \nmoney--just 10 percent. In my State of Indiana, the concentration is \neven greater. The top 10 percent receive 62 percent of the money. Not \nonly is there concentration in a few States, but within States that are \nmajor beneficiaries, a concentration exists with a very few farms.\n  This is not the first time that proposition has been brought to the \nattention of the Senate and, indeed, as we began debate in the Senate \nAgriculture Committee this year, the distinguished chairman, Senator \nHarkin, frequently talked about this problem of concentration. In fact, \nit bobbed up in all sorts of ways: Concentration of meat packers, \nconcentration of supermarket chains, concentrations of authority all \nthe way through the food chain, and, of course, very startlingly with \nregard to producers themselves.\n  But as the debate proceeded, somehow or other along the way the whole \nidea of concentration, when it came to payments to a very few farmers \nin a very few States, was lost by the wayside. This is why it came as a \npleasant surprise to me to read an article by Peter Harriman in the \nSioux Falls Argus Leader. This is on December 7:\n\n       U.S. Sens. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., and Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., \n     will introduce a farm bill amendment next week--\n\n  That is the week we are now in--\n\n     that would drop commodity subsidies from a maximum $460,000 \n     per individual per year now to about $275,000.\n       The amendment also would require commodity-\n     payment recipients to be actively involved in farming.\n\n  A quote from Senator Johnson:\n\n       You can't use these corporate entities to expand the amount \n     of benefits you get. . . .\n\n  One of the points that Senator Johnson goes on to make is:\n\n       One of the deficiencies of the Senate farm bill is that it \n     really didn't do much to target payments to typical farmers \n     and ranchers. We thought the Senate bill could be \n     strengthened by better redirection of resources to typical \n     farmers. . . .''\n       Dorgan added, ``It has been increasingly frustrating over \n     the years to see large corporate ag factories get very large \n     checks, and there is not enough money left to provide a \n     decent safety net for family farmers.''\n       Johnson said: ``If people want to farm the whole township \n     they can. There is nothing in this amendment to keep people \n     from farming.\n       But we are not asking taxpayers to subsidize a small \n     handful of operations that are getting over $500,000.''\n\n  I look forward to that amendment and the debate on that because it \ncertainly has occupied a lot of time already of many of us in the \ncommittee who felt that, in fact, these payments really required some \nscrutiny. I ask some consideration in due course, Madam President, when \nI offer an amendment to the commodity title which, in fact, does \nprovide a very substantial limit. My legislation provides 6 percent of \nthe total farm bill, so it is not discriminatory but equal in all \nStates--equal, really, to all types of farming. But it does finally \nlimit these payments to $40,000. That seems to me to offer equity to \nevery farmer in every State, every county, every crop. And it meets the \nneeds of those who truly are small and struggling and have a very \ndifficult time, given the concentration in agriculture that has been \npointed out by so many.\n  So we will have an opportunity in due course to think through \nconcentration and limitations and equity, a chance to move this from \nhalf of the money going to six States to an even distribution wherever \nthere is farming of any sort in every State.\n  Madam President, I ask active consideration of Senators as they take \na look at their own States, at their own farmers, at what farming \noccurs in their States, to support that general proposition as opposed \nto the one that lies before us in the bill that came out of the \nAgriculture Committee which, in fairness, essentially bumps along with \nthe same type of distribution system that we have had for many years \nand which I and others have criticized in the course of this debate.\n  Finally, let me point out that we still have the problem of money. I \nbelieve at least we have a problem of money. Others on the Senate floor \nmay disagree and may believe that we already are running into Federal \ndeficits that are fairly large and that these\n\n[[Page S12829]]\n\npayments to farmers are merely part of that proposition.\n  Some suggested yesterday that maybe even a stimulus package of sorts \nfor rural America would stimulate the situation. If that is the \nproposition, it is very difficult to make it, given the figures I have \njust recited; namely, that all of the stimulus or half of it would be \nnarrowed to six States. Even within those States, well over half of 10 \npercent of farmers is a relatively few thousand people. That is not \nvery much of a general stimulus. In fact, it is a very pointed and very \nfocused situation.\n  I can well understand why those who are beneficiaries of the past \nbill, or of the bill that Senator Harkin has introduced, would be \nobsessed that we are taking a look either at the fact that we have a \nFederal deficit or that these are rather concentrated payments. There \nhas been a general myth that has surrounded farm bills--that they are \nmeant to save every family farmer; that somehow they make a difference \nin the lives of every family farmer.\n  I am here to tell you that, in fact, each bill and the bill that \nSenator Harkin has proposed even concentrates this further with higher \nsubsidies, higher target prices, and higher loans. The money goes to \nthose who are the most efficient. One can ask: What is wrong with that? \nThe most efficient are not always the largest but frequently they are \nbecause of the scale of size and unit costs involved. And the ability \nto produce, quite apart from the market, has led to their \nconcentration. And it has continued each year. It will march ahead now. \nThat is why I will oppose the bill that lies before us. We need to \namend it constructively so that, in fact, we can proceed to good \nagricultural legislation.\n  I thank the Chair for this opportunity. I thank the distinguished \nmajority leader for allowing me to complete my remarks under the \nunanimous consent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Indiana for the manner in which he has made his points this \nmorning. While we may have some disagreement, I do not know of a \nSenator who has greater respect and whose views are more widely \nappreciated than the Senator from Indiana. I appreciate the opportunity \nto hear many of his comments this morning.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Iowa, I \nhave an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for Mr. \n     Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 2471.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nsubmitted and Proposed.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use some leader time to make \ncomments as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Economic Stimulus\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the Chamber for a few \nminutes to call to the attention of my colleagues an article that \nappeared in the Wall Street Journal this morning. The article is \nheadlined ``House GOP Ponders Scale-Backed Version Of Stimulus \nPackage.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       House GOP Ponders Scaled-Back Version of Stimulus Package\n\n                          (By Shailagh Murray)\n\n       Washington.--House GOP leaders may take a new, scaled-back \n     economic stimulus package to the House floor if talks fail to \n     produce a House-Senate compromise.\n       Republican leaders said they would offer the bill as a \n     last-ditch effort to revive the stimulus package, which is on \n     life support due to protracted partisan squabbling. Officials \n     hope to act on the matter before Congress adjourns for the \n     holidays.\n       House Majority Leader Richard Armey (R., Texas), one of two \n     GOP House leaders appointed to negotiate a final package, \n     said the version would include many of the most politically \n     popular provisions on the table, some scaled back from levels \n     that have been unacceptable to Senate Democrats. They include \n     a depreciation bonus for new capital investments; higher \n     expensing limits for small businesses; an extension of the \n     net operating loss carry-back period to five years, from two; \n     accelerated reductions in individual income-tax rates; $300 \n     rebate checks for low-income workers; and extensions of tax \n     breaks due to expire Dec. 31.\n       The package also would feature at least $20 billion to \n     extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks and to help jobless \n     workers buy health coverage. House Ways and Means Chairman \n     Bill Thomas (R., Calif.) offered the beefed-up benefits \n     package last week in an effort to win Democratic votes on \n     trade negotiating authority.\n       Mr. Armey said he would like to include corporate \n     alternative-minimum tax repeal and capital-gains tax \n     reductions, but acknowledged it could be an uphill battle \n     because of strong Democratic resistance.\n       The move would allow House Republicans to say that they \n     made a good-faith effort to produce a stimulus package, \n     should the talks fail. It also is intended back Democratic \n     Senate leaders into a political corner, by forcing the \n     stimulus bill's final fate into the hands of Senate Majority \n     Leader Tom Daschle.\n       ``If Daschle wants to stop this process, he needs to \n     reconcile that with the American people,'' Mr. Armey said. \n     Mr. Daschle has countered that he is eager to complete the \n     stimulus bill negotiations, especially to deliver the worker \n     benefits.\n       Stimulus-bill talks broke down during the weekend, when \n     Democrats and Republicans accused each other of walking out \n     on negotiations scheduled for Friday and Saturday. Mr. Armey \n     said he hoped talks would begin again today, although no \n     formal meetings were scheduled as of Monday evening. But Mr. \n     Armey said House leaders, including Speaker Dennis Hastert, \n     were ``exploring other options'' in the event that stalemate \n     can't be broken. Senate Republicans say they also are seeking \n     alternative ways of getting the stimulus package on track.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the article provides new information \nabout the current views of at least House leadership regarding the \nstimulus package that I find to be very encouraging. I will not read \nall of the article, but I will simply cite one paragraph. It says:\n\n       House Majority Leader Richard Armey (R., Texas), one of two \n     GOP House leaders appointed to negotiate a final package, \n     said the version would include many of the most politically \n     popular provisions on the table, some scaled back from levels \n     that have been unacceptable to Senate Democrats. They include \n     a depreciation bonus for new capital investments; higher \n     expensing limits for small businesses; and extension of the \n     net operating loss carry-back period to five years, from two; \n     accelerated reductions in individual income-tax rates; $300 \n     rebate checks for low-income workers; and extensions of tax \n     breaks due to expire Dec. 31.\n       The package also would feature at least $20 billion to \n     extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks and to help jobless \n     workers buy health coverage.\n\n  My response to this article is two words: I accept. I accept.\n  I think this would go a long way in dealing with many of the concerns \nthat Senate Democrats have expressed--concerns we have now had for some \ntime.\n  There is one major caveat. The only major change we would have to \nhave is that we would trade the accelerated rate cut proposal currently \nlisted as part of the Republican package for the Domenici payroll tax \nholiday. In other words, we would propose a Republican tax proposal--\none that is cosponsored by a lot of our Democratic colleagues--we would \nsubstitute the Republican payroll tax holiday for the rate cut \nacceleration, and, by and large, you have all the components of a deal. \nWe don't need to go into more rooms in the back of the Capitol. We \ndon't have to negotiate with a great deal of give and take here and \nprocedural concerns about how we are going to address these issues. \nThat would be it.\n  Let us take what the Republicans have said as their new proposal and \nlet us substitute a Republican payroll tax holiday proposal for the \nrate cut acceleration, and you have a deal.\n  We want to clarify what it is we are talking about with regard to the \nunemployment compensation and health benefits. I think it is very \nimportant that the worker assistance package include extended \nunemployment benefits for all workers, especially the part-time workers \nand recent hires who would have to be part of the unemployment \ncompensation package, a tax credit for employers and insurers to cover \n75 percent of COBRA health care\n\n[[Page S12830]]\n\ncosts for laid off workers, an option for States to extend Medicaid \ncoverage for those ineligible for COBRA, and a bipartisan National \nGovernors Association proposal for State fiscal relief.\n  I assume when we talk about health care, that would be part of the \nhealth care proposal we would have on the table. The tax rebates that \nare listed would certainly be a part of it, tax incentives for business \nto create and invest in new jobs; we are willing to accept a 30-percent \ndepreciation bonus.\n  These are clarifications, of course, of the proposals that the House \nRepublicans say they would be prepared to put into an economic stimulus \npackage.\n  There you have it.\n  Clarify what we are talking about with regard to unemployment \ncompensation and medical benefits; let us make sure that part-time \nworkers and recent hires are included; clarify health coverage so we \nare sure we are talking about the same thing here; and deal with the \nrebate checks; tax incentives for business for up to 30 percent of \ndepreciation bonuses. All of that could be part of a plan that we could \nagree to today. All we have to do is substitute a Republican payroll \ntax holiday for the Republican accelerated rate cut idea and we have a \ndeal. I hope my colleagues share the same enthusiasm.\n  I have one more caveat. Of course, this is an issue that I have \nalready vetted with Senator Baucus and Senator Rockefeller, our \nnegotiators. I vetted it with our leadership this morning.\n  I am very confident that two-thirds of our caucus, at least--if not \nthe whole caucus--will support something such as this. But I would want \nto present it to my caucus--and we will have a caucus meeting this \nafternoon at 12:30, as we do on Tuesdays. I would recommend it, as I \nknow my negotiators would as well.\n\n  So, Senator Baucus, Senator Rockefeller, our leadership, examined \nthis and share our view that we have the makings here of an agreement. \nI hope we will not waste any time. I hope we can move forward with a \nproposal of this kind.\n  We could complete this stimulus package this week. It is my hope that \nwe can do so, putting aside all of the procedural hurdles and all of \nthe many differences and many of the accusations that have been made \nover the last several weeks.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the majority leader will yield to me.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from North Dakota, \nand then of course I will yield to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DORGAN. First of all, I compliment the majority leader for this \nproposal. I think there is a real urgency for us to do something to \nprovide some lift or some stimulus to this country's economy. We are \nboth at war and in a recession. I think we owe it to the American \npeople to take a no-regrets policy here, to take steps in the right \ndirection to try to deal with this weakened economy.\n  If I might just say, virtually every economist in this country \nbelieves that what you should do to provide a stimulant to this economy \nis to propose policies that are both temporary and immediate. And that \nwhich the majority leader has objected to, with respect to the \nacceleration of the rate cuts for the top two rates in the income tax \ncode, does not give temporary and immediate help. They in fact cause \nlonger term fiscal policy problems.\n  But I ask the majority leader, isn't it the case that all of the \nproposals you have reacted to, with respect to the announcement by the \nHouse and also the proposal offered by Senator Domenici, meet the test \nof being both temporary and immediate? Isn't it the case that that \nwould represent the character of all of those elements of the plan you \nhave just described that you would accept?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. That is, of course, one \nof the really appealing features of this plan. We said at the beginning \nwe would want this to be immediate, we would want it to be stimulative, \nand we would want it to be cost conscious. This meets all of those \ncriteria. This is immediate, it is stimulative, and the Domenici \nproposal is less in cost than the accelerated rate cuts.\n  So we are in a very strong position to meet the criteria, to find the \ncommon ground that both sides have said they are looking for. That is \nwhy I wanted to come to the floor. I read about this proposal this \nmorning with great enthusiasm because I do believe it represents \nmovement here. I hope with that one change, and with the clarifications \nI have suggested are important to our caucus, we can reach an \nagreement.\n  I appreciate the Senator's views on this as well.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator would yield for one additional comment.\n  I hope, very much, this is a breakthrough. The majority leader has \nsaid we will accept, he will accept, our caucus will largely accept the \nproposals on the Republican side coming from the House, take one of the \nsignificant proposals from the Republican side in the Senate, package \nthose together with a couple of small modifications, and try to embrace \nthem as we deal with this country's economy. I hope this is a \nhuge breakthrough.\n\n  If I might just say to the majority leader, I know there has been \ncriticism in recent days about roadblocks here or there. It is \nsometimes very difficult to see who is manning the barricades in the \nCongress. But I must say, from personal knowledge, it has not been the \nmajority leader who has ever wanted to block the stimulus package.\n  It is the case, is it not, I ask the majority leader, that you are \nthe one who brought a stimulus package to the floor of the Senate for \ndebate before it was so rudely interrupted by a point of order? Is that \nnot the case?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. And I, again, like the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, do not want to go back to the old wars and battles \nif we are going to try to create a new environment here. But the \nSenator is right. We have made a lot of efforts on the floor, off the \nfloor, in the effort to try to get a meeting. Procedurally, we had a \nnumber of obstacles that had to be overcome. We have done that. I have \ndone everything I know how to do to bring this effort forward. And now, \nperhaps, with some movement on the other side, we are in a position to \ntake full advantage of what could be some really new common ground.\n  Before I yield to the Senator from California, I will to yield to the \nSenator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the majority leader. I appreciate his comments on \nthe stimulus package. I want to go back, however, to the action taken \njust before that. As I understood, the leader offered an amendment that \nwas identified by number. I just want to trace the parliamentary \nsituation.\n  Was this amendment offered to the bill S. 1731? Does it stand as an \namendment to that bill? The reason I ask--and let me clarify further--\nis that some thought was expressed, I believe, here on the floor, that \nthis would be original text supplanting S. 1731. And, respectfully, my \nview would be--although the Parliamentarian might confirm this--that if \nthe majority leader were to supplant all of this and make his amendment \noriginal text, you would need to ask unanimous consent to do that as \nopposed to the offering of simply an amendment in the straightforward \nway he did so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been offered as a \nsubstitute. No further agreements are in place with respect to the \namendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. It was offered as a substitute but does not supplant the \noriginal text of the original bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair and the leader for that clarification.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Indiana for his question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to Senator Daschle, I thank you for \ncoming to the floor today and making a proposal that I do see as a \nbreakthrough to, let's just say, some of the antagonism that has been \non this floor and all over the news media.\n  I want to say to my friend, and then just very quickly ask him a \nquestion, that I believe personally a test of leadership is, when you \nare in a fire, how you behave. I think a leader who behaves in a \npositive way, such as you have this morning, after what I consider to \nbe an onslaught of harsh words, says a lot about you as a human\n\n[[Page S12831]]\n\nbeing and as a leader leading this country.\n  You are, in fact, the highest elected Democratic leader in the \ncountry today. This has made you a target. All I can say is, the way \nyou stand up to this is coming to the floor and saying: Let's work \ntogether.\n  I see a little light at the end of the tunnel from the Republicans on \nthe other side. They have dropped their alternative minimum tax \nretroactive rebate to the largest corporations. I know that pleases my \nfriend because here is a time of recession, and the House bill gave \n$1.4 billion to a company, IBM, for example--that is just one example--\nthat has earned $5, $6 billion. They have huge cash reserves. They are \nnot going to spend that money to stimulate the economy. But people in \nthe middle class are going to spend money.\n  Then my friend sees that Senator Domenici has made a proposal that \nis, in fact, progressive that will help get this economy going. And he \ndoes not seem to care that it is coming from a Republican. He is \ngrabbing on to that.\n  So I first thank the majority leader. I just want to end with a \nquestion about your main difference with the new Republican proposal, \nand that is the acceleration of the rates. I would like to ask my \nleader why he believes this isn't good for the economy at this time to \naccelerate the rates of about 20 percent of the people, leaving 80 \npercent without any acceleration. If he could make that argument.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will answer the Senator from California after \nacknowledging her kind words. And I appreciate very much--as she always \nprovides--the gracious support she has provided me.\n  Let me just say that our concern for the accelerated rate cut \nreduction at this point is based on three concerns.\n  First, it is not in keeping with the principles we laid out. We said \nit ought to be stimulative. We said it ought to be temporary. It is \nneither of these. So for those reasons, we are opposed to the \naccelerated rate reduction.\n  Second, we said it ought to be cost conscious. Of course, this is a \nvery expensive proposal, at least $52 billion, and as much as about \n$125 billion depending on what kind of acceleration we are talking \nabout. So there is a very significant cost associated with it. When we \nrecognize that this money is coming from borrowed funds, the Social \nSecurity trust fund, that will be troubling.\n  Third, of course, is who benefits. What we want to do is put it into \nthe hands of those who will benefit and who is most likely to spend the \nmoney so that there is something of consumptive value and whatever it \nis we are doing in an economic stimulus will be most appreciated.\n  This does not have much consumptive value. This does not have much \nvalue in terms of both economic as well as fairness factors and \nconsiderations. From that perspective as well, we have a lot of \nconcerns.\n  I have to leave the floor at this time, but I do appreciate the \ncomments and the question of the Senator from California. I hope this \nwill open up a new opportunity for us to work together to find some \nresolution, sometime hopefully in the next day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me speak a little bit about what has just occurred. \nWe have had the Democratic leader, the majority leader of the Senate, \noffer a breakthrough on an economic stimulus plan by saying to our \nfriends in the Republican Party: Save one item, we will be with you. We \ncan craft a plan that will work, and substituting for that one item a \npayroll tax holiday for 1 month that was suggested by the ranking \nmember on the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici.\n  All we need now to get it done is for the President to weigh in. He \nis very popular in his efforts in the tough period we are going \nthrough. I have supported him essentially down the line on his war on \nterrorism. But when it comes to here at home, we need the same kind of \nfocus, the same kind of commitment, the same kind of attention, the \nsame kind of steely resolve that he has shown in carrying out this war \non terror. We need that same thing here at home.\n  After a weekend of being vilified by the Republican side all over the \npress, including the Vice President of the United States, who you would \nthink would have better things to do than to attack the Democratic \nleader, he has come to this floor, turned the other cheek, as he always \ndoes, and said: I am ready to work. I see a light at the end of this \ntunnel.\n  I am very excited about this prospect. As a former stockbroker many, \nmany years ago, I spent a lot of time looking at the economy. This \neconomy is very confusing in the sense it is sending confusing signals. \nWill this be a long-term recession? Will we come out of it? How does \nthe war on terror play in one way or the other?\n  These are difficult times, but we do know we need a response, a \nresponse that will give an immediate impetus to consumer spending in \nthis country, a kind of response that will not have a long-term \nnegative impact on our budget.\n  Senator Daschle's patience, his leadership, his willingness to take a \npunch or two and still come back and be positive, these are all \nqualities we need in leaders. I am very happy. I know we have a lot of \nwork to do on the farm bill. I will not go on much longer, except to \nsay this is certainly the start of a new day for the economic stimulus \npackage. I hope the President will weigh in. I hope Senator Daschle and \nthe President will talk today, very soon, and that the President will \nbring his energy and focus to this issue. I believe it could be \nresolved in 24 hours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was hopeful there would be some talk on \nthe farm bill. I am sure that will take place, with amendments being \noffered. I am confident that will take place.\n  I am gratified the leader came to the floor and put an end to this \nconstant talk about his not wanting a stimulus package. He has wanted a \nstimulus package. And if the Chair would recall, the only reason there \nis a stimulus package still before the Senate is, we did not raise a \npoint of order on the one that would have been granted on the House \nbill. That is still here in the Senate. If the leader had wanted to get \nrid of the stimulus, he could have raised a point of order, or any one \nof us could have, and that would be gone.\n  We had offered a number of unanimous consent requests when we were on \nthe railroad retirement bill that if we could get off that during the \npostcloture proceedings, we would go back to the stimulus. They refused \nto do that. The minority would not allow us.\n  What the leader has said today is, he accepts what the Republicans \nhave offered. Of course, it is in the press, not from an authenticated \nsource. He has said, we accept what they offer with the one exception: \nrather than have the accelerated tax cuts, what we would do is accept \nwhat Senator Domenici has talked about for several weeks, agreed to by \nSenator Lott and a number of Democrats; namely, that there would be a \n1-month's moratorium on withholding taxes, which is what most people \npay. Most people in America do not pay more in income taxes than they \ndo withholding taxes. Withholding taxes is the burden on the American \npeople. What Senator Domenici has said should happen is there would be \na 1-month moratorium on paying withholding taxes, not only by the \nemployee but the employer. This money would go immediately back into \nthe economy.\n  It is a good idea. We accept that.\n  It seems to me we have a deal. We could have that deal by 3 this \nafternoon. It is very simple. It would be stimulative. It would meet \nall the requirements that everyone has talked about, including the \nPresident.\n  I hope then we can get past this name calling. As has been indicated \na number of times today, it really is name calling--obstructionist. It \nis all directed toward the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle.\n  I don't think it is just by chance that this happened, that we have \nall the\n\n[[Page S12832]]\n\ncongressional leaders, we have the Vice President, and we have everyone \ndirecting the attention to Senator Daschle. I think it is probably as a \nresult of the fact that the White House has done some polling, which \nindicates that all over America Senator Daschle is someone people \ntrust. I go home to Nevada and people don't know Senator Daschle \nbecause he is from South Dakota, but they like Senator Daschle. On \ntelevision and in his appearances on C-SPAN, to America he is somebody \nwho comes across as trying to work things out. He is not shrill. He is \nreasonable. He comes across on television that way because that is how \nhe is. He is the most patient person with whom I have ever worked. He \nis someone who never raises his voice. He has time for everybody. I \nhave seen him--when I want to go home late at night, sometimes there \nare Members of the Senate who still want to see him. He is patient and \nhe says: Come on over; I am happy to talk to you.\n  So what the American people see is what we see every day. I think the \nreason there has been this directed--I repeat--and concerted effort to \nget Daschle is because they realize he is an effective spokesperson for \nthe Democratic Party. I think it would be a real stretch to say that he \ncomes from some wild-eyed liberal State--the State of South Dakota. \nSome people are trying to correlate Senator Daschle with Saddam \nHussein. That is what those ads, as we speak, are doing that are \nrunning in South Dakota.\n  I am tremendously disappointed in the Vice President. I served in the \nHouse of Representatives with him. I like Dick Cheney. But on national \ntelevision when he was asked if he supported those television ads, he \ndid not respond that he did not support them. He gave every impression \nthose ads were OK--that Daschle and Saddam Hussein should be pictured \ntogether. That is not good.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the assistant leader that his comments are right \non target. I find it so strange that at this time they are attacking \nthe Democratic leader, who is not only the leader of the Democrats in \nthe Senate but of everyone. He is, in fact, the majority leader. He \nleads the Senate. So at a time when we have tried to come together, we \nhave been supportive of this administration in the war against \nterrorism. And it seems that if you disagree with one another on \nanything, you are a target for attack. The irony of that is, what we \nare truly fighting for in this war against terror is our right to have \nour democracy, our freedom, our differences, whether it is political \ndifferences, religious differences, diversity, or to fight for the \nrights of women. After all, we know that in Afghanistan, or in the \nTaliban, I would never be allowed to show my face--not that it would be \nso terrible for everybody, but it would not be very nice for me. I have \ntried on a burqa and it is a frightening thing.\n  When a Democrat in the Senate or in the House, steps out and says we \nthink the President is doing a terrific job, but we have an opinion \nthat it isn't smart to give retroactive tax cuts to the wealthiest \ncorporations in America because, A, it won't stimulate the economy, B, \nit is unfair, and, C, it is going to hurt Social Security, somehow we \nare related to Saddam Hussein. Or if we don't want to drill in the \nAlaska wildlife refuge because we think it is pristine and a gift from \nGod, we are criticized as playing into the hands of the \nterrorists. This is not right.\n\n  I think our leader has shown the grace today that leaders should show \nmore of, which is to come to this Chamber without rancor and say--not \neven address all of that and just say: I see a little light here; let's \nget to work.\n  But does my friend not see the irony here of our being engaged in a \nwar against people who don't want diversity of thought; yet when we \nstep out here, we are criticized if we don't go down the line 100 \npercent?\n  Mr. REID. Well, the Democratic Party and Democratic Senators are \nabout as diverse as a group of people could be. We have people who \nrepresent different constituencies and different States, of course, but \nwe are a group of Senators with wide-ranging views. Senator Daschle \nworks with each one of us. As I look around in this Chamber, there is a \nSenator from North Dakota, and Senators from New York, California, \nNevada, and Georgia. We all have different views and experiences in \nlife. We try to be together as much as we can.\n  Senator Daschle recognizes that we can't be together all the time, \nbut he does a good job of holding us together, being our leader. I \nthink it speaks volumes for what he has done when he comes to the floor \ntoday, and he has an article from the Wall Street Journal that lists in \ndetail what the minority wants in a stimulus package. He says: I \naccept. The only thing I don't want is the retroactive tax cuts. We \nwill take another Republican proposal and insert that instead--one \nsupported by the former chairman of the Budget Committee and the former \nmajority leader, Senator Domenici and Senator Lott. I think it is a \npretty good deal. I think it speaks that we want to get a stimulus \npackage. It is here.\n  As I said earlier today, we can have it by 3 o'clock this afternoon. \nHowever long it takes the staff to write it up, we can do it and walk \naway from it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield, with the prefatory statement: The \nSenators from the State of New York, more than any other Senators in \nthe past 6 months, can talk about how the majority leader has led this \nNation in a bipartisan effort to help the State most afflicted by the \nterrorist acts. So I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend from Nevada. In terms of what I would \nlike to ask him, he is certainly right. New York, without the majority \nleader, would be virtually nowhere. He has stood firm for us and he has \ntried in every way to help New York, whether it be on the DOD \nauthorization bill, in terms of the financing we need, along with the \nFinance Committee, Chairman Baucus, and the majority whip. He has \nhelped us look for tax cuts that keep businesses in New York. In fact, \nit has been this Senate, under his leadership, that has sort of had its \nfinger in the dike. Have we gotten everything we wanted? No. Have we \ndone very well because of Tom Daschle? You bet.\n  I would like to ask a question, and the Senator mentioned it as I \nrose. If this man were so obstructionist, why would he be proposing a \ncomprehensive package that has a large number of the proposals that the \nfolks from the other side came up with? The Domenici proposal is a tax \ncut. It is a tax cut that goes to business, it is a tax cut that \ncreates jobs, and it seems to fit a lot of the guidelines for which \nmany colleagues on the other side are asking. The majority leader of \nthis side takes a giant step across the aisle and says, OK, we are \ngoing to take a lot of the things you have proposed, even though we \nmight prefer actually to get the economy going in other ways, but this \nis a decent way to do it, so we are going to reach out to you. I think \nit is a brilliant step. I think it is a step that could break the \nlogjam because, as my colleagues well know, we have had loggerheads \nhere. The other side of the aisle has said the way to stimulate the \neconomy is tax cuts. What on this side we have said primarily is that \nit has to be aimed at average folks, not the wealthiest who got their \ngoodies back in the tax bill.\n  Well, the Domenici proposal, which Senator Daschle has embraced, does \nboth. It is a tax cut on perhaps the most onerous tax--necessary but \nonerous because it funds Social Security--the payroll tax. Talk to \nsmall business as well as average workers and yet it is aimed at \naverage folks. At least half of it is.\n  So doesn't it seem befuddling that the one person who seems to have \nput together a compromise, who has not said do it my way and that is \nthe bipartisan way, which we seem to hear from a few colleagues on the \nother side--I don't hear Senator Daschle saying his way is bipartisan \nand the other way is not. But the one person who has put together a \nreal proposal that has a chance of breaking the logjam, that does \nincorporate many ideas that came from the other side of the aisle seems \nto be our majority leader. Quite the contrary to what some of the \neditorials are saying, he is not being an obstructionist. He is being \nthe most constructive Member of the entire Chamber. I have not heard a \nproposal that has\n\n[[Page S12833]]\n\nmore promise than the one he elucidated on the floor an hour ago.\n\n  I ask my good friend from Nevada, is this somebody who takes the \nproposal of the good Senator from New Mexico and makes it the linchpin, \nthe centerpiece of what he could support, someone who could fairly be \ncalled obstructionist, or someone who seems genuinely trying to get \nmoney into the hands of the people even as we go into a recession, so \nwe can get out of that recession and so people can start spending a \nlittle more and getting the economy going? Is my thinking on this out \nof touch? It seems to me so logical that I almost do not want to bring \nit up.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New York has answered his own question. Of \ncourse, it is clear Senator Daschle is not being an obstructionist, but \nit shows the kind of person he is, the peacemaker he is. He stood here \nhalf an hour ago and said: Let's not pass blame. Let's not talk about \nwhat went on in the past. Let's just talk about what is going on today, \nand I accept your proposal with the one caveat: Rather than \naccelerating tax cuts, let's go for the Domenici and Lott proposal and \ntake that. There are some Democrats who accept that also, which is \ngood. It seems to be bipartisan.\n  I repeat, it speaks well of our leader when, in responding to a \nquestion from one of us earlier today, he said: Enough said of what \nwent on in the past. What I want to do is move forward. I think that is \nwhat this does.\n  As the Senator from New York has said, it breaks a logjam, and I hope \nour friends on the other side of the aisle will also not look backward. \nI think they should follow the advice, the suggestion of our friend \nfrom South Dakota, the majority leader, and say: Let's look forward; I \naccept your deal.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, after what I just said, this is in no way to \ndirect blame toward anyone, but we are going to go into party \nconferences at 12:30 p.m. Because there was not anything going on, we \ntalked a lot today on this side. I hope, though, we will move to the \namendment process as soon as we can. At 11 o'clock, we were ready for \namendments. We acknowledge we should have been ready to go a little \nearlier than that, but we were not. We did not hold things up that much \nbecause there were votes scheduled all morning and we were able to get \nthat. We had only one recorded vote.\n  In short, I hope people will not say they have not had enough time to \nwork on this bill. I hope colleagues will offer their amendments, if \nthere are amendments to be offered. We want to finish this bill today. \nWe want to get this bill to conference. It is an extremely important \nbill.\n  There are some who do not like the bill the way it is written. That \nis the way any legislation is. I am not as experienced in the Senate as \nmy friend from Indiana, but I have been in Congress quite awhile. I \nhave never had legislation that I introduced turn out the way I \nintroduced it. I am sure that is what will happen with this \nlegislation.\n  I hope we can move forward, get this legislation done, have a good \ndebate, and go home for Christmas. We are beating around the bush here, \nI say to everyone within the sound of my voice. Christmas Eve is 2 \nweeks from yesterday. We are fast approaching Christmas. Two weeks from \ntoday is Christmas. We have to finish our work. People want to go home \nto get ready for Christmas. I do not know the experience of others, but \nit is a little hard to go Christmas shopping when you are here until \nafter midnight on Friday night, when we have other things to do, and \nwith travel that is necessary. I live almost 3,000 miles from here. I \nwant to go home for Christmas.\n  I hope we can move forward with these amendments as quickly as \npossible and move on this legislation. I hope people do not complain \nthat they have not had time to offer amendments. We have time now. \nAfter the conference, we will go to 6 o'clock tonight, 12 o'clock \ntonight. We want to finish this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I share the eagerness of the distinguished \nleader in wanting to complete the bill. For the moment, I am awaiting \nthe presence of the distinguished Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo, who \nhas one amendment on dairy. I anticipate his arrival imminently.\n  After he offers that amendment and in the event it is still in order, \nI will offer an amendment that will amend the commodity nutrition \nsections of the bill. To advance the process, I will discuss that \namendment pending the arrival of the distinguished Senator from Idaho. \nIf he does not arrive, I will offer the amendment and let it be the \npending amendment.\n  As many of us have pointed out, current farm programs, including the \nprogram we adopted in 1996 and supplemental farm assistance programs we \nhave adopted at least the last 3 years during the summertime, have \nencouraged overproduction of a small number of selected program crops; \nnamely, wheat, corn, cotton, rice, and soybeans.\n  The effect of our farm bills, intended or unintended, has been to \nencourage those who are in the five row crops I have enumerated to \nplant more. This should not have come as a total surprise because we \nhave set incentives in our bill which make it profitable to do that.\n  As I pointed out from my own experience in Indiana, if you send a \nbushel of corn to the elevator, you are guaranteed to get $1.89 because \nthe last farm bill has a loan deficiency payment program that \nguarantees that. That has no relationship necessarily to the cost of \nproduction of an additional unit. So many farmers in Indiana, myself \nincluded, produce knowing that our cost for the marginal bushel is \ngoing to be less than what was meant to be the floor. The $1.89 was not \nto be touched.\n  Of course, as more and more of us produce more and more corn, the \nsurpluses grow, the price predictably falls, and given the size of the \nsurplus, it stays low. Then people come to the Senate Chamber and point \nout, correctly, that prices are very low and, as a result, we ought to \ndo something about that. And farm bills are passed to do something \nabout that.\n  The dilemma with the pending bill that came out of the Agriculture \nCommittee is that, in my judgment, the incentives to produce even more \nhave been increased substantially. Therefore, it is a large step in the \nwrong direction.\n  If we adopt the bill out of the Agriculture Committee, we will, in \nfact, have low prices. They are almost guaranteed.\n  Senators will say: But whether the low prices happen or not, that is \nthe market. What we are talking about in this bill are payments for a \nbushel that have no relationship to the market because we are going to \nguarantee a payment that is well above the market, almost in \nperpetuity, whether it is a 5-year bill or a 10-year bill. That will \nprovide new income to farmers, quite apart from what supply and demand \neither in this country or the world might suggest. I think that is the \nwrong course.\n\n  As a result, I simply want to point out that caught in this cycle of \nlow commodity prices that reinforce themselves, I tried to think \nthrough a different way of approaching this; namely, one that in effect \naccepts that we have markets that work and people ought to produce for \nthe market price. In the event the market price is not adequate, they \nought to produce something else. They ought to have a mix in terms of \ntheir farm situations, as most farmers do, or become much more \nefficient so the costs become lower than the market price and they make \na profit doing that.\n  I do not make that shift abruptly. There are a couple of years of \nphaseout. But the heart of the matter, in light of the amendment I am \ngoing to introduce, says instead of just the five row crops that are \nthe focus of farm legislation and that lead to six States receiving \nclose to 50 percent of all the payments, every person who is involved \nin farming, whether that person produces livestock or row crops or \nfruits\n\n[[Page S12834]]\n\nand vegetables--whatever is produced on that farm, every dollar of that \nfarm income counts. It is a level lie. We don't pick and chose, as \nhistorically we did from the New Deal days onward, for crops that \nbecame the so-called program crops, the focus of farm programs.\n  In the event we were to adopt my amendment, all States are equal. All \nfarmers are equal. It doesn't make a difference what they produce and \nthey have the freedom to produce whatever will make a profit. They look \nto the market for whatever that may be.\n  After they find that market, under my proposal, they add up--and \ntheir tax return will show--all the money that has come from all \nagricultural sources on their farm. They receive, up to a certain \nlimit, a 6-percent credit or voucher from the Federal Government of the \ntotal value of what they produced. If their total production is \n$100,000 on the farm--say $40,000 from corn, $40,000 from soybeans, \n$20,000 from hogs--$100,000 of revenue, then they get a voucher for \n$6,000 with which to purchase a crop insurance--or really a whole farm \ninsurance, more accurately, because now we are doing not only crops but \nlivestock or anything else--whole farm insurance that guarantees that \nthey will receive 80 percent of the average 5-year value that they \nproduce.\n  In essence, it is a safety net. It doesn't guarantee 100 percent of \ntheir average year by year, but says in no case can they dip below 80 \npercent regardless of weather disaster or export/import disasters or \nall the things that can befall agriculture in America. In other words, \nwe leave behind target prices, loan rates, prices that have no \nrelationship to the market. People produce for markets. They get credit \nfor everything they produce, unlike the current system. And they have \nsufficient money to buy insurance that makes them whole--at least 80 \npercent, a 20-percent reduction being the worst that can happen in any \nfarm year with that kind of coverage.\n  I think this makes sense as a long-term farm policy for our country. \nIt ends the cycle of overproduction, of stimulation from our farm \nbills. One could say this has not been all bad. In fact, if you own \nland then, in fact, it has been very good. Some agricultural economists \ndo not prophesy a bubble in farmland, but many point out that the \nvalues of real estate, agricultural real estate, have leapt far beyond \nthe income potential--largely stimulated, again, by Government payments \nand the certainty of these payments.\n  Unfortunately, 42 percent of farmers who are involved in this program \nrent land. They are out of luck because, essentially, our programs \nbuild value into the value of the land--into the heightening of the \nrent.\n\n  Mr. President, I am advised, happily, that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho, Mr. Crapo, is available. As I indicated as I began this \ndiscussion of my potential amendment, I am very pleased that he has an \nactual amendment that he is prepared to introduce and discuss for the \nbenefit of all of us at this time. So, therefore, I am prepared to \nyield to the distinguished Senator from Idaho for the purpose of his \noffering an amendment and his discussion of that important amendment.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I will \ncall it up for its consideration.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I understand there now is a copy of the \namendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2472\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I have an amendment at the desk. I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Crapo], for himself, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Craig, and Mr. \n     Voinovich, proposes an amendment numbered 2472.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To replace the provision relating to the national dairy \n    program with the provision from the bill passed by the House of \n                            Representatives)\n\n       Strike section 132 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 132. STUDY OF NATIONAL DAIRY POLICY.\n\n       (a) Study Required.--Not later than April 30, 2002, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture shall submit to Congress a \n     comprehensive economic evaluation of the potential direct and \n     indirect effects of the various elements of the national \n     dairy policy, including an examination of the effect of the \n     national dairy policy on--\n       (1) farm price stability, farm profitability and viability, \n     and local rural economies in the United States;\n       (2) child, senior, and low-income nutrition programs, \n     including impacts on schools and institutions participating \n     in the programs, on program recipients, and other factors; \n     and\n       (3) the wholesale and retail cost of fluid milk, dairy \n     farms, and milk utilization.\n       (b) National Dairy Policy Defined.--In this section, the \n     term ``national dairy policy'' means the dairy policy of the \n     United States as evidenced by the following policies and \n     programs:\n       (1) Federal Milk Marketing Orders.\n       (2) Interstate dairy compacts (including proposed compacts \n     described in H.R. 1827 and S. 1157, as introduced in the \n     107th Congress).\n       (3) Over-order premiums and State pricing programs.\n       (4) Direct payments to milk producers.\n       (5) Federal milk price support program.\n       (6) Export programs regarding milk and dairy products, such \n     as the Dairy Export Incentive Program.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, this amendment will strike section 132 from \nthe farm bill and replace it with a study of the impact of our Federal \ndairy policy on producers and consumers. I am proud to be joined by \nSenators Bingaman, Domenici, Brownback, Craig, and Voinovich. There \nwill probably be others before we are finished with the debate.\n  There has been a lot of national attention provided to the issue of \nnational dairy policy. As the provisions in the farm bill in the Senate \ndealing with dairy were first proposed, there was a very strong outcry \nacross the country, which I supported. It is my understanding the \nproposals have been modified somewhat. What we first started out with \nwas a proposal that would have increased the costs to our consumers, \nincreased the costs--reduced the price to our farmers or our producers \nand created a national subsidy program for milk in the middle.\n  This would have resulted in our school lunch program, for example, \npaying millions more dollars nationwide, our Food Stamp Program paying \nmillions of more dollars nationwide, and a reduction of the consumption \nof milk because of the increased price of milk that this new national \ndairy program would have required.\n  It has been modified somewhat but still achieves the same types of \nnegative results in the managers' amendment that has been proposed as a \nsubstitute for the bill that is now on the floor. It is an ill-\nconceived attempt to create a national dairy program that is unfair, is \nunwanted, and untested.\n  This proposal is opposed by milk producer organizations that \nrepresent over 90 percent of the milk produced in this country. It is \nopposed by groups with an interest in our milk policy. And, it is \nopposed by taxpayer organizations.\n  The proposal we have before us today is the third iteration we have \nseen since it was first sprung upon us before the committee mark-up. \nWhile this version is a vast improvement over the milk tax created in \nS. 1628 and in the filed bill, it is still bad dairy policy and still \nharmful to the majority of dairy producers.\n  This proposal takes a relatively healthy domestic industry and forces \n$2 billion in government spending that will reduce overall farm income. \nThat's right. This will reduce income.\n  The proposal creates artificial incentive to increase production. The \nlaw of supply and demand dictates the surplus milk will reduce the \nprice paid to dairy farmers. For example: payments to milk producers \ncould amount to more than $500 million per year, or the equivalent of a \nU.S. average price incentive of nearly 3 percent. Such a production \nincentive could lead to an increase in milk production of nearly 1 \nbillion pounds of milk and a market price decline of 20 cents per \nhundredweight.\n\n[[Page S12835]]\n\n  If you have a dairy farm larger than the cap, which is most of the \nWest and major producers in every State, you lose money.\n  The price of milk goes down, and that subsidy, which this proposal in \nthe farm bill now intends to make up the difference to farmers, only \ngoes so far. So those who do not benefit from the new subsidy are going \nto lose income.\n  The special treatment in this bill for the Northeast is also going to \nhave an additional effect on milk across the country. This proposal \ncontains specific and special provisions for the Northeastern States.\n  The 12 Northeastern States identified in this proposal, which account \nfor 18 percent of milk production, will receive 25 percent of the \nproposed benefits. So, the percentage increase in production in the 12 \nstates is likely to be greater than the rest of the Nation. The market \nprices in the rest of the Nation would reflect a disproportionate \nreduction due to the higher payments paid to northeast producers.\n  In effect, a taxpayer subsidy to the Northeast is going to result in \nan increase in the production of milk to the detriment of dairy farmers \naround the rest of the country.\n  What's more, this $2 billion government outlay is just for the \npayments. It does not take into account the cost to the government when \nit has to purchase surplus milk products. Nonfat dry milk is currently \nbeing bought under the price support program, which helps to support \nclass IV milk prices--butter and nonfat dry milk. USDA purchased over \n20 million pounds of nonfat dry milk last week, bringing USDA \nuncommitted inventories to 655 million pounds, nearly a year's worth of \nU.S. production and far more than USDA can distribute over the next \nseveral years. The increased supply and decreased prices will lead to \nmore government purchases and more cost to the taxpayer.\n  I also ask my colleagues what they expect to happen when the $2 \nbillion is expended. We will have pushed market prices down and \nproducers will actually need these payments in the future. We will have \nmade our producers dependent on Federal payments, leading to more \npayments in the future.\n  We will have created a dependency, making our producers dependent on \nFederal payments, leading to more payments in the future and increased \ndebates in these Halls of Congress about whether we can continue a \nsubsidy program which we didn't need to establish in the first place.\n  What is the goal of this proposal? Supposedly it is to prevent the \ndemise of small dairy farms.\n  Is there anyone who thinks producers will not make investments to \nproduce the maximum amount they can get subsidized to produce? What \nwill this do to the small dairy producers who can't afford to make \nthose investments?\n  The subsidy programs in this bill--which I understand is to encourage \nproduction of up to 400 cows per farm--will end up in a Federal subsidy \nprogram stimulating the overproduction of milk in those areas and \nstimulating the increased size of dairy farms.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote with me to strike this provision. This \nis bad policy for the farms, it will be bad for the dairy industry, and \nit is bad policy for the country. Congress should favor policies that \nencourage growth and innovation in the industry, and not endorse plans \nthat replace market paychecks with government subsidies. The study \ncalled for in my amendment will help us determine what those good \npolicies should be.\n  As I indicated, by striking section 182 of the farm bill, we are \nproposing to replace it with a study. There has been a tremendous \namount of debate over the past few years--in fact, over a number the \npast years--about what the proper milk policy in this country should be \nand what the impact on producers, processors, and those who consume the \nmilk will be from different farm policies.\n  Although I am confident that the proposal to create a new Federal \nsubsidy program and then impose floor prices in some parts of the \ncountry is not the right kind of farm policy, I also believe a study by \nCongress is necessary to help us get the actual data before us to make \nthese critical decisions.\n  Let me explain for just a moment who in this country opposes this \nprogram. Again, as I indicated previously, dairy producers across this \ncountry representing over 90 percent of the dairy production oppose \nthis new dairy proposal. Let me go through a little more specifically \nwho opposes this proposal.\n  It is opposed by the National Milk Producers Federation, American \nFarm Bureau Federation, National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, \nAlliance of Western Milk Producers, Southeast Dairy Farmers \nAssociation, Western United Dairymen, Milk Producers Council of \nCalifornia, and the Dairy Producers of New Mexico, Idaho, Oregon, \nTexas, Utah, Washington, and Montana. It is opposed by the retailer \nprocessors and consumer food groups, including the American Frozen Food \nInstitute, Americans for Tax Reform, Chocolate Manufacturers \nAssociation, Council for Citizens Against Governmental Waste, Food \nMarketing Institute, Grocery Manufacturers of America, Independent \nBakers Association, International Dairy Foods Association, National \nConfectioners Association, National Council of Chain Restaurants, \nNational Food Processors Association, National Grocers Association, \nNational Restaurant Association, and the National Taxpayers Union.\n  I went through that list to show the broad array of different kinds \nof groups that oppose this new proposal for a national dairy policy.\n  If you listened carefully, you will notice that there are groups in \nthere whose dedicated purpose is to protect the American taxpayers, \nsuch as the National Taxpayers Union or Citizens Against Governmental \nWaste. There are groups in there that utilize milk and the milk \nprocessing industry, such as the chocolate manufacturers or grocery \nstores or retailers and restaurant associations. There are groups in \nthere that produce the milk and many milk organizations that were \nidentified. Whether one is on the production side or whether one is on \nthe consumer side or the marketing side, it is recognized very broadly \nacross this Nation that this new proposal to create a Federal subsidy \nprogram for dairy is not a wise direction for our dairy policy.\n  For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to vote yes on this \namendment to strike this provision from the farm bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nIndiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator. I believe he has concisely pointed out the \ndilemma of subsidies in the dairy areas where a great deal of the \nproblem has been created in the past.\n  The committee has wrestled over the course of time with dairy policy \nand has found vast regional and sectional differences, most recently \nexacerbated by the New England Dairy Compact and the debate that has \nsurrounded that particular situation.\n  As a matter of fact, the Chair will recall when we last had an \nagriculture debate where there were a number of Members vitally \ninterested in the dairy issue, although that was not ultimately a part \nof the supplement payments virtually made by that legislation last \nAugust.\n  But a great number of Members pointed out inequities they believed \nwere created by Federal policy and created by the New England Dairy \nCompact. Even though the last farm bill indicated it should come to an \nend after a couple of years, it did not come to an end because of \nnegotiations that surrounded appropriations bills at the end of the \nsession.\n  Advocates for the New England Dairy Compact managed each year to do \nso by bumping it ahead another year beyond the termination of the farm \nbill that called for it.\n  The last farm bill also called for very substantial changes in dairy \nsubsidies. Those likewise have been bumped ahead by other negotiations \nthat do not deal directly with farm legislation most frequently but \nwere tradeoffs by Senators whose votes were required at the end of the \nsession on appropriations bills.\n  The compounding of these problems over the years leads us to this \npoint and the need for some rationalization, some study of how there \nmight be some degree of equity for dairy producers\n\n[[Page S12836]]\n\nthroughout the country, regardless of where they live and their income, \nboth with regard to production and pricing as opposed to artificial \nconstraints or boosts that the Federal Government gives.\n  Certainly, it is a way of bringing things back to where we thought we \nwere in passing the 1996 act given the same troubles the Senator from \nIdaho has pointed out today. They were exacerbated then.\n  In addition to this, I presume, in an attempt not to hit the New \nEngland Dairy Compact issue head on, the Agriculture Committee, by \npassing a very generous dairy bill, indicated to many Senators that the \nadditional subsidies and payments to dairymen would be fairly universal \naround the country.\n  At least one of the first attempts to do this in the farm bill--and \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer listened to the debate, as well as \nthe distinguished Democratic manager present, the Senator from \nGeorgia--was to up the ante very substantially; one thought being that \nthose who utilized dairy products might put money into a trust fund for \nthe benefit of producers but at the expense of consumers.\n  It was estimated that this particular scheme might result in a \npayment of 26 cents per gallon more by all the consumers of milk \nregardless of income level, regardless of the WIC program, or the \nschool lunch program.\n  Understandably, as word of this particular redistribution of the \nwealth got out, cries of outrage occurred. As a matter of fact, the \ndairy sections were not very compatible. Having warred with each other \nfor all of these years, the thought that somehow the New England \ncompact would be universalized with equity, even if paid for by \nothers--namely, the consumers, ultimately, and 26 cents a gallon--did \nnot set well. So as a result, it was apparent that the farm bill was \nbeing rewritten by committee staff.\n  Most Senators were never the wiser as to what changes the staff made \nin that particular area, but they were substantial, in part because the \ninitial scoring by the Congressional Budget Office, and others, of the \noverall product of our Agriculture Committee sent it well beyond the \nlimits that were still very generous in the budget situation. So it \nwould have been subject to a point of order, and a lot of amending and \nrewriting went on.\n  That, of course, was not the end of it. I have no idea how many times \nthe dairy section has been subsequently rewritten. I am advised that \neven this morning before we started this debate, once again, the dairy \nsection was being rewritten. The reason for the delay of our debate \nthis morning was, in fact, legislative counsel was working with the \ndistinguished Democratic staff members on still another dairy amendment \nto the farm bill to supplant whatever was there, which bore no \nrelationship to what we finally debated in committee.\n  I think the Senator's amendment is very constructive because neither \nhe nor I have the slightest idea what is now in the farm bill that is \nbefore us, and particularly with regard to the dairy situation. We have \nscrambled, I admit to you, Mr. President, in terms of the amendment \nthat I was about to offer and will offer subsequently to this dairy \namendment, to find where, in relationship to the new bill that Senator \nDaschle has offered this morning, our amendment fits.\n  That is going to be a problem for everybody thinking about amendments \ntoday. I think we have rearranged the papers, but there are substantial \nnumbers of new pages. I would estimate, just quickly, there are over \n100 pages of new language, some of it pertaining to dairy--a lot of it, \nas a matter of fact, because that has been the major area of contention \nand scoring.\n  Fortunately, the Senator from Idaho, noting this situation, simply \nsays, we just strike the dairy section, whatever its writing or \nreiteration. Whether it is the fourth or fifth or sixth try at this, we \nstrike it, and we have a study of the situation, which is going to be \nmuch more healthy for every American consumer.\n  Any consumer of milk, listening to this debate, will be relieved that \nthe cost of milk is not going to go up 26 cents a gallon or 5 cents or \n10 cents a gallon or what have you. As a matter of fact, there will be \na pretty economical milk situation without extraordinary subsidies \npiled on and redistributed in this way.\n  The Senator from Idaho has done a favor for every American consumer \nof milk, a humanitarian service for those who are poor, those who are \nbeing assisted in the Women, Infants and Children Program and the \nschool lunch program. He certainly has assisted all of us as Senators \nto come out of the trenches of this sectional warfare over dairy, which \nhas pitted Senators not only on the Agriculture Committee but on the \nfloor in pitched battles for some time.\n  I can remember vividly 2 years ago this December when it was very \ndifficult to close down the session of the Congress because the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, felt that somehow, \ndespite his very best efforts, behind the scenes, somebody, trying to \nwind up the appropriations process, was, once again, renewing the New \nEngland Dairy Compact, which was supposed to be over at that point. The \nSenator's suspicions were correct. Amazingly, as we left town, the \ndairy compact was still alive. And Senator Kohl vowed that he would \nstop this sort of thing. He has tried valiantly to do so on behalf of \nWisconsin dairymen and people from the Midwest but without visible \nsuccess.\n  I would say to the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, if \nhe had read the first dairy section coming out of the Agriculture \nCommittee, he would have been even further outraged by the process. He \nmay have read that and may have contributed, for all I know, to other \niterations subsequently. But my hope is we will adopt the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Idaho. It is a clean-cut way \nof getting us back to some reality in the dairy area. Clearly, it will \nbe useful for the Congress at this point--without the encumbrance of \nall of the layers of dairy programs that we have produced, plus some \nthat we have not ever debated but have been produced somewhere else--to \nsort of clear the deck. The Senator's amendment does that magnificently \nand cleanly.\n  So I am hopeful that as we approach the time for final consideration \nof this amendment and a rollcall vote on the amendment, Senators will \nbe found to have voted in the affirmative for it. I certainly will be. \nI commend the Senator for crafting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/11/senate-section/article/S12836-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12836-S12837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WE MUST LIVE BY OUR PRINCIPLES\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, today we are commemorating the \nanniversary of a despicable act against our country and against our \npeople. We all pay tribute to those who died on September 11. At the \nsame time, we salute those defending freedom today at home and halfway \nacross the globe.\n  War brings out the best in America. The soldiers who stormed Omaha \nBeach are still our heroes. The firefighters who marched into the World \nTrade Center will be our grandchildren's heroes.\n  But the heat of battle and the crush of necessity can also bring out \nAmerica's worst, especially here at home. And that is the risk I want \nto talk about today.\n  During World War II, one of our greatest Presidents authorized the \ninternment of more than 100,000 innocent people, mostly United States \ncitizens, simply on account of their ancestry.\n  Today, we are ashamed of that episode. And we are resolved that our \nactions should make our grandchildren proud, not ashamed.\n  President Bush himself has expressed that resolve. In his speech to \nthe Congress on September 20, he said something that was very \nimportant. He said:\n\n       We are in a fight for our principles, and our first \n     responsibility is to live by them.\n\n  That is exactly right. One of our principles is vigorous debate. I \nwas saddened when the Attorney General of the United States last week \nsaid that unidentified critics ``aid terrorists'' and ``give ammunition \nto America's enemies.'' Mr. Ashcroft did not offer any\n\n[[Page S12837]]\n\nevidence that terrorists benefit when Americans speak their mind.\n  In our American tradition, it is the responsibility of leaders to \npromote the free exchange of ideas, not stifle them. That \nresponsibility carries over from peacetime to wartime. We don't \nencourage different ideas because we owe it to critics. We encourage \ndifferent ideas because we owe it to ourselves. Robust debate has made \nAmerica stronger for more than 200 years.\n  It is only because of open debate that we have a legal right to speak \nour minds at all. The way the Constitution was initially drafted back \nin 1787, there was no guarantee for free speech. There was no \nprotection for religious freedom, for privacy, for individual liberty, \nfor so many rights all Americans now take for granted. The original \nConstitution contained no Bill of Rights.\n  Without a Bill of Rights, many veterans of the American Revolution \nfuriously opposed the original Constitution. My State of North Carolina \nflatly rejected it. The first Congress approved the Bill of Rights only \nafter those patriots spoke their minds, spoke up and demanded it. \nToday, we are all grateful for their speaking their minds, for their \npatriotism that has meant so much to many Americans who followed.\n  A few years later, in the late 1790s, our Nation was on the brink of \nwar. The French Government was torturing American soldiers and seizing \nAmerican ships. At that point, an enraged Congress passed a sedition \nact criminalizing ``scandalous'' writing ``against the Government.'' \nChief among the opponents of that legislation was Vice President Thomas \nJefferson. As he put it, the country's critics should be allowed to \n``stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of \nopinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.''\n  Closer to today, President Richard Nixon moved to expand the \nSubversive Activities Control Board's oversight of political protests \nduring the Vietnam war. Sam Ervin, whose seat in the Senate I now hold, \nsupported that war. But he challenged President Nixon's proposal. What \nhe said on the floor echoed Jefferson:\n\n       Our country has nothing to fear from the exercise of its \n     freedoms as long as it leaves truth free to combat error.\n\n  I believe that is still true today. Like the vast majority of \nAmericans, I strongly support America's war on terrorism overseas. \nUnlike some, I also support much of the administration's law \nenforcement effort here at home. We live in a new world after September \n11. We simply must take steps that we would not have accepted 3 months \nago.\n  I also believe that vigorously discussing each of those steps \nstrengthens our war effort. Thanks to the courage and skill of our \nsoldiers, we will win this war against al-Qaida. But there is a totally \ndifferent question whether we will win the war for the minds and hearts \nof those around the world.\n  I believe we will do that if we hold true to our values--values such \nas justice, fairness, and the rule of law. Those are the values that \nmake America the beacon of freedom for the rest of the world. And \nnothing reminds us of our values like open discussion.\n  The debate over military tribunals is a perfect example. The order of \nNovember 30 that authorized tribunals came with very little \nexplanation. Many Americans, including many past Federal prosecutors, \nasked why our ordinary criminal justice system was not adequate. The \nadministration responded with a much more detailed explanation for \ntheir action. That explanation built broad support for the use of \ntribunals in very narrow circumstances. In fact, I support the use of \nmilitary tribunals under the right circumstances.\n\n  But even since that exchange, serious questions remained about the \ngap between the specific terms of the order and basic norms of fairness \nthat Americans share and believe in deeply.\n  In answer to some of the questions last Thursday, Attorney General \nAshcroft was able to clarify that many things apparently allowed on the \nface of the order will not happen. For example, secret trials, \nindefinite detentions, executive reversal of acquittals by the military \ntribunals.\n  Mr. Ashcroft could not rule out other disturbing possibilities. Could \na lawful resident in this country be convicted and sentenced to death \nby a tribunal on a 2-to-1 vote? Could it happen under a burden of proof \nrequiring only a 51-percent likelihood of guilt; that is, a lawful \nresident of this country being convicted and receiving the death \npenalty on 51 percent of the evidence? And could it happen without an \nindependent review to see whether there was evidence that should have \nbeen admitted that was not admitted, evidence that would have shown \nthat this particular defendant did not commit the crime?\n  Members of Congress and members of the general public have much more \nthan a right to raise those questions. We have a responsibility to \nraise those questions.\n  The give and take over military tribunals hardly helps terrorists. I \nbelieve that it undercuts America's enemies, for open exchange ensures \nthat our actions reflect our commitments. It signals that a great \nnation fears nothing from peaceful debate. We should welcome that \ndebate. It is a proud, necessary tradition, both in peace and in war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. What is the will of the Senate?\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I start by thanking Senator Harkin for \nhis hard work on this farm bill. I know he has a difficult task pulling \npeople together to craft a bill. As chairman of the committee, he and \nhis staff need to be complimented for the fine work they have done on \nthe bill. It is important legislation for farmers in New Mexico, and I \nhope the Senate can move ahead to complete action on the farm bill.\n  The bill has several provisions important to my State. I thank the \nchairman for working with me on those. I also thank Senator Harkin for \nthe strong efforts he has made to improve the conservation programs in \nthe bill which are particularly important to my State.\n  However, all that being true, I wish to express a serious concern \nabout the dairy provisions in the bill. As I understand it, the \nsubstitute bill creates a totally new dairy program. I believe the new \ndairy scheme in the bill is wrong for the Nation's dairy farmers and \nwrong for consumers as well. That is why I support Senator Crapo's \namendment to strike this provision and to instead have a study to \ndetermine which, if any, of the proposals that are currently floating \nin the Senate ought to be considered in the future.\n  I do appreciate the effort that Senator Harkin and Senator Daschle \nand others, as well as our staffs, have made to come up with a balanced \ndairy policy. The latest version I have seen is a dramatic improvement \nover previous versions, and I appreciate that.\n  My State of New Mexico is the 10th largest dairy producing State and \none of the fastest growing dairy producing\n\n[[Page S12838]]\n\nStates. Dairy production in my State has grown 200 percent in the past \n10 years. We have large, efficient dairies which are clearly the big \nlosers under this latest proposal. These are family-owned dairies, just \nas in other States. They are larger in my State because we have the \nland and the resources to support those larger dairies.\n\n  Because the latest version of the proposal has only been available a \nfew hours, we do not know the full impact on milk prices and dairy farm \nincome. However, I think it is fair to say that the legislation clearly \nfavors certain regions and certain sizes of farms. Moreover, we do not \nknow what the real impact will be on future production rates, prices \nthe farmers receive for their milk, and nobody has had time to do \nproper analyses to consider all the complex ramifications of this \ndramatic change in policy.\n  We just received a very preliminary analysis of the new proposal. The \nanalysis compares the subsidies to farmers in terms of Federal payments \nper hundred pounds of milk produced, and our analysis shows that States \nin the Northeast would receive on average a Federal payment of more \nthan $2 per hundred pounds of milk. Farmers in my State would receive \n40 cents, five times less than the Federal payments to farmers in the \nNortheast.\n  Based on this analysis, my State of New Mexico would be 50th out of \n50 States in Federal payments per hundredweight. Arizona, Florida, \nWyoming, California, Idaho, and Washington State would all receive less \nthan $1 per hundredweight. Farmers in Georgia, North Carolina, Rhode \nIsland, Louisiana, Oregon, and Arkansas would receive half as much as \nfarmers in Northeastern States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table prepared for my \noffice by Mr. Ben Yale be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. This table shows the Federal payments per hundred pounds of \nmilk produced in each State. The table is based on the preliminary \nanalysis performed by the Independent Food and Agriculture Policy \nResearch Institute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do not know of any other farm program \nthat favors one region to this extent and has such a dramatic disparity \nin the use of taxpayers' dollars. In this case, one region will receive \n25 percent of the Federal payments, though it produces less than 18 \npercent of the Nation's milk. Moreover, in one region, farmers are \nguaranteed a price of nearly $17 per hundredweight, while prices \nelsewhere are based on market rates and undoubtedly will be \nsubstantially lower.\n  In my view, this is not a balanced program. In addition, I am \nconcerned that indirect payment schemes, such as that proposed here, \nwould distort the market by encouraging overproduction. I know that is \na point the Senator from Idaho made in his remarks. Overproduction \ndrives down the prices that farmers receive for their milk. When there \nis overproduction, the Government will step in and purchase surplus \ndairy products in the form of cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk.\n  We simply have not had the time to digest properly the dramatic new \nproposal and to make sure we know the implications of this new proposed \nscheme.\n  I do believe a market-oriented policy that includes a minimum dairy \nprice support program and the Federal milk marketing orders is the \nbasic approach we need for national dairy policy.\n  These are the programs that are currently in place. This amendment \nwould simply ensure that these programs continue. I appreciate the \nefforts of the proponents of the new program to develop a national \npolicy that benefits dairy farmers everywhere. I do not believe that \nwhat we have before us does that. I believe we should work toward a \nbalanced national dairy policy that is fair to all farmers, not one \nthat pits one State against another or one region against others. We \nneed a policy that is fair to consumers and processors and promotes a \nmarket-oriented dairy policy, not a scheme that could dramatically \naffect milk prices and add new layers of Government regulation and \ncontrol.\n  I want to continue working with Senator Harkin, Senator Lugar, and \nother interested Senators to ensure we end up with a dairy policy that \nis good for all regions of the country, and I am pleased to support the \namendment Senator Crapo is offering.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National Milk \nProducers Federation in support of Senator Crapo's amendment be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                           National Milk Producers Federation,\n\n                                 Arlington, VA, December 11, 2001.\n       Dear Senator:\n\n                    We're Sticking to Our Principles\n\n       The National Milk Producers Federation has represented the \n     interests of America's dairy farmers for 85 years, and is the \n     only national policy voice for U.S. milk producers.\n       During the past two years, through a meticulous, inclusive \n     grassroots outreach process involving dairy farmers across \n     the country, we have developed a set of policy principles to \n     help our members work with Congress in the preparation of the \n     next Farm Bill. From these national ``Principles of \n     Agreement,'' we developed a set of dairy-specific programs \n     which have consistently guided our recommendations concerning \n     the Farm Bill.\n       S. 1731 contains many of the programs that our members have \n     identified as being important to them. These programs are \n     national in scope and favorably impact dairy farmers in all \n     regions of the country. They include:\n       Extending the Price Support Program;\n       Requiring importers to pay their fair share into National \n     Dairy Promotion and Research Programs, as well as removing \n     the sunset provision for the National Fluid Milk Promotion \n     Program;\n       Extending the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP).\n       Fixing the statutory mandatory inventory and price \n     reporting language to prevent further costly reporting errors \n     by the USDA, and;\n       Supporting increased Market Access Promotion (MAP) program \n     funds.\n       These same provisions are also contained in the House \n     version of the Farm Bill, and therefore we urge you to \n     support their inclusion in the final version S. 1731.\n       It is our understanding that S. 1731 will also contain \n     additional monies for dairy farmers beyond the House version. \n     NMPF supports the authorization of added money as long as \n     those funds are equitably allocated, and do not disrupt the \n     orderly marketing of milk throughout the country. Since \n     ``equitable'' is a relative term, NMPF has established the \n     following principles to help assess whether a new dairy \n     program meets that definition:\n       It must be national in scope.\n       It must not discriminate between states and regions.\n       It must not discriminate between farmers by limiting \n     payments based on herd size.\n       It must not cause competitive disadvantages for advantages \n     between dairy farmers.\n       It should not increase production to the point where \n     overproduction eventually erodes the farm gate prices.\n       As you begin your debate on S. 1731, we urge you to apply \n     these same principles that our dairy farmers are using in \n     considering new programs. Otherwise, we fear that the \n     additional money may do more harm than good.\n       We're sticking to our principles and we urge you to do the \n     same!\n           Yours truly,\n                                                      Jerry Kozak,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, that letter makes some very strong \npoints. The title of the letter is ``We're Sticking to Our \nPrinciples.'' It says the National Milk Producers Federation \nestablished the following principles to help assess whether a new dairy \nprogram meets that definition:\n  No. 1, it must be national.\n  No. 2, it must not discriminate between States and regions.\n  No. 3, it must not discriminate between farmers by limiting payments \nbased on herd size.\n  No. 4, it must not cause competitive disadvantages or advantages \nbetween dairy farmers.\n  And No. 5, it should not increase production to the point where \noverproduction eventually erodes the farm gate prices.\n  On that basis they believe the amendment offered by Senator Crapo is \nthe proper course. I urge that course of action on my colleagues.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                        ESTIMATED FEDERAL PAYMENT PER

2002-2005.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are going to move to a vote very \nshortly, and I will be moving to table the Crapo amendment. I am \nconstrained to say I am a little, I guess--maybe I do not understand \nwhere my friend from New Mexico is coming from on this amendment.\n  Dairy is important. It is the second largest commodity produced in \nthis country at a value of $23 billion, second only to beef. It is \nunique among all commodities because it is highly perishable. You \ncannot store it for long. A dairy farmer has to market it every day, \nregardless of the price. We have had a price support program for dairy \nover 50 years. Since 1949, we have had a price support program.\n  We have had market loss payments in each of the last 3 or 4 years for \ndairy. Every year we come in and we pass a market loss payment. On \nthree occasions we have done that.\n  I would say to my friend from New Mexico and others, we made these \nmarket loss payments that went out nationwide. The last market loss \npayment that went out went to about 225 cows. That was it. We have put \n$2 billion more into this bill for dairy farmers all over the country. \nWe took $500 million for the Northeast, everything west of Maryland, \nDelaware, northeast, to help them transition from the compact they \nhave. They need that. Then we took the other $1.5 billion and we spread \nit around the country.\n  In working this out, in trying to make a balance between the smaller \ndairy farmers of Wisconsin and Michigan and Minnesota and places such \nas that, and the larger dairy farms in New Mexico and California and \nIdaho, places such as that, where they have these huge dairy herds of \n10,000 cows, we tried to reach some level of balance. So if the market \nloss payments of the last 3 years were to 225 cows, we said, Where \ncould we limit it? We went to 450 cows. We doubled, in this bill, the \npayments to dairy farmers on the cap from what it was last year--\ndoubled it. That means the larger dairy farmers will get more.\n  Since we are working with a fixed pot of money, $1.5 billion, the \nmore they get, the less someone else gets. So we had to reach some kind \nof balance. Obviously, if we had no caps at all, these large dairy \nfarms in the West would get all the money and the dairy farmers in \nMichigan and Minnesota and Iowa and Wisconsin would get precious \nlittle. So we had to reach some balance.\n  Regarding the 450-cow limit we put in, I tell you a lot of Senators \nfrom the Midwest swallowed hard on it. They think it should be 225, \nwhere it was last year. We tried to make this balanced, so we raised \nthe cap to 8 million pounds annual production, which I think is fair. \nIt is equitable. I think it addresses needs all over the country.\n  Last, I do not understand what the Senator was saying in terms of New \nMexico being last in the Nation. Frankly, New Mexico, I think, was \ngoing to get, in the next 3 years, $10.1 million in payments. As I look \ndown the list of States, that is about right in the middle for the \nUnited States in terms of total payments. It is right in the middle of \nall the States.\n  California, I would point out, gets $143 million; New York gets $178 \nmillion; Pennsylvania gets $181 million; Wisconsin, $293 million. These \nare the big milk producing States and they get the most money. I \nunderstand that. But New Mexico is about right in the middle of all the \nStates so I don't understand what he meant about it being last. It \ncertainly is not in terms of the amount of money going to the \nindividual States.\n\n  If there is no other debate, I was going to say to my friend from \nIdaho that I am prepared to move to table.\n  Mr. CRAPO. If the Senator will yield, I am aware of at least one \nother Senator who is trying to come to the floor who wants to say \nsomething. May we wait for a few minutes to see if he arrives?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to commend the Senate for bringing \nthe farm bill to the floor today. For my State of Montana, there is no \none single issue that is more important than to get the farm bill \npassed this year, particularly a farm bill that makes sense and helps \naddress the issues that our producers are facing.\n  Producers have faced drought for a couple of years. I must say, if we \ndo not get relief in a farm bill passed this year, it is truly a fact, \nI question whether some farmers are going to be able to hang on. It is \nthat important.\n  I think the farm bill we passed out of the committee is a good bill. \nIt is not a great bill, but it is a good step, a good step in the right \ndirection. I am pleased we will now have the opportunity to continue \nour negotiations in the Senate Chamber to make the bill as \ncomprehensive and as strong as possible.\n  We need to support our Nation's agriculture, that is clear--our \nfarmers and our ranchers. Other countries support their farmers and \ntheir ranchers, agriculture in their country, I might add, more \nstrongly than we do in ours, and I might add that is not right.\n  We have an obligation to help people fend for themselves--those who \ndepend upon the weather and who depend upon the market to do a lot \nbetter job. We cannot wait until the current program expires next year. \nWe rely upon producers for our food. We have the lowest food prices in \nthe world. We have the most efficient producers in the world. They are \nnow relying upon us for survival.\n  Our agricultural producers are in as tough shape as I have ever seen. \nYears of very low prices and extreme drought have made it nearly \nimpossible for farmers and ranchers to break even. Some areas in my \nState of Montana are experiencing their sixth year of drought.\n  This summer, I traveled across the high line--the northern part of \nour State--where a lot of grain is produced. I was astounded, saddened, \nand stunned. I was just sick at seeing the land in such poor shape. \nSome of the grain has barely come up. Most of it is just dust for miles \nand miles. There is no crop because there is no moisture. It is \ndevastating. In about a square 2,000 miles of cropland there is \nnothing. We have strip farming in Montana because we haven't had a lot \nof moisture year after year but drought. A large portion of my State is \nas bad as I have seen it. It is worse, in my judgment, than the drought \nback in 1988 which was extremely severe. For about 2,000 square miles \nof central Montana, I hardly saw a combine.\n  Low prices and drought is disastrous not only to producers but \nsurrounding communities. When producers are hurting, obviously the \ncommunities are\n\n[[Page S12840]]\n\nhurting. Farmers can't buy seed, fertilizer, and machinery, not to \nmention that they don't have much for clothes or for shoes. The whole \neconomy suffers as well as farmers. The list goes on.\n  Agriculture is the No. 1 industry in my State. It has been for years. \nIt is today. We are an agricultural State. When agriculture suffers, \nthe entire State suffers. When agriculture suffers in America, the \nentire country suffers.\n  Often, agriculture leads to recession before other parts of the \neconomy. Often agriculture tends to lead us out of recession. As we \nknow, when the country is in recession and agriculture is also in \nrecession, there is no way in the world one can say agriculture is \nleading our country out of recession. That is because they are in such \nbad shape.\n  Lenders and bankers in my State are cutting back. They are not \ngranting that working capital to the farmer and to the rancher the way \nthey were before. They are cutting back. Why? Because of the position \nof farmers.\n  The troubled agricultural economy not only affects our Nation but it \nalso threatens relationships we have with other countries.\n  A strong domestic agricultural policy is the only way we are going to \nget a level playing field with our trading partners. We are at a \ndisadvantage.\n  Eighty-some percent of the world's agricultural export subsidies are \npaid by the European Union. How are we going to get leverage to get \nthose agricultural subsidies down so we have a level playing field? We \ncannot, unless we have leverage. The only leverage I know of is a very \nstrong domestic agricultural policy where farmers are really strong. In \nfact, I think that is barely enough and is probably not enough if we \nare going to get the job done to get other countries to lower their \nagricultural export subsidies.\n  Clearly, if we don't pass this bill, and if our farmers are in a \nweakened position, that makes it even harder in world trade talks to \nget other countries to lower their export subsidies which very directly \nhurts American farmers.\n  The time has come to pass this bill, pass the changes in Freedom to \nFarm, which really turned out to be ``freedom to fail.'' Farmers at \nthat time when those laws were enacted were gambling. They had an idea \nFreedom to Farm would work pretty well the first few years, but not \nafter a few years later. We are here a few years later. It is not \nworking. Farmers are in difficult shape.\n  We need a bill that is a commonsense bill, one that is right for \nMontana, and that is right for America. We need to work together to get \nthis done now because that is the least we can do for our farmers. Our \nfarmers want some help. We should give them the help they need because \nthey have been doing so much for us and so much for the world with the \nfood they are supplying.\n  Let us get to work and pass a strong, stable, comprehensive farm bill \nthis year.\n\n\n             Holding the California Dairy Industry Harmless\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee for working with me to find a way that the \nCalifornia dairy industry can be held harmless by the dairy provisions \nin the farm bill.\n  California is the largest dairy State in the Nation. Last year, \nCalifornia dairy farmers produced 32.2 billion pounds of milk--over 19 \npercent of the Nation's supply. With over 2,100 dairy farms in the \nState, California leads the Nation in total number of milk cows at \napproximately 1.5 million.\n  I spoke on the floor last week about how devastating the original \nfarm bill would have been to the California dairy industry. And I have \nsaid California cannot be left out of any dairy equation. The original \nbill would have cost California dairy farmers $1.5 billion over 9 years \nand driven up prices for consumers by $1.5 billion over 9 years. I \nthank the Chairman for recognizing how much better California fares \nunder this substitute versus the original proposal. I am delighted that \nhe has agreed to see to it that California can be held harmless.\n  Under the compromise in this bill, and according to an analysis by \nthe University of Missouri's Food and Agricultural Policy Research \nInstitute, California dairymen will receive a net benefit $143.1 \nmillion in payments until the end of fiscal year 2005. This means \nCalifornia dairy farmers will receive $78.1 million in fiscal year \n2002, $70.7 million in fiscal year 2003, and $19.4 million in fiscal \nyear 2004. If these numbers are not accurate projections for \nCalifornia, it is my understanding that the dairy provisions will be \nworked out in conference so that California is ultimately not adversely \nimpacted by the dairy provisions in this bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator very much for working with me and \nother Senators on this. It is not the intention of this bill to put \nCalifornia dairy farmers at a disadvantage. We will work to ensure the \nCalifornia dairy industry will be held harmless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I rise in opposition to the milk pricing mechanism, the last one we \nhave seen. It is very hard to analyze because we have had four since we \nstarted. I wish I could be more precise and specific about the latest. \nBut I want to just talk generally.\n  I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of Mr. Crapo's amendment which would \neliminate all elements of a National Dairy Plan.\n  The amendment I support today would continue the $9.90/cwt. price \nsupport, which the New Mexico dairy interests strongly support. This is \nthe third or fourth proposal we have seen with regard to dairy policy \nand it still caters to the Northeast at the expense of the other \nstates. This most recent proposal resembles an expanded Northeast Dairy \nCompact. It is expanded to include Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New \nYork, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia which were not originally in the \nnortheast Compact.\n  Under this recent proposal, marketing assistance loans apply to every \nproducer except those in ``Participating States,'' which are \nConnecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, \nNew Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West \nVirginia. The 12 States in the Northeast reap greater benefits than the \nother 38 dairy States. If we compare the numbers using today's payment \nrates, the Northeast States would get about 70 cents per hundredweight. \nCompare this to other States, such as New Mexico, which would receive \nonly 40 to 60 cents per hundredweight.\n  Under this national plan as the rolling average decreases each year, \nthe payments to producers decrease by about one-third. Yet under the \nsame plan, payments to the northeast group stay the same. This is \nbecause there is a $16.94 target price built into the plan. It is time \nthat the Senate understands that when it comes to setting dairy policy, \nit is not just Vermont versus the Upper Midwest. The West, including \nNew Mexico, should have just as much to say about dairy policy.\n  New Mexico is currently the fifth largest diary State. Yet, under \nthis new plan, estimates show New Mexico coming in dead last on \npayments. Policies that penalize the new and efficient while providing \nwelfare to the inefficient are unacceptable. These are the types of \npolicies that are being contemplated in the original Ag Committee bill. \nAdditionally, policies intended to retard and reverse the growth of \ndairying in larger producing States such as New Mexico are also \nunacceptable.\n  We need to be setting sound policies that foster competition and the \nproduction of a good healthy product, not policies that are regionally \ndivisive--pitting small-farm States against large-farm States--for \nexample, West versus the East. Additionally, we should not be setting \npolicies that punish consumers with higher prices for fluid milk. \nDecreased milk consumption is not helpful to any producer.\n  My colleague, Senator Crapo, has done such a wonderful job in \nmanaging the opposition to this price fixing approach. He received a \nletter from the Secretary of Agriculture. It was gracious of him to ask \nme to put it in the Record. I will read one part of it, wherein the \nSecretary of Agriculture says:\n\n       Consumers will pay billions in additional costs. By raising \n     prices, S. 1731 will also further exacerbate dairy \n     overproduction. The Federal Government currently owns about\n\n[[Page S12841]]\n\n     600 million pounds of non-fat dry milk--nearly a year's \n     supply. The bill's effect of increased supply and reduced \n     demand will create an even more enormous surplus that would \n     adversely impact dairy farmers for many years to come.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter which includes that paragraph \nfrom the Secretary of Agriculture to Senator Crapo be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 The Secretary of Agriculture,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2001.\n     Hon. Michael Crapo,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Crapo: We would like to commend the very \n     constructive amendment you and Senator Bingaman are offering \n     to the dairy title of S. 1731, the ``Agriculture, \n     Conservation and Rural Enhancement Act of 2001''.\n       As you know, the Administration is strongly opposed to the \n     dairy program proposed in S. 1731 as reported out of \n     Committee. It will raise the cost of milk by 10-15 percent. \n     In effect, this provision imposes a tax on each gallon of \n     milk, which disproportionately impacts low and moderate-\n     income American families. Consumers will pay billions in \n     additional costs. By raising prices, S. 1731 will also \n     further exacerbate dairy overproduction. The Federal \n     government currently owns more than 600 million pounds of \n     non-fat dry milk--nearly a year's supply. The bill's effect \n     of increased supply and reduced demand will create an even \n     more enormous surplus that would adversely impact dairy \n     farmers for many years to come.\n       Your amendment to strike this section and provide for a \n     study is consistent with the Administration's Statement of \n     Administration Policy on S. 1731. We support forward-looking \n     farm legislation that facilitates the long-term prosperity of \n     our Nation's farmers and ranchers, promotes effective \n     conservation efforts, and strengthens the nutrition safety \n     net.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Ann M. Veneman.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Crapo, a junior Member \nof the Senate. He is on the Agriculture Committee, and he is growing \nhis way up from near the bottom in seniority. Today and yesterday, he \nhas shown that he has a very good understanding of dairy and dairy \nprices in the United States.\n  I am very proud that he came to the floor and repeated his view of \nthe remarks which Senator Bingaman of my State made.\n  I know if we were to ask the Senate to answer a quiz about dairy and \nmilk production in America, they would never come close to an answer \nthat said the State of New Mexico is the fifth largest producer of milk \nin America. Nobody would really think that because we don't look like a \nState that should produce a lot of milk. We are very dry. We are not a \ngiant agricultural State. But what we have is a large group of dairy \nfarmers who have moved to New Mexico with their families, and they have \nbecome very modern, entrepreneurial, and technologically ahead of the \ngame in production of milk in the United States.\n  It is just an absolute joy to go see one of these dairy farms with \n2,000 cows. It is unheard of in the parts of America where we are going \nto protect dairy and milk production with subsidies. We have many that \nhave 1,000 head and many with 750 head. On average, we exceed 1,000 \nhead per dairy farm. They produce large quantities of milk. In fact, \nyear before last, the largest producing cow in America in terms of \nweight of milk was from the great State of New Mexico, which again \ncauses people to wonder what are we doing right in New Mexico.\n  We have great competitive farmers. They are doing the right thing by \nway of matching entrepreneurial spirit, capitalism, and the production \nof dairy milk and milk-related products for America.\n  I think our national goal would be not to make it difficult or more \ndifficult for that to happen as it is beginning to happen in the State \nof Idaho. We ought to encourage that. After all, what do we want? We \nwant the cheapest price of solid, safe milk and related products coming \nfrom American dairy farmers for our children and for our families. We \nwant a constant supply coming from competitive producers and marketers \nof milk.\n  Clearly, whether or not one understands the intimate details of the \nlatest, the fourth amendment regarding dairy and milk production in \nAmerica, it is clear that there is no intention to make it easier for \nthose who are producing at competitive prices such as New Mexico and \nother States. If anything, there is a calculated effort to make their \nlives more difficult and to make the potential for them to grow and \nprosper less rather than more.\n  I can see where we ought to help one State versus another State if we \nhave some really difficult problems on which they must have assistance. \nBut just how much longer do we have to try to paint this picture, and \nthen implement it, of trying to help one piece of America because they \nare having difficulty being competitive in the production of milk?\n  This has been going on for a long time. It is time that it end, not \nthat it continue. It is time that that kind of allocation of American \nresources be on some kind of a slide that is going downward, not one \nthat is going up, up, and away.\n  This year, the money that will be circulating around will exceed $2 \nbillion, that will move from here to there and elsewhere in order to \nmake one region, that obviously wants to continue producing milk but \nwould have a difficult time competing, more assured of making money \nthrough the production of milk.\n  So I came to this Chamber to urge, when we vote in the Senate today, \nthat we decide we are not going to pursue this policy any longer, that \nwe are going to move in the opposite direction. If there is going to be \na motion to table, which I think there is, I say to Senator Crapo, I \nhope Senators will not vote to table and will leave this issue before \nus so we can have a vote on it.\n  I believe eventually an agriculture bill that has this provision in \nit--that is the latest, the fourth iteration of the amendment in the \nlast few hours--if that is going to be in the bill, I think it is going \nto be difficult to pass this bill, get it through both Houses, and \nsigned by the President. In fact, I do not see how that is possible.\n  So I am glad to be on what will ultimately be the right side. In the \nmeantime, I yield the floor and wish the best for Americans in the \nfuture in terms of being able to supply plenty of milk to them at the \nmost reasonable prices, coming from a competitive milk industry in the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, to get to the point where we can vote, I \nask unanimous consent the Senator from Louisiana be recognized for 2 \nminutes, the Senator from Idaho, the proponent of the amendment, be \nrecognized for 2 minutes, and then I be recognized for a motion to \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, with all due respect, I rise to oppose \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Idaho and urge my colleagues \nto table this particular amendment.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the committee, the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Harkin, for his hard work. It is not easy to put together any major \npiece of legislation, let alone, as I have learned in my few years in \nthe Senate, legislation regarding agriculture because, in different \nways, all of our States participate in the infrastructure of \nagriculture, some of us more as producers but all of us as consumers. \nWeighing those interests between the consumers, the producers, and the \nprocessors, and all the international trade implications is quite \ncomplicated. So I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \nextraordinary work in trying to put a bill together to which we can \ngenerally agree.\n  Representing the South and Louisiana, and speaking for the dairy \nfarmers, let me say that when the original bill came out, it did not \nwork for southern dairy farmers. The national pooling concept was \nreally not very fair to many regions, including the dairy farmers in \nLouisiana. And we have been suffering. We have lost over 25 percent of \nour farms. If we do not do something, we are going to lose even more.\n  It is not right to not address this issue. So we proposed a compact--\nthe same as the Northeast has--for the South that would have worked \nbeautifully. But, unfortunately, there were\n\n[[Page S12842]]\n\nother regions of the country where that did not work. So we came up \nwith yet another compromise.\n  In the underlying bill that we are considering, the Harkin-Lugar \nproposal, this compromise shows itself, and it is a countercyclical \nplan for dairy that will resemble the way we do countercyclical plans \nand proposals for other commodities that will work well for the \nmajority of our dairy-producing States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more \nseconds to wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Some of us have large dairy farms. Some of us have \nsmall and medium-sized dairy farms. I suggest that the proposal in the \nHarkin bill is one that benefits most of us most of the time, and I \nurge my colleagues to table the Crapo-Bingaman amendment. I support the \ncommittee compromise.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, today what we are being asked to do is \nadopt a massive new subsidy program in the dairy industry in the United \nStates that will distort the price of milk, promote overproduction, and \neventually cause dynamics in the economics of the dairy industry that \nwill work to the detriment of dairy farmers nationwide.\n  I encourage everyone who comes to vote in a few minutes, when the \nvote will be called, to support the effort to strike section 132 from \nthe farm bill and to oppose the motion to table.\n  I conclude by simply reading from correspondence we have received \nfrom the National Milk Producers Federation, which has already been \nmade a part of the Record by the Senator from New Mexico. It clearly \nstates what this entire debate is about.\n  They said they have established the following principles to help \nassess whether a new dairy program meets the needs of the dairy \ncommunity in America and of the economy that we want to promote in the \nUnited States.\n  They state the program ``must be national in scope. It must not \ndiscriminate between States and regions. It must not discriminate \nbetween farmers by limiting payments based on herd size. It must not \ncause competitive disadvantages or advantages between dairy farmers. It \nshould not increase production [in America] to the point where \noverproduction eventually erodes the farm gate prices.''\n  The provisions currently in the farm bill do not meet any of those \nobjectives. The current provisions in the farm bill, in fact, create a \nmanaged economy for the dairy industry, establishing a floor price \nwhich is far above the market price in one region of the country, which \nwill increase overproduction and promote a new subsidy program that \nbenefits that region of the country much more than other regions of the \ncountry, to the detriment of farms in the other parts of the country. \nIt is unfair to dairy producers nationwide. It is unfair to the \nconsumers. We should strike these provisions from the farm bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I move to table the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Idaho, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is we are in a period of \ngeneral debate with no amendments to be offered. I wish to make a \ncouple comments at this point that relate to some things that have been \nsaid during the debate on this farm bill.\n  First of all, I am pleased we are at this point. Many of us have \nstruggled hard to make sure we get a farm bill on the floor of the \nSenate. We are here and we will have a good debate. My hope is we will \nbe able to have some amendments offered and deal with those amendments. \nWe have just had one amendment with a very close vote. I would like, \nvery much, to see us finish this bill by at least tomorrow evening or \nthe next evening and have a conference with the House of \nRepresentatives. I hope our goal might be to put a bill on the \nPresident's desk for signature before this Congress leaves for the \nyear.\n  I know that is the goal of the Republican chairman of the House \nAgriculture Committee. He produced a bill in the House. He said very \nmuch that he wants to get to conference with us. So this would be a \nbipartisan effort with Chairman Combest in the House and those of us \nwho wish to finish a farm bill this year in the Senate.\n  My hope is we can move forward very quickly. We should consider \namendments, and have significant debate on amendments, but it will \nserve this country's best interests, and certainly the interests of \nfarm families in America, if we produce a good farm bill.\n  Why are we here? We are here because we have a farm bill that does \nnot work.\n  Freedom to Farm, which is now existing law, just doesn't work. Almost \nall of us concede this point. It is not unanimous, but it is about as \nclose to unanimous as you can get on public\n\n[[Page S12843]]\n\npolicy. There are still a couple of discordant voices who will insist \nthat Freedom to Farm does work. For the last 4 years, we have had to do \nemergency bills at the end of the year to try to deal with the \nshortfall in farm revenue because commodity prices have collapsed and \ncollapsed dramatically. If we didn't do something to respond to that, \nwe would not have family farmers left.\n  I suppose that requires answering the question: Does it matter \nwhether we have family farmers? Some would say it doesn't matter who \nfarms the land. But, that is kind of an antiseptic view of the culture \nwe live in. They would say the organization of our food production is \nreally pretty irrelevant. We could have the largest corporate \nagrifactories farming America from California to Maine. They would just \ndrive a tractor one way all day and then back the next day. They would \njust plow furrows and plant seeds, and giant agrifactories will \ncertainly produce food. That is true. But as they produce that food, \nsomething else will be dying; that is a part of American culture that \nis very important to our country.\n  The seed bed of family values has always moved from our family farms \nto our small towns to our big cities and nourished and refreshed \nAmerica. That has always been the case. It is not only important for \nsocial and economic reasons, it is important for security reasons to \nmaintain a network of family farms. Europe has done that. Europe has \nbeen hungry in the past, and it decided: We will not be hungry again. \nWe will not rely on some huge mammoth operation. We will have a network \nof family farms dotting the landscape of rural Europe. And they do. \nThey have price supports. That is the kind of economy they want. Those \nare the kinds of food producers they want--a broad dispersed network of \nproducers, families living on the land.\n  Small towns in Europe are radically different than small towns in \nthis country these days. In most of Europe, small towns are thriving \nand growing and alive and have a heartbeat. In this country, across so \nmuch of our heartland, small towns are shrinking. They are shrinking \ninevitably.\n  My home county in my hometown is exactly the mirror of what is \nhappening in so much of our country, going from 5,000 people to 3,000 \npeople in 25 years. Maybe it doesn't matter to some. Does it matter in \npublic policy? I believe it does. We ought to have a farm plan that \nreflects decent price supports, reasonable price supports, that gives \nfamily farms an opportunity to make a living during tough times. That \nis what this is about.\n  The legislation brought to us by the Senate Agriculture Committee is \ngood legislation. It is certainly not perfect. I intend to offer an \namendment as soon as I have the opportunity that will further target \nsome of the benefits so that we don't give an amount of benefits that \nare inappropriate to the largest producers in this country which has \nhappened in the past. I hope we can prevent that from happening now. I \ndo intend to offer an amendment. I suspect others will as well.\n  My goal is that we aggressively debate the amendments, call for a \nvote, and then try to see if we can't finish the bill and get to a \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  It is interesting that the Department of Agriculture was created in \nthe 1860s by Abraham Lincoln. When the Department of Agriculture was \ncreated, they had nine employees in the early 1860s. It is now a \nbehemoth organization. My belief about the Department of Agriculture \nis, no matter who is in charge of the administration, Republican or \nDemocrat, we don't need a department if the end goal is not to support \nthis statement: It is our goal to foster and maintain a network of \nfamily-based food producers in this country.\n\n  If that is not the goal of our agricultural policy, we don't need a \nU.S. Department of Agriculture; just let happen whatever happens. But \nif you believe, as the Europeans do and I do and others, that the \neconomy that you will get is the economy that you want and that you \nconstruct instead of just letting something happen, you can have an \neconomy that fosters and maintains a network of family producers.\n  Our family farmers produce more than just food. They produce \ncommunities. They produce a value system that is important. Each farm \nout there that lives under a yard life, trying to raise a family, \nrepresents a blood vessel that flows into a network of vessels that \ncreates communities and a rural lifestyle. That is very important.\n  It is not the case that family farming is somehow irrelevant these \ndays. It is not the case that food production is irrelevant. A \nsubstantial portion of the people in this world go to bed hungry \nbecause they don't have enough to eat. I am told that 500 million \npeople in this world go to bed every night with a powerful ache in \ntheir belly because it hurts to be hungry. Yet in my home State and \nmany others, our farmers are hauling freight to the elevator only to be \ntold that the food they produce in such abundance has no value. There \nis a powerful disconnection there.\n  If you take a look at producers, family farm producers, and what \nhappens to the grain they produce, you discover it is not that there is \nnot value to it. It is the question of who is able to get the proceeds \nfrom that value.\n  If you have a kernel of wheat and the farmer hauls it to the \nelevator, the grain trade says, this wheat doesn't have any value, what \nyou have produced is pretty irrelevant to the world; then someone buys \nthat wheat and puts it into a grocery manufacturing plant, a cereal \nplant; they puff it up and that kernel of wheat is now puffed wheat. It \nis put into some cellophane, put in a box, and sent through to a \ngrocery store somewhere. And that little box is going to sell for $4.50 \nfor a box of puffed wheat.\n  Who made the money? The person that bought the tractor, bought the \nseed, bought the fuel, bought the fertilizer, spent the nights and days \nplanting and then hoping and then harvesting? Did that family farmer \nmake the money? No, it was the manufacturing plant that puffed it and \nput it in a box and sold it as breakfast cereal. They made the money. \nFor the farmer, that food dollar has been shrinking and shrinking. We \nhave fewer and fewer family farmers and more expensive grocery cereals \nand more people hungry overseas.\n  Somehow this is a puzzle the pieces of which don't fit. We need to \nmake sense of it in the Senate with a farm bill that recognizes the \nvalue and the worth of families that produce America's food and produce \nfood for a hungry world.\n  I have been places in the world where people were hungry. I have \nleaned over the crib in a neonatal clinic of a terribly poor country \nand had a young child who was starving reach up to me because I was the \nonly one that young child had. I was only going to be there a couple of \nminutes. The doctor said to me: That child is going to die. I have been \nto refugee camps and hospitals in the worst parts of the world. I have \nseen hunger. I have seen death.\n  It needn't happen in this world that the winds of hunger blow every \nday and 45,000 children die. It needn't happen if we decide that we are \ngoing to use what we produce in such great abundance to help produce a \nmore stable world. We send weapons around the world. We are the arms \nmerchant to the world. We send more weapons than any other country \nunder any other circumstance year after year.\n  Somehow that which the world needs most, food, we are not able to \nconnect very well to meet the needs of the world and the needs of those \nwho produce it here at home.\n  My hope is that we can decide with this farm bill that family farmers \nmatter, families who struggle to make a living matter, and we are going \nto do something to help them when grain prices collapse.\n  There may well be others who want to speak. I will not go on except \nto say this: My family came to the prairies of Hettinger County, ND, \nmany years ago. Many years ago, a Norwegian immigrant, recently widowed \nwith six children, decided to move to the prairies of western North \nDakota, pitch a tent and build a house and start a farm. One can only \nbegin to think of the courage it took for a widow who just lost her \nhusband to a heart attack, who had come over from Norway to decide to \nget on a train with her children and go homestead, with the promise of \nthe Federal Government saying if you go and improve that land and you \nbuild a farm on that land and do the things that are necessary, we will \ngive you the 160 acres. That was the homestead plan.\n\n[[Page S12844]]\n\n  That woman, named Caroline, did that and she had a son who had a \ndaughter who had me. That is how I was born in southwestern North \nDakota. But I will bet that many, many serving in this Chamber have \nexactly the same stories of their heritage--people who decided they \nwanted to stake their dream and their hope on trying to raise food from \na family farm and raise a family on a family farm, be independent, and \ndo the things they wanted to do to make that soil produce bountiful \nfood supplies.\n  Now, what we have seen in recent years is so many broken dreams and \nso many families deciding that which they have invested their life \nsavings to do is now gone and they can't continue. We can do better \nthan that as a country. That is what this debate is about. Some say it \nis about this amount of money--no, it is not about that. It is about \nwhether this country wants family farmers in its future. Does it \nbelieve the production of its food supply ought to be done by families? \nDoes that contribute to this country and promote security and \nstrengthen this country? I think it does. People look at family farms \nand say they are like the old diners who came and went. It is nice to \nthink of it, but it is really not part of tomorrow's economy. They are \nwrong.\n  Family farming is not out of favor. It is an important part of what \nthis country is and what it can be in the future. That is why we have \nto pass this farm bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I inquire about the parliamentary \nsituation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is time for debate until the hour of \n4:30. All time remaining is under the control of the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So there is no time on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes at this \ntime. I don't want to use up the Senator's time.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I respond by saying I am pleased to yield time to the \nSenator. The allocation by the majority leader was equal time between \nthe time he made the motion and 4:30. That is why we are in this \nparticular situation. The previous speaker consumed the first half of \nthe time. I will be recognized at 4:30 to offer an amendment, which I \nplan to do. I am pleased to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator for his courtesy. Once again, the \nSenator from Indiana demonstrates his generosity of spirit and the \nreason why he is held in high esteem by everyone. I thank him for his \ncourtesy.\n  We have talked about why we are discussing a farm bill now, why it is \ncritically important. I believe it is critically important because of \nthe economic conditions we confront. We are faced with a circumstance \nin which the farm families I represent in the State of North Dakota are \nfacing some of the most difficult times they have ever confronted.\n  I think this chart says it very well. This green line shows the \nprices the farmers have paid for the inputs they use to produce goods, \nwhat happened to those prices from 1991 to 2000. You can see that the \nprices farmers are paying have gone up considerably in this period. On \nthe other hand, the red line shows the prices the farmers receive, and \nyou can see what happened there. Since the 1996 farm bill, that line is \nalmost straight down because prices have collapsed. That is the reality \nof what has happened in farm country. It is the reason why the new farm \nbill is so important to consider.\n  This shows the same pattern, just the prices that farmers have \nreceived for wheat. Again, we can see that the peak was at the time the \nlast farm bill was considered. Look at what has happened. Since that \ntime, since 1996, the red line shows the price of wheat over this \nperiod through and up until this moment. Wheat prices have absolutely \ncollapsed. This black line is the cost of production for wheat at $4.26 \na bushel. You can see we are at about $2.50. We are far below the cost \nof production. It is not just wheat, it is commodity after commodity.\n  One of the key reasons that agriculture in America is in crisis is \nbecause our major competitors are doing much more to support their \nproducers than we are doing to support ours. This chart shows what the \nEuropean Union is doing to support their farmers. This is support per \nacre. The red bar is what Europe is doing--$313 an acre of support. The \nblue bar on the chart represents what we are doing in the United \nStates, which is $38 an acre. So they are outsupporting their farmers \nby a huge margin. By the way, these are not Kent Conrad's numbers or \nthe Agriculture Committee's numbers; those are the numbers of the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the \ninternational scorekeepers. They are the recognized international \nscorekeepers. This tells the story. That is why it is so important we \npass a new farm bill and that we do more to support our producers. If \nwe want to level this playing field and we want our farmers not to be \nfacing a stacked deck, then we have to act and act now.\n\n  It doesn't end there because this chart shows what has happened with \nworld agricultural export subsidies. These are the most recent numbers \nworldwide. You can see that this pie chart represents all of the \nworld's agricultural export subsidies. The blue part of the pie is \nEurope. They account for nearly 84 percent of all the world's \nagricultural export subsidies. The United States shares this tiny red \npiece of the pie, 2.7 percent--not 27 percent but 2.7 percent--less \nthan 3 percent. So our friends in Europe are outsubsidizing us for \nexports by a factor of 28 to 1. It is no wonder there is hardship in \nAmerican agriculture, when we see the Europeans buying markets that \nhave traditionally been ours. They are going out and getting these \nmarkets the old-fashioned way. They are paying for them. Again, this is \nthe World Trade Organization's information. It demonstrates \nconclusively what we are up against and the need for this farm bill to \nstart to level the playing field.\n  There has been a lot of talk about the spending in this farm bill and \nthat it represents an increase. This is the baseline for agricultural \nspending, this red line. You can see the baseline is coming down \ndramatically and would continue to decline under current law. This farm \nbill does represent an increase over the baseline. You can see that the \ngreen line here represents the Senate farm bill. But you can see that, \nwhile it is higher than current farm policy, it also will be in steady \ndecline. Farm spending will take a smaller and smaller share of the \nFederal budget.\n  I might say, before we leave this chart, that while this is more \nmoney than current farm law provides, it is actually less money than \ncurrent farm law plus the economic disaster payments we have made in \neach of the last 4 years.\n  This chart shows how important Government payments have become to \nfarm income. If we look at each of these bars, the red part is \nGovernment payments as a part of overall farm income.\n  We can see back in 1992, farm income was just under $50 billion. In \n1993, it actually went down. In 1994, it was about the same. In 1995, \nthere was a big slip when prices were down. Then prices went up right \nat the time we wrote the last farm bill. Then we can see farm income \nstarted to decline, and decline quite markedly. As a result, Government \npayments increased as we passed in each of these 4 years economic \ndisaster assistance to keep the farm sector from imploding, to keep the \nfarm sector from mass bankruptcy.\n  We can see now what a big chunk of farm income is represented by \nGovernment payments. Again, that is the red part of each of these bars. \nEach of these bars represents net farm income, and we can see how \ncritically important Government payments have been, again, largely as a \nresult of what the Europeans are doing.\n  I believe we have arrived at the hour of 4:30 p.m. The agreement was \nwe would turn to an additional amendment, so I will yield the floor. \nAgain, I thank the Senator from Indiana, the ranking member of the \nAgriculture Committee, for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nremarks. He always makes an important\n\n[[Page S12845]]\n\ncontribution in the Agriculture Committee and, of course, now serves as \nchairman of our Budget Committee in the Senate and has made an \nadditional contribution because of the importance of that \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. President, before I offer my amendment, I ask for the yeas and \nnays on the pending substitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2473\n\n   (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute for the commodity and \n                           nutrition titles)\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2473.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the \nAgriculture Committee-passed farm bill and to the substitute that has \nbeen submitted. By adopting my amendment, the Federal safety net for \nlow-income Americans will be strengthened through improvements in the \nFederal nutrition programs and will create a more effective market-\noriented and broad-based safety net program for U.S. farmers and \nranchers. Therefore, my proposal amends the commodity title and the \nnutrition title of the bill.\n  Since joining the Senate Agriculture Committee, I have fought for \nFederal nutrition programs and worked closely with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to make improvements to those programs and to \nsafeguard their existing resources to improve the safety net for low-\nincome Americans and to support the goals of welfare reform.\n  The last time we looked at significant changes in the Federal \nnutrition programs was during welfare reform. Since that time, \nsignificant changes have occurred which require adaptations and \nimprovements in the program's policies and operations.\n  Over the course of the re-authorization process, we have been able to \nachieve remarkable consensus among the client advocates, the States, \nand the administration as to changes that should be made to Federal \nnutrition programs. This consensus was reflected in the nutrition title \nof S. 1571, the farm bill proposal which I introduced.\n  I am pleased that Chairman Harkin of the Agriculture Committee \nadopted a number of these proposals in the chairman's mark, and many \nare included as part of the committee-passed legislation. However, I \nbelieve strongly we can and should do more in the nutrition area, and \nthis amendment will accomplish just that.\n  The second part of my amendment reforms the safety net for U.S. \nfarmers and ranchers. The Senate Agriculture Committee and the House of \nRepresentatives have each passed legislation expanding dramatically \nU.S. farm program subsidies. The bills are not only costly, but each \nrepresents a wholesale retreat from the important reforms begun under \nthe last farm bill.\n  My amendment will expand the base of the agriculture safety net and \nwill institute much needed market-oriented reforms so the U.S. farm \npolicy will comport with economic reality.\n  Americans can take pride in the assistance programs created to \nprovide a strong nutrition safety net. The Food Stamp Program is the \nfoundation of this safety net, and its re-authorization warrants our \nthoughtful and serious attention.\n  In our post-welfare-reform environment, the Food Stamp Program is \nparticularly important. As families leave behind cash assistance for \nemployment, they typically encounter minimum wages and modest, if any, \nfringe benefits and often unstable jobs. In the year 2001, a family of \nfour with earnings equivalent to a full-time minimum wage job and the \nearned income tax credit needs food stamps just to reach the poverty \nline.\n  Dr. Ron Haskins, a key architect of welfare reform legislation, has \nstated:\n\n       There are millions of people who cannot earn enough to \n     support their families. Even more than in the past, the Food \n     Stamp Program has become a vital support to poor and low-\n     income mothers who work.\n\n  Thus, one of the important questions we must address is whether or \nnot the current Food Stamp Program effectively supports welfare reform \ngoals.\n  There appears to be a number of indicators that point to the need for \nadditional program changes. Some of these signals, such as the \nincreased proportion of recipients who hold jobs, are clearly desirable \nbut may suggest further steps to make the program more compatible with \nthis evolving caseload profile.\n\n  Other findings, such as the decline in the percentage of financially \neligible persons who participate, raise questions. Collectively, these \nshifts illustrate the need both to continue adapting and improving the \nFood Stamp Program.\n  As part of my farm bill proposal, I introduced a nutrition title \nembodying changes which would simplify food stamp rules for all \nstakeholders, increase State flexibility in administering the program, \nmake the quality control system less punitive, support personal \nresponsibility and work, and reduce the dependency of low-income \npersons on emergency food assistance.\n  This idea received public support from Michigan's Governor Engler \nwhen introduced, and the amendment which I offer today is intended to \nprovide a more complete meal to low-income families in need of \nnutrition assistance and to States seeking administrative flexibility \nand simplicity.\n  I served as chairman of the Agriculture Committee in 1995 and 1996 \nwhen the committee wrote both the farm bill and the food stamp \nprovisions of welfare reform. The committee faced a difficult budget \nreconciliation instruction for those years. The result was that \nspending on food stamps was significantly reduced.\n  For the years 1996 through 2001, the Congressional Budget Office \n(CBO) estimated that welfare reform would reduce food stamp spending by \nover $21 billion. Over that same time-frame, CBO estimated that farm \nprogram spending would be reduced by $2 billion due to the enactment of \nthe 1996 farm bill.\n  Thus, over 90 percent of the budget cuts enacted in 1995 and 1996 \npursuant to the Agriculture Committee's reconciliation instruction \noccurred in the Food Stamp Program. I make that point again because it \nis such a dramatic one. Reconciliation instructions came to our \ncommittee. We were compelled to act. The $23 billion of savings that \nwas required came, $2 billion from farm commodity programs and $21 \nbillion from food stamps.\n\n  As it turned out, CBO underestimated the effects of welfare reform on \nthe Food Stamp Program. For the years 1996 through 2001, food stamp \nspending declined by about $50 billion, not the $21 billion CBO \noriginally estimated or the $21 billion we anticipated as we responded \nto the reconciliation instruction. Around half of that reduction was \ndue to the changes in law made by welfare reform and an economy that \nwas stronger than CBO anticipated. The other half of the decline in \nfood stamp participation occurred among eligible families and was due \nlargely to the outdated restrictive nature of the current Food Stamp \nProgram administration. Thus, food stamps provided the vast bulk of the \nsavings needed in 1995 and 1996.\n  History has shown that the actual reductions were far bigger, in \nfact, dramatically larger than expected. Some of those reductions were \nreinstated in later bills. Specifically, about $2 billion has been \nrestored to the Food Stamp Program, but an additional $30 billion has \nbeen added in commodity support over the same period. Given that such a \nlarge proportion of budget savings came from the Food Stamp Program, it \nseems equitable that with substantial new agricultural resources all of \nthe legislation we are now considering, all the alternative bills \nproduced, a significant share of the new money should go to restoration \nof a sound Food Stamp Program. I am not proposing that 90 percent, or \neven a majority of the new funding apparently available to the \nAgriculture Committee, go to the Food Stamp Program. The committee-\nreported bill, however, devotes\n\n[[Page S12846]]\n\nonly 7.6 percent of its spending to nutrition. I am proposing to spend \n19.2 percent of these new resources for nutrition. It seems to me it is \nonly fair and right to vote a little less than one-fifth of the bill's \nnew resources to support Americans in poverty and to further the goals \nof welfare reform.\n  The nutrition title in my amendment spends $6.3 billion more in \nbudget authority over the next 10 years than the nutrition title in the \nfarm bill now before the Senate. Senator Harkin's title spends $5.6 \nbillion in budget authority over baseline; my amendment spends $11.9 \nbillion, an increase of $6.3 billion over the committee-passed bill.\n  I make it clear that the spending I am talking about goes to support \nthe goals of welfare reform in addition to the Food Stamp Program.\n  Collectively, my proposed nutrition policy serves to replace complex \nfood stamp rules with simpler ones, better integrate the food stamp, \nMedicaid, and cash assistance programs, offer many opportunities for \nState flexibility, and attempt to make the program more compatible with \nthe needs of working families.\n  The nutrition package is constructed to make sure the Food Stamp \nProgram promotes welfare reform objectives conveyed in the title of \nthat legislation.\n  First, responsibility and work opportunities: My proposal includes \nalmost twice as many provisions to simplify the Food Stamp Program. \nThey cover eligibility rules and procedures, income adjustments, and \nreporting requirements. Most of the differences between the two \ntitles--that is, the committee-passed bill and my proposal--occur in \nthe first two categories. My proposal excludes vehicles and \ndedicated retirement savings from the asset limit thus reflecting what \na household needs to assume personal responsibility today and in the \nfuture. Making these changes also simplifies application and \neligibility determination procedures by reducing the documentation \nhouseholds must provide and some of the fine distinctions case workers \nhave to apply now as to which assets are and are not excluded. The \nresult is a set of realistic and uniform asset policies across all \nStates.\n\n  Both titles--that is, the farm bill proposal of Senator Harkin and my \nproposal--create new opportunities for State flexibility and \ninnovation. My proposal offers substantially more. States have provided \nan additional discretion for using food stamp employment and training \nfunds, as well as additional dollars. The Lugar title also opens the \ndoor for States to test their own ideas on program simplification \nthrough changes to demonstration waiver rules on cost neutrality and by \nfunding a set of systematically evaluated projects. The outcomes of the \nstated initiative should provide the basis for continuing welfare \nreforms.\n  Finally, my nutrition title allows States to move beyond their \nsuccessful demonstration experience of integrating a food stamp \neligibility decision with an application for SSI benefits to more \nroutine implementation for the one-stop approach. The two nutrition \ntitles are similar to one another and to the House proposal for \nmodifying the food stamp quality control system. The proposed changes \nresult in targeting penalties to those States with repeated and \nexceptionally high levels of benefit payment error.\n  Our proposals differ, however, with respect to rewarding States for \nexceptionally good performance. The Lugar proposal introduces a large \nnumber and variety of performance standards that allow many states the \nopportunity to be meaningfully rewarded for outstanding operations and \nservice.\n  Other improvements to the Food Stamp Program are intended to reduce \ndependency on emergency food assistance. Both the Lugar and committee \nproposals selectively remove some of the restrictions on the \nparticipation of legal aliens and able-bodied adults in the Food Stamp \nProgram, as well as provide a modest benefit increase through a more \ngenerous standard reduction to family income.\n  The Lugar bill proposes reasonable periods of U.S. residence, 5 \nyears, or a history of 4 years at work. The proposal was carefully \ndesigned to balance our obligation to those who legally emigrate to \nthis country and subsequently face economic hardship against the \nconcern that assistance program policy should not be so generous as to \nprovide benefits immediately upon arrival, nor to create that \nexpectation.\n  Finally, both titles link the standard income deduction to the \npoverty line which results in indexing by family size and adjusting for \ninflation. Under either proposal, the absolute benefit gain per \nhousehold is modest. For example, after full phase in over 10 years, my \nproposal entitles a family of four to an additional $16 in benefits \neach month.\n  This increase is more generous than the committee proposal in terms \nof the amount of the change and the rate at which the increase occurs.\n  Many different organizations have sent letters of endorsement to both \nSenator Harkin and to myself. Public support includes the Food Research \nand Action Center, Second Harvest, the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Bishop's Council, \nFarmers Market Advocates, United Jewish Communities, the Quakers, the \nNational Council of La Raza, the National Governors Association, the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures, and the American Public \nHuman Services Association. These organizations acknowledge the \nimportant steps Chairman Harkin and the Agriculture Committee have \ntaken to build on the provisions of the House title. But these same \norganizations note that nutrition funds provided by the committee's \npackage provide the minimum budget necessary to make a difference. Many \nalso indicate their preference for both the proposed policies in, and \nthe funding for, my nutrition title ideas.\n\n  Individual groups identify specific but different provisions that \nthey view as critical to fully implementing welfare reform. With our \ncountry's wealth and agricultural bounty, there is no justification for \nanyone to experience hunger or even uncertainty about the next meal. \nThe Food Stamp Program continues to be fundamental in meeting the \nnutrition needs of low-income persons and families. It is particularly \nimportant now, as food stamp benefits help support families who leave \ncash assistance for entry-level jobs with uncertain futures and at the \nsame time provide a direct stimulus to the Nation's economy. It is also \nimportant that we listen to the States and to the Governors who have \nasked us to simplify this complex program.\n  That brings us to the second part of my amendment which is reforming \nthe safety net for U.S. farmers and ranchers. As we debate the farm \nbill, it is important to understand the shortcomings of current farm \npolicy. Virtually all agricultural subsidies go to producers of just \nfive program crops: corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton, and rice. As a \nresult, 60 percent, three-fifths, of all farms are excluded from \nFederal farm benefits. Agricultural subsidies have been distributed \naccording to acreage. This has resulted in the bulk of payments being \ndistributed, understandably, to large farming enterprises. In fact, 47 \npercent of all payments during 1996-2000 went to just 8 percent of \nfarmers, a very focused concentration for payments.\n  The cost of U.S. agricultural policy to taxpayers has been large and \nunpredictable, even as it has failed to alleviate the difficulties it \nis intended to address. Even with an overall net cash farm income for \nthis year of $61 billion, many producers, particularly small family \nfarms, struggle to survive. But that is paradise. Despite the rhetoric \nthat has been heard on occasion during our farm bill debate this year, \nthe facts are that we are enjoying--if that is the proper word--the \nhighest net cash farm income ever for any year in American \nagriculture--$61 billion. Even the often cited year of 1996 did not \nexceed that amount, and this year's farm income is substantially \ngreater than the years subsequent to 1996.\n  Yet, as we have heard from testimony, and from Senators about \nconstituent farmers, large numbers of farmers are obviously short in \nterms of income and many are growing short in terms of hope. I think \nthe Chair and I understand that. We have heard from a good number of \nfarmers in our States.\n  The problem of course is that the benefits of the program, by \ntradition and history--and now that history is about to be repeated--go \npredominantly to five crops, so that almost half of the payments go to \njust 8 percent of the farmers. It is very difficult\n\n[[Page S12847]]\n\nto argue logically that the farm program--at least the one that came \nout of the Agriculture Committee this year or, for that matter, the one \nthat came out of the Committee in 1996--is going to touch even a \nmajority of farmers. It will certainly not reach a majority of those \nwho are fairly small.\n  There may be an illusion that the program does this by chance, but \nthere is certainly no program effort or focus involved. The current \npolicy of Federal supports, in fact, defies economic logic. It \nperpetuates--I repeat that word--it perpetuates a cycle of low prices \nand overproduction, which is then reinforced by further emergency \nsubsidies that create further low prices and overproduction. The \nhistory of these efforts to concentrate on five row crops and to \nattempt to guarantee prices that are clearly substantially above market \nprices, either in the United States or the world, creates incentives to \nproduce for the Government program, not for the market. As a result, \nmore is produced. Predictably, as demand in our country for major crops \nhas not increased, the supplies overwhelm demand.\n\n  In the best of all worlds, we would have free flow of our \nagricultural commodities in world trade, but we do not. Someday we may. \nIt is a very tough thing, as we have all found, to negotiate. \nMeanwhile, with the flow constricted abroad, supplies mounting at home, \nprices predictably go down. The bill that came out of committee, in my \njudgment, will pound them down further.\n  The promise of the committee bill, not economic reality, is, that \nnotwithstanding what may be occurring in the market, farmers can count \non prices that are much higher than the market and financed essentially \nby other taxpayers. So, in a 10-year period of time, it is estimated \nthat with the so-called baseline expenditures plus the new \nexpenditures, about $172 million will be transferred from all the \ntaxpayers in the United States to a very few agricultural producers.\n  Why very few? Because 60 percent of farmers don't get anything at \nall. Most of the benefits go to six States. Within the six States, the \nsame national averages are replicated; namely, 8 percent of the farms \nget half of the benefits.\n  There may be an illusion that somehow in agricultural America farms \nacross all 50 States are being supported or rewarded by this bill. That \nsimply is not the case. It has not been written that way this time nor \nhas it been, really, since the New Deal days of the 1930s.\n  Large farm payments also have the faculty to inflate land values and \ncash rents derivative from that, particularly for program crop \nproducing regions. Why there? Because, given the desire of the Federal \nGovernment to support prices that are well above the market, land \nvalues have an expectation of those sorts of returns. Country bankers \nhave an expectation of those sorts of returns. Landowners become \naccustomed to those returns and increase the rents.\n  Why is that significant? Because 42 percent of farmers rent land. So \nthey are losers in this process. So, on the one hand, we are hoping to \nboost income, while, in fact for the 42 percent of farmers who are \nrenting, the land that is useful for farming program commodities \nincreases in price and so does the rent for that land. This has \nespecially unfortunate results for young farmers who typically must \nrent most of the land they farm unless they have inherited land or are \npart of a situation where they do not need the capital to buy in.\n  The commodity bill that came out of the Agriculture Committee \nincreases the CCC Farm Program spending by an estimated total of $44 \nbillion over 10 years. That bill raises nonrecourse marketing \nassistance loan rates significantly and across the board. The only \nexception is the soybean loan rate which would remain largely unchanged \nat its current high level.\n  These loan rights will be effective for 2002 through the 2006 crop.\n  Compared to current law adopted in 1996, the new Senate bill coming \nout of the committee raises marketing assistance loan rates by 16.2 \npercent for wheat, 10.1 percent for corn, 5.9 percent for cotton, and \n5.1 percent for rice.\n  Without doubt, this will encourage even more production of these \nloan-eligible commodities given the attractive new loan rates that are \navailable to those who produce them.\n  In addition, the committee-passed bill will provide direct and \ncountercyclical payments for program crops based on updated acreage and \nyield history, in effect rewarding producers for recent decisions to \nincrease production of these commodities, and, thus, encourage their \nproduction in the future regardless of market signals because of the \nguarantees that come quite apart from whatever is occurring in the \nmarket.\n  Altogether, these program crop provisions are expected to cost \ntaxpayers about $34 billion in addition to the baseline expenditures \nover the next 10 years. Importantly, increased crop production will \ndrive farm prices for these crops lower than they are today, thus \nfurther reducing crop market revenue received by farmers.\n  Dr. David Orden, professor of agriculture economics of Virginia Tech \nUniversity, estimates that after including the production increasing \neffect of such subsidies, about 25 percent, or $8.5 billion--of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee's $34 billion--will be lost by crop \nfarmers due to lower market revenues. That is an astonishing phenomenon \nthat, on the one hand, we congratulate the committee for increasing \nfarmers' income by $34 billion, but we fail to acknowledge that, even \nas we are overstimulating production, another $8.5 billion is being \nlost by crop farmers due to lower market revenue as prices are pounded \ndown.\n  For the dairy industry, the committee-passed bill originally extended \nthe milk price support at $9.90 per hundredweight through 2006. I say \noriginally because, as with many, it has been hard to follow the \nchanges and the chapters of this stock. I fear almost any figures that \nI quote from previous bills have been overtaken by events, perhaps even \nas we speak.\n  But, in any event, suffice it to say that with the programs and \nsignificant restructures and committee-approved bill, instead of newly \nconstituted boards in each Federal marketing order region administering \nthe program, it may now be administered by the Secretary through \nexisting Federal milk marketing orders. Overall, the dairy provisions \nare expected to cost taxpayers $3 billion over the next 10 years.\n  A new target price and marketing loan support program is created in \naddition for peanut producers. The taxpayers' cost, therefore, is \nexpected to be about $4.2 billion over 10 years, nearly $700 million \nmore than the House-passed peanut provisions.\n  The distinguished occupant of the chair will recall discussions in \nthe Committee on Agriculture in which some of our members were \ninsistent for more attention to peanuts, and they received that. Peanut \nprocessors and manufacturers are expected to benefit substantially from \nlower farm prices for peanuts that will occur as a result of this \ntaxpayer financed buyout but peanut users are not asked to share the \ncost.\n  The commodity title of this bill is expected to cost about $44 \nbillion over baseline, and, if so, this would be only $4.8 billion less \nthan the $48.8 billion the House spent on its commodity title over the \nsame period.\n\n  Current farm programs, however, have some problems as well. Due to \nthe current program's focus on program crops, as I mentioned, 60 \npercent of farmers are excluded from the program benefits. Furthermore, \nfarm payments are distributed based largely on historical program crop \nacreage and yields in the case of the fixed payments, the so-called \nAMTA payments, and the volume of program crops produced in the case of \nthe marketing assistance loan program and the sufficiency payment \nprogram.\n  I mentioned this because we have debated this issue during, as I \nrecall, each of the three emergency or supplemental debates we had. \nMany Senators pointed out that technically a farmer might not now be \nfarming but would receive an AMTA payment because the farmer was on the \nrolls in 1996 that established a history for program crops and, \ntherefore, received the money.\n  The rationalization was made--I must confess I accepted this as a \npractical matter--that to reconstruct the rolls would be to eliminate \nany possibility for relief of the emergency that we are attempting to \nmeet; namely, the only way that checks could be cut and money get to \nthe farmers would be\n\n[[Page S12848]]\n\nto use the AMTA payment rolls from 1996, recognizing that each year \nthat history became more dated.\n  In fact, we are sort of back to square one in the bill out of the \nCommittee on Agriculture. There is a thought about updating--not \nnecessarily eliminating--that we still have the 1996 situation for some \nfarmers who may or may not update. I gather that would be optional. And \n47 percent of the payments now go to 8 percent of the largest farmers. \nIt is not clear, but it would appear at least to some that \nconcentration might increase, given the fact that the landowners who \nare involved in the situation have an opportunity to enhance their \nsituation by updating the acreage--acreage that has been planted in \nresponse to the rewards of the program which, in my judgment, has \ncontributed to an overproduction and lower prices. But those who have \nbeen increasing their production have, by and large, been among our \nmost efficient farmers.\n  They say we ought not to be penalized for using the benefits of \nresearch of our land grant colleges. The fact that we are good at it \nmeans we are able to produce for less than the loan deficiency payment, \nand, thus, finding it profitable to the last bushel to do so ought not \nbe a consideration.\n  I believe the bill which came out of the Committee on Agriculture \ndoes not deal with the shortcomings in policy that I have been \ndiscussing. Therefore, we tried to find an alternative that would not \nbe production distorting, would not distort land values, and would not \ndiscourage young farmers and those who rent, but would, in fact, bring \nmuch greater equity not only to the program crops but to farmers who \nproduce livestock, fruits, and vegetables, or various other things on \ntheir farms. The commodity title of my farm bill offers such an \nalternative.\n  As the Chair may recall, I offered in the bill that I submitted an \nentire farm bill. It was the will of the committee, in which I was \npleased to cooperate, that most of the titles were ones that we were \nable to adopt in a bipartisan colloquy, and all things considered, \nfairly rapidly, given the comprehensive nature of going into farm \ncredit and conservation, and some very large issues. For example, \nenergy, this time, is a very important issue.\n\n  (Mr. DAYTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LUGAR. Therefore, I do not want to dwell on the committee product \nin its entirety because I support, as I recall, eight of the titles, if \nI remember how many we dealt with. But all of us around the table knew \nwe would have some differences on policy and results with the commodity \ntitle, and we did. So this is a part of that extended argument.\n  At the time of the adoption of the nutrition title, I offered an \namendment in the committee which was narrowly defeated that, in fact, \ntraces the additions I wish to offer today.\n  In essence, for those who are attempting to keep some scoring as to \nhow this is paid for without breaking out of the budget balance, the \nsavings I obtain in my commodity title are more than are required to do \nthe additional things I have chosen to do in the nutrition title. In \nthe proposal that I make, beginning in the year 2003--and I stress \nthat; not this year or the next year, 2002, but in 2003--a farmer or \nrancher with at least $20,000 in annual gross farm income, and who \nprovides 5 consecutive years of Federal tax return information related \nto his or her farm business, regardless of commodities produced--that \nis a very large ``regardless''--for Senators or staff who may be \nlistening to this debate, the question would be, for example, Does that \nmean strawberries? Yes, it does. Sheep and wool? Both. In essence, it \nmeans just what it says, all returns from farm business.\n  That total amount of revenue would qualify for a voucher to come from \nthe Federal Government, redeemable to, first of all, help purchase a \nrevenue insurance policy. This would not be crop insurance. This would \nbe whole farm revenue insurance at an 80-percent level of coverage. Or \nit could be used to fund matching deposits for a farmer who chooses to \nparticipate in an income stabilization savings account. In essence, the \nfarmer matches the voucher, and all of this goes into an interest-\nearning savings account for that farm family. Or it could be used to \nhelp purchase, in addition to the whole farm insurance idea, any other \napproved risk management tool, once again, to help insure 80 percent of \nnormal market revenue.\n  An eligible farmer's annual voucher would be equal to 6 percent of \nthe first $250,000 in average gross income from the farm from all \nsources. This would drop to 4 percent on the next $250,000 gross farm \nincome up to $500,000, and 1 percent of the next $500,000 gross farm \nincome up to $1 million, based on the tax return information as filed. \nTherefore, under this schedule, the maximum voucher would be $30,000.\n  I appreciate, for those listening to that figure, that is some \ndistance from the estimates of the committee-passed bill that a farmer \nmight, in fact, under some circumstances, gain as much as $500,000 from \nprogram subsidies.\n  Cynics, I point out to the Presiding Officer--and the Presiding \nOfficer would not be one of these--but around the agriculture table in \nthe past we have heard descriptions of what might be called ``the \nChristmas tree theory'' of the subsidies. In short, people who are very \nsophisticated point out that some farm families, who seem to have a lot \nof members, had so distributed their property into a number of farms, \nall of which seemed to qualify for the maximum amount. Ingenious \nSenators and Members of the House have tried to curtail this practice \non occasion, but I do not see great success in doing that. Those who \nwere able to contrive this had very good legal counsel and accounting \ncounsel, as would befit the stature of the sums of money that were \ninvolved.\n  In any event, one of the arguments around the table for a long time \nhas been a recognition that perhaps the payments were too concentrated, \nfirst of all, by crop, by certain States, to certain people. So as a \nresult, in one fell swoop, my reform cures this.\n  First of all, every farmer in every State is on a level playing \nfield. There are no historical program crops. A bushel of corn and \nrevenue from that counts the same as a bushel of strawberries and the \nrevenue that comes from that. I make that point because on the face of \nit the self-interests of Senators from most States would be to favor my \nbill.\n  Senators may not have studied my bill. That is why I am tedious in \ntrying to make the case that they should. Because they will find that \nin many cases only a single digit of farmers receive any benefits in \ntheir State. California, for example--a very large agricultural State--\nonly 9 percent of farmers in California receive anything from all of \nthis.\n  So farmers in California, listening to this debate today, will know \nthat the Lugar proposal means that they participate. Some farmers in \nCalifornia may say: We really don't want any of this in our lives. We \nhave some testimony to that effect, that farm programs inevitably lead \nto more and more entrants into a market, overproduction, disastrous \nprices, and dependence on the Federal Government. So they would say: \nThank goodness we were spared all of this.\n  So there may be Senators who have a majority of farmers who are \nasking to be spared the farm bill. But my recognition, at least during \ndebates we have already had, is that many Senators have a different \npoint of view. As a matter of fact, they want to know what is in any of \nthis that may be helpful to their farm families.\n  So I am saying, first of all, all of your farm families, for the \nfirst time in American history, qualify for a farm program. And they \nall qualify on the same basis. Furthermore, we try to recognize it is \nimportant they qualify only to a certain extent; that is, that the \npurpose of these transfer payments, from all taxpayers to some \ntaxpayers, is to bring about some income stability for family farmers.\n  You may say a 20-percent reduction in 1 year is not a great deal, but \nmost of the arguments made to us come from people who have suffered \nweather disasters or trade disasters or extraordinary events in which \nreally a much larger percentage of their income has been wiped out, and \nthey hope to get some wholeness through emergency appropriations.\n  There are very few businesses in America that would be able to \npurchase whole business insurance and guarantee that their revenues \nwould be at least 80 percent of their 5-year average, and to do so, in \nessence, with a\n\n[[Page S12849]]\n\npremium paid for by the Federal Government.\n  That is the proposition. And it brings stability to every farmer \nregardless of size. It recognizes that the bulk of the money must go to \nthose farmers who have revenues of $1 million or less--even more \npointedly, $500,000 or less. But that covers a prohibitive percentage \nof farmers in America, even though current farm programs are really \ngeared to the very small percentage that it does not cover.\n\n  This comprehensive revenue-based program would replace most \ntraditional farm program supports, the latter of which my bill would \nphase out over the 3-year, 2002-2005 crop-year period. Essentially, the \nprogram that remains through this period is the loan deficiency payment \nprogram which has been the safety net of the 1996 bill. That is \nimportant so that while this transition is occurring, people are \nestablishing the 5-year average. During the transition, they have some \ncertainty that a national loan program for corn and other program \ncommodities will continue at whatever the support may be at the local \nelevator in each of our States and counties.\n  The risk management program supposes that a producer operates a farm \nthat has $100,000 in average gross farm income at the start of his \nplan. Let's say $94,000 of that came from crop and livestock market \nreceipts and $6,000 in government payments. The latter is likely to \noccur because of the hangover of the last AMTA payment of this bill, \n2002, or loan deficiency payments that may come in the program crops \nthat have those payments. But in any event, this farmer would be \neligible for a $6,000 voucher beginning in the year 2003. The farmer \ncould use the voucher to purchase the 80-percent whole farm revenue \ninsurance.\n  Let me say that the premium is based upon the fact that the current \nfarm bill and the committee-passed bill continue the basic crop \ninsurance program with changes that we made last year. It is already a \nvery generous crop insurance program. I will not go into anecdotal \nmaterial with the Chair, but as one who has argued in favor of the \nprogram and in full disclosure, I have indicated that I have utilized \nthe farm insurance program. It is possible the family of the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, has used the program; \nthat is, we have paid premiums to a commercial insurer. I have no idea \nof Senator Grassley's level of coverage, but in the current crop-year, \nI selected the 85-percent policy, which is a very substantial policy. \nThere is no other business in America in which I could have purchased \nthat kind of insurance before my crop was even in, which gave me then \nthe ability to go into the futures markets and to sell thousands of \nbushels that had not yet been planned, a reckless gesture without, in \nfact, the safety net that this insurance gives and thus some \npossibility of selling to the markets as opposed to the loan deficiency \npayment at the end of the trail.\n  Other farmers in America have done that; as a matter of fact, many \npeople who are much more involved than I am. But it is there. It \nremains there.\n  Given the fact that already that premium has a very high Federal \nsubsidy, some would estimate maybe 48 percent already paid for by the \nFederal Government, the voucher that comes, the $6,000 to our \nhypothetical $100,000 revenue farmer, solidly pays for the 80 percent. \nAs this all works out in the fullness of time, it may buy more than \nthat. But we shall see. I believe it is a conservative estimate. If it \ndoesn't or he doesn't need the $6,000 entirely to buy the whole farm \ninsurance, then there is money left over for the savings account. It is \nnot lost.\n  The whole purpose of all of this from the beginning was to bring some \nassurance, some stability, and some financial security to the family \nfarmer.\n  The aspects of this are reasonably clear. Yet I know, as I explain a \ncomplex program to many for the first time, that some would say we \nwould need to walk around. The problem, as we all recognize, is that we \nare now debating a farm bill. Whether we should be walking around it \nlonger is not for me to say. I am attempting to manage, with the \ndistinguished chairman, and to expedite the passage of a good bill in a \nconstructive way.\n\n  But it is important that we recognize the need for the change in \ncourse that I have tried to identify because the failure to adopt what \namounts to a substantially new course is to exacerbate the problems of \nthe past, which I still believe are overproduction, low prices, greater \ninstability, a built-in bubble in land values for which we shall pay at \nsome point. It has been my good fortune as a farmer to have land that \nwent way up in value in the 1970s. As I didn't either buy it or sell it \nin that period, I could watch happily, but then would watch with dismay \na crash and burn scenario in the early 1980s, as that same land lost \nperhaps 60 percent of value, years entirely stripped off, a \nbreathtaking, heart-stopping experience that was extended, however, not \nover 6 months but over 6 or 7 years, followed by a tedious movement \nback up the scale.\n  If, in fact, you have a family farm that has longevity and you have \nthe good fortune to last through all of this, it is interesting to talk \nabout anecdotally, but it does not really affect your material \nprospects except on paper.\n  Most farmers do not have that opportunity. As a matter of fact, we \nreally have to gear programs for persons likewise who want to enter \nagriculture as well as to exit the scene as gracefully as possible.\n  In short, my amendment strengthens very substantially the Federal \nsafety net for low-income Americans, as I illustrated in the earlier \npart of this presentation. It has been crafted with the very generous \nhelp of those involved in the hunger movements all over our country and \nthose who have had great experience and with whom it has been my \nprivilege to work for the past 25 years on this committee.\n  They come in year after year to advocate for the poor; to talk about \nthe problems that a low-income person has with the administrative \nhassles of pages of estimates that would be very difficult for a \nsophisticated businessperson to give; the growing problems of persons \nwho are hungry because they really could not figure out how to contact \nthe system despite advocates for the poor who tried to guide them in; \nthe inequities of the vehicle laws or the problems of savings or things \nthat may seem incidental to people who have middle-income situations \nbut are very tragic for others; on top of this, the welfare reform law, \nwhich had very good effects for many Americans but at the same time, as \nwe now know and we heard testimony from Second Harvest about food banks \nand food pantries throughout the country. We have a counterintuitive \nsituation of a nation in prosperity and yet a nation whose food banks \nfrequently are running dry. These are problems that the Agriculture, \nForestry, and Nutrition Committee has to think about.\n  The political excitement of this debate comes in thinking about \nproducers, although in fairness, most of us are also interested in \nnutrition ideas.\n  It is important the degree to which we are interested. I pointed out \nearlier in my talk that we had tough times in 1995 and 1996 as a \ncommittee. Under the so-called reconciliation procedure at that \ntime, we were ordered to cut spending by $23 billion. We solved it by \ncutting producer programs by $2 billion and food stamps by 21. Now, we \nhave the good fortune of history that prosperity occurred in the \ncountry, so as a result many people left the Food Stamp Program and the \nsavings eventually were $50 billion. Correspondingly, however, the $2 \nbillion in cuts in the producer programs did not last for long, and we \nspent not plus-30, but negative 50. So the disparities in our \nresponsibilities have been substantial.\n\n  Finally, let me once again offer what almost comes as a common scold, \nand that is that none of us could have predicted precisely that our \ncountry would enter a mild economic recession, and we pray that it is \nmild and short. Certainly, at the time we were discussing the budget at \nthe beginning of this year, we heard the President of the United States \nin the State of the Union Address describe $3 trillion of surpluses \nover 10 years of time--the solution, perhaps, of Social Security \ndisability, Medicare reform, of important educational advances, and \nmuch more; and we saw our own Congressional Budget Office, I recall, \nprophesying in the fiscal year we are now in that started October 1 a \nsurplus of over $300 billion. By summer, that had been tempered down to \n176 before we left for the August recess. After September 11, it \ntempered\n\n[[Page S12850]]\n\ndown to 50, double digits. Subsequently, a sober analysis has said, \nsadly enough, we will have a deficit this year.\n  This is reinforced by reports from the Treasury yesterday that in the \nfirst 2 months of the fiscal year, September and October, the deficit \nwas $63 billion. In part, that is because of when receipts come and \nwhen expenditures come and not a chunk of income is coming in. But last \nyear it was $35 billion in the same period. So that is $28 billion \nmore.\n  There has not been this much of a rise in the first 2 months of the \nfiscal year in a long time. Last year, unfortunately, we suffered a \nbudget deficit, year long. Perhaps we will recover, but most who are \nprojecting say probably not for a few months.\n  This may not make any difference to Senators one way or another. The \nmood has changed because we have been talking about war expenditures, \nabout expenditures for New York City and elsewhere, on rebuilding. We \nare talking on and off about a stimulus package that may contain \neverything from tax cuts to substantial safety net enhancements. \nPerhaps we are all now of a mood that, in fact, we are in deficit \nfinance. Therefore, the problem of dealing with it is different. And \nfarmers, after all, should not be discriminated if we are going to have \ndeficit finance for other people. On the farm we ought to be thinking \nabout that.\n  That would make more sense if this were a 1-year bill, but it is not. \nIt is 5 years in the Senate version. The bill that passed the House is \n10 years. I have no idea where the conference will come out on these \nthings. We are not writing the final bill. The House bill assumes \nreally a perpetual agricultural crisis for the entire decade. It was \nwritten with the thought that a portion of that $3 trillion surplus \nought to be spoken for, and quickly, by agriculture. Many members on \nthe House committee would still contend that if we do not speak \nquickly, it will be gone. We have had some testimony to that effect \nfrom Senators, and some tempering by the majority leader who said the \nother day, not right away.\n  We would have to act in a timely way, but on the other hand it would \nnot disappear at midnight at the end of this year. Well, maybe not \ntheoretically, but actually it is gone. We are in a deficit situation, \nand these will be expenditures on top of that.\n\n  Why do I bring all of this up? Because essentially the scoring by the \nbudget authorities in the commodity section of the Harkin substitute is \n$27.6 billion for a 5-year bill--from 2002 to 2006. The Harkin \nsubstitute has about $1.8 billion on the nutrition side in that 5-year \nperiod.\n  Now, my bill has markedly different results, and I will try to \nexplain some of them because this is not magic. My bill costs only $5.6 \nbillion in the commodity title in the first 5 years--not 27.6, but 5.6. \nMy nutrition section is $3.7 billion, roughly double the $1.8 billion \nin the Harkin substitute. The figure of 5.6 would seem dramatically low \nfor any sort of safety net operation, but it comes through the scoring \nprocess because we are phasing out a number of agricultural subsidy \nprograms. So with the cost of these 6-percent vouchers for every dollar \nof agricultural income, which mounts up to a lot of money, lots more \npeople are being included, lots more States and farms. But as you \nsubtract the cost of the current agricultural subsidy programs, the net \nof this comes down to 5.6 for the 5-year period of time.\n  I think that is an important contribution, in large part because I \nbelieve that theoretically my bill satisfies the safety net situation \nfor more farmers and more States and more situations than does the \nHarkin substitute, however well motivated that might have been and \ngenerous in its payments. Clearly, demonstrably, tens of million of \npeople are affected by this, and all the various States are going to be \nbetter off in the ripple effect of agricultural spending, farm families \nand farm communities.\n  Furthermore, I believe that at a fairly small cost in the aggregate \nof all of this, the humaneness of nutrition changes is very important. \nI believe they will lead to greater social justice as we continue with \nwelfare reform and the thought that there ought to be a meal for every \nAmerican, even as we try to work with Americans to find work and \nresponsibility.\n  I appreciate the attention of the Chair to what has been an extended \npresentation. But this is a serious attempt to markedly change \nagricultural policy in this country. I appreciate that such changes are \nnot easy to make, not easy to explain, and are worthy of a great deal \nof study. Nevertheless, I have attempted to do my best as one who has \nwitnessed farm bills for 25 years and heard the debates and seen the \nresults, and as one of perhaps a few Senators who actually experienced \nthe results of these farm bills on my own farm property. It is not a \nlarge farm--604 acres, located now inside the city limits of \nIndianapolis, given the extension of our city on various occasions. But \nit is a corn farm, soybean farm, and a tree farm. It has made money for \nthe last 45 years every year. We were fortunate. But, at the same time, \nI mention that because I will admit that the amount we have made is \nvery small as a return on invested capital or what the farm was worth.\n  That is the problem for all farms in America. I recognize that \nacutely, as one whose small wealth is tied up in this sort of thing. A \n4-percent return on invested capital is roughly what I see as sort of a \ngold standard that you work by. That is true whether it is the Lugar \nfarm or all farm income in America. This past year was a bit over a \ntrillion dollars, and with net-net farm income of something over $40 \nbillion, the 4 percent bobs up even as you look at USDA's figures. That \nmakes farming a difficult proposition, and it always will be.\n  These debates will continue because we are not talking about persons \nwho are likely to be wealthy across the broad spectrum--a few cases, \nmaybe deservedly so, from ingenuity, work, and perseverance--but the \nbroad spectrum is mostly in difficulty.\n  Under those circumstances, I talk about a realistic safety net that I \nthink can be perpetuated at fairly low cost and is unlikely to have the \npolitical reaction or re-reaction from other taxpayers at various \npoints when they visit these programs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, as others may have comments about \nthis amendment. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I announce \nfor the Senate there will be no more rollcall votes tonight.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to speak for a little bit on the \namendment now before us offered by the ranking member of our committee, \nSenator Lugar.\n  The nutrition title is one of the most important titles in our farm \nbill. This is a part of the farm bill that talks about who we are and \nwhat we are about as a nation. To the extent we help people in lower \nincome brackets, people who may be out of work, the elderly, the \ndisabled, newly arrived immigrants, those who qualify because of income \nor status to have better nutrition, it helps all of us. It helps our \nhealth care system because these people are not always going off to an \nemergency room to get help; their health is better. It lessens the load \non our health care system.\n  Second, it helps in education. Kids who are fed, if they have a good \nnutritious breakfast, learn better. We know that. It also helps our \nfarmers. This is a market. As one of my friends from my old days in the \nHouse--God rest him--Jerry Litton used to always say--he was a great \nIrishman. He died tragically in a plane crash. He represented a rural \npart of Missouri across the State line from my district. He used to \nsay, if you are going to give a dollar to someone in this country, give \nit to\n\n[[Page S12851]]\n\nsomeone who is poor. They will spend it on food and that helps my \nfarmers and it helps all of the country. And that is still true today.\n\n  So to the extent we help these nutrition programs and bolster the \nnutrition programs, it helps our farmers. It is food. In any way you \nlook at it, helping boost nutrition programs in this country is a win \nfor everybody.\n  In light of some of the cuts we have had in spending, in light of the \ndownturn in the economy that we are experiencing now, in many ways if \nyou just looked at that, Senator Lugar's proposal might make sense \ninsofar as it expands spending on our nutrition programs. Keep in mind \nwe have about $6.2 billion over 10 years for nutrition in our bill. The \namount of money we have put in is about double what the House added in \ntheir nutrition program. I thought we did a good job in committee. \nSenator Lugar's amendment doubles what we had. I can see a lot of \npeople might want to support that. That is pretty enticing.\n  Keep in mind this bill is a balanced bill. We had to balance all the \nvarious interests with all the money we have. Therefore, when you look \nat that and try to balance the interests, you have to recognize you \ncan't just boost one without drastically affecting the other. When you \nboost nutrition, it does help the farmers. But the Lugar amendment \ntakes away loan rates. It phases them all out. Talk about something \nhurting our farmers, the occupant of the Chair knows how important loan \nrates are to farmers and to their livelihood. You cannot say, just by \ngiving poor people more food this will more than make up for it. It \nwill not.\n  The Lugar amendment also takes out all of the direct payments. We \nhave to help farmers bolster their income. All of the price support \nprograms for dairy, peanuts, sugar, will be phased out. Again, trying \nto keep a balance, we have to keep these programs for farmers, to help \nthem and their families. We also have to meet our nutritional needs for \nlow-income people. That is what we did in a responsible fashion in our \nbill.\n  Again, we have made changes. We opened it up more for immigrants, \nchildren, disabled, refugees, people seeking asylum. We have changed \nthese things. We have opened it up and made it better. We had an \nincrease in food stamp benefits to make up for the cuts that went on \nthat we have endured over the last 5 years. Again, keep in mind the \nFood Stamp Program is an entitlement. If you qualify, you get it. \nTherefore, if there is more of a downturn in the economy and we have \nmore people seeking assistance, they will not be denied food stamps.\n  There is no limit in our bill. We don't say just so much and no more. \nIf you are entitled, you get it. I don't want anyone to think somehow \nif the recession deepens, if more people are out of work or they are \nout of work longer, that somehow they will be severely restricted in \nthe food stamps they get. That is not so.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, is it not the case that the piece of \nlegislation that the Senator from Iowa brought to the floor of the \nSenate in both conservation and nutrition substantially improves what \nwas written in the bill approved by the House of Representatives?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Doubles it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might inquire further, the farm bill comes from the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, and in both areas of nutrition and \nconservation at a very substantial increase over present funding and \nover the funding of this proposal in the bill offered by the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is it not the case that in the other area--we have \nnutrition, conservation, and then commodities--area, commodities, which \nis the support basically for that which the family farm is producing, \nthat is the area where we need the help? The Senator from Iowa has \nproduced a piece of legislation that in nutrition and conservation has \nsubstantial increases, and we are trying to preserve significant help \nfor farmers who are out there trying to make a living during collapsed \nprices.\n  I ask, is it the belief of the Senator from Iowa that what we need to \ndo is now make sure that we have a decent price support for family \nfarmers during tough times, especially a countercyclical price support \nthat kicks in when commodity prices collapse? Is that the Senator's \nintent?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from North Dakota for asking these \nquestions. The Senator is absolutely right. We significantly increase \nboth nutrition and conservation. As I mentioned earlier, we doubled it, \nand then we provided for a commodity program that has not only loan \nrates and direct payments but they are countercyclical. That is kind of \na 50-cent word, but basically the prices really go down. We come in and \nhelp the farmers stay afloat. And we have a balance.\n  I believe we have met our responsibility in meeting the nutritional \nneeds of the people of this country.\n  Senator Lugar goes even farther, and I will talk a little bit more at \nlength about that, but we have met our responsibility in nutrition. We \nhave met it on conservation. As the Senator points out, we have to meet \nit on commodities. We have to meet our obligation to keep our family \nfarmers afloat and in business all over this country. That is what we \nhave done.\n  Quite frankly, the amendment of my friend from Indiana will phase out \nloan rates to zero. Not a little bit--to zero. It does away with all \nthe direct payments that we had to our farmers, all price supports for \ndairy, peanuts, sugar--all are phased out. Everything is taken away. \nThat is not in the best interests of people who are on food stamps or \nour kids who need nutrition. That is not in their best interests. We \nhave to have a balance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator is in the middle of a \npresentation, but the description of the underlying amendment sounds \nvery much like the current law, Freedom to Farm, which had at its roots \nthe notion that farmers should essentially accept whatever the \nmarketplace offers and we do not need a farm program, so they set up 7 \nyears of declining payments, after which there is no farm program. The \npresumption was that this would ``transition''--that was the operative \nword in Freedom to Farm--farmers out of a farm program.\n  The experience of the past 6 years is it has been a miserable \nfailure. It does not work. It sounds like the proposition here is to do \nless of the same. The old ``more of the same''--this is less of the \nsame, and the same didn't work.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa if he believes as I do that I do not give \na hoot in terms of the commodity portion. I don't give a hoot about a \nbushel of grain. I care about a family who is trying to raise that \ngrain or produce that grain on a farm. I care about the network of \nproducers who represent family farmers living under this, trying to \nraise a family and raise a crop and whose hopes and dreams rest on the \nquestion of whether, when they get that crop off the field, everything \nis favorable that year when they take it to the elevator. It rests on \nthe question, Is there a decent price somewhere above or near the cost \nof production? The answer in the past 5 or 6 years has been no. The \nmore you sell, the more you raise; the more you produce, the more you \nare going to lose.\n\n  So isn't it the case that really, while conservation and nutrition \nare very important--and in my judgment no one fights harder for that \nthan the Senator from Iowa; he takes a back seat to no one. But isn't \nit also the case that the so-called commodity title with respect to \nwhat it represents in support for families, support for those economic \nall-stars in America, family farmers, ranks right up there with all the \nother considerations? In my judgment, it is right at the top of the \nconsiderations of why we should do a farm bill. Would the Senator \nconcur with that?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I like the way my friend from North Dakota has portrayed \nit because I think that is absolutely right, looking at both of them. I \nwas just thinking about that when the Senator was asking the question.\n  When we think about the nutrition side of it, we think of the \nfamilies; we think of the kids; we think of the people involved and \nwhat it does to help them in their lives. When we think of the \ncommodity programs, we should not be thinking of a bushel of wheat or a \nbushel of corn or a bale of cotton or hundredweight of rice or \nwhatever. We ought to be thinking about the families who are involved \nin production. What are they like? What are they doing?\n\n[[Page S12852]]\n\nWhat are they doing for our country? How are they living? What are they \ndoing for rural America? And what are we going to do if we lose them \nall? What happens when they get wiped out?\n  I think the Senator from North Dakota has really, again, pointed out \nthat we have to have this balance in this bill. The commodity title is \none that does not go to support it. The Senator is absolutely right. It \ndoesn't go to support a bushel of corn or a bushel of wheat. It goes to \nsupport a family farmer--their spouse, their kids, their livelihood, \ntheir communities all over rural America. The Senator is absolutely \nright on that.\n  (Mrs. CLINTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for one \nadditional question, the commodity title is important here. We have an \namendment that is now pending and I believe another major amendment \nthat will follow it at some point, offered by two of our other \ncolleagues. Both of these amendments tend to chip away at the commodity \ntitle and support for family farmers. The amendment pending does that. \nThe amendment pending just eviscerates price supports for family \nfarmers. But there is another one coming that is a major initiative \nthat also just squeezes down this price support in a way that really \ndoesn't provide much help at all to family farmers.\n  It is very important, in my judgment, for us to turn back these two \namendments because if we don't, we will be here scratching and clawing \nand debating a farm bill that doesn't really have much merit with \nrespect to the livelihood of families who are trying to make a living \non American farms.\n  So our job, it seems to me, is to try to defeat the amendments that, \nin the commodities title, shrink that support for families who are \ntrying to live on this country's farms.\n  If I might, I held a hearing in the State of Iowa with my colleague, \nSenator Harkin. We had testimony about the big crop farms and all the \nbig agrifactories in this country that are growing up, the behemoth \nenterprises. Everyplace a family farmer looks, they see somebody buying \ntheir grain, somebody buying their livestock, somebody hauling their \ngrain. If they look at the railroads, mostly they are looking at \nmonopolies. They say to the farmer: By the way, here is the price. If \nyou don't like it, tough luck.\n\n  If I might take one moment to say to the Senator from Iowa, Do you \nknow a farmer in North Dakota, my State, pays more to ship grain from \nNorth Dakota to the west coast than a farmer from Iowa does moving \ngrain from Iowa through North Dakota to the west coast? Why? Because \nthe railroad says they have to.\n  A farmer from Bismarck, ND, puts a carload of grain on the track at \nBismarck and ships it to Chicago--let me give you the breakdown on the \ntransaction here. If he ships a carload of grain 400 miles, Bismarck to \nMinneapolis, they charge him $2,300. But if a farmer in Minneapolis \nputs a carload of wheat on the track in Minneapolis and ships it to \nChicago, about the same distance--$2,300? No, $1,000. So the North \nDakota farmer pays $2,300 to send a carload of wheat 400 miles, and the \nfarmer on the next segment, Minneapolis to Chicago, pays $1,000--less \nthan half.\n  Why? Because on the second segment there is competition; on the first \nthere is not. The monopoly says: Here is what you are going to pay, and \nyou will pay through the nose, and if you don't like it, tough luck.\n  For chemicals--spray, fertilizer--it is the same thing: Here is what \nyou pay. Farm equipment, same thing. Virtually everywhere the farmer \nlooks, grain trade--they ship that kernel of wheat and puff it up or \ncrisp it or shred it and put it on the shelf, and they sell the grain \nthe farmer got nothing for for $4 for a small cardboard box. It is just \nthe farmer who doesn't get a due return, but the people who crisp it \nand puff it are making money hand over fist.\n  The only people losing their shirts for 6 years are the family \nfarmers because commodity prices have collapsed. The family farmers \nhave taken a financial bath. They are hanging on by their financial \nfingertips, and everybody who touches the product that farmers produce \nhas been making money with it. The railroads are making big money \nhauling it. The cereal manufacturers are making big money crisping it \nand popping it. It is just the farmer. And people say it doesn't \nmatter.\n  It matters to this country. This country's character is formed by who \nwe are, what we have as elements of producers.\n  The fact is, we need family farmers as part of our culture. They \ncreate the family values that move from family farms to small towns to \nbig cities and nourish and refresh this country. They are a very \nimportant part of our economy.\n  The Senator from Iowa has been very generous with his time, but I \nwant to say on--I know he is speaking against this amendment--this \namendment takes the commodity title and says we are going to reduce \nsupport for families. That is not the right approach; it is exactly the \nwrong direction; and it means we have not learned anything in the last \n6 years. What we should have learned in the last 6 years is that we \nneed countercyclical price supports. As the Senator said, that is a 50-\ncent word, but what it means is you provide help to the people who need \nhelp--not Freedom to Farm--which says we provide help no matter what \nthe price is. When people need help, we lend a helping hand because \nthey are helping this country mightily. They are our all-stars.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership and his help in opposing this \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his eloquence and for his focus \non what this is all about.\n  I know a lot of what the Senator from North Dakota said about \nshipping of the grain is hard to follow. I understand that. But I hope \nthe Senator from North Dakota makes the point time and time and time \nagain here in this debate on this farm bill. That is that the family \nfarmer is at sort of the end of the whip out there. If we don't have a \ngood competition title and if we don't have something that helps those \nfamily farmers to have more bargaining power, they are lost. They are \nlost.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for pointing that out. I hope \nhe continues to do that. I say to my friend from North Dakota also, \nactually the amendment by the Senator from Indiana would be less than \nFreedom to Farm. There would be less support there for agriculture than \nFreedom to Farm.\n  I did want to correct the statement I made. I said the Lugar \namendment would phase out all of the loan rates. I guess that is not \nquite right. I guess I didn't read it closely enough. Actually, by 2006 \nthey would phase it down to 1 percent.\n  I guess that is about nothing, now that I think about it. But there \nis 1 percent of the previous 5-year average, which really is kind of \nlaughable when you think about it. But it was pointed out to me it \nwasn't zero, it was 1 percent of the previous 5-year price. Right now \nwe are at about 85 percent, if I am not mistaken. So you go from 85 \npercent of the previous 5 years to 1 percent.\n  I want the record to be clear, the Lugar amendment does not \ncompletely phase out loan rates. It brings it down to 1 percent. So \nthere, I just wanted to make sure that was correct.\n  I also wanted to point out that in talking about the support for \nfamilies, for low-income families, to make sure they get enough \nnutrition, our bill provides $780 million additional money for \ncommodity purchases for food assistance. So there is three-quarters of \na billion dollars more to purchase fruits and vegetables, things such \nas that, meats, meat products, that would go to help low-income \nfamilies meet their nutritional needs.\n  The Lugar amendment has much less in it than I have in mine.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. This has been cleared with the chairman and ranking member \nof the committee. Following this unanimous consent agreement, anyone \nwho wants to talk on this amendment can talk as long as they wish \ntonight.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of S. 1731 tomorrow morning, Wednesday, December 12, \nthere be 60 minutes of debate\n\n[[Page S12853]]\n\nprior to a vote in relation to the Lugar amendment No. 2473 with the \ntime equally divided and controlled in the usual form, that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order, nor to the language proposed to be \nstricken prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the Senator yielding for this \nimportant matter.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I understand we will come in tomorrow \nmorning and I will make my comments at that time on the Lugar \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, the unanimous \nconsent agreement didn't call for it, but the Senate will come in at \n9:30 tomorrow morning, and the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Lugar, will control the time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There will be 1 hour for debate from 9:30 a.m. until \n10:30 a.m. equally divided, and the vote will occur on the Lugar \namendment at 10:30 tomorrow morning?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the leader. I will have more to say about this \ntomorrow morning.\n  But the Lugar amendment takes away all of the programs that we have \nfor farmers and gives them a voucher by which they can go out and \npurchase a whole farm revenue insurance program which will give them a \nguarantee of up to 80 percent. They can contribute an amount at least \nequal to the amount of the voucher to a risk management stabilization \naccount, and they can redeem the voucher for cash payment and use the \npayment to carry out one or more risk management strategies that are \nsufficient to guarantee a net income from all agricultural enterprises \nof at least 80 percent.\n  That is pretty convoluted. Quite frankly, at a time when our farmers \nare just about at their wit's end right now to take what we carefully \nfashioned in a bipartisan fashion--and this is a bipartisan bill that \nwe have on the floor--and just throw it out for an experiment, I think \nwe just can't do that right now. That would disrupt all of agriculture \nand it would disrupt the markets. It would be chaos. The adoption of \nthe Lugar amendment would just mean chaos. The markets would not know \nwhat to do. Farmers would not know what to do. Bankers would not know \nwhat to do. A farmer going in to get a loan early next year for seed \nand fertilizer or maybe to buy a piece of equipment or get the \nnecessary funds to farm--that is the way people farm. They go in and \nget the credit. The banker says: I don't know what to do because I do \nnot know what kind of program there is. With the Lugar amendment, they \nwould have absolutely no idea what they would be doing.\n  I think the Lugar amendment is probably something you put out there \nto debate and people talk about it and they think about it. Maybe you \nmassage it around for a while, but it is not something you just do all \nof a sudden and leap off the deep end.\n  We cannot take our loan rates down to 1 percent. We cannot do away \nwith direct payments. We can't take away all of the price supports over \nthe next 5 years for dairy and for peanuts, sugar and everything else. \nThat would be catastrophic.\n  While I applaud Senator Lugar for his strong support--and I know it \nis genuine and sincere--for nutrition and nutrition programs, the way \nhe has gone about getting the money by devastating the commodity title \nis in no one's best interest. It is not in the best interests of low-\nincome families; it is not in the best interests of our farm families; \nand certainly it is not in the best interests of our country.\n  I reserve my remarks for tomorrow morning. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nthis year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in August \n1991 in San Francisco, CA.

The assailants, both 17-year-old \nfemales, were later found guilty on all counts of felony assault and \nhate crime violations in connection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

Cody joined the Army's Special Forces \nshortly after his high school graduation, and had served his country \nwith pride and distinction for 10 years.\n  Staff Sergeant Prosser paid the supreme price defending liberty and \njustice, and his sacrifice will never be forgotten.

ARRIZURIETA\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of \nPresident Bush's nominee to be U.S. Alternative Executive Director to \nthe Inter-American Development Bank, Jorge L. Arrizurieta. I ask \nunanimous consent that letters of support for this nomination from our \ncolleagues, Senator Graham and Senator Frist, as well as letters of \nsupport from Governor Bush of Florida, the Undersecretary of the \nTreasury for International Affairs, Mr. John Taylor, and the Special \nAssistant to the Assistant Attorney General, Mr. Jeffrey Ross, be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Arrizurieta's background represents a strong \ncombination of public service at the Federal, State, and local levels. \nPreviously, Mr. Arrizurieta worked for five years as the Director of \nState Projects for our former colleague Senator Mack where he did an \noutstanding job. He was also appointed by Governor Jeb Bush of Florida \nto the Post Secondary Education Planning Commission, where he was \nelected Vice Chairman by his colleagues.\n  For the past eight years, Mr. Arrizurieta has been closely associated \nwith corporate ventures of Mr. Wayne Huizenga, a southern Florida \nentrepreneur. As Vice President of Public Affairs for Huizenga \nHoldings, Mr. Arrizurieta has had the opportunity to meet and work with \na broad variety of government and business leaders throughout the \ncountry and the Western Hemisphere. In this capacity he has worked on \ndeveloping extensive business development outreach efforts in the Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean region.\n  Aside from these commitments, Mr. Arrizurieta has devoted his time \nand effort to many charitable, community and business organizations, \nincluding the Make A Wish Foundation, the Florida Chamber of Commerce, \nLa Liga Contra el Cancer, and the Florida FTAA, Free Trade Area of the \nAmericas, initiative as a founding member of its Board of Directors.\n  Jorge Arrizurieta is the son of Cuban immigrants, is fluent in \nSpanish, and has a strong understanding of Latin American culture. His \ngovernment affairs and community relations background will serve him \nwell in a position where people and diplomatic skills are highly valued \nto advance the interests of the United States, and the efficacy of the \nbank as a political institution.\n  I would like to note that a misimpression may have been left by \nquestions raised at Mr. Arrizurieta's nomination hearing before the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations, regarding a bank on whose board he \nserves. I call my colleagues' attention to the very helpful letter of \nclarification from the Department of Justice which I have entered into \nthe Record and which should resolve any questions that arose during the \nCommittee hearing.\n  The nomination of Mr. Arrizurieta will come before the Committee on \nForeign Relations soon. I urge my colleagues on the Committee to join \nme in voting to favorably report this nomination. Once the nomination \nhas been reported from the Committee, I urge the Majority Leader to \nbring the nomination promptly before the Senate so that President Bush \nand the American people will have the benefit of Mr. Arrizurieta's \nstrong background and\n\n[[Page S12855]]\n\nexperience on the Inter-American Development Bank.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 27, 2001.\n     Hon.

Coupled with his fluency in \n     Spanish and strong understanding of the Latin American \n     culture, Jorge has a strong background in government and \n     community relations in Florida's large Latin-American \n     community.\n       Mr. Arrizurieta's work with Senator Mack was well regarded \n     and extremely valuable to the Senator and all Floridians. At \n     the Huizenga organization he began his work as the Director \n     of Community Relations for the Florida Marlins Baseball Club. \n     The team's focus on marketing to Latin America and the \n     Caribbean allowed Mr. Arrizurieta the opportunity to meet and \n     work with many government and business leaders in the region \n     and assist the team in their efforts to become ``The Team of \n     the Americas.''\n       His current duties at Huizenga Holdings include managing \n     the government relations for its business interests as \n     diverse as the Miami Dolphins Football Club, Pro Player \n     Stadium, and Autonation, Inc., the largest automotive \n     retailer in the world.\n       Notwithstanding these responsibilities, Mr. Arrizurieta has \n     continued to make time to give back to his community.

He served as Senator Connie Mack's Director of State \n     Projects, and was Vice-Chairman of the State of Florida's \n     Post Secondary Education Planning Commission. Mr. Arrizurieta \n     has always distinguished himself as an accomplished and \n     trusted leader.

The Arrizurieta \n     family was among the first families I came to know upon my \n     move to Miami.

I can \n     assure you Jorge has the ability, the integrity and \n     dedication that will be required of him in this most \n     important position.\n       Jorge's abilities and good work were very visible during \n     his five years with Senator Connie Mack's office. For the \n     last eight years he has been associated with Wayne Huizenga's \n     organization in a variety of positions. From the Director of \n     Community Relations position with the Florida Marlins, to the \n     current position where he serves as the holding company's \n     Vice President of Public Affairs, he has always been very \n     effective and enjoyed the respect of his peers. These \n     positions have prepared him very well for his return to \n     public service.\n       I appointed Jorge to a position on the State's Post \n     Secondary Education Planning Commission, where his colleagues \n     elected him Vice Chairman. Here again he served successfully \n     and with extreme dedication. Through his role on the \n     commission, he was very helpful to our efforts in the \n     reorganization of the state's education system.\n       Jorge has all the ingredients required to do an effective \n     job in an area where diplomatic and business skills are \n     required in equal measure. Jorge has always made me proud of \n     his work and commitment to our nation. I know he will serve \n     our country very successfully and effectively. I urge you to \n     support this excellent nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeb Bush.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 27, 2001.\n     Hon.

Previously, Mr. \n     Arrizurieta performed public service in government as the \n     Director of State Projects for Senator Connie Mack, in which \n     I understand his work was extremely well regarded. He was \n     also appointed to the State of Florida Post Secondary \n     Education Planning Commission and was elected Vice Chairman \n     by his colleagues.\n       Mr. Arrizurieta was also the Director of Community \n     Relations for the Florida Marlins Baseball Club. The team's \n     focus on marketing to Latin America and the Caribbean allowed \n     Mr. Arrizurieta the opportunity to meet and work with many \n     government and business leaders in the region and assist the \n     team in their efforts to become ``The Team of the Americas.'' \n     In this capacity he worked in developing extensive business \n     development outreach efforts in the Latin American and \n     Caribbean region.\n       His responsibilities at Huizenga Holdings include managing \n     the government relations for its business interests as \n     diverse as the Miami Dolphins Football Club, Pro Player \n     Stadium, Autonation, Inc. (the largest automotive retailer in \n     the world) and Alamo and National Rental Car.\n       Notwithstanding these commitments, Mr. Arrizurieta has \n     donated his time and effort to our society through his \n     devotion to many charitable, community and business \n     organizations--including the Make A Wish Foundation and the \n     Florida FTAA (Free Trade Area of the Americas) effort as a \n     founding member of its Board of Directors.\n       To sum up, Jorge Arrizurieta is an accomplished Hispanic-\n     American. He is the son of Cuban immigrants, is fluent in \n     Spanish, and has a strong understanding of the Latin American \n     culture.

The press release misidentified International \n     Finance Bank as being a Venezuelan bank. Further, the press \n     release should be read as stating only that accounts at \n     International Finance Bank received funds wired through the \n     undercover operation. Neither International Finance Bank nor \n     any of its employees were the subject of the criminal \n     indictments returned as a result of Operation Casablanca.\n       We understand that, despite this fact, you are concerned \n     over downstream news accounts suggesting or even stating that \n     your institution or its employees were involved in the \n     laundering of drug money through accounts in your bank. The \n     public material released from the Justice and Treasury \n     Departments does not indicate that your bank or any bank \n     employee was charged with any criminal wrongdoing. I know you \n     feel the\n\n[[Page S12856]]\n\n     public may reach a contrary conclusion because the name of \n     your bank was mentioned in public documents, but I again \n     assure you that the indictment and public statements convey \n     nothing more than a list of the Venezuelan banks through \n     which undercover drug funds were laundered.\n       Please feel free to circulate the contents of this letter \n     as you deem appropriate.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              L.

Madam President, Last week I offered an amendment on \nbehalf of Senator Domenici and myself. It authorizes State and local \ntransit authorities that receive Federal transit assistance to purchase \ntransit buses through the General Services Administration. Because of \nGSA's limited experience with transit buses, the amendment provides for \nthe pilot program to be managed by the Federal Transit Administration.\n  Currently only the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has \nthe option to purchase buses through the General Services \nAdministration. The pilot program would open up that option to other \npublic transit agencies around the country that also receive Federal \ntransit assistance. However, the pilot program is limited only to \nheavy-duty transit buses and intercity coaches. The initial pilot \nprogram would end on December 31, 2003.\n  The General Services Administration currently offers three heavy-duty \ntransit buses and two intercity coaches. GSA selected these suppliers \nas a result of competitive solicitations, and the companies had to bid \nattractive terms and prices in order to win those 5-year contracts.\n  GSA intends to expand its existing sources of simply to a full \nmultiple-award schedule with a larger variety of vehicles and choices \nof optional equipment. GSA indicates this process will take 12 to 18 \nmonths. Therefore, our amendment directs GSA to complete the multiple-\naward schedule by December 31, 2003, and authorizes state and local \ntransit authorities that receive Federal transit assistance to purchase \nheavy-duty transit buses and intercity coaches off these GSA schedules. \nThis authority would expire on December 31, 2006.\n  Allowing additional public transit agencies the option to purchase \nthese buses from GSA could result in substantial options and prices \nwould help streamline the procurement process, which could be \nespecially valuable to some of the smaller communities. Purchasing \nbuses through GSA will help stretch each dollar of Federal transit \nfunding a little bit farther.\n  I believe it is very important to point out that this pilot program \nis limited only to transit buses and intercity coaches. It has no \neffect on companies that supply other types of buses or vehicles, \npharmaceuticals, or any other product that currently can be purchased \nthrough the General Services Administration. I believe transit buses \nare a unique situation. Purchases through the GSA should be allowed. \nThere are only a few bus manufacturers in America today and most buses \nfor public transit are purchased using Federal funds provided by the \nFederal Transit Administration.\n  Our bus manufacturers are not having an easy time. Our amendment will \nhelp expedite bus purchases by eliminating the cost of responding to \nmyriad requests for proposals from public transit agencies. Our \namendment will also help the public transit agencies by reducing the \ncost of preparing the requests for proposals and assessing the \nresponses. I do believe this is a meritorious amendment. It is one I \nwould very much like to see adopted as part of this legislation. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it. The amendment has the support of the \nFederal Transit Administration, bus manufacturers, and public transit \nagencies across the Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the American Public \nTransportation Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    American Public Transportation\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding a provision the Senate \n     is expected to take up as part of the defense appropriations \n     bill that would allow recipients of funds under the federal \n     transit program to purchase heavy-duty and intercity buses \n     from the General Services Administration schedule of \n     contracts.\n       The Business Member Board of Governors of the American \n     Public Transportation Association (APTA) considered a similar \n     provision in a meeting on Sunday, September 30, 2001. They \n     voted in support of the measure.\n       Further, on December 7, 2001, APTA's Legislative Committee \n     considered this new provision and unanimously agreed to \n     support it. While APTA's governing body has not had an \n     opportunity formally to consider the provision, our public \n     transit members are supportive of measures that would \n     simplify and standardize the federal procurement process, as \n     this provision would do. We are particularly pleased to note \n     that under the provision GSA, with assistance from the \n     Federal Transit Administration, would be required to \n     establish and publish a multiple award schedule for heavy-\n     duty buses, which means that any heavy-duty or intercity bus \n     manufacturer would be provided an opportunity to participate \n     in the program.\n       Please have your staff contact Daniel Duff, APTA's Chief \n     Counsel & Vice President, Government Affairs, should you have \n     any questions about this matter. He may be reached at (202) \n     496-4860 or internet e-mail dduff@apta.com.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                William W.

FAMILY COURT REFORM\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto note for the record a few important points. As you may know, the \nfiscal year 2002 Appropriations Act for the District of Columbia, which \nis on its way to the President's desk as we speak, included a total of \n$24 million dollars for the purpose of funding the reforms provided for \nunder the Family Court Reform Act of 2001. As Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the DC Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator DeWine and I felt \nvery strongly that these funds were a necessary prerequisite for the \nkind of change we envisioned. This money was provided to the Courts \nwith the expectation that it would be used to affect this reform in the \nmost immediate and effective way possible. Having worked with the \nCourts for the better part of this past year, we are confident that \nthey will work diligently towards implementing a unified family court, \nstaffed with highly trained and experienced judges, attorneys and court \npersonnel. We expect that they will do their best to ensure that the \nthis family court is structured in such a way as to reflect its \nfounding principle, ``One family, One Judge'', a critical component in \nan effective child welfare system. And finally, we hope that the chief \njudge, the Child and Family Services Agency and others will go beyond \nthe letter of the law and embrace its spirit, that the safety and well \nbeing of our children must remain our paramount concern.\n  With that said, I would like to make clear our intent in including \nlanguage which restricts the total distribution of the $24 million \nuntil the family court reform plan is received and reviewed by \nCongress. It should be noted that one hundred percent of the DC \nSuperior Court's operating budget is paid for with Federal funds. \nTherefore, Congress has a unique obligation to ensure that the day-to-\nday operations of this court reflect the best practices in each and \nevery area of law under its jurisdiction. The Family Court Reform Act \nof 2001 lays out a broad set of guidelines for the reform of the family \ncourt in the District. Under the provisions of the DC Appropriations \nbill, within 90 days of the date of its enactment, the Courts are to \nsubmit to congress a plan for the immediate transition to a unified \nfamily court system. Within 30 days of receipt of this report, the \nGeneral Accounting Office is to provide Congress with an independent \nreview of this plan. Finally, after a 30 day review period in Congress, \nthe funds earmarked for family court reform are to be distributed to \nthe Court and to the Mayor to implement these reforms.\n  Our intent in arranging the distribution of funds in this way was to \nensure that the money added to the Court's budget for the purpose of \nfamily court reform would remain available to carry out the reform \nplan. In the short time since the congress passed the DC Appropriations \nconference report, modification to the authorization bill have\n\n[[Page S12857]]\n\nexpedited the time in which the Court's are required to hire magistrate \njudges and their support personnel. The DC Courts have the ability to \nuse funds from their general operating budget to hire magistrates, \ntheir staff, or any other activity, before the family court reform \nfunds are available. We recognize that certain requirements of the \nfamily Court Reform Act of 2001 require immediate action and we \nencourage the Court to take the necessary steps to provide for a \nseamless transition.\n  If the constraints on family court reform funds contained in the DC \nAppropriations bill prove to be unfeasible, I am committed to \nrevisiting those constraints when Congress reconvenes in January. The \nSenate Appropriations Committee does not intend to hinder the \nimplementation of the Family Court Reform Act in any way. We hope that \nwe can work with our colleagues in the House to clarify this issue if \nnecessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/11/senate-section/article/S12857-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12857-S12858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DOVER AIR FORCE BASE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, on December 20, 1941, the 112th \nObservation Squadron of the Ohio National Guard arrived in Dover, DE, \nto begin conducting anti-submarine patrols. It was the first military \nunit to serve at what is now known as the Dover Air Force Base.\n  The history of the Base actually goes back 2 years further, to 1939, \nwhen in response to the Nazi invasion of Poland, the Civilian Aviation \nAdministration, CAA, offered State and local governments on both coasts \nfinancial help to build municipal airports. The CAA offered to build \none airfield in each of Delaware's three counties; the State did not \npursue the offer, but New Castle and Sussex Counties accepted. Kent \nCounty passed the issue to the city of Dover, our State capital, and \nthe Dover leaders agreed and purchased the land for a new airfield, in \nwhat has been hailed many times since as ``the best investment the city \never made.''\n  In addition to the anti-submarine mission during World War II, \nDover's airfield was used, once the Corps of Engineers had done some of \nits magic, to train fighter squadrons and then, in 1944, as the site \nfor classified air-launched rocket tests, experiments that led to the \nuse of air-to-surface rockets in both the European and the Pacific \nTheaters.\n  After the war, the airfield was placed on caretaker status, and \nalthough it remained inactive for the rest of the 1940s, the name was \nofficially changed to Dover Air Force Base in January 13, 1948. Control \nof the Base was transferred to the Ninth Air Force in February 1949. In \nFebruary 1951, the Dover Air Force Base was reactivated and put under \nthe jurisdiction of the Air Defense Command, ADC, with different \nfighter squadrons using the airfield over the course of the next 7 \nyears.\n  The foundation for a permanent mission was laid when, recognizing \nDover's strategic location, the Military Air Transport Service, MATS, \nassumed control and began, with an appropriation from Congress, to \ntransform the Base into the East Coast embarkation point and foreign \nclearing base. Four units of the Atlantic Division were organized at \nDover: the 1607th Air Base Group, the 1607th Air Base Squadron, the \n1607th Maintenance and Supply Squadron, and the 1607th Medical Group. \nIn November 1953, the first two transport squadrons were assigned, \nforming the core of the 1607th Air Transport Wing, and in December of \nthat year, the Secretary of the Air Force designated the Dover Air \nForce Base as a permanent military installation.\n  In 1955, the Aerial Port Mortuary responsibilities were transferred \nto Dover, and many Americans have become familiar with the Base for its \nprominence and exceptional service in fulfilling that duty. To offer an \nincomplete list, the Port Mortuary has received the remains of \ncasualties of the war in Vietnam, a number of plane and helicopter \ncrashes involving military personnel, the mass suicide in Guyana, the \nattack on the Marine barracks in Beirut, the Challenger explosion, the \nUSS Stark, Pan Am 103, the USS Iowa, the Khobar Towers bombing, the \n1998 bombing in Kenya, and most recently, victims of the September 11 \nattack on the Pentagon.\n\n  From the mid-1950s to the mid-Sixties, to offer another incomplete \nlist, Dover Air Force Base participated in Project Ice Cube to \nconstruct a Defense Early Warning Network in Northern Canada; the \nairlift to help combat a polio outbreak in Argentina; Operation Good \nHope to Jordan; the Amigo Airlift in response to a devastating \nearthquake in Chile; an airlift of relief supplies to Honduras after \nHurricane Hattie; the airlift of United Nations peace-keepers to the \nBelgian Congo; the Cuban Missile Crisis; the relief airlift following \nthe Great Alaskan Earthquake; and the delivery of supplies to \nGuadeloupe Island after Hurricane Cleo, as well as supporting the \ndeepening involvement in Vietnam.\n  In January 1966, a reorganization led to the designation of the \nMilitary Airlift Command and the activation of the 436th Military \nAirlift Wing to assume command of the Base. The 436th, by the way, has \nits own proud history, going back to the famed 436th Troop Carrier \nGroup, TCG, which participated in just about every major European \ncampaign of World War II, from Normandy to Operation Market Garden to \nBastogne to Operation Varsity.\n  In 1968, the 912th Military Airlift Group, Associate, along with the \n326th Military Airlift, the 912th Support, and the 912th Material \nSquadrons, were activated at Dover, giving the Base a total of four \nactive and one reserve military airlift squadrons. In 1973, the 512th \nMilitary Airlift Wing, A, which is now the 512th Airlift Wing, A, was \nactivated as a replacement to the 912th and its subordinates; the 512th \nAW remains a key part of Dover's mission. From 1971 to 1973, the \ntransition was undertaken to make Dover home to the first all C-5 \nequipped wing in the Air Force.\n  During the Vietnam war, Dover aircrews participated in, among others, \nOperation Blue Light in January 1966 and Operation Eagle Thrust in \n1967, an incredibly ambitious military airlift into a combat zone for \nwhich Dover personnel received their first Air Force Outstanding Unit \nAward.\n  Among other most notable missions in which Dover crews have \nparticipated are Operation Nickel Grass, during which Dover's C-5s flew \n71 missions, more than 2,000 hours, delivering more than 5,000 tons of \ncargo. That operation is considered by many to have been the first real \ntest of the C-5 aircraft. Dover crews also successfully dropped and \ntest-fired a Minuteman I ICBM in 1974, and delivered a 40-ton \nsuperconducting magnet to Moscow in 1977 as part of a joint energy \nresearch program. The mission to Moscow earned the crew the Mackay \nTrophy for the most meritorious flight of the year. Missions to Zaire \nand, in the cause of joint verification, another to the Soviet Union \nalso earned Mackay Trophies for Dover captains and crews.\n  Dover crews helped evacuate Americans from Iran in 1978, and \nsupported the Marine operation in Lebanon in 1983-84. Dover's C-5s flew \n27 missions in the invasion on Grenada also in 1983, and assisted with \nthe clean-up after the Valdez oil spill in 1989. Eighteen missions were \nflown by Dover crews in Operation Just Cause in Panama, and in \nOperations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the Persian Gulf War, \nDover's C-5s logged more than 30,000 flying hours. Since then, Dover \ncrews have flown in Operation Restore Hope in Somalia; in Operation \nJoint Endeavor in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Operations Desert Thunder and \nDesert Fox in 1998; and in Operation Allied Force against the military \nstructure of Slobodan Milosevic.\n\n  Among recent humanitarian missions have been the airlift to Central \nAmerica following Hurricane Mitch; Joint Task Force Shining Hope to aid \nKosovar refugees; airlifts to Turkey following the earthquakes of 1999; \nthe 436 AW also responded to the earthquake that same year in Taiwan; \nand Operation Atlas Response in Mozambique after the devastating \nflooding there last year.\n  And, of course, there is Operation Enduring Freedom, our common cause \nin which our military men and women bear so much of the burden, the \nrisk and the sacrifice. Our prayers and thanks are with them every day, \nincluding the 200 men and women from the 512 Air Reserve Wing who have \nbeen activated. I would also note that the 436th Airlift Wing received \nits 13th Air Force Outstanding Unity Award in October.\n\n[[Page S12858]]\n\n  I share this history with my colleagues and with the Nation today, \nnot only because the 60th anniversary of the Dover Air Force Base \nrepresents our proud military tradition so well, but also because the \nhistory of the Dover Air Force Base is very much a part of the history \nof Delaware. We do not merely co-exist with the Base; it is a part of \nour State family, a part of our community of friends and neighbors.

Madam President, I rise today to recognize a \nteacher from Idaho who has achieved national recognition for her work \nin physical education. Danette Lansing, from Eagle, ID, has been chosen \nto receive the Disney American Teacher Award, one of only 36 teachers \nchosen for such an honor. In fact, she was chosen from among that \nselect group as one of the top ten teachers in the Nation, and the top \nteacher in the ``Wellness/Sports'' category.\n  It is a great honor for the people of Idaho that a teacher from our \nState has won this award. It has always been my belief that the \neducation system in Idaho is one of the finest in the Nation, and \nhaving a teacher from Idaho chosen for the Disney American Teacher \nAward only reinforces this belief. Our State has produced many fine \nteachers and students over the years, and this award is merely an \noutward indication of what Idahoans already know.\n  One look at her career shows why she was chosen for this award. As a \nphysical education teacher, she has done much for the students of Eagle \nElementary School to make them more active and increase their physical \nhealth. As Bart Roen of Disney said about Miss Lansing's selection: \n``If I had to pick one thing, it's the creativity . . . the kinds of \nthings she does and how well it ties in with what she teaches the \nkids.'' For example, her success in creating a walking club at Eagle \nElementary School has not only students walking during lunch, but also \nteachers and neighbors.\n  Not surprisingly, this is not the first award Miss Lansing has won. \nIn 1999, she was named Idaho's Physical Education Teacher of the Year. \nHowever, these awards pale in comparison to the high praise her \nstudents have for her. In fact, one of my own staff members had \nchildren who were students of Miss Lansing's, and he reports that she \nwas one of their favorite teachers. It has been obvious to the people \nof Eagle and the State of Idaho that she is a great teacher, now it \nwill be obvious to the Nation.\n  As you can see, Danette Lansing is truly a treasure for her school, \nfor Idaho, and indeed for the Nation in general. Teachers like Miss \nLansing make education a rewarding experience for students and parents \nalike.

A bill to strengthen and improve the management of national \nsecurity, encourage Government service in areas of critical national \nsecurity, and to assist government agencies in addressing deficiencies \nin personnel possessing specialized skills important to national \nsecurity and incorporating the goals and strategies for recruitment and \nretention for such skilled personnel into the strategic and performance \nmanagement systems of Federal agencies; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n[[Page S12860]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in the fall of 1957, the United States \nreceived a national wake-up call. The Soviet Union launched sputnik \ninto orbit. The space race was on, and we were already behind. Not only \nwere we caught off guard by sputnik, it was suddenly clear that major \nchanges had to be made to preserve our national security and to pull \nahead in scientific and technological innovation.\n  One year later, Congress passed landmark legislation, the National \nDefense Education Act. The purpose of the act was to ``strengthen the \nnational defense and to encourage and assist in the expansion and \nimprovement of educational program to meet critical national needs.'' \nThe National Defense Education Act provided assistance to State and \nlocal school systems to strengthen instruction in science, math, \nforeign languages, and other critical subjects. It also created low-\ninterest student loan programs and fellowships to open the door to \nhigher education to a greater number of young people. This coordinated \nnational effort helped our Nation meet its goals.\n  By 1969, Americans had landed on the Moon. The United States was the \nmost technologically advanced Nation in the world. A new generation of \nhighly skilled mathematicians, scientists, and technology experts \nstaffed laboratories, universities, and Federal agencies. Colleges and \nuniversities had established centers for foreign language study and \nresearch.\n  Sadly, this Nation received another wake-up call on September 11, \n2001.\n  The week after the attacks, FBI Director Robert Mueller made a public \nplea for Arabic and Farsi speakers to assist as translators, \nillustrating the alarming deficiency in fluent speakers of languages \ncrucial to our national security needs. It does our Nation no good to \nhave sophisticated weapons programs if we don't have the scientists to \nback them up. It does our Nation no good to have expanded intelligence \ngathering capabilities if what we retrieve sits untranslated. The \nUnited States must have the brainpower to match its firepower.\n  Today I join Senators Thompson and Akaka to introduce two initiatives \nthat serve two important purposes, to meet the immediate needs of the \nFederal Government in areas of national security, and to make \ninvestments in our future through investments in education.\n  The Homeland Security Federal Workforce Act authorizes funds for key \nnational security agencies to repay student loans for employees in \nnational security positions who pledge to serve for a minimum of three \nyears. This expands the existing loan forgiveness program for \nFederal employees by permitting these agencies to repay up to $10,000 \nper year in student loans.\n\n  The bill also establishes a National Security Fellowship Program for \ngraduate students who agree to enter Federal service in a position key \nto national security upon the completion of their degree. The \nfellowship program will also be open to current Federal employees, \nencouraging the enhancement and development of their skills.\n  To give Federal employees more flexibility and experience, the bill \ncreates a National Security Service Corps to allow Federal employees to \nserve in rotational assignments in other agencies with national \nsecurity responsibilities.\n  Along with these immediate remedies, homeland security and \npreparedness depend on a well-educated citizenry who leave school with \nthe tools they need to succeed in science, math, technology, and \nforeign languages. Unless broader education reforms are implemented, we \nwill continue to find ourselves playing catch-up to secure the skilled \nprofessionals our government needs.\n  The Homeland Security Education Act would fund partnerships between \nlocal school districts and foreign language departments in institutions \nof higher education. These new foreign language partnerships will \nprovide intensive professional development opportunities for foreign \nlanguage teachers at every level from kindergarten to 12th grade. The \npartnerships will foster contact and communication between university \nfaculty and K-12 teachers in order to improve teachers' knowledge of \nthe languages they teach as well as their teaching skills. Partnerships \nwould also use grant funds to recruit foreign language majors to the \nclassroom. Our bill will give priority to partnerships that include \nhigh-need school districts and that put a focus on the less-commonly \ntaught languages.\n  Our bill will encourage more undergraduates to complete degrees in \nmathematics, science, engineering, and the less-commonly taught foreign \nlanguages by establishing a program to forgive the interest on a \nborrower's student loans if he or she earns a degree in one of these \nsubjects. The program aims to provide an incentive for students who are \ninterested in these areas of study to earn their degrees.\n  The bill establishes grants for partnerships between school districts \nand private entities to help schools improve science and math \ncurriculum, upgrade laboratory facilities, and purchase scientific \nequipment. In turn, the private sector partner will donate technology \nor equipment to the school district; provide scholarships for district \nstudents to study math, science, or engineering at college; establish \ninternship or mentoring opportunities for district students; or sponsor \nprograms aimed at young people who are under-represented in the fields \nof math, science, and engineering.\n  In order to stay on top of innovations in science and technology, \nmore professionals in these fields will have to also be proficient in a \nforeign language. This is imperative to our national security, even \nsome scientific documents and articles in the public domain are beyond \nthe translation capabilities of our government. The Homeland Security \nEducation Act would make grants available to colleges and universities \nto establish programs in which students take courses in science, math \nand technology taught in a foreign language. Funds will also support \nimmersion programs for students to take science and math courses in a \nnon-English speaking country.\n\n  The Homeland Security Education Act authorizes $20 million for the \nNational Flagship Language Initiative, which was funded as a one-year \npilot program in this year's Defense Appropriations bill. The funds \nwill be used to provide institutional grants to universities to \ngraduate specific numbers of students with the foreign language \nproficiencies needed by the government. Participating institutions will \nmake available a negotiated number of slots to student applicants who \nare Federal employees.\n  With these bills, we hope to address some of the gaps in homeland \nsecurity that have been identified by numerous experts and panels, \nincluding the Hart-Rudman Commission on National Security in the 21st \ncentury. We must do everything possible to ensure that our intellectual \npreparedness is equal to that of our military preparedness. Without \nthese investments, we may find that the war against terrorism is \nunwinnable, and our status in the global community severely diminished.\n  Our Nation has demonstrated that we have the moral resolve to fight a \nwar to end terrorism. We must match that resolve with the willingness \nmake investments in education and training that will pay off well into \nthe next century.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nInternational Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services, I am \nhonored to work with my colleagues from the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Durbin and Senator Thompson, to introduce the \nHomeland Security Federal Workforce Act and the Homeland Security \nEducation Act.\n  Alarmed at the Soviet Union's successful launch of the first space \nvehicle, Congress passed the National Defense Education Act of 1958. \nOur country faced a changed national security landscape, and our \nGovernment was determined to make certain the United States never came \nup short again in the areas of math, science, technology and foreign \nlanguages.\n  Although we face new national security threats, our Government's \nresponse is built on the talents and dedication of our Federal \nworkforce. Recently the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st \nCentury, also known as the Hart-Rudman Commission, concluded that ``. . \n. the excellence of American public servants is the foundation upon \nwhich an effective national security strategy must rest . . . because \nfuture success will require\n\n[[Page S12861]]\n\nthe mastery of advanced technology . . . as well as leading-edge \nconcepts of governance.''\n  The recent terrorist attacks strengthened our will and exposed the \nweaknesses of our great country. We were quickly reminded of the \nimportance of our Federal Government and its workforce. For every \nessential service these attacks disrupted, we expected our government \nto respond quickly and effectively, and those in government did.\n  However, the events of September 11 and the anthrax attacks through \nthe mails underscored how much government needs people with the \ncritical skills to fill critical national security positions. We need \nto recruit the best people with the best skills and ensure that \ngovernment service remains attractive. Our legislation does that.\n  The Homeland Security Federal Workforce Act and the Homeland Security \nEducation Act provide needed tools and resources to agencies expressly \nfor hiring new employees in critical national security positions and \nestablishes a student loan repayment program and fellowships to future \nand current federal employees in exchange for government service.\n  It provides additional training opportunities for the great people \nalready committed to the Federal service whose expertise guide agencies \ndaily in meeting their missions. For example, Federal employees in \nnational security positions will be eligible to apply for fellowships, \nwhich includes full tuition and a stipend, to pursue degrees in fields \ndeemed critical to national security.\n  Our bills also respond to future national security needs by helping \nschools better prepare students for the demands of the 21st century. We \nmust act now to identify and develop the right balance of skills in \nscience, math, and foreign languages. We must make resources available \nto our schools and their teachers so that our students graduate with a \ngreater proficiency in these areas.\n  The bills will strengthen the specific foreign language skills that \nthe Government has identified as critical to our national security. We \nwould help establish an advanced foreign language program that matches \nforeign language program efforts in leading universities with national \nsecurity requirements.\n  I would like to note that the University of Hawaii is recognized as a \nmodel university in foreign language instruction and is noted for the \nstrength of its faculty and curriculum particularly in Mandarin \nChinese, Korean, and Japanese, language deemed important by the Defense \nLanguage Institute. The University of Hawaii is also an authority in \nthe development of enhanced foreign language teaching methods.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to see that this \nbipartisan legislation is passed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Hutchinson, and Mr. \n        Smith of New Hampshire):\n  S. 1804. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives for economic recovery and provide for the payment of \nemergency extended unemployment compensation; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the economy has been struggling for \nabout a year now. We have had a number of difficulties that have made \nour economy not as healthy as we would like it to be. Oddly enough, for \nthe week of September 11, according to the hearing we had in the Joint \nEconomic Committee, unemployment actually dropped. There was an \nincrease in employment that week. So maybe our economy was moving in \nthe right direction. But immediately after September 11, and the shock \nthis Nation went through, we slipped back into what has now been called \na recession.\n  Factories are closing in a number of places. Quite a few have closed \nin my State. It has been quite discouraging that this tends to happen \nmore often in small towns where you have just a few businesses. That is \nwhere you see more of the closings than in the urban areas.\n  The National Bureau of Economic Research has declared that we have \nslipped into recession. And the terrorist attacks have hurt us in a lot \nof different ways involving jobs for families in America. So I have \nbeen pushing for some time that we make sure we complete this Congress \nwith a good, healthy stimulus package.\n  I have raised that observation with quite a number of people. But we \nare not, to my knowledge, making any progress. I have referred to the \npeople who I understand are working on it as ``the masters of the \nuniverse.'' They are back there somewhere outside of this Chamber, \nworking and manipulating and talking to people about what ought to be \nin the package. And, yes, they take input, and I have talked to them, \nand other people have talked to them--and I did not suggest it is not a \ntough job; it is a tough job--but we are getting close to the time when \nwe should recess, and people are suggesting that we might even complete \nthis Congress without a stimulus package. I think that would be a very \nbad mistake.\n  Even the most conservative economists have suggested we would have a \none-half of 1 percent increase in the GDP if we have a stimulus package \nof $75 billion to $100 billion. I believe that is clearly worth the \neffort. That one-half of 1 percent, in an economy as large as ours, is \nvery significant. It means many people will continue to have jobs that \nthey would not have otherwise. It means that many people will be \nworking and paying taxes to the Government which will help us with our \ndeficit situation. It means many people will be working and taking care \nof their families and not going into debt and will be buying things, \nsuch as at the grocery store, that they would not otherwise be buying.\n  So I think we need to be sure we move in that direction. That is why \nI have offered today S. 1804, which is cosponsored by Senators Tim \nHutchinson, George Allen, and Bob Smith. And I intend to move this bill \nif we do not see progress. Really, I intend to seek a vote on it if it \nis in any way appropriate and possible this session.\n  Let me mention a few things that are in the bill which I think are \ncommon sense and would be good policy. One of the things I have been \nwrestling with is the earned-income tax credit. This is a program that \nbegan in 1975. It is now a $31 billion program that provides a tax \ncredit to low-income working Americans. It is designed to make work \nmore beneficial and more rewarding so that, particularly, families can \nlive off of low-income jobs. In fact, the program is quite generous for \na family of four or more who qualify appropriately. They can receive \n$4,000 a year. An average family with one qualifying child, that \nreceives the earned-income tax credit, receives almost $2,000 a year. \nOn average, it is over $1,900 per year that they receive.\n  This totals out, if you figure it on an hourly basis for the average \nfamily of four that receives the earned-income tax credit, to almost $1 \nan hour pay raise over whatever they are making. If they are making $6 \nan hour and they get another $1, that is a big increase. If you are at \n$5 an hour and you get $1 an hour, that is a 20-percent increase in \nyour pay. It is more than that in take-home because you don't have any \nwithholding out of a tax credit.\n  The way this thing has been working, however, is not healthy. The way \nthis thing has been working is, the money goes to the worker when they \nfill out their income-tax return the next year. In February or March, \nwhen they fill out the tax return, they get this $1,900 in a lump sum \ncheck sometime in the spring after they worked.\n  Congress wrestled with that. They didn't believe that was furthering \na policy of the Congress, and so they tried to provide the credit on \nthe worker's paycheck. In years past, in the 1970s and all, when this \npassed, people didn't have the computers we have today, and requiring \nsmall businesses to calculate this and put it on the paycheck caused \nsome grief. But today, because everything is automated, it is much \neasier to do.\n  In recent years, Congress tried to do something about it. In 1978, \nthey passed legislation that said a worker could have it put on their \npaycheck if they want to. Oddly enough, only 5 percent of workers have \nchosen this or know they can.\n  Therein lies a problem, and there are several reasons. One, they \nprobably don't know about it. Another one is that oftentimes they are \ntold that if you get this advanced payment on your check instead of \ngetting a refund next year, you may owe money to the Government next \nyear. And that caused some to not take advantage of it. At\n\n[[Page S12862]]\n\nany rate, only 5 percent of Americans are taking advantage of this \npolicy.\n  I believe it ought to be the policy. I believe the policy was founded \nto begin with, with the idea of helping people, encouraging people to \ngo to work. If you are not making much more than the minimum wage, \nsometimes people may wonder if they are not better staying at home on \nwelfare. The money should be put on there. Most economists, most good \npublic policy students of the situation believe that.\n  That is one of the points of this stimulus bill that I have. Let me \ntell you why it is such a good stimulus package. It is good because the \nmoney for people who have worked this year, who receive the benefit of \nthe earned-income tax credit, they will get their refund next year.\n  What my proposal says is in January, they would begin to receive next \nyear's $1,900, on their paycheck. Current law allows a recipient to get \nabout 60 percent of their earned income tax credit in advance, on their \npaycheck. We calculate, of the $31 billion that is annually being spent \non the earned income tax credit, this proposal would bring to the \naverage worker, infused into the economy next fiscal year, $15 billion, \na year before the time it would normally be in the economy. I believe \nthat is good public policy. It is good to encourage work. It will help \npeople who need money now to take care of their families. It will be \ncoming to them in a regular way, and it will help them take care of \ntheir families.\n  That would be a good stimulus package. It would help us next year \nwhen we have to balance the budget because we would have $15 billion \nless to spend on the tax refunds because it would have been paid out \nthroughout this fiscal year. It would help us get back into a balanced \nbudget which is important. This year, we are not going to be in a \nbalanced budget. We are going to be in deficit unfortunately. Next \nyear, we have an opportunity to get out. This package in that regard \nwould help us do so.\n\n  I strongly believe that is a good thing that should be considered. It \nwould infuse money into the economy and have a net drain on the economy \nof zero over a 2-year period, except perhaps some interest loss to the \nGovernment.\n  Another matter that we believe should be in this package is a \nproposal for relief for those who are unemployed. Everybody has been \ntalking about that. We ought to be able to reach agreement on that. \nSenator Baucus had a proposal. The House Republicans had a proposal \nthat came out of that chamber. A centrist proposal has been put forward \nby Senators Collins, Smith and Landrieu that hits the area about right. \nIt increases the weeks for unemployment for up to 13 additional weeks, \nand it begins calculating that for anybody who was unemployed at the \ntime of September 11. It is more expansive in that regard. We have a \ngood bipartisan unemployment compensation package.\n  Another thing it is time for us to do would be to complete the \nreduction of the 27-percent tax bracket down to the 25-percent tax \nbracket. We committed to doing that over the 10-year tax plan. This \nwould accelerate that next year, and working Americans would receive a \nlittle more take-home money every week as a result of a reduction in \nthat tax rate. That has a lot of support.\n  One thing that has not been mentioned, but I strongly believe would \nbe one of the most beneficial proposals, is to advance the child tax \ncredit. Under our current 10-year tax reduction package that passed, we \nwill increase the child tax credit for families to $1,000, but it will \ntake nine years for it to become $1,000. I believe for next year alone \nwe ought to do that. So every family who obviously is hurt the most in \na recessionary environment would receive an additional $400 per child \ntax credit that they could use to help their families. That would be a \ngood impact.\n  The cost of that is about $20 billion in terms of estimated revenue \nlost to the Government, but it is a real stimulus into the economy, \ninto the hands of families who will be spending it on their children. \nIt will help keep the economy moving in a healthy way. That is a good \nstep. It is good public policy. Families trying to raise children would \nhave additional income to take care of them.\n  A lot of people are at a point where they have had to cash in stocks \nand other investments that they have and have taken losses for it. For \nindividuals, this allows them to deduct those losses on their tax \nreturn, but the limit on loss deductions is $3,000 per year. We believe \nthat, particularly in light of the fact that many people may be cashing \nin investments, we should at least raise it up to $5,000 per year which \ncould be helpful to people in desperate circumstances.\n  One other thing that is important--and Senator Allen has been a \nchampion of this and has won me over--is the need to provide a tax \ncredit to encourage American families to become technologically \nliterate, to encourage American families to purchase computers for \nchildren who are in school so they will have a computer at home so they \ncan become a part of the high-tech world that is all about us today. He \nhas proposed, and we have put as a part of this bill, a $500 tax credit \nfor the purchase of software or computer systems for a family. To \nreally get a jolt out of it, we are only going to propose that for a 3-\nmonth period. And the computer companies, I am sure, and all the \nmarketing companies and the stores will be promoting that you have a \n$500 rebate on your purchase of a computer for your family, if you have \na student in school.\n\n  I think that is a good step. The computer industry has been hurting \nbadly, and having this money available could get them off the ground, \nget them moving again and, at the same time, help children, help them \nbecome educated and to become an active part of the high-tech world in \nwhich we now live.\n  Some of the matters that are in the legislation we proposed, I don't \nbelieve there is a single thing in it that somebody could say is a \nspecial interest. It has a business provision. It has Senator Baucus's \n10-percent advance depreciation, which would encourage businesses to \npurchase equipment and allow them to depreciate a little faster, and \nencourage them, perhaps, to recapitalize in their business. That was \nSenator Baucus's 1-year proposal.\n  I don't believe there is anything in this bill that does violence to \nfairness or justice. I don't think there is anything in this bill that \nin any way could be considered special interest or unfair. I believe we \nhave a simple package--myself and the three Senators who have \nintroduced this with me--that would infuse $75 billion into the \neconomy, with virtually no bureaucracy, virtually no overhead, targeted \nto middle and lower income America--putting $75 billion into their \nhands early, allowing them to spend it and get this economy going \nagain.\n  I am not sure businesses--and I have heard a number of economists say \nthis--are in a mood to do a lot of investing in new equipment to \nproduce a lot more product if there is nobody to buy. So I think that \nthe way we proceed would be to allow people who have families and who \nwork every day, and who need every dollar they get to survive--give \nthem a little bit more to take home. If they do, they will spend it and \nhelp get the economy moving again. If nothing else, it will help them \nget by, whether it improves the economy or not.\n\n  Of course, we do have $5 billion in grant money to the States that \nwould allow them to deal with emergency situations in their States for \npeople who are hurting also. That has been a bipartisan project, and it \nhas a little more than has been proposed in the President's request. We \nthink that is a good figure that everybody can rally around.\n  I believe getting a tax stimulus package together and passed is not \nthat hard. It doesn't have to be lockstep the way everybody is \nnegotiating now. They have dug in on every position. Some of the issues \nin my package they are dealing with and some of them they are not \nconsidering. My provisions do the job just as well--in fact, better \nthan what I am hearing discussed in a lot of ways.\n  I think the majority leader needs to be sure we don't get to the end \nof this session without time to bring this up. If they can't reach an \nagreement, we are going to have a problem. The bill was up and \namendments were being offered. When debate and amendments were not shut \noff, the bill was pulled down. It has gone behind closed doors and we \nare sitting around here saying: Maybe they will reach an agreement; \nmaybe they will not reach an agreement.\n\n[[Page S12863]]\n\n  I have a bill that I think we need to vote on if we can't get some \nagreement with which I and other Members are comfortable. We need to \nvote on this bill because it is a good bill. It is not that complicated \nin any way to administer or put together.\n  I thank the Chair for her attention. I look forward to further \ndiscussions on this issue. I certainly look forward to making sure \nbefore this Congress recesses we bring up and pass legislation that \nwill help this economy. I don't know how much it would take to do it. \nThe experts say $75 billion is worth half a GDP percentage point in \ngrowth. That is good news. I think it is exactly the kind of shot that \nmight be helpful.\n  If we don't pass something, that could be a sad event also. In fact, \nthe markets and people might lose confidence even more than they have \nalready if we don't pass a stimulus package. It is a double burden to \nmove that forward.\n  I thank the Chair for listening. I thank my colleagues in the Senate \nfor their consideration of this legislation. We look forward to making \nsure a stimulus package clears before we recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \n        Graham, Ms. Collins, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1806. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect \nto health professions programs regarding the practice of pharmacy; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise today, joined by my colleagues, \nSenator Johnson of South Dakota and Senator Enzi of Wyoming, to \nintroduce legislation that will address the growing shortage of \npharmacists.\n  The Pharmacists Education Act takes a multi-faceted approach to the \nproblem of workforce shortages in the pharmacy sector. In December \n2000, the Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA, Bureau of \nHealth Professions published a report entitled, ``The Pharmacist \nWorkforce: A Study of the Supply and Demand for Pharmacists''. This \nstudy considered the factors influencing the demand for pharmacists in \nthe health care sector and also looked at the ability of our academic \ninstitutions to supply the quantity of pharmacy students required to \nmeet this growing demand. The report concluded that there was indeed \nevidence of a shortage in the field, due primarily to the rapid \nincrease in demand for pharmacists and the array of services they \nprovide, coupled with a constrained ability to expand the number of \npharmacy education programs to accommodate the need for more practicing \npharmacists. The study also indicated that the shortage was unlikely to \nabate in the future without significant changes to the current system.\n  Pharmacists represent the third largest health professional group in \nthe United States with about 190,000 active pharmacists last year. This \nfigure is expected to grow to 224, 500 by 2010. Yet, despite this \nanticipated increase in the number of practicing pharmacists, the \ndemand for the services is expected to continue to outpace supply. A \nrecent employment survey conducted by the National Association of Chain \nDrug stores found that the number of vacancies among their member \ncompanies had increased by 1,000 positions in the last six months \nalone.\n  Remarkable advancements in medical science have made treatments for \ndiseases once thought impossible to treat a reality. And what is \npossible is quickly what is practiced in the medical profession. Many \nof these dynamic breakthroughs have been in the area of \npharmaceuticals.\n  These remarkable changes in health care have resulted in dramatic \nupswings in the number of retail prescriptions dispensed annually, from \n1.9 billion in 1992 to 2.8 billion in 1999. Moreover, as medications \nbecome more complex and diverse, and our population becomes older and \nsicker, the role of the pharmacist in the health care setting has \nbecome evermore important. For these reasons, my colleagues and I felt \nit was very important that steps be taken to avert a more serious \nshortage of these critical health professionals.\n  The Pharmacy Education Act seeks to enhance not only the supply of \npharmacists, by providing much needed support to Colleges of Pharmacy, \nit also aims to improve the distribution of pharmacists by building \nupon the National Health Service Corps. Specifically, the bill expands \neligibility of certain existing Federal grant programs to Colleges of \nPharmacy to upgrade and expand facilities and laboratory space and \nrecruit and retain talented faculty to educate pharmacy students.\n  The bill also provides a number of new sources of financial aid to \nstudents interested in pursuing a career in pharmacy. First, the bill \nallows students entering pharmacy school and students who have \ngraduated with a PharmD degree to apply for National Health Service \nCorps, NHSC, Scholarship and Loan Repayment funds. Second, it allows \nstudents who demonstrate financial need to apply for scholarships to \nqualifying schools of pharmacy.\n  This bill is endorsed by a number of organizations, including the \nAmerican Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, the National Association \nof Chain Drug Stores, National Community Pharmacists Association, \nAmerican College of Clinical Pharmacy and American Society of Health-\nSystem Pharmacists.\n  Increasing demand for pharmacists makes it imperative that a \nproactive response to current trends be undertaken before the situation \nbecomes critical. I hope my colleagues will join me in seeking \nexpeditious consideration and passage of this timely and important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Pharmacy Education Act \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1806\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pharmacy Education Aid Act \n     of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Pharmacists are an important link in our Nation's \n     health care system. A critical shortage of pharmacists is \n     threatening the ability of pharmacies to continue to provide \n     important prescription related services.\n       (2) In the landmark report entitled ``To Err is Human: \n     Building a Safer Health System'', the Institute of Medicine \n     reported that medication errors can be partially attributed \n     to factors that are indicative of a shortage of pharmacists \n     (such as too many customers, numerous distractions, and staff \n     shortages).\n       (3) Congress acknowledged in the Healthcare Research and \n     Quality Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-129) a growing demand for \n     pharmacists by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services to conduct a study to determine whether there is a \n     shortage of pharmacists in the United States and, if so, to \n     what extent.\n       (4) As a result of Congress' concern about how a shortage \n     of pharmacists would impact the public health, the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services published a report entitled \n     ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study in Supply and Demand for \n     Pharmacists'' in December of 2000.\n       (5) The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study in Supply and Demand \n     for Pharmacists'' found that ``While the overall supply of \n     pharmacists has increased in the past decade, there has been \n     an unprecedented demand for pharmacists and for \n     pharmaceutical care services, which has not been met by the \n     currently available supply'' and that the ``evidence clearly \n     indicates the emergence of a shortage of pharmacists over the \n     past two years''.\n       (6) The same study also found that ``The factors causing \n     the current shortage are of a nature not likely to abate in \n     the near future without fundamental changes in pharmacy \n     practice and education.'' The study projects that the number \n     of prescriptions filled by community pharmacists will \n     increase by 20 percent by 2004. In contrast, the number of \n     community pharmacists is expected to increase by only 6 \n     percent by 2005.\n       (7) The demand for pharmacists will increase as \n     prescription drug use continues to grow.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Madam President, for many years I have spoken at length, \nboth on and off of the Senate floor, about the need to curb pork barrel \nspending and reduce overall government waste. Around this time each \nyear, I often engage in lengthy debates over the latest excesses in the \nappropriations bills, which, almost invariably, are stuffed to the \ngills with earmarks and pet projects.\n  It was noted last week that H.R. 3338, this year's $317 billion \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations bill, was the most expensive \nappropriations bill to ever pass the United States Senate. Unlike some \nof my colleagues, I do not believe this is something for which we \ndeserve praise. Bills like H.R. 3338, before it was modified due to the \nefforts of other Republican Senators who share my concern, are prime \nexamples of how we are failing the American taxpayers who foot the bill \nfor our excesses.\n  Time and again, I have called my colleagues' attention to the harmful \npractice of earmarking, of putting parochial interests before national \nones, and of funding projects in an ad hoc manner devoid of a unifying \npolicy or goal.\n  Last week, Secretary Rumsfeld, after briefing a group of Senators \nabout the war effort, was asked what the Senate could do to help. One \nof several requests by the Secretary was that we in Senate stop funding \nprojects the military did not ask for or need. As my colleague from \nArizona, Senator Kyl, recounted last Friday night during debate on the \nDoD appropriations bill, the reaction to this statement was ``other \nthan that, what can we do?\"\n  Today I offer an answer. It is premised on the recognition that part \nof the problem lies in the current structure of the Senate, which \ndelegates to separate committees the functions of authorization and \nappropriating funds. Currently, there are no effective restrictions on \nfunding projects that have not been considered by a single committee \nwith technical expertise and broad policy perspective. I should mention \nthat I do not necessarily think these are the authorizing committees.\n  To help provide a unified, uniform policy basis for our spending of \ntaxpayers' money, I am introducing a resolution today to reorganize the \ncommittees of the United States Senate with the hope of helping to \neliminate spending on unauthorized and unconsidered pet projects.\n  Under this Resolution most of the existing committees would be \ndissolved and reconstituted as policy, administrative, or leadership \ncommittees. The Resolution would merge the functions of the authorizing \nand appropriations committees by having members of the existing \nappropriations subcommittees serve with current members of the existing \nauthorizing committee on newly created ``policy committees'' that \ncorrespond to the issues they currently cover.\n  This resolution is not a new idea. It was introduced during four \nprevious Congresses by one of our former colleagues, Nancy Kassebaum. I \nwas a proud cosponsor of this legislation then, and I find it \nparticularly timely now. This is a sound proposal for real reform, and \nI hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/11/senate-section/article/S12868-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12868-S12869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 190--AUTHORIZING THE TAKING OF A PHOTOGRAPH IN THE \n                  CHAMBER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE\n\n   Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Lott) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 92\n\n       Whereas on May 1, 1951, Radio Free Europe inaugurated its \n     full schedule of broadcast services to the people of Eastern \n     Europe and, subsequently, Radio Liberty initiated its \n     broadcast services to the peoples of the Soviet Union on \n     March 1, 1953, just before the death of Stalin;\n       Whereas now fifty years later, Radio Free Europe/Radio \n     Liberty (in this concurrent resolution referred to as ``RFE/\n     RL'') continues to promote democracy and human rights and \n     serve United States national interests by fulfilling its \n     mission ``to promote democratic values and institutions by \n     disseminating factual information and ideas'';\n       Whereas Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty were \n     established in the darkest days of the cold war as a \n     substitute for the free media which no longer existed in the \n     communist-dominated countries of Central and Eastern Europe \n     and the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty developed a \n     unique form of international broadcasting known as surrogate \n     broadcasting by airing local news about the countries to \n     which they broadcast as well as providing regional and \n     international news, thus preventing the communist governments \n     from establishing a monopoly on the dissemination of \n     information and providing an alternative to the state-\n     controlled, party dominated domestic media;\n       Whereas the broadcast of uncensored news and information by \n     Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty was a critical element \n     contributing to the collapse of the totalitarian communist \n     governments of Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet \n     Union;\n       Whereas since the fall of the Iron Curtain, RFE/RL has \n     continued to inform and therefore strengthen democratic \n     forces in Central Europe and the countries of the former \n     Soviet Union, and has contributed to the development of a new \n     generation of political and economic leaders who have worked \n     to strengthen civil society, free market economies, and \n     democratic government institutions;\n       Whereas United States Government funding established and \n     continues to support international broadcasting, including \n     RFE/RL, and this funding is among the most useful and \n     effective in promoting and enhancing the Nation's national \n     security over the past half century;\n       Whereas RFE/RL has successfully downsized in response to \n     legislative mandate and adapted its programming to the \n     changing international broadcast environment in order to \n     serve a broad spectrum of target audiences--people living in \n     fledgling democracies where private media are still weak and \n     do not enjoy full editorial independence, transitional \n     societies where democratic institutions and practices are \n     poorly developed, as well as countries which still have \n     tightly controlled state media;\n       Whereas RFE/RL continues to provide objective news, \n     analysis, and discussion of domestic and regional issues \n     crucial to democratic and free-market transformations in \n     emerging democracies as well as strengthening civil society \n     in these areas;\n       Whereas RFE/RL broadcasts seek to combat ethnic, racial, \n     and religious intolerance and promote mutual understanding \n     among peoples;\n       Whereas RFE/RL provides a model for local media, assists in \n     training to encourage media professionalism and independence, \n     and develops partnerships with local media outlets in \n     emerging democracies;\n       Whereas RFE/RL is a unique broadcasting institution long \n     regarded by its audience as an alternative national media \n     that provides both credibility and security for local \n     journalists who work as its stringers and editors in the \n     broadcast region; and\n       Whereas RFE/RL fosters closer relations between the United \n     States and other democratic states, and the states of Central \n     Europe and the former Soviet republics: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) congratulates the editors, journalists, and managers of \n     Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on a half century of effort \n     in promoting democratic values, and particularly their \n     contribution to promoting freedom of the press and freedom of \n     expression in areas of the world where such liberties have \n     been denied or are not yet fully institutionalized; and\n       (2) recognizes the major contribution of Radio Free Europe/\n     Radio Liberty to the growth of democracy throughout the world \n     and its continuing efforts to advance the vital national \n     interests of the United States in building a world community \n     that is more peaceful, democratic, free, and stable.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, amidst the focus and sustained attention \nwe have all had on the matters of the first global war of the 21st \ncentury, we do not wish to miss the 50th year anniversary of one of the \nmost important tools developed in our foreign policy arsenal in the \n20th century. I am referring to the 50th anniversary of the \ninauguration of Radio Free Europe, which first broadcast its full \nschedule of radio programming into central and eastern Europe on May 1, \nInternational Workers' Day, one of the most famous communist holidays, \nin 1951.\n  Two years later, Radio Liberty began its broadcasting programs to the \npeoples of the Soviet Union. An era of puncturing the state-imposed \nsilence of totalitarian regimes had begun.\n  Today, I am happy to submit a resolution commemorating the 50 years \nof the ``Radios,'' as they have come to be known. I am happy to have as \nco-sponsors the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, as well as Senator Kennedy and Senator Smith of \nOregon.\n  The Radios were the main component in what some would call America's \npropaganda efforts. Along with the Voice of America, which broadcasts \nabout American affairs throughout the world, revealing to audiences \nrestricted from freedom of the media the real stories of this country, \nthe Radios were a central tool in broadcasting local news and \ninformation back into the captive countries of central and eastern \nEurope and Eurasia.\n  Totalitarian communism required complete government control of every \naspect of society, that is what totalitarianism is. In addition to \ncontrolling every aspect of an individual's life, totalitarianism \nrequired that all information, be it cultural, educational or \ninformational, must also be controlled. Totalitarianism cannot \nfunction, communism cannot dominate, tyranny cannot succeed, if they \nmust compete with independent media that promotes a free exchange of \nideas and views.\n  That was the role of the Radios. It was an understanding of this \nbasic dynamic of totalitarian communism which led our policymakers, 50 \nyears ago, to realize that one of the most effective, in fact, most \nthreatening, tools we could deploy was the use of a free media. And \nthus was born the Radios, Radio Free Europe for broadcasting to eastern \nand central Europe and Radio Liberty for broadcasting into the Soviet \nUnion's realm.\n  When peoples' minds can grasp differing views, news not controlled by \nthe state, then the state does not completely own them. When the state \ncannot own them, the state will eventually have to serve, not dominate, \nits citizens.\n  It is the freedom of information, wedded to technology, originally \nradio, then television, now the Internet, that gave hope, that \nsustained resistance and that ultimately made one of the central \ncontributions to the collapse of these regimes against which we waged a \nCold War through the latter half of the 20th century.\n  Now, 50 years after their inception, it is fitting that we pass this \nresolution to honor the Radios and their many contributors, editors, \njournalists, broadcasters and technicians, who staffed them through all \nof these years.\n  It is also worthwhile, as we pause to honor this mission, to \nrecognize that the Radios had bipartisan support throughout these \nyears. America's foreign policy, after all, is most vibrant, most \ndynamic, most successful, when it operates with bipartisan support. \nThat is why our colleagues in the House passed this concurrent \nresolution with 404 votes.\n  It is also worthwhile to note that there are very valuable lessons to \nbe learned from this successful aspect of American foreign policy, and \nto recognize that the supporters of the Radios have, in fact, applied \nthese lessons to the new post-Cold War context.\n  Yes, it has become a cliche in the past 10 years that we are in a \n``post-Cold War'' era. The question that has remained largely \nunanswered, however, is how does the U.S. respond to this era? Some \nhave suggested that we reached an ``end of history,'' where liberal \ndemocracy essentially triumphs around the globe. Some suggested that \nthe end of geopolitical competition in a bipolar era would reduce \nAmerica's role or obligations in the world.\n  In response, some have suggested, more caustically and in retrospect \nsince that dark September 11 day, that America went on holiday for the \nlast 10\n\n[[Page S12870]]\n\nyears, eschewing our vigilance against global threats and riding on a \nhistoric wave of prosperity underlined by a false assumption that \neconomic growth eliminated all global challenges and threats.\n\n  An American foreign policy expert noted, shortly after the end of the \nCold War, that ``the world has changed the way it looks, but not the \nway it works.'' I agree. There still remain regimes that oppress their \npeoples; there still remain movements that see the United States as \ntheir enemy; there still remain forces that seek to destroy us.\n  It is no coincidence that these regimes and movements depend on \ncontrolling and suppressing freedom of thought and expression wherever \nthey hold sway. None of the countries on our terrorism list has free \nmedia. And certainly one of the most repressive regimes in recent \nmemory was that of the now defunct and despicable Taliban regime.\n  Our colleagues have introduced legislation promoting a ``Radio Free \nAfghanistan'' to assist the transition to a post-Taliban era for that \nnation we abandoned and neglected for the last decade. My colleague, \nSenator Biden, in response to the September 11 attacks, has correctly \nnoted that there is much, much more that we can do in terms of \nbroadcasting accurate news and information to large parts of the Arab \nand Islamic world. Senator Biden has a long-standing dedication to \nthese broadcasting tools of our foreign policy. I have seen his first \nproposal for an enhanced international broadcasting function, and am \nanxious to support it.\n  As those who have always supported the Radios know, a lot of the \nlessons for our future use of surrogate broadcasting comes from the \nlessons learned through the Radios since 1989. The Radios themselves \nhave evolved. No longer broadcasting into closed societies, they have \nadapted their mission to the changed circumstances, they have become \nkey players in these societies in transition. As a result of \ncongressional oversight and the leadership of the Radios, the Radios \nhave reshaped their missions to support the transition to democracy of \nthe many nations of the former communist bloc, who are all in various \nstages of transition, some fully democratic, others struggling, and \neven others backsliding.\n  One of the most disturbing aspects of America's temporary retreat \nfollowing the end of the Cold War was the notion that, with communism \ndefeated, these societies of the former Soviet bloc would inevitably \nblossom into stable democracies. This has proved contrary to history, \nand, as we saw in many cases during the 1990s, was contrary to fact. \nWhile communism is defeated, a stable democratic society must be \ndeveloped and nurtured, often by well-meaning citizens with little \nexperience of the societies they seek to achieve. Central in effecting \nthis transition is a free media, and I am happy to say that the Radios \nare playing a key role, a role carefully calibrated to their stages of \npolitical and economic development.\n  In societies still governed by repressive regimes, such as Belarus \nand Turkmenistan, the Radios continue to broadcast news that the local \npopulations can trust and continue to puncture state-controlled media \nwith fresh and objective analysis. In transition societies, such as \nRussia and Serbia, the Radios, in addition to providing useful news and \nanalysis, provide a model of modern, professional media that these \nsocieties study and use to advance their own nascent media \ninstitutions.\n  America does not have all of the ideas, nor all of the solutions, to \nthe problems of the world. But our system is based on the fundamental \nconviction that there must be a free exchange of ideas. And history has \ndemonstrated that we have worked best, most productively, most \npeacefully, with nations that share this conviction. The Radios both \nemulated this fundamental principle and applied it to advance our \nnational security. Let us pause for a moment and recognize this by \npassing this resolution commemorating their 50th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/11/senate-section/article/S12870-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2467.

and\n       (ii) ending discriminatory pricing practices for \n     agricultural commodities that amount to de facto export \n     subsidies so that the enterprises or other mechanisms do not \n     (except in cases of bona fide food aid) sell agricultural \n     commodities in foreign markets at prices below domestic \n     market prices or prices below the full costs of acquiring and \n     delivering agricultural commodities to the foreign markets;\n       (B) unjustified trade restrictions or commercial \n     requirements affecting new agricultural technologies, \n     including biotechnology;\n       (C) unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary restrictions, \n     including restrictions that are not based on scientific \n     principles, in contravention of the Agreement on the \n     Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (as \n     described in section 101(d)(3) of the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(3)));\n       (D) other unjustified technical barriers to agricultural \n     trade;

or\n       (C) manipulated its currency value to the detriment of \n     United States agricultural producers or exporters; and\n       (7) otherwise ensuring that countries that accede to the \n     World Trade Organization--\n       (A) have made meaningful market liberalization commitments \n     in agriculture; and\n       (B) make progress in fulfilling those commitments over \n     time.\n       (b) Priority for Agriculture Trade.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that--\n       (1) reaching a successful agreement on agriculture should \n     be the top priority of United States negotiators in World \n     Trade Organization talks; and\n       (2) if the primary export competitors of the United States \n     fail to reduce their trade distorting domestic supports and \n     eliminate export subsidies in accordance with the negotiating \n     objectives expressed in this section, the United States \n     should take steps to increase the leverage of United States \n     negotiators and level the playing field for United States \n     producers, within existing World Trade Organization \n     commitments.\n       (c) Consultation with Congressional Committees.--It is the \n     sense of Congress that--\n       (1) before the United States Trade Representative \n     negotiates a trade agreement that would reduce tariffs on \n     agricultural commodities or require a change in United States \n     agricultural law, the United States Trade Representative \n     should consult with the Committee on Agriculture and the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives \n     and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and \n     the Committee on Finance of the Senate;\n       (2) not less than 48 hours before initialing an agreement \n     relating to agricultural trade negotiated under the auspices \n     of the World Trade Organization, the United States Trade \n     Representative should consult closely with the committees \n     referred to in paragraph (1) regarding--\n       (A) the details of the agreement;\n       (B) the potential impact of the agreement on United States \n     agricultural producers;

SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) the United States is becoming increasingly dependent on \n     nonindustrial private forest land to supply necessary market \n     commodities and nonmarket conservation values;\n       (B) there is a strong demand for expanded assistance \n     programs for owners of nonindustrial private forest land \n     because the majority of the wood supply of the United States \n     comes from nonindustrial private forest land;\n       (C) soil, water, and air quality, fish and wildlife \n     habitat, aesthetic values, and opportunities for outdoor \n     recreation in the United States would be maintained and \n     improved through good stewardship of nonindustrial private \n     forest land;\n       (D) the products and services resulting from stewardship of \n     nonindustrial private forest land contribute to the economic, \n     social, and ecological health and diversity of rural \n     communities;\n       (E) catastrophic wildfires threaten human lives, property, \n     forests, and other resources;\n       (F) Federal and State cooperation in forest fire prevention \n     and control has proven effective and valuable because \n     properly managed forest stands are less susceptible to \n     catastrophic fire, as demonstrated by the catastrophic fire \n     seasons of 1998 and 2000;\n       (G) owners of nonindustrial private forest land face \n     increased pressure to make that land available for \n     development and other uses, resulting in forest land loss and \n     fragmentation that reduces the ability of private forest land \n     to provide a full range of societal benefits;\n       (H) complex investments in the management of long-rotation \n     forest stands, including sustainable hardwood management, are \n     often the most difficult commitments for owners of \n     nonindustrial private forest land;\n       (I) the investment of a single Federal dollar in State and \n     private forestry programs is estimated to leverage, on the \n     average, $9 from State, local, and private sources; and\n       (J) comprehensive, multiresource planning assistance made \n     available to each landowner before the provision of technical \n     assistance would provide an opportunity to ensure that the \n     landowner is aware of the many projects and activities \n     eligible for cost-share assistance.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to strengthen the commitment of the Secretary to \n     sustainable forest management to enhance the productivity of \n     timber, fish and wildlife habitat, soil and water quality, \n     wetland, recreational resources, and aesthetic values of \n     forest land; and\n       (B) to establish a coordinated and cooperative Federal, \n     State, and local sustainable forestry program for the \n     establishment, management, maintenance, enhancement, and \n     restoration of forests on nonindustrial private forest land.\n       (b) Program.--The Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of \n     1978 is amended by inserting after section 6 (16 U.S.C. \n     2103b) the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 6A.

Res. 140, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 140\n\n       Whereas the United States embarks on this new millennium as \n     the world's model of democratic ideals, economic enterprise, \n     and technological innovation and discovery;\n       Whereas our Nation's preeminence is a tribute to our great \n     2-century-old experiment in representative government that \n     nurtures those ideals, fosters economic vitality, and \n     encourages innovation and discovery;\n       Whereas representative government is dependent on the \n     exercise of the privileges and responsibilities of its \n     citizens, and that has been in decline in recent years in \n     both civic and political participation;\n       Whereas Alexis de Tocqueville, the 19th century French \n     chronicler of our Nation's political behavior, observed that \n     the people of the United States had successfully resisted \n     democratic apathy and mild despotism by using what he called \n     ``schools of freedom''--local institutions and associations \n     where citizens learn to listen and trust each other;\n       Whereas civic and political participation remains the \n     school in which citizens engage in the free, diverse, and \n     positive political dialogue that guides our Nation toward \n     common interests, consensus, and good governance;\n       Whereas it is in the public interest for our Nation's \n     leaders to foster civic discourse, education, and \n     participation in Federal, State, and local affairs;\n       Whereas the advent of revolutionary Internet technology \n     offers new mechanisms for empowering our citizens and \n     fostering greater civic engagement than at any time in our \n     peacetime history; and\n       Whereas the use of new technologies can bring people \n     together in civic forums, educate citizens on their roles and \n     responsibilities, and promote citizen participation in the \n     political process through volunteerism, voting, and the \n     elevation of voices in public discourse: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL CIVIC PARTICIPATION WEEK.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning September 15, 2002, as \n     ``National Civic Participation Week'';\n       (2) proclaims National Civic Participation Week as a week \n     of inauguration of programs and activities that will lead to \n     greater participation in elections and the political process; \n     and\n       (3) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon interested organizations and the people of the \n     United States to promote programs and activities that take \n     full advantage of the technological resources available in \n     fostering civic participation through the dissemination of \n     information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/11/senate-section/article/S12984-4", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12984-S12985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING BARRY BONDS\n\n  On December 10, 2001, the Senate amended and passed S.

Res. 178\n\n       Whereas Barry Bonds has brought distinction to Major League \n     Baseball and excellence to the San Francisco Giants, \n     following in the baseball footsteps of his father, Bobby \n     Bonds, and his godfather, Willie Mays;\n       Whereas Barry Bonds has had an outstanding career that so \n     far includes an unprecedented 4 Most Valuable Player awards, \n     10 All-Star Game appearances, 8 Rawlings Gold Glove awards, \n     and the distinction of being named Player of the Decade for \n     the 1990s by the Sporting News;\n       Whereas in 2001, Barry Bonds had 1 of the greatest seasons \n     in Major League Baseball\n\n[[Page S12985]]\n\n     history, achieving 73 home runs, a slugging average of .863, \n     and an on-base percentage of .515;\n       Whereas Barry Bonds has established himself as the most \n     prolific single-season home run hitter in Major League \n     Baseball history, hitting his 73d home run on October 7, \n     2001, eclipsing the previous record of 70 home runs set by \n     Mark McGwire in 1998;\n       Whereas Barry Bonds has attained the rank of 7th place on \n     the all-time Major League Baseball home run list with 567;\n       Whereas Barry Bonds drove in 136 runs to set a Giants \n     franchise record for runs batted in by a left fielder, and \n     has recorded at least 100 RBI's in each of 10 different \n     seasons;\n       Whereas of Barry Bonds's 73 home runs, 24 gave San \n     Francisco the lead and 7 tied the game;\n       Whereas Barry Bonds also hit the 500th home run of his \n     career during the 2001 season, a 2-run game-winning home run \n     which landed in the waters of McCovey Cove, San Francisco;\n       Whereas Barry Bonds, at age 37, is the oldest player in \n     Major League Baseball history to hit more than 50, 60, and 70 \n     home runs in a single season;\n       Whereas Barry Bonds has recorded 484 stolen bases in his \n     career, becoming the only Major League Baseball player to \n     both hit more than 400 home runs and steal more than 400 \n     bases;\n       Whereas Barry Bonds's 233 stolen bases achieved while \n     playing for San Francisco place him 6th on the Giants \n     franchise list behind his father, Bobby, who is 5th with 263 \n     stolen bases;\n       Whereas Barry Bonds has proven himself to be an active \n     leader not only in the Giants clubhouse but also in the \n     community, donating approximately $100,000 to the September \n     11th Fund to aid the victims of the terrorist attacks in New \n     York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas Barry Bonds has also devoted his time and money to \n     support the Link & Learn Program of the United Way, and has \n     been an active participant in numerous other San Francisco \n     Bay area community efforts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates Barry Bonds on his spectacular record-\n     breaking season in 2001 and outstanding career in Major \n     League Baseball;\n       (2) wishes Barry Bonds continued success in the seasons to \n     come; and\n       (3) thanks Barry Bonds for his contributions to baseball \n     and to his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/11/senate-section/article/S12985-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AUTHORIZATION OF SENATE CHAMBER PHOTOGRAPH\n\n  Mr. REID.

STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to support the people \n     of Zimbabwe in their struggle to effect peaceful, democratic \n     change, achieve broad-based and equitable economic growth, \n     and restore the rule of law.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) International financial institutions.--The term \n     ``international financial institutions'' means the \n     multilateral development banks and the International Monetary \n     Fund.\n       (2) Multilateral development banks.--The term \n     ``multilateral development banks'' means the International \n     Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International \n     Development Association, the International Finance \n     Corporation, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian \n     Development Bank, the Inter-American Investment Corporation, \n     the African Development Bank, the African Development Fund, \n     the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the \n     Multilateral Investment Guaranty Agency.\n\n     SEC. 4. SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION AND ECONOMIC \n                   RECOVERY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Through economic mismanagement, undemocratic practices, \n     and the costly deployment of troops to the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo, the Government of Zimbabwe has \n     rendered itself ineligible to participate in International \n     Bank for Reconstruction and Development and International \n     Monetary Fund programs, which would otherwise be providing \n     substantial resources to assist in the recovery and \n     modernization of Zimbabwe's economy. The people of Zimbabwe \n     have thus been denied the economic and democratic benefits \n     envisioned by the donors to such programs, including the \n     United States.\n       (2) In September 1999 the IMF suspended its support under a \n     ``Stand By Arrangement'', approved the previous month, for \n     economic adjustment and reform in Zimbabwe.\n       (3) In October 1999, the International Development \n     Association (in this section referred to as the ``IDA'') \n     suspended all structural adjustment loans, credits, and \n     guarantees to the Government of Zimbabwe.\n       (4) In May 2000, the IDA suspended all other new lending to \n     the Government of Zimbabwe.\n       (5) In September 2000, the IDA suspended disbursement of \n     funds for ongoing projects under previously-approved loans, \n     credits, and guarantees to the Government of Zimbabwe.\n       (b) Support for Democratic Transition and Economic \n     Recovery.--\n       (1) Bilateral debt relief.--Upon receipt by the appropriate \n     congressional committees of a certification described in \n     subsection (d), the Secretary of the Treasury shall undertake \n     a review of the feasibility of restructuring, rescheduling, \n     or eliminating the sovereign debt of Zimbabwe held by any \n     agency of the United States Government.\n       (2) Multilateral debt relief and other financial \n     assistance.--It is the sense of Congress that, upon receipt \n     by the appropriate congressional committees of a \n     certification described in subsection (d), the Secretary of \n     the Treasury should--\n       (A) direct the United States executive director of each \n     multilateral development bank to propose that the bank should \n     undertake a review of the feasibility of restructuring, \n     rescheduling, or eliminating the sovereign debt of Zimbabwe \n     held by that bank; and\n       (B) direct the United States executive director of each \n     international financial institution to which the United \n     States is a member to propose to undertake financial and \n     technical support for Zimbabwe, especially support that is \n     intended to promote Zimbabwe's economic recovery and \n     development, the stabilization of the Zimbabwean dollar, and \n     the viability of Zimbabwe's democratic institutions.\n       (c) Multilateral Financing Restriction.--Until the \n     President makes the certification described in subsection \n     (d), and except as may be required to meet basic human needs \n     or for good governance, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     instruct the United States executive director to each \n     international financial institution to oppose and vote \n     against--\n       (1) any extension by the respective institution of any \n     loan, credit, or guarantee to the Government of Zimbabwe; or\n       (2) any cancellation or reduction of indebtedness owed by \n     the Government of Zimbabwe to the United States or any \n     international financial institution.\n       (d) Presidential Certification That Certain Conditions Are \n     Satisfied.--A certification under this subsection is a \n     certification transmitted to the appropriate congressional \n     committees of a determination made by the President that the \n     following conditions are satisfied:\n       (1) Restoration of the rule of law.--The rule of law has \n     been restored in Zimbabwe, including respect for ownership \n     and title to property, freedom of speech and association, and \n     an end to the lawlessness, violence, and intimidation \n     sponsored, condoned, or tolerated by the Government of \n     Zimbabwe, the ruling party, and their supporters or entities.\n       (2) Election or pre-election conditions.--Either of the \n     following two conditions is satisfied:\n       (A) Presidential election.--Zimbabwe has held a \n     presidential election that is widely accepted as free and \n     fair by independent international monitors, and the \n     president-elect is free to assume the duties of the office.\n       (B) Pre-election conditions.--In the event the \n     certification is made before the presidential election takes \n     place, the Government of Zimbabwe has sufficiently improved \n     the pre-election environment to a degree consistent with \n     accepted international standards for security and freedom of \n     movement and association.\n       (3) Commitment to equitable, legal, and transparent land \n     reform.--The Government of Zimbabwe has demonstrated a \n     commitment to an equitable, legal, and transparent land \n     reform program consistent with agreements reached at the \n     International Donors' Conference on Land Reform and \n     Resettlement in Zimbabwe held in Harare, Zimbabwe, in \n     September 1998.\n       (4) Fulfillment of agreement ending war in democratic \n     republic of congo.--The Government of Zimbabwe is making a \n     good faith effort to fulfill the terms of the Lusaka, Zambia, \n     agreement on ending the war in the Democratic Republic of \n     Congo.\n       (5) Military and national police subordinate to civilian \n     government.--The Zimbabwean Armed Forces, the National Police \n     of Zimbabwe, and other state security forces are responsible \n     to and serve the elected civilian government.\n       (e) Waiver.--The President may waive the provisions of \n     subsection (b)(1) or subsection (c), if the President \n     determines that it is in the national interest of the United \n     States to do so.\n\n     SEC. 5.
