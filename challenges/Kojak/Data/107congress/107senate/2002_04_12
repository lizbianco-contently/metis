Mr. President, I am happy to have some time this \nmorning to speak about the important issue that is before the Senate \nand has been for some time. It is very important legislation that will \nhelp us set the course of our energy policy for perhaps the next \nseveral decades.\n  While we have spent a great deal of time on this bill, I am glad we \nhave spent this time because this is one of the most, if not the most, \nimportant issue we could be addressing at this time. It relates to our \nnational security posture and it relates to the issues that are before \nour eyes and on our hearts: what is happening in the Mideast and around \nthe world.\n  Although I understand the leadership wanting to move to other issues, \nhopefully, we can have the final votes and move on to other issues.\n  I have come to this Chamber a number of times to relay what people in \nLouisiana are thinking and hoping for in this bill, and I have tried to \nexpress their frustration in some ways over what they and I also \nperceive as a conflicting policy.\n  It seems as though our Nation has a test of our will every 20 or so \nyears: Are we willing to take the steps necessary to become more energy \nindependent? The last time we had this test was in the 1970s when oil \nspiked because of international circumstances. Our gas lines were very \nlong. It put a clamp on our economy, helped to raise interest prices \nand threw our economy into a tailspin. We failed the test.\n  Over the last 25 years, we have not become more energy independent. \nWe have become more efficient. Our technologies have improved \nsignificantly in terms of environmental impacts, but we have not passed \nthe test for energy independence. It is now 25 years later and we are \ntaking this test again.\n  It is my hope that as we cast these last important votes on this \nenergy bill that we will this time pass the test and move our country \non a steady and sure march toward energy independence.\n  Instead of reducing our reliance on imported oil over the last 25 or \n30 years, we have increased our reliance on foreign oil and energy \nsources, the exact reverse of what we were hoping to do. And we have \nnot increased renewables in our energy portfolio nearly to the point \nwhere they can help us reach that self-reliance.\n  I do not have to explain to the Presiding Officer, who knows this \nissue well, or to my colleagues, how important it is for us to pass \nthis test now because it has a direct relation to our national \nsecurity. It has a direct relation to our ability to fight clearly, and \nwithout compromise, our war on terrorism. It helps us to broker a peace \nand a compromise in the Mideast based on our values of freedom and \ndemocracy.\n  I have a chart which I hope will help people understand how important \nthis is. As I said, 25 years ago we failed the test of trying to help \nour country march towards energy independence. Instead of standing \nstill, we have actually taken a reverse course. In the last 30 years, \ninstead of putting more places on the map for production of oil, gas, \ncoal, and other traditional fuels, as well as nuclear power, hydro and \nalternatives, we have actually taken places off the map.\n  So in 2002, we have this great, mighty, and very wealthy United \nStates of America that consumes more energy per capita than any nation \non Earth and any nation in the history of man, and yet we refuse to \nproduce it. We want to consume it. We do not want to produce it.\n  We have been misled to believe that we cannot produce oil and gas \nwithout great environmental damage. This is simply not true.\n  What is true is when we began producing oil and gas in the 1930s, the \n1940s, and the 1950s, prior to rules and regulations, before the \nscience was clear and before we were able to understand some of the \ngreat negative consequences, we did make a lot of environmental \nmistakes.\n  We have now minimized the risk financially, economically, as well as \nenvironmentally in our drilling, whether it is onshore or offshore. Are \nthere still problems? Yes. Are there some environmental risks \nassociated with drilling? Yes.\n  I do not know any exercise in life that is without risk. The question \nis: what is the measure and the weight of the risk? I say \nunequivocally, coming from a State that has done a lot of oil and gas \ndrilling, the benefits of drilling outweigh the environmental risks if \nrules are followed and polluters are prosecuted.\n\n  When we are free of Mideast-set oil prices it helps our Nation be \nsecure internationally. Every time violence escalates in the Mideast, \nit drives prices higher causes our economy to tailspin.\n  When our economy takes a tailspin, as I have tried to explain, it is \nnot only charts and graphs where the lines start moving. Dreams are \nshattered. Houses are lost. Businesses are lost. People lose their \njobs. Kids do not go to school. Families fall into despair. These are \nserious issues. These economic trends affect real people, in my State, \nand all over our country. Let us take a step now for more domestic \ndrilling.\n  We have no amendments to open these places shown here where moratoria \nexist. But we must consider opening drilling both on and off of our \nshores because there are rich, significant reserves of meaningful \nproportion. Let me give one example.\n  In the Gulf of Mexico, where we see this blue area where we have been \ndrilling for many years, the red dots indicate all current and active \nleases. Where it says ``gas, 105.52 trillion cubic feet,'' that is the \nestimated reserves of the gas that is located in this part of the gulf. \nNotice this is only the central and the western part of the gulf, not \nthe eastern part, off of the Florida coastline.\n  One hundred and five trillion cubic feet of gas is a lot of gas. In \nthe whole Nation, we use 22 trillion cubic feet a year. So in this one \nsmall part of the gulf, if we drilled it in its entirety and were \ncommitted to a good drilling program, we could supply enough gas for \nthe entire United States, according to my math, for between 4 and 5 \nyears.\n  I have to assume that the geology does not stop at this line. Just \nbecause the political boundaries divide Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama, and Florida does not mean the geographic or geological \nformations stop. So there are tremendous gas and oil reserves in this \npart of the gulf. There are probably tremendous reserves all along our \nNation's shorelines. Does that mean we have to drill within sight of \nthe coast? No. It used to be that way 20 years ago, where drilling \nwould have to be in shallow water. But one of the great advances that \nhas occurred because of wise tax credits, encouragement, research, and \ndevelopment is that we now can drill safely in deeper water.\n  What does that mean? That means we can have great beaches, wonderful \ncoastlines, a tremendous tourism industry, and never see an oil rig.\n  The technology is there to drill, and drill safely, and move gas and \noil throughout this country. We would not have to rely on Iraq or Saudi \nArabia and be held hostage to world oil prices.\n  We need more oil and more gas. It is simply hogwash when people say \nit will not help. That is not true. It will help, and we can do it.\n  Regarding the ANWR situation, people might not be clear. It was not \nto me until I visited Alaska and began to understand how huge Alaska \nis. I asked my staff to place Alaska on the map of the continental \nUnited States so we could appreciate how big the State is. We are lucky \nto have purchased this land, this wonderful State with so many \nresources. It is a great asset for the United States of America.\n  When we purchased Alaska, people thought it was a folly. We have the \nlast laugh. It has given us great natural resources, an abundance of \nwildlife, timber, and oil and gas.\n  We cannot turn all of Alaska into a national park. We cannot afford \nto do it. We have set aside some areas of Alaska. One area the size of \nthe State of South Carolina is a refuge. It is the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge.\n  Are we suggesting to drill in the whole refuge? No, the debate over \nANWR is regarding 1.5 million out of 19 million. That is what the fear \nis about. A huge number of people say we absolutely, positively, cannot \ndrill in this little dot because a major catastrophe will befall our \nenvironment or Nation.\n\n[[Page S2607]]\n\n  Other nations hear this and say: What is the United States thinking? \nThey have so much land, so much more than we do, so many more resources \nthan we do. What is keeping them from drilling in a place far removed \nfrom any urban population? If they will not drill here, the question \nis, where will these people in America drill? That is my question.\n  While some of the Democratic leadership is getting blamed for this \nposition, neither party has been instrumental in opening up lands for \ndrilling. This motto of not in my backyard, not in anyone's backyard, \nnot now, not ever, is going to bring this country to its knees.\n  I don't mean to sound pessimistic, but we cannot maintain the great \nmilitary strength we have, and the great economic strength we have, if \nwe refuse to produce the energy we consume. We have to produce more. We \nhave the land. We have the skill. We have the technology. We have \npeople who want jobs, good jobs. I have thousands of workers out of a \njob. They want a job that can pay $20, $25, $30, $35, $40 an hour; \nscientists who can make a fabulous living exploring new ways for \ndrilling; engineers, geologists, truckers, suppliers, small business \nowners.\n  More domestic production in little areas like this or in places in \nthe gulf or in some parts of California and some parts of the east \ncoast would be very helpful. I hope we can do it.\n  In addition, we must diversify our fuel source. We need more oil and \ngas. If anyone says we don't, they are leading you astray. We also need \nmore nuclear power. There is also a byproduct of hydrogen that will \nhelp America move to hydrogen fuel cells in our transportation sector. \nThat is very exciting.\n  The Presiding Officer and Members from agricultural States know we \ncan help develop fuels from excess agricultural byproducts and help to \nproduce the kind of fuels for our automobiles, from corn, wheat and \nsugarcane. This is a careful way to produce our food: consume what we \nneed, and use the excess to produce energy to run the new vehicles of \nthe next decade--this is truly exciting--and wean ourselves off of the \noil and gas that is so necessary today and will be for the next several \nyears.\n  The second important area is improving the transmission grid. I \ncompare it to the National Highway System. If you came to Louisiana or \nMississippi before we had a National Highway System, you would reach \nthe State line and the highway might end because we in Louisiana \ndecided to build the road in a different way. Imagine not being able to \nget to Texas because we had our highway going north when we needed it \ngoing west.\n  That is what would have happened. But we came together a number of \nyears ago and said: We are going to have a National Highway System so \nwe can move goods from the East to the West. To do that, the Federal \nGovernment is going to have some say about how this highway system is \nbuilt.\n  We need to do the same thing with transmission. Let me show the \nproblem with transmission. Even if we drilled more, we don't have \nadequate infrastructure to move electricity. Even if we increase our \nproduction, we have to be able to move it from the source to the user.\n  What this chart shows is the increase in system demand. There is an \nincrease in demand. Why? Because we are using more electricity. This \ncountry is moving aggressively to using more power, not less.\n  So, this is our demand curve. Here, though, is the net transmission \ninvestment, which is going down, not up. This is what causes blackouts \nand brownouts, this separation. The reason for this is 50 States are \ndoing their own thing.\n  Senator Bingaman he has some wonderful language in this bill to help \nus build, if you will, an interstate, national transmission system to \nmove electricity to the places that need it.\n  I would like to improve upon this language, so I am going to be \noffering an amendment next week that will produce more transmission \ncapacity through participant funding.\n  The current electricity pricing system is a tremendous obstacle to \nenhanced transmission capacity. This system dictates that new \ntransmission capacity be rolled in, or socialized across the system, \nbut when power moves from one system to another, customers who receive \nno benefit, like those in my State, still shoulder the burden of the \ncost of building more transmission. This situation leads to state \nutility commissioners and consumer groups to oppose badly needed \nexpansions of the transmission grid.\n  Prior to recess, I introduced an amendment, along with Senator Kyl, \nto establish an option of participant funding, whereby the utility \ncustomers who give rise to, and benefit from the expansion of \ntransmission, pay the associated costs.\n  Now let me clear about one thing: this amendment does not mandate \nanything. Rolled-in pricing would continue to be the rule while \nparticipant funding would become an option.\n  Unfortunately, there has been a persistent tendency to misread or \nmisinterpret this amendment to the contrary. In order to clarify this \nissue, I have made a series of changes to the amendment which make \nabsolutely clear, beyond any doubt, that the amendment is not a \nmandate.\n  We are building support for this amendment. Again, besides increasing \nproduction, we have to build a national transmission system, similar to \nour highway system, and we have to do it in this bill right now or all \nthe discussions about energy reliability are going to be for naught.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to show another part of the \nproblem: the need for some reinvestment in our energy infrastructure.\n  Let me put up the chart that shows drilling in the gulf. All of these \nred dots represent wells that are being drilled out in the gulf. It is \nreally a sight to see. There are thousands of people working out in the \ngulf on these rigs. But they do not just get there from heaven. They \nhave to come from some shore, usually from Texas, Louisiana, or \nMississippi where the pipes, the supplies, and helicopters are located. \nWe serve as the platform that allows this activity to go on. We are \nhappy to do that.\n\n  But we have been doing it now for 50 years and getting no \ncompensation whatsoever. In other words, all the taxes paid in this \narea do not come back to Louisiana. We do not see a penny of the \nroyalties that are paid, and it is a lot of money. It is $120 billion, \nsince 1955; $120 billion since 1955 has been paid to the Federal \nGovernment from the drilling. Some of it is off the shore of Florida, \nbut most of it is off Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas.\n  Since 1955, these wells and energy have produced, for Washington, \n$120 billion. Yet for the parishes, the States, and the communities \nthat support that drilling, we get zero. It has to change. It is just \nnot fair, it is not right, and it makes no sense.\n  This is what happens. This is Highway 1, the highway that goes down \nthe boot of Louisiana to the gulf. This is what the highway looks like \nbecause we cannot get one penny, under the current law, to broaden or \nimprove this highway. This is what happens when there is an accident on \nthis narrow two-lane highway. These are all workers in these trucks. \nThis is what we cause our citizens to have to deal with because we \nrefuse to design a system, for coastal States, that interior States \nhave.\n  Interior States, when they drill for resources, get to keep 50 \npercent of their money. That goes to help them fund their highways, \ntheir schools, to counter any negative environmental impacts, to invest \nin those local communities. Coastal States, for some reason, have not \nbeen able to share in that way.\n  My amendment, which is in this bill, establishes an authorization for \nthat. I am going to ask this body to take a further step and make a \ndirect appropriation--if we are going to drill in the gulf--for \nAlabama, for Mississippi, for Louisiana, and for Texas. We certainly \ndeserve to keep a portion of those revenues so we can invest back in \nour communities and make this situation more tenable for the workers \nand for the community of people who produce energy for this Nation. We \nthink it is our patriotic duty, but we cannot continue without just \ncompensation.\n\n[[Page S2608]]\n\n  That is a picture of what Highway 1 looks like on a bad day when \nthere has been an accident. Frankly, on a good day when there has not \nbeen an accident, it looks a lot like that. There can be 1,000 trucks a \nday trying to get down to the gulf to produce oil.\n  First, we need to drill more in this Nation in places where we can. \nWe can have protected waters so the beaches of Florida or the coast of \nLouisiana or places in Alaska can be protected and preserved. But we \ncan drill in places where we can become more energy independent and \nself-sufficient.\n  Second, we should double our efforts to diversify our sources of \nenergy and concentrate on developing renewables.\n  Third, we should create a transmission grid much like our national \nhighway system so that wherever the power is created, we can move it to \nwherever the Nation needs it, efficiently and at low cost.\n  It will be fabulous for our consumers and for our businesses.\n  Finally, we need to make sure we compensate the States such as \nLouisiana that are producing and give them a fair share of these \nrevenues so we can invest in our economic future, fix highways such as \nHighway 1, and restore the damage to our coastal wetlands.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the attention and the time to speak \non this important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida).

Senator Daschle's statement was wise. It is important \nwe all listen carefully to what Senator Daschle said. And, more \nimportantly, in my opinion, it is important that we follow his \nsuggestion.\n  President Bush was correct in his assessment that he presented to the \nAmerican public and the world last Thursday in his speech when he \ninformed the world he was going to be engaged in the Middle East by \nsending Secretary Powell to the Middle East. It was a correct decision.\n  Secretary Powell is now engaged in a very difficult, dangerous, and \ndelicate mission. Yes, there are great risks for the President's \nprestige, our Nation's risk to that prestige, and to America's \nprestige. There are risks all around.\n  We must not misunderstand the reality of with what we are dealing. We \nare not dealing with some abstraction or some theory. We are dealing \nwith the cold, brutal reality of what is taking place in the Middle \nEast. There are no good options. There are no risk-free options for \nAmerica, for Israel, for the Palestinians, for the Arab world, and for, \nindeed, the entire world.\n  There are far greater risks if the United States of America does not \nengage and provide leadership where there has been a vacuum of \nleadership, which, in my opinion, has produced much of this danger, \nchaos, and turmoil, and which I believe borders on the brink of a \nraging inferno if this is not brought under control. We have no option \nbut to lead. Terrorists win if we don't engage--if we allow ourselves \nto be held captive to terrorist actions.\n  As we follow this through, do we believe things will get better? \nThings won't get better. Things will get worse and more dangerous and \nwill draw more and more of the world into this conflict. So we have no \noption.\n  The President is right. If this situation continues to spiral out of \ncontrol, it serves no one's interest or purpose except the fringes, the \nradicals, and the terrorists.\n  It is not in Israel's interest, nor the Palestinians' interest, nor \nthe world's interest to allow this problem to continue. Of course, our \nhearts go out to the Israeli people today, and to the victims and \nfamilies of the latest terrorist bombing in Jerusalem. We can never \njustify nor condone acts of terrorism.\n  Unfortunately, I am not surprised that on the day Secretary Powell is \nin Israel meeting with leaders to attempt to bring some sanity to this \nsituation that the terrorists have struck. That is what they always do. \nThey try to drive us back. They try to fragment us. They try to get us \nto argue amongst ourselves as to strategy and policy. But we must not \nfall prey to terrorist actions and allow ourselves to become paralyzed \nby what they are doing.\n  No Nation and no people should have to live under the conditions the \nIsraelis are presently living under and the Palestinian people are \nenduring.\n  That is why Secretary Powell is there. Let us not forget why he is \nthere. Let us cut through the fog. He is there to try to bring some \nstability and peace and pull apart the warring factions so that we can \nget on with a settlement, get on with lives, and hopefully on into a \nfuture for all peoples of that region. That is why he is there.\n  President Bush has been very clear in his condemnation of terrorism \nand his unprecedented commitment to ending it. We understand Israel's \nright to defend itself. We are committed to that right. We have helped \nIsrael defend that right. We will continue to do so. But it should not \nbe at the expense of the Palestinian people--innocent Palestinian \npeople and innocent Israelis who are paying a high price. Both Israelis \nand Palestinians are trapped in a war not of their making.\n\n  We must step back from this great tragedy and recognize one constant: \nThat the more the violence escalates, the more the terrorists win, and \nthat further violence will embolden the terrorist bombers in Israel and \nelsewhere, and it will spread and spread.\n  We cannot allow a vacuum of leadership to develop in the Middle East. \nThat, too, is why Secretary Powell is there. Secretary Powell is on a \ncritical mission to help end this cycle of violence and eventually help \nboth sides see a future where there can be peace. Look over the \nhorizon. Is it imperfect? Absolutely. Is it full of problems and holes \nand gaps, imperfections and flaws? Absolutely. But if we do not anchor \nourselves to some hope, some plan, some leadership--all, yes, full of \nrisk--then what is there, what will there be?\n  We must be reminded that this cannot, and will not, be accomplished \nin one trip. This will take time. We must have patience. We must stay \nfocused, disciplined, and prepared for setbacks. And there will be \nsetbacks. But allowing this to spiral out of control is not an option.\n  The military solution alone is not an option. That is part of it. We \nwill get to a time--I have confidence we will--where we will be asking, \nHow do we guarantee this peace? Will America be called upon, NATO \nforces be called upon to help guarantee this peace? Maybe. But we \nshould now put all our creative, new, wider-lens thinking on this \nissue, and all our foreign policy in this new world in which we live, \non the table. It will require some new thinking.\n  Who guarantees this peace? If, in fact, we expect Israel to pull back \nto their pre-1967 borders, who guarantees that peace? Those will be \ndifficult decisions for this body to be part of making, as well as the \nPresident having to make those difficult decisions. I do not tremble \nwith any fear or quake with fear that we are not up to that. We will \nget to that. We must be prepared to think through that--and long term.\n  The Secretary's mission is all about the war on terrorism. Let's not \nget disconnected to the broader purpose. Its purpose is to end the \nviolence and terror. The Middle East is connected to our policies in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. We are paralyzed now in some of these areas \nbecause we are totally consumed with the Middle East, and appropriately \nso. We have few options anywhere until this Middle East issue is on \nsome track of resolution.\n  The situation in Afghanistan, as the Presiding Officer knows, is \nstill very fragile and very dangerous. There is a long way to go. We \nmust not allow Afghanistan to unwind. The investment, the progress, the \ngood, the justice, the dignity--all that has been brought to that land \nas a result of American leadership, which we must preserve--we\n\n[[Page S2609]]\n\ncannot allow to erode and for us to go back to a time when we were \nlosing there.\n  Deadly terrorism stalks the world. It is the great challenge of our \ntime. It is the reality of our time. We need the help of all our \nallies, all our friends all over the world, all the Moslem nations, to \ncontinue to root out terrorism and stabilize and secure the world.\n  This is not an American interest alone. And we cannot do it alone. We \nare the greatest power the world has ever known. We stand astride the \nglobe as no power in the history of man. But we have limits, too. These \ncoalitions for peace, coalitions for change, will be our future, the \nworld's future. And we must lead that coalition. We cannot press \nforward on a regime change in Iraq with the fires burning in Israel or \nwe will stand alone, without our allies. We will risk finding ourselves \nisolated, Israel isolated. It is not in the interest of Israel to find \nAmerica and Israel isolated in the world.\n\n  America's and the world's vital interests are connected to the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict--completely, directly, daily. We must give \nSecretary Powell and the President the time to work through these \nunprecedented challenges, this unprecedented violence and danger. They \nneed the latitude, the flexibility to work through to a solution, in \nconsultation with the Congress, of course. In this body and in the \nHouse of Representatives reside great expertise, ability, common sense, \nand wisdom on which the President will and is calling.\n  We need an Arab coalition for peace, building upon the Saudi \ninitiative of Crown Prince Abdullah, incorporating the Tenet plan and \nthe Mitchell plan. We need to support the President's policies to help \nbring to this region peace which has worldwide consequences. All of the \nworld will be affected by the outcome. There are consequences playing \nout today, and they will continue to play out, and they are \nuncontrollable consequences.\n  In conclusion, I offer a comment that Henry Kissinger made in a \nstatement recently on U.S. policy in the post-cold-war world reality. \nDr. Kissinger said this: ``history . . . will not excuse failure by the \nmagnitude of the task.'' It applies very appropriately, clearly, and \nwith deadly accuracy today in the Middle East. The President has shown \nhis courage and the determination that a nation as great and worthy as \nAmerica is--and can be, and has been--to go forward with the kind of \nleadership the world expects from us, and, yes, at great risk. But that \nrisk is for peace, and that risk is worth taking. It will be long and \ndifficult, but it can be done. We are dealing with a manmade problem. \nWe will find a manmade resolution.\n  So I return to the opening of my comments this morning in once again \nsuggesting that Senator Daschle had it right yesterday in calling for \nall of us on Capitol Hill to work together to support the President, to \nfind solutions and resolutions. Criticism is easy. It is very easy to \ncriticize. But we do not have an option to criticize. We have a \nresponsibility to find a solution. And we will. We must support our \nPresident and Secretary Powell in his mission for peace.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your attention. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/12/senate-section/article/S2609-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to consideration of H.R. 3525, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3525) to enhance the border security of the \n     United States, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is time to enact the Enhanced Border \nSecurity and Visa Entry Reform Act.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Brownback and Kyl, on the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Republican leaders on the Judiciary Committee and on \nthis issue, and also acknowledge the very strong leadership of my \ncolleague and friend from California, Senator Feinstein. We have worked \nvery closely together. We all had different legislation in different \nforms and shapes, but all on a similar subject matter. We have worked \nclosely to make a unified recommendation to the Senate which reflects \nour best judgment.\n  It also reflects the best judgment of those who have had the \nopportunity to study the issues that we have included, and we have \nbenefited from a number of recommendations. I am very grateful to all \nof our colleagues for all of the good work they have done. We present \nthis as a unified team.\n  This legislation would strengthen the security of our borders, \nimprove our ability to screen foreign nationals, and enhance our \nability to deter potential terrorists. This legislation addresses the \nsignificant national security challenges we face today.\n  The House passed the Border Security Act in December. The Senate \naction is long overdue.\n  I believe there are five dimensions to our security challenge today. \nFirst is the military. The Armed Forces are performing superbly, and \nthey are well led. Secondly, we have a new intelligence challenge that \ndeals primarily with the control of nuclear and biological materials in \nthe former Soviet Union, and the gaps in what we know about terrorist \ngroups. A third involves a cracking-down on money laundering and \nimproving our ability to follow the financial trail of terrorist groups \nthrough the international monetary system, and we have seen important \nlegislation on that subject successfully completed in this body.\n  Fourth is the area of bioterrorism. Senator Frist and I have worked \nclosely together to enact the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act \nsigned by the President in the year 2000. We are in conference now with \nthe Bioterrorism Preparedness Act. We have very good bipartisan support \nfor this legislation--Congressman Tauzin, House Members--and we are \nvery close to making recommendations with a conference report sometime \nnext week or very shortly thereafter. We have worked very closely in a \nbipartisan, bicameral way to meet this particular challenge.\n  Finally, there is the security of our borders, which remains the \nchallenge that needs attention.\n  As the recent mistakes of the INS demonstrate, the need is urgent to \nclose the loopholes in our immigration system. Border security is the \nshared responsibility of the INS, the State Department, intelligence \nagencies, and the Customs Service, and requires improved technology, \nenhanced intelligence capacity, and dynamic information sharing, \nupdated training for border officials and Foreign Service offices, and \nexpanded monitoring of foreign nationals already in the United States.\n  Additional restructuring within agencies to streamline the \nimplementation of this multi-faceted goal may be necessary over time, \nbut are not a precondition to the passage of this legislation.\n  The pressing need for enhanced border security must proceed without \nfurther delay.\n  As I mentioned, the reorganization, restructuring of the INS is \nimportant.\n  I and others have introduced that restructuring in the 105th and \n107th Congresses. Basically, that incorporated the recommendations of \nwhat we call the Barbara Jordan Commission. The Commission itself spent \nover a year evaluating and examining the series of recommendations \nabout how to make the whole INS more effective and efficient and \nrespond to both its enforcement as well as its service needs. It is a \nsolid base from which we should move ahead.\n  But it does seem to all of us that it is important we get about this \nbusiness now in terms of border security first and not wait for the \nmore general\n\n[[Page S2610]]\n\nkinds of debates on the restructuring and reorganizing, because \nwhatever is going to be done with that, these provisions that we will \nbe accepting and endorsing today will be well incorporated into that \nsystem.\n  In strengthening our security at our borders, we must also safeguard \nthe unobstructed entry of the more than 31 million persons who enter \nthe United States legally each year as visitors, students, and \ntemporary workers. Many others cross our borders from Canada and Mexico \nto conduct daily business or visit close family members. We are talking \nabout 550 million people who come and go from the United States every \nyear--with the possibility of some visitors who might pose some danger \nto our country and society in the form of terrorism. It is really like \nfinding a needle in the haystack.\n  We have to use technology to the greatest effect we can--with well-\ntrained people and good technology at the entry level. With this new \ntechnology, we will be able to track when individuals acquire a visa \nand follow that individual while they are in the United States to know \nwhen they are leaving or when they should leave the United States. This \ntechnology will keep alive the knowledge and the whereabouts of \nindividuals who are visiting our country. That capability does not \nexist today. It is key in terms of trying to deal with the challenges \nof border security. And now that we have recognized that the terrorists \nwere visitors to this country who acquired visas, we understand the \nimportance of trying to deal with this issue and deal with it \neffectively.\n  We believe the legislation we are supporting is not going to answer \nall of the problems, but it is going to move us into the modern \ntechnology age and will take advantage of all the new technology to \nhelp provide security for our country.\n  We also must live up to our history and heritage as a nation of \nimmigrants. We can go to a more restrictive kind of border security. It \nprobably would not be responsive to the nature of the terrorists, and \nit would have important implications in terms of families and in terms \nof commercial relationships. We want to provide a recommendation \nconsistent with our historical and economic interests, but also use the \nbest of technology in terms of identifying it and seeking out those who \nmean to do harm to our society.\n  Continued immigration is a part of our national well-being, our \nidentity as a nation, and our strength in today's world. In defending \nAmerica, we are also defending the fundamental constitutional \nprinciples that made us strong in the past and will make us even \nstronger in the future. Our action must strike a careful balance \nbetween protecting civil liberties and providing the means for law \nenforcement to identify, apprehend, and detain potential terrorists. It \nmakes no sense to enact reforms to severely limit immigration into the \nUnited States. ``Fortress America,'' even if it could be achieved, is \nan inadequate and ineffective response to the terrorist threat. This \nlegislation strikes the balance. Immigrants are not the danger; \nterrorists are. We have to keep that in mind.\n\n  Our legislation creates increased and improved layers of security by \nproviding multiple opportunities for our government to turn away or \napprehend potentially dangerous visitors and travelers.\n  Our first layer of security is the intelligence information provided \nto consular offices, the INS, and border guards. Our efforts to improve \nborder security must therefore include targeted intelligence gathering \nand analysis to identify potential terrorists, and coordinated \ninformation-sharing within and between the Department of State, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, and the law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies.\n  This legislation will require the President to submit and implement a \nplan to improve the access to critical security information. It will \ncreate an electronic data system to give those responsible for \nscreening visa applicants and persons entering the United States the \ninformation they need in real time and the tools they need to make \ninformed decisions. It also provides for a temporary system until the \nPresident's plan is fully implemented.\n  Now, most foreign nationals who travel here must apply for visas at \nAmerican consulates overseas. We must improve the ability of the \nForeign Service officers to detect and intercept potential terrorists \nbefore they arrive in the United States. Traditionally, consular \noffices interviewing visa applicants have focused on trying to \ndetermine whether the applicant is likely to violate his or her visa \nstatus.\n  Although this review is important, consular offices must also be \ntrained specifically to screen for security threats, not just potential \nvisa violators.\n  We are basically talking about two concepts. One is in terms of the \ntechnology and the shared information and the other is the training. \nToo often we find that the intelligence agencies refuse to provide \ninformation in terms of the dangers of individuals who may pose a \nthreat to the United States and share that with the consular offices \nthat are making decisions and judgments with regard to whether they \nought to give that person a visa. And it has been a bureaucratic snafu \nthat continues too often, even today.\n  The intelligence community believes that if they provide that \ninformation, they are somehow potentially sacrificing their sources in \na given country because there are foreign nationals in the consular \noffices and they will be able to get wind of what is happening and \nendanger their sources of information with regard to those who pose us \na threat. So in many instances they will not make those individuals and \nthe dangers of those individuals available to the consular offices. \nClearly, if the consular offices, no matter how well-trained, don't \nhave that information, then they are unable to make a judgment about \nthe kinds of threats that individual poses for the United States. That \nhas to stop.\n  There is no question, with the level of technology that is available \nat this time and the whole processing that can be utilized, we can meet \nthe responsibilities of the intelligence community, as well as ensuring \nthat well-trained consular offices are going to have the kinds of \ninformation they are going to need in order to make a solid judgment in \nterms of the individual. That is a key element. We need to have the \ntraining of the consular offices so they are not just looking at the \nusual judgments, whether individuals may overstay, based upon family \nrelationships; but they need the additional kind of training in order \nto be able to detect and determine, to the extent that the training \ncan, whether individuals pose us a threat. Those two factors are \nincluded in this legislation and strongly supported. It is extremely \nimportant, right at the very beginning, to make sure you are going to \nhave the best information that is going to be available to that visa \nofficer, and that the visa officer is going to have the best possible \ntraining to not only understand their responsibility on individuals who \nwant to get a touring visa, but also they are going to be carefully \ntrained in order to use their skills to be able to root out those who \nmay potentially be a threat. Those are very important parts of this \nlegislation.\n\n  Terrorist lookout committees will be established in every U.S. \nconsular mission abroad in order to focus the attention of our consular \nofficers on specific threats and provide essential critical national \nsecurity information to those responsible for issuing visas and \nupdating the database. So if the other intelligence agencies are going \nto be able to pick up information, as we have seen happen at different \ntimes, that a particular area is a potential threatened area, that \ninformation can be made available as well to the consular offices to \nput them on a higher alert. That too often does not exist today. That \nhas to be altered and changed. This legislation does that.\n  This legislation will close gaps on restrictions on visas for foreign \nnationals from countries that the Department of State has determined \nare sponsors of terrorism. It prohibits issuing visas to individuals \ncoming from countries that sponsor terrorism, unless the Secretary of \nState has determined on a case-by-case basis that the individual is not \na security threat.\n  The current visa waiver program, which allows individuals from \nparticipating countries to enter the United States for a limited period \nof time without visas, strengthens relations between the United States \nand those\n\n[[Page S2611]]\n\ncountries and encourages economic growth around the world. Given its \nimportance, we must safeguard its continued use, while also ensuring \nthe country's designation as a participant in the program does not \nundermine the U.S. law enforcement and security. This legislation will \nonly allow a country to be designated as a visa waiver participant--or \ncontinue to be designated--if the Attorney General and Secretary of \nState determine that the country reports instances of passport theft to \nthe U.S. Government in a timely manner.\n  There is a criterion for selecting those countries. Those countries \nare eligible for a visa waiver if they demonstrate that 97 percent of \nthose who are granted visas return. That has been reviewed and studied \nover a period of time. Rather than using the personnel when we know \nindividuals will be returning, part of all of this effort is to use the \nresources we have, which are not infinite, to target the areas where \nthere is the greatest need.\n  We have 22 million visitors who come from these visa waiver \ncountries. There is not a careful monitoring of those individuals when \nthey are here or when they are returning. That has to change. This \nlegislation ensures the INS will know when those individuals come here, \ntheir whereabouts, and when they are going to leave. That is enormously \nimportant.\n  Another provision is the student waiver program. We have 22,000--\nlisten, 22,000--educational institutions that can grant an educational \nvisa. We do not now know when the individual comes in, once they get by \nthe port of entry, whether they ever go to the college, whether they \never attend for any period of time, or, quite frankly, whether they \ngraduate, which is an enormous loophole. That has to change.\n  There are provisions in this legislation that do that. We have \naccomplished this with the cooperation of the universities and the \neducational centers. They cooperated. They helped us. We will have a \nchance to go through this in greater detail to the extent Members want \nto, but that is included in this legislation as well.\n  We must require also that all airlines electronically transmit \npassenger lists to destination airports in the United States, so that \nonce the planes have landed, law enforcement officers can intercept \npassengers on the lookout list. United States airlines already do this, \nbut some foreign airlines do not do it. Our legislation requires \nairlines to electronically transmit passenger manifest information \nprior to arrival in the United States. That information is going to be \nput into the computers so we know when the visa is granted and that it \nis based on the most current information. We will know when that \nindividual purchased a ticket. That information will be shared. We will \nknow by the tracking of that ticket when the person enters. When the \nborder security person sees that individual at the port of entry, they \nare going to have up-to-date information and ultimately will have \nbiometric technology to make sure the person standing before them is \nthe same person who was granted the visa. That does not exist today, \nand it creates enormous opportunities for abuse. We make that \ncommitment in this legislation.\n  We do not minimize the complexity in achieving all of this, but we \nbelieve it represents our best effort in how we can improve our current \nsystem.\n  Enforcement personnel at our ports of entry are a key part of the \nbattle against terrorism, and we must provide them greater resources, \ntraining, and technology. These men and women have a significant role \nin the battle against terrorism. This legislation will ensure that \nenforcement personnel receive adequate pay, can hire necessary \npersonnel, are well trained to identify individuals who pose a security \nthreat, have access to important intelligence information, and have the \ntechnologies they need to enhance border security and facilitate cross-\nborder commerce.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service must be able to retain \nhighly skilled immigration inspectors. Our legislation provides \nincentives to immigration inspectors by providing them with the same \nbenefits as other law enforcement personnel. They do not have that \ntoday. Our bill does.\n\n  Expanding the use of biometric technology is critical to prevent \nterrorists from traveling under false identities. This legislation is \nneeded to bring our ports of entry into the digital and biometric age \nand equip them with biometric data readers and scanners. These secure \ntravel document scanners will verify that a person entering the country \nis the same person who was issued the passport and the visa.\n  We must expand the use of biometric border crossing cards. The time \nframe previously allowed for individuals to obtain these cards was not \nsufficient. This legislation extends the deadline for individuals \ncrossing the border to acquire the biometric cards. There are some \ninstances where individuals, particularly in Mexico, have the cards and \nwe have not put the investment into the technology that is necessary to \nread these cards.\n  The USA PATRIOT Act addressed the need for machine-readable passports \nbut did not focus on the need for machine-readable visas issued by the \nUnited States. This legislation enables the Department of State to \nraise fees through the use of machine-readable visas and use the funds \ncollected from these fees to improve technology at our ports of entry. \nThe fee raising has been enormously successful. It has funded these \nprograms. It makes a great deal of sense.\n  We must also strengthen our ability to monitor foreign nationals \nwithin the United States. In 1996, Congress enacted legislation \nmandating the development of an automated entry/exit control system to \nrecord the entry of every non-citizen arriving in the United States and \nto match it with the record of departure. Although the technology is \navailable for such a system, it has not been put in place because of \nthe high costs involved. Our legislation builds on the antiterrorism \nbill and provides greater direction to the INS for implementing the \nentry/exit system.\n  Also, we include in the legislation a very interesting proposal, and \nthat is to first look north and then south at perimeter security. We \nare not only looking at our border with Canada, but we are also working \nwith Canada to find out who is coming into Canada as a first line of \ndefense. That is shared information, with the idea that we can set up \nsystems that are going to be cooperative and interchangeable with the \nexchange of information and intelligence on individuals.\n  The Canadian Government is responding very positively. Our Ambassador \nto Canada, the former Governor of Massachusetts, Paul Cellucci, \ntestified before our committee about the steps that are being taken. \nThat will take time to work through. Then we can obviously think about \ndoing the same job on the southern perimeter. Most of those who worked \non the whole security issue believe that can be enormously important \nand very worthwhile.\n  It is time for the Senate to support this bill. The security concerns \naddressed by this legislation cannot be ignored, action cannot be \npostponed, and the cost is reasonable. The estimated cost of the \nlegislation is $1.2 billion in 1 year, $3.2 billion for full \nimplementation. It is a small price to pay for the security this bill \nwill provide the American public.\n  Some have urged Congress to delay the passage until we have had, as I \nmentioned, the opportunity to restructure the INS. But the many \nimportant goals of this bill, including developing an interoperable \ndata system to give immigration and consular officers access to \nrelevant law enforcement and intelligence information, requiring \nbiometric identifiers be included in travel documents, and \nstrengthening the training of consular officers and immigration \ninspectors are important reforms that need to be enacted regardless of \nhow our agencies are organized.\n  These reforms cannot wait for a bureaucratic arrangement to be \nresolved, as we have seen the risks are too great. While reorganization \nof the INS is a top priority, which Congress plans to quickly address, \nwe cannot afford to wait until that task is implemented to undertake \nthe necessary changes advanced in the border security bill.\n  The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act has the broad \nbipartisan support of 60 Senators and the support of numerous \ncoalitions such as the National Border Patrol Council, the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, Americans for Better Borders,\n\n[[Page S2612]]\n\nInternational Biometric Industry Association, the American Immigration \nLawyers Association, the Association of International Educators, the \nLeadership Council for Civil Rights, National Council of La Raza, \nNational Immigration Forum, the American Federation of Government \nEmployees, and the AFL-CIO.\n  The USA PATRIOT Act was an important part of the effort to improve \nimmigration security, but further action is needed. This legislation is \na needed bipartisan effort to strengthen the security of our borders \nand enhance our ability to prevent future terrorist attacks while also \nreaffirming our tradition as a nation of immigrants.\n  I see my colleague and friend Senator Feinstein is in the Chamber. At \nthis time, I state for the record the very strong support from the \nNational Border Patrol, which represents 9,000 nonsupervisory Border \nPatrol employees, talking about the very important aspects of this \nlegislation, and rest assured we can count on the support of the \nNational Border Patrol Council to secure the passage of this \nlegislation. Americans for Better Borders, similarly they have \nindicated their strong support and state that given the importance of \nthis legislation, they urge swift passage in the Senate. Also included \nare the groups I have indicated in this chart, which are as broad a \nrange of groups in support of this legislation as one could hope for in \nthis body.\n  One of the most important groups that support this--and I intend to \nyield in a moment--are the Families of September 11. We heard marvelous \neloquence today from MaryEllen Salamone, who is the director of the \nFamilies of September 11. These families testify about the importance \nof this legislation. They are attempting not only to try and bring \ntheir lives together, but also in areas of public policy they are \nexpressing their views in ways of ensuring, to the extent that we can, \nthat we will not have a similar kind of tragedy as September 11.\n  We heard testimony so powerful today in support of legislation from \nthat group. I will include those letters of support, as well as from \nthe International Biometric Industry, as to why they believe this \nlegislation is so important. I have letters from the Alliance, which is \nthe International Education and Cultural Exchange, and the Association \nof International Educators. There is strong support from those who \nwould be impacted by this legislation.\n  This is good legislation. It is necessary, and I hope the Senate will \nsupport it. I am so glad to see my colleague and friend from \nCalifornia, who I have indicated has been a driving force in this area \nas in so many other areas, and she has been an essential partner. We \nalways enjoy the opportunity to work closely with her, and we always \nlearn from that experience.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters I referred to be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            American Federation of\n\n\n                                         Government Employees,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Immigration, Senate Committee on \n         Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: On behalf of the American Federation \n     of Government Employees, I would like to express our strong \n     support for S. 1749, the Enhanced Border Security and Visa \n     Entry Reform Act of 2002. In our view, the combination of \n     improved technology, better training and higher pay will do \n     much to improve our border response capability.\n       We are particularly gratified that this legislation \n     includes a long overdue increase in the journeyman pay grade \n     for immigration inspectors and border patrol agents. \n     Currently, the journeyman pay grade for these two groups of \n     employees is GS-9, among the lowest for all federal law \n     enforcement personnel. This, coupled with the lack of law \n     enforcement retirement benefits for immigration inspectors, \n     has created an attrition crisis at the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service.\n       According to statistics provided by the I, the current \n     attrition rate for border patrol agents is 14 percent and is \n     expected to rise to a staggering 20 percent by the end of the \n     fiscal year. For immigration inspectors, the current rate is \n     10.1 percent and it is expected to reach 15 percent by the \n     end of the year. We have been told that over 50 percent of \n     our nation's border patrol agents have applied for air \n     marshal positions. The tremendous loss of experienced \n     personnel to other law enforcement agencies has a devastating \n     effect on agency effectiveness and employee morale.\n       W3 applaud you for your leadership on this issue and look \n     forward to working with you to secure full funding for this \n     important measure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Beth Moten,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Immigration and Naturalization Service Council \n           of the American Federation of Government Employees,\n                                                   April 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the National Immigration \n     & Naturalization Service Council and its 6,800 members, I \n     would like to express our appreciation for your efforts to \n     increase the journeyman pay grade for INS inspectors from GS-\n     9 to GS-11. We believe this is a long overdue step that will \n     help stem the double digit attrition rate currently \n     experienced within the ranks of INS inspectors. It will also \n     begin to close the gap between their pay rates and that of \n     most other federal law enforcement agencies.\n       For this reason, we want to lend our strong support to S. \n     1749/H.R. 3525, the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry \n     Reform Bill of 2002. We look forward to working with you to \n     secure the necessary appropriation to implement the pay grade \n     increase.\n       We also look forward to working with you in the future on \n     legislation that would grant immigration inspectors their \n     right as federal law enforcement officers to receive law \n     enforcement retirement benefits. It is a gross injustice that \n     these individuals, who make countless arrests, are required \n     to carry firearms and place themselves in danger on a regular \n     basis and are denied such retirement benefits.\n       If there is anything we can do to assist you in your \n     efforts to enact this bill, please let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles J. Murphy,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Families of September 11,\n\n                                                  Great Falls, VA.\n       Dear Senator: On September 11, 2001, terrorists attacked \n     America. They hijacked four planes and crashed into the World \n     Trade Centers and the Pentagon. They took over 2800 lives, \n     they left 15,000 children without one or both parents, and \n     they ruined thousands and thousands of families. They left \n     America in fear.\n       Senate Bill 1749, The Enhanced Border Security and VISA \n     Entry Reform Act addresses immigration security issues. The \n     events of September 11 illustrated most clearly the \n     weaknesses of our immigration monitoring systems and Congress \n     responded with this well thought out and carefully written \n     legislation. It passed in December, without delay, in the \n     House.\n       It is disturbing to learn that this legislation is \n     presently blocked from a vote on the Floor of the Senate. In \n     honor of our loved ones lost, our organization, the Families \n     of September 11, Inc., is committed to promoting legislation \n     and policies which will prevent the recurrence of such a \n     horrific tragedy. We implore you, as an elected official of \n     this country, not just of your state, to do the same. All \n     legislation necessary to improved homeland security must be \n     passed without delay. There is no justification to compromise \n     the safety of the United States of America. Senate Bill 1749 \n     needs to be passed, and it needs to be law.\n       This is not a time for politics in our country, it is a \n     time for action. The families affected by the events of \n     September 11 have already paid the ultimate price for \n     freedom. We have a reasonable expectation that neither we, \n     nor anyone, should have to pay such a great price as ours for \n     the liberty of this country again. And we have a reasonable \n     expectation that it should be your obligation to ensure this. \n     Please exert any effort necessary to effect a vote on S1749 \n     on the Floor of the Senate. And please vote in its favor, \n     homeland security needs to be of the utmost priority in these \n     dangerous times.\n       Thank you for your attention and dedication to the \n     resolution of this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     MaryEllen Salamone,\n       Director.\n     Carie Lemack,\n       President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           International Biometric\n\n\n                                         Industry Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 10, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Immigration,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the International Biometric \n     Industry Association (IBIA), I am writing to express warm \n     support for swift enactment of the Enhanced Border Security \n     and Visa Reform Act of 2001.\n       The IBIA and other industry stakeholders understand the \n     critical importance of this legislation to help counter \n     vulnerabilities in national infrastructure security that were \n     so tragically demonstrated on 9/11. Incorporating biometric \n     identification technology into the new security program \n     called for by the bill will vitally strengthen border \n     security.\n\n[[Page S2613]]\n\n       The IBIA and its partner organizations in research and \n     education in biometrics believe that biometrics must be \n     deployed in ways that both advance security and protect \n     privacy and civil liberties. This legislation is consistent \n     with that goal while making great strides toward removing the \n     cloak of anonymity used by those who have no regard for such \n     personal freedoms and the safety of our citizens.\n       IBIA is a tax-exempt, nonprofit trade association founded \n     in 1998 to advance the collective interests of the biometric \n     industry. IBIA impartially serves all biometric technologies \n     in all applications. IBIA's membership includes leading \n     manufacturers of hand recognition, iris, facial fingerprint, \n     voice and signature biometrics, and leading integrators of \n     layered biometrics.\n       Thank you for your farsighted leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John E. Siedlarz,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Federation for American\n\n\n                                           Immigration Reform,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: It is my distinct pleasure to offer \n     the full support of the Federation for American Immigration \n     Reform (FAIR) for S. 1749, the Enhanced Border Security and \n     Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001. As you know, FAIR has worked \n     tirelessly with you and with other members of both the House \n     and Senate to develop and advance this critically important \n     homeland security legislation. Senate consideration of this \n     measure separately from other controversial legislation to \n     extend Section 245(i) is the only supportable means for \n     handling this landmark legislation.\n       Absent the important provisions of this legislation, the \n     United States will remain perilously vulnerable to attack by \n     terrorists because the nation presently lacks any federal \n     capacity to monitor or track foreign nationals who violate \n     the terms of their visas. Without this important legislation, \n     the United States will continue to lack knowledge of who has \n     entered and departed the country. Similarly the nation will \n     continue to lack knowledge of whom and how many have failed \n     to depart and remain illegally in the country.\n       As we have seen since the attacks of September 11, our \n     federal investigative agencies are fragmented, uncoordinated \n     and lack the ability to share important information needed to \n     identify terrorists either attempting to enter our country or \n     who are already here. S. 1749 will mandate interoperability \n     of investigative databases, making it at least possible to \n     detect, intercept and quickly apprehend terrorist suspects \n     before their deadly plans are consummated. The mandates to \n     implement an exit-entry system, inter-agency information \n     sharing and the use of verifiable biometric identifiers on \n     visas and passports make enforcement of laws against all \n     forms of illegal immigration far more feasible.\n       Senator Feinstein, we applaud the steadfast determination \n     you have shown in ending the logjam holding up Senate \n     consideration of this bill since last December. The nation is \n     in your debt.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Dan Stein,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Border Patrol Council of the American Federation \n           of Government Employees,\n                                        Campo, FL, April 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Immigration Subcommittee, Judiciary Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The National Border Patrol Council, \n     representing over 9,000 non-supervisory Border Patrol \n     employees, appreciates your leadership on immigration issues \n     and support of the dedicated men and women who protect our \n     nation's borders. Your recent efforts to provide enhanced \n     technology, more training, and higher pay through the pending \n     Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 \n     (S. 1749/H.R. 3525) are greatly appreciated. As you are aware \n     attrition within the ranks of the Border Patrol is at an all-\n     time high, and continues to climb at an alarming rate. \n     Increasing the journeyman pay level of these employees is an \n     important step in addressing this severe problem. Rest \n     assured that you can count on the support of the National \n     Border Patrol Council to secure the passage of this \n     legislation. After it is enacted, your continued assistance \n     in the effort to fully fund the pay increase authorization \n     will prove invaluable.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      T.J. Bonner,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking the \nSenator from Massachusetts for his leadership on this issue. It is very \nclear to me we would not be where we are today had it not been for his \nleadership, both as a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee and as \nthe chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, and as a 40-year member \nof this great body.\n  I am very pleased to join with Senators Kennedy, Brownback, and Kyl \nin sponsoring the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of \n2001. This legislation, I think it is fair to say, represents a \nconsensus. It draws upon the strength of both the Visa Entry Reform Act \nof 2001, which I introduced with my colleague from Arizona, Senator \nKyl, and the Enhanced Border Security Act of 2001, which Senators \nKennedy and Brownback introduced.\n  How did this happen? Senator Kyl and I, in the Technology and \nTerrorism Subcommittee, held hearings and came upon many of the same \nthings I think Senators Kennedy and Brownback did in the full \nSubcommittee on Immigration. In any event, the final result, as Senator \nKennedy has said, garnered widespread support from both sides of the \naisle. We now have a total of 61 cosponsors, and I think that is pretty \nmuch unprecedented for an immigration bill, particularly one of this \nmagnitude.\n  September 11 clearly pointed out the shortcomings of our immigration \nand naturalization system. For example, all 19 terrorists entered the \nUnited States legally. They had valid visas. Three of the hijackers had \nremained in the United States after their visas had expired. One \nentered on a foreign student visa. Another, Mohamed Atta, had filed an \napplication to change status to M-1, which was granted in July. \nHowever, Mr. Atta sought permission and was admitted to the United \nStates based on his then current B-1 visitor visa.\n  On March 11, 6 months from the date of the attacks, 6 months after \nMohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi flew planes into the World Trade \nCenter, the Immigration and Naturalization Service notified a Venice, \nFL, flight school that the two men had been approved for student visas.\n  I think the sheer volume of travelers to our country each year \nillustrates the need for an efficiently run and technologically \nadvanced immigration system. This is extraordinarily difficult if we \njust look at some of the numbers. I want the record to reflect some of \nthese numbers.\n  We have in our country between 8 and 9 million people who are \nresidents without any legal status. They either entered illegally or \nthey overstayed a temporary visa. Actually, 40 percent of the total \nwere visa overstays. We had 30.1 million nonimmigrants entering the \nUnited States during the year 1998. That is the most recent year for \nwhich INS has statistics.\n  As Senator Kennedy pointed out, 23 million of them entered as \ntourists on the visa waiver program. Nobody knows really whether they \never went home again. Six million of them were issued nonimmigrant \nvisas as students, tourists, temporary workers, and other temporary \nvisitors; 660,000 were foreign students who had entered in the fall of \n2001. If that is not enough, we have about 500 million border crossings \nback and forth each year, combining Americans who cross the border with \nnon-Americans who cross the border, and 350 million of the 500 million \nare non-Americans crossing the border.\n  So if one talks about securing borders, our country is a giant sieve. \nThis sieve is virtually our strength in times of peace, and at times of \nwar it is our greatest insecurity.\n  Of these 666,000 foreign nationals who held student visas in 2001, \nmore than 10,000 enrolled in flight training, in trade schools, in \nother nonacademic programs, and more than 16,000 came from terrorist-\nsupporting countries.\n  Senator Kennedy pointed out--my numbers are 2,000 different from \nhis--that we have some 74,000 U.S. schools that are allowed to admit \nforeign students, but checks of the schools on the current INS list \nfound that some had closed. Yet students still come in. Others have \nnever existed; therefore, they were fraudulent schools set up clearly \nto bring in people on student visas.\n  Exactly 6 months after the 9-11 attacks, as I pointed out, Huffman \nAviation received student visa approval forms for Mohamed Atta and \nMarwan al-Shehhi.\n  There is a big problem out there, and I think the sheer volume of \ntravelers to our country each year points out eloquently the problems \nwe face.\n\n[[Page S2614]]\n\n  This is one of the reasons why we have to change a paper-driven \nagency into a much more active agency, with better management, with \nmore technologically modern tools, and I think knowing what we now know \nto secure our borders. It is visa entries, change the processes, and \nimprove the border. This bill aims to do that.\n\n  I will talk for a moment about the visa waiver program. I mentioned \nvisa waivers: Some 23 million people, from 29 different countries. I \nmentioned nobody knows where they go in the United States or whether \nthey leave once their visas expire. The INS estimates over 100,000 \nblank passports have been stolen from government offices in \nparticipating countries in recent years. Why would 100,000 passports be \nstolen? The answer is, to use them fraudulently. Abuse of the visa \nwaiver program poses threats to U.S. national security. It also \nincreases illegal immigration.\n  For example, one of the co-conspirators in the World Trade Center \nbombing of 1993 deliberately chose to use a fraudulent Swedish passport \nto attempt entry into the United States because of Sweden's \nparticipation in the visa waiver program. That clearly says we have to \nchange the program. What we do in this bill is mandate all these \npassports must be machine readable, so they can be read when the \nindividual enters the country, they can be read when the individual \nleaves the country, and also the information can be provided to know \nwhat these people are going to do while they are in the country.\n  Let me talk about the foreign student visa program. I mentioned that \nmore than 500,000 foreign nationals enter each year. Within the last 10 \nyears, 16,000 came from such terrorist-supporting States as Iran, Iraq, \nSudan, Libya, and Syria. The foreign student visa system is one of the \nmost underregulated systems we have today. We have seen bribes, \nbureaucracy, and other problems with this system that leave it wide \nopen to abuse by terrorists and other criminals.\n  For example, in the early 1990s, 5 officials at 4 California colleges \nwere convicted in Federal court of taking bribes, providing counterfeit \neducation documents, and fraudulently applying for more than 100 \nforeign student visas. It is unclear what steps the INS took to find \nand deport the foreign nationals involved in this scheme, even after \nthese five officials were convicted.\n  Each year, we have 300 million border crossings. For the most part, \nthese individuals are legitimate visitors in our country, but we have \nno way of tracking all of these visitors. Mohamed Atta, the suspected \nring leader in the attack, was admitted as a nonimmigrant visitor in \nJuly 2001. He traveled frequently to and from the United States during \nthe past 2 years. According to the INS, he was in legal status the day \nof the attack. Other hijackers also traveled with ease throughout the \ncountry.\n  It has become all too clear that without an adequate tracking system, \nour country becomes the sieve that it is today. That creates ample \nopportunities for terrorists to enter and establish their operations \nwithout detection.\n  I sit as chair of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on \nTechnology, Terrorism, and Government Information. Last October, the \nsubcommittee held a hearing to explore the need for new technologies to \nassist our Government agencies in keeping terrorists out of the United \nStates. The testimony at that hearing was very illuminating. We were \ngiven a picture of an immigration system in chaos and a border control \nsystem rife with vulnerabilities. Agency officials don't communicate \nwith each other, computers are incompatible, and even in instances \nwhere technological leaps have been made, as in the issuance of 4.5 \nmillion smart border crossing cards with biometric data, the technology \nis not even used because the laser readers have never been purchased \nand installed.\n\n  It is astonishing that a person can apply for a visa and be granted a \nvisa by the State Department and there is no mechanism by which the FBI \nor the CIA can raise a red flag with regard to the individual if he or \nshe is known to have links to a terrorist group or otherwise pose a \nthreat to national security.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, it is unconscionable that a \nterrorist might be permitted to enter the United States simply because \nour Government agencies don't share information. We heard testimony \nfrom the head person of the State Department in the consular division. \nShe testified that they feel terrible because they granted these visas. \nThey granted them from abroad. But they had no information on the \nindividuals, no reason at the time to deny the visas.\n  We have discovered since then the perpetrators of these attacks \nclearly had a certain confidence that our immigration laws could be \ncircumvented either because the law itself was not adequate to protect \nus or the enforcement of existing law is too lax. It almost seemed \neffortless the way the terrorists got into this country. They did not \nhave to slip into the country as stowaways on sea vessels or sneak \nthrough the borders evading Federal authorities. Most, if not all, \nappeared to have come in with temporary visas, which are routinely \ngranted to tourists, to students, and to other short-term visitors to \nour country.\n  This brings me to why the provisions we have cosponsored are so \nimportant and should be enacted without further delay. Right now, our \nGovernment agencies use different systems with different information \nand different formats. They often refuse to share that information with \nother agencies within our Government. This clearly, in view of \nSeptember 11, is no longer acceptable. When a tourist presents himself \nor herself at a consular office asking for a visa or at a border \ncrossing with a passport, we need to make sure his or her name and \nidentifying information are checked against an accurate, up to date and \ncomprehensive database.\n  Under the pending legislation, the administration would be required \nto develop and implement an interoperable law enforcement and \nintelligence data system which would provide the INS and the State \nDepartment immediate access to relevant law enforcement and \nintelligence information. The database would be accessible to foreign \nservice officers issuing visas, to Federal agents determining the \nadmissibility of aliens to the United States, and law enforcement \nofficers investigating and identifying aliens.\n  In addition, the interoperable data system would include \nsophisticated, linguistically based, name-matching algorithms so that \nthe computers can recognize that, for example, Muhamad Usam Abdel \nRaqeeb and Haj Mohd Othman Abdul Rejeeb are transliterations of the \nsame name. In other words, this provision would require agencies to \nensure that names can be matched even when they are stored in different \nsets of fields in different databases.\n  Incidentally, this legislation also contains strict privacy \nprovisions limiting access to this database to authorized Federal \nofficials only. The bill contains severe penalties for wrongful access \nor misuse of information contained in the databases.\n  I wish to address one other problem. Some people say if you give the \ndate that is in the legislation, it is too soon, they cannot approve \nit. I don't believe that. We have been after them for years to do \nthings like this, and I believe, after talking with several people from \nthe private sector, that the private sector can come in and provide the \nsoftware very quickly for the kinds of databases we are discussing.\n  They have assured me this is possible. I think one of the problems we \nhave is we don't employ the experts in the private sector we have--the \ntechnologically hypersensitive people who know the most modern \ntechnology and how to apply software, how to get the system up and \nrunning, how to get the data entered, and then stay with the system.\n  I remember when I was mayor of San Francisco when we did the first \nlatent fingerprint database in the United States. NEC did it for us. \nNEC sent their people to San Francisco to install the system and to \nestablish the software. They remained for 5 years to see that the \nprogramming was done adequately. This was done on a request for \nproposal of bid from the private sector.\n  I believe very strongly, if we are going to ever get this section of \nthe bill properly instituted, that not only does the private sector \nhave to come in, but they have to stay for substantial periods of \ntime--at least 5 years--to supervise the data entry as that data is put \nin, as the databases are checked, as\n\n[[Page S2615]]\n\nthey are revised. I think that is critical to a system.\n  I mentioned briefly the Visa Waiver Program. With 123 million people \nand 29 different countries, we would require tamper-resistant, machine-\nreadable biometric passports. Each country participating in the visa \nwaiver program would issue tamper-resistant, machine-readable biometric \npassports to its nationals by 2003. This must happen. No excuse should \nbe tolerated. If they cannot meet it, they should be dropped out of the \nprogram.\n  Prior to admitting a foreign visitor from a visa waiver country, the \nINS inspector must first determine that the individual does not appear \nin any lookout database. As a condition of a country's continued \nparticipation in the visa waiver program, the Attorney General and the \nSecretary of State must consider whether that country keeps the United \nStates apprised of the theft of blank passports. One-hundred thousand \nof them have been stolen. Again, why? Fraud.\n  This is important because terrorist organizations have made use of \nstolen or counterfeit passports from countries participating in the \nvisa waiver program. The INS would be required to enter stolen or lost \npassport numbers into the interpretable visa data system within 72 \nhours of notification of loss or theft. Until that system is \nestablished, the INS must enter that information into an existing data \nsystem. So when they come through on the visa waiver program with a \nstolen passport, that number is hot. That number pops up. Whoever is \nwaving them through knows it.\n  We know the September attacks were connected with al-Qaeda, which has \nlinks in some 60 to 70 countries around the world. It has, in fact, \nestablished bases in visa waiver countries such as Albania, Belgium, \nBosnia, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, \nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n  Al-Qaeda cells exist in these countries. Stolen passports become \navailable. They come in, and no one knows what happened after that \ntime. Clearly, we cannot allow this program to become a passageway for \nterrorists into our country.\n  We also have new requirements for passenger manifests. All commercial \nflights and vessels coming to the United States from international \nports must provide manifest information about each passenger, crew \nmember, and other occupants prior to the arrival of that flight or that \nvessel. That is critical to closing some of these loopholes. The \nmanifest has to get to the INS prior to the arrival of the ship or the \nplane.\n\n  I have checked with airlines as to whether this can be done and \nwhether it is practical. The answer is yes.\n  In addition, each vessel or aircraft departing from the United States \nfor any destination outside of the United States must provide manifest \ninformation before departure. By 2003, the manifest must be transmitted \nelectronically.\n  The Attorney General would be authorized to extend manifest \nrequirements to any public or private carrier transporting persons to \nor from the United States.\n  The Attorney General may impose a fine on carriers that fail to \nprovide manifest information or those who provide inaccurate, \nincomplete, or false information.\n  This section of the bill also eliminates the 45-minute deadline to \nclear arriving passengers which now exist in law.\n  This legislation also includes other concrete steps to restore \nintegrity to the immigration and visa process, including the following \nnew travel document requirements.\n  The bill would require all visa, passports, and other travel \ndocuments to be fraud and tamper resistant and contain biometric data \nby October 26, 2003.\n  The legislation would also require all foreign nationals to be \nfingerprinted, and when appropriate submit other biometric data to the \nState Department when applying for a visa.\n  That is reasonable. It has to be done. This provision should help to \neliminate fraud as well as identify potential threats to the country \nbefore they gain access.\n  There is a provision on nonimmigrants from certain countries. The \nbill would prohibit the issuance of nonimmigrant visas to nationals \nfrom countries designated as state-sponsored international terrorism, \nunless the Secretary of State, after consulting with the Attorney \nGeneral and the heads of other appropriate agencies, determines that \nthe individual poses no safety or security threat to the United States.\n  Student visa reforms: We worked closely with the university community \nin crafting new strict requirements for the student visa program to \ncrack down on fraud--to make sure that students really are attending \nclasses, and to give the Government the ability to track any foreign \nnational who arrives on a student visa but fails to enroll in school.\n  Prior to 9-11, I think it is fair to say that the American academic \ncommunity didn't really want to have this responsibility. After 9-11, \nto some extent, they still didn't.\n  That is when I came forward with perhaps a moratorium on the student \nvisa program. Then they came in and agreed to assume additional \nresponsibility.\n  I am very grateful to the university associations for their \nleadership in this matter. I know it is additional work for schools. \nBut I also think if the schools receive the tuition, and if the schools \nreceive the individuals, there has to be a private sector sharing of \nthis responsibility as well. That is just, and that it is appropriate. \nI believe the university community now agrees with this.\n  I am very grateful to them for their cooperation. The legislation \nalso reforms the student visa process by doing the following: It would \nrequire the Attorney General to notify schools of the student's date of \nentry and require the schools to notify--this is important--the INS if \na student has not reported to school within 30 days of the beginning of \nan academic term.\n  The monitoring program does not preselect such information as the \nstudent's date of entry, the port of entry, the date of school \nenrollment, the date the student leaves the school, graduates, or quits \nthe degree program or field of study. That, and other significant \ninformation, will now be collected.\n\n  I think it is important. I do not believe the people of my State or \nthe people of America want us to give advanced nuclear training to \nthose who would conduct a nuclear program and use that program against \nus. We know we have trained the head of the Iraqi nuclear program. We \nknow we have given a higher education to the head of the Islamic Jihad. \nI do not think our people want us to do that. I, as one Member of this \nSenate, really rebel against that kind of thing. I don't want to train \npeople who will create enormous danger to all of our citizens.\n  I think we can't entirely avoid it, but we can have those systems in \nplace that guard against it. We at present do not.\n  We would also require the INS, in consultation with the State \nDepartment, to monitor the various steps involved in admitting foreign \nstudents and to notify the school of the student's entry. This does not \npresently happen.\n  It would also require the school to notify INS if a student has not \nreported for school no more than 30 days after the deadline for \nregistering for classes. So if you are supposed to register and you do \nnot register for 30 days, right now the INS doesn't know that. You can \nbe long gone. They do not know it. This would be the school's \nresponsibility. The schools are prepared to accept that responsibility.\n  We would also mandate the INS to conduct a periodic review of \neducational institutions to monitor their compliance with recordkeeping \nand reporting requirements. If an institution or program fails to \ncomply, their authorization to accept foreign students may be revoked. \nWhile the INS currently reviews educational institutions, reviews have \nnot been done consistently in recent years, and some schools are not \ndiligent in their recordkeeping and reporting responsibilities.\n  As to more border personnel, this section authorizes an increase of \nat least 1,000 INS inspectors. If you were there--and I believe you \nwere, Madam President, this morning at our hearing--you heard the \nimmigration specialist say how very important the INS\n\n[[Page S2616]]\n\ninspector is; how overburdened--and underpaid, I would add--they are. \nThis bill would change both of those. It would add 1,000 INS \ninvestigative personnel, 1,000 Customs Service inspectors, and \nadditional associated support staff in each of fiscal years 2002 \nthrough 2006, to be employed at either the northern or southern border.\n  As to better INS pay and staffing, to help INS retain Border Patrol \nofficers and inspectors, this section would raise their pay grade and \npermit the hiring of additional support staff.\n  As to enhanced Border Patrol and Customs training to enhance our \nability to identify and intercept would-be terrorists at the border, \nfunds are provided for the regular training of Border Patrol, Customs \nagents, and INS inspectors. In addition, funds are provided to agencies \nstaffing U.S. ports of entry for continuing cross-training, to fully \ntrain inspectors in using lookout databases and monitoring passenger \ntraffic patterns, and to expand the carrier consultant program.\n  As to better State Department information and training, this section \nauthorizes funding to improve the security features of the Department \nof State screening of visa applicants. Improved security features \ninclude better coordination of international intelligence information, \nadditional staff, and continuous ongoing training of consular officers.\n  The bill contains a number of other related provisions as well, but \nthe gist of this legislation is this: Where we can provide law \nenforcement more information about potentially dangerous foreign \nnationals, we do so. Where we can reform our border crossing system to \nweed out and deter terrorists and others who would do us harm, we do \nso. And where we can update technology to meet the demands of modern \nwar against terror, we do that as well.\n\n  As we prepare to modify our immigration system, we must be sure to \nenact changes that are realistic and feasible. We must also provide the \nnecessary tools to implement them, and the money to pay for it all. I \nthink Senator Byrd was eloquent this morning in expressing that.\n  We have a lot to do, but I am confident that we will move swiftly to \naddress these important issues. The legislation Senators Kennedy, \nBrownback, Kyl, and I crafted is an important and strong first step, \nbut this is only the beginning of a long and difficult process because \nour entire intent, our body language, our laws, our philosophy, has \nbeen to have a very liberal, open border. Now we cannot afford to do \nthat.\n  Madam President, I would like to respond to any concern anyone might \nhave that this bill is anti-immigrant. We are a nation of immigrants. \nThe United States takes more immigrants legally each year than all of \nthe other industrialized nations on Earth put together. So we are a \nnation of immigrants. We recognize it; we respect it. It is what the \nStatue of Liberty stands for. And we have followed it.\n  The overwhelming percentage of people who come to live in this \ncountry do so to enjoy the blessings of liberty, equality, and \nopportunity. The overwhelming percentage of the people who visit this \ncountry mean us no harm, but there are several thousand innocent \npeople, including foreign nationals, who were killed on September 11--\nin part because a network of fanatics determined to wreak death, \ndestruction, and terror. They exploited the weaknesses of our \nimmigration system to come here, to stay here, to study here, and to \nkill here.\n  We learned at Oklahoma City that not all terrorists are foreign \nnationals. But the world is a dangerous place and the world is peopled \nwith regimes that would destroy us if they had a chance.\n  We are all casualties of September 11. Our society has necessarily \nchanged as our perception of the threats we face has changed. The \nblinders have fallen from our eyes. Clearly, we need to address the \nvulnerabilities in our immigration system that September 11 painfully \nrevealed.\n  O, that we had done it after the 1993 bombing of the World Trade \nCenter.\n  When one of the bombers was being moved after 9-11, he said to the \nFBI agent moving him: If I only had the money and explosives, I could \nhave done what was done on September 11, in 1993.\n  The changes we need to make in our system will inconvenience people. \nLet there be no doubt. Once implemented, however, those changes will \nmake it easier for law-abiding foreign visitors either to visit or to \nstudy here, and for law-abiding immigrants who want to live here to do \nso. More importantly, once they are here, their safety--and our \nsafety--will be greatly enhanced.\n\n  We must do everything we can to deter the terrorists, here and \nabroad, who would do us harm. From the Pentagon to downtown Manhattan, \nwe have learned just how high the stakes are. It would dishonor the \ninnocent victims of September 11 and the brave men and women in our \nArmed Forces who are defending our liberty at this very instant if we \nfailed in this effort.\n  So it is extraordinarily important that we enact the Enhanced Border \nSecurity and Visa Entry Reform Act. I urge the bipartisan leadership of \nthe Senate to join with us in gaining final passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would also like the Record to \nreflect the following:\n  In fiscal year 1999, the Department of State identified 291 potential \nnonimmigrants as inadmissible for security or terrorist concerns. Of \nthat number, 101 aliens seeking nonimmigrant visas were specifically \nidentified for terrorist activities, but 35 of them were able to \novercome the ineligibility.\n  Including the 19 September 11 hijackers, 47 foreign-born individuals \nhave been charged, pled guilty, or been convicted of involvement in \nterrorism on U.S. soil in the last 10 years. Of the 47 terrorists, at \nleast 13 had overstayed a temporary visa at some point prior to taking \npart in terrorist activity, including September 11 ring leader Mohamed \nAtta. Therefore, tracking visa overstays is a very important part of \nwhat we are trying to do.\n  One other fact: Some reports indicate that Khalid Al Midhar, who \nprobably flew American Airlines flight 77 into the Pentagon, was \nidentified as a terrorist by the CIA in January 2001, but his name was \nnot given to the watch list until August 2001. Unfortunately, he had \nalready reentered the United States in July 2001.\n  I should point out that there is some debate about exactly when the \nCIA identified him as a terrorist. But if it really did take the CIA \nseveral months to put his name on the list, as PBS's ``Frontline'' has \nreported, then that is a serious problem because we might have stopped \nhim from entering the country had they shared this information sooner. \nThis, of course, speaks to the issue of sharing information between \nFederal agencies.\n\n  Let me just add some information on absconders and detainees.\n  In December 2001, INS estimated that 314,000 foreigners who have been \nordered deported are at large. More recent estimates, released in March \n2002, suggest there may be at least 425,000 such absconders. At least \n6,000 were identified as coming from countries considered al-Qaeda \nstrongholds.\n  In a report released in February 2002, the U.S. General Accounting \nOffice said that antifraud efforts at the INS are ``fragmented and \nunfocused'' and that enforcement of immigration law remains a low \npriority--that enforcement of immigration law remains a low priority.\n  The report found that the agency had only 40 jobs for detecting fraud \nin 4 million applications for immigrant benefits in the year 2000. I \nthink that is a clear indication that the additional personnel provided \nfor in this bill are truly necessary.\n  Since there is no one else on the floor at the present time, I would \nlike to also put in the Record some border agency statistics.\n  There are 1,800 inspectors at ports of entry along the U.S. borders.\n  The Customs Service has 3,000 inspectors to check the 1.4 million \npeople and 360,000 vehicles that cross the border daily--1.4 million \npeople and 360,000 vehicles daily.\n  The 2,000-mile-long Mexican border has 33 ports of entry and 9,106 \nBorder Patrol agents to guard them.\n\n[[Page S2617]]\n\n  In October 2001, there were 334 Border Patrol agents assigned to the \nnearly 4,000-mile-long northern border between the United States and \nCanada. This number of agents clearly cannot cover all shifts 24 hours \na day, 7 days a week, leaving some sections of the border open without \ncoverage.\n  The Office of the Inspector General found that one northern border \nsector had identified 65 smuggling corridors along the 300 miles of \nborder within its area of responsibility.\n  INS intelligence officers have admitted that criminals along the \nnorthern border monitor the Border Patrol's radio communications and \nobserve their actions. This enables them to know the times when the \nfewest agents are on duty and to plan illegal actions accordingly.\n  The primary tool available to INS inspectors during the inspections \nprocess is the Interagency Border Inspection System, known as IBIS, \nwhich allows INS inspectors to search a variety of databases containing \nrecords and lookouts of individuals of particular concern to the United \nStates.\n  A 1999 Office of the Inspector General report found, however, that \nINS inspectors at U.S. ports of entry were not consistently checking \npassport numbers with IBIS. INS officers also failed to enter lost or \nstolen passports from visa waiver countries into IBIS in a timely, \naccurate, or consistent manner. One senior INS official from Miami \nInternational Airport told the OIG that he was not even aware of any \nINS policy that required the entry of stolen passport numbers.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I know Senators Brownback, Kyl, and \nDorgan will come to the Chamber shortly to speak. In the interim before \nthey appear, I wanted to just make a couple of budget points, at least \nas I understand them.\n  The committee, I believe the Appropriations Committee as well, has \nthe INS-anticipated budget numbers--Senator Kennedy referred to them--\nthat the total cost to implement the bill, according to the INS, is \n$3,132,307,000. The amount of the first year's cost is $1.187 billion. \nThere is $743 million additional in the President's budget, which \nleaves a net deficit of $187,959,000.\n  Of the $40 billion we appropriated after the 9-11 attacks, $20 \nbillion to New York City and $20 billion for discretionary funding, it \nis my understanding the administration has allocated all but $327 \nmillion of that $10 billion. I don't know whether that money is \navailable to be put into this program. We certainly will look and \ndetermine that.\n  I agree with those in the Senate who believe homeland defense is \nextraordinarily important; that this asymmetrical warfare we are \nengaged in is going to last a substantial period of time, perhaps a \ndecade or more; and that when we took this oath of office, we ought not \nonly uphold the Constitution but also protect and defend our people. \nTherefore, if we are really to carry this out, this becomes a very high \npriority item.\n  I am hopeful the money will be appropriated. I believe it will. There \nis now a commitment on both sides of the aisle to do so. It is going to \ntake much more money than we even recognize at the present time, but I \nbelieve the American people want us to do that. Therefore, we certainly \nshould.\n  I don't see any of the other Senators in the Chamber at this time. I \nask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter by Bruce Josten \non behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supporting the bill.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, I would like to urge you to bring to the floor as \n     soon as possible the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry \n     Reform Act of 2001 (H.R. 3525/S. 1749). As you know, the \n     Chamber and its members have been long concerned about the \n     security and efficiency of our borders for commerce and \n     travel. We believe this legislation goes a long way toward \n     achieving those goals and is particularly necessary following \n     the tragic events of September 11. The legislation has broad \n     bipartisan support, and already passed the U.S. House of \n     Representatives by voice vote on December 19, 2001.\n       This legislation takes a careful and reasoned approach to \n     the issue of border security, and we strongly support the \n     provisions to increase resources for technology and personnel \n     for our Immigration and Customs Services, enhance data \n     sharing capabilities expand pre-clearance and pre-inspection \n     programs, and direct Federal agencies to work with our NAFTA \n     partners to ensure our joint security while enhancing the \n     flow of legitimate commerce and travel across shared borders. \n     These changes are long overdue.\n       While we understand that Congress must provide adequate \n     funding if the ambitious deadlines set forth in the \n     legislation are to be met, further delay in this legislation \n     will only postpone the needed reforms that can provide both \n     security and efficiency to our inspections processes. Such \n     changes will allow business to look to the future of cross-\n     border travel and trade with some sense of stability.\n       We look forward to working with you to secure passage of \n     this legislation, and working with the Congress and the \n     Administration on its implementation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters from a number of other organizations: the American Council on \nInternational Personnel; the Alliance for International Education and \nCultural Exchange; Americans for Better Borders; and the host of \nagencies that are reflected by the Family of September 11th Victims; \nand by the Association of International Educators; and the University \nof California as well.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             NAFSA: Association of\n\n\n                                      International Education,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Chair, Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government \n         Information, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write on behalf of the Nation's \n     largest association of international education \n     professionals--with more than 8,000 members nationwide, \n     including 992 in California--to express our strong support \n     for S. 1749, the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry \n     Reform Act.\n       We have a particular interest in those parts of the bill \n     that pertain to international students and scholars. We have \n     worked closely with your offices to ensure that the bill \n     includes any necessary provisions with respect to visa \n     screening and student tracking, while at the same time \n     maintaining the openness to international students and \n     scholars that is itself important to our Nation's security. \n     In our judgment, the bill strikes that crucial balance, and \n     we congratulate you for your work.\n       We look forward to early enactment of this legislation, and \n     we pledge our ongoing cooperation to ensure its successful \n     implementation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Marlene M. Johnson,\n     Executive Director and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Americans for Better Borders,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2002.\n     To Members of the U.S. Senate:\n       We urge you to help bring S. 1749 to the floor, the \n     Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 \n     sponsored by Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Feinstein, and Kyl. \n     In December, the House passed H.R. 3525, the companion \n     measure, by voice vote. The Senate should quickly follow \n     suit.\n       Almost six months have passed since the September 11 \n     terrorist attacks. Since that time we, like the rest of the \n     nation, have focused on how to enhance our Nation's security \n     through constructive changes to our immigration policies. \n     This legislation takes a significant step in ensuring that \n     our Nation's immigration policies are in line with our common \n     goal of effectively deterring terrorism. It includes many \n     long-overdue reforms that will deter terrorism by developing \n     layers of protection both outside and within the U.S., and \n     help our country increase its intelligence capacity. It \n     provides authorization for increased funding to support \n     additional personnel and technology at our border agencies, \n     mandates better cooperation among border agencies, and \n     encourages further cooperation on a North American Security \n     Perimeter with Canada and Mexico. The bill requires new and \n     advance information sharing between the privates sector and \n     government agencies, and enhances the use of biometrics in \n     our visas and passports.\n       While we support all of these efforts, we are aware that \n     this bill also poses significant challenges to the agencies \n     and Congress to implement new technologies and processes in \n     very short deadlines. Congress must allocate\n\n[[Page S2618]]\n\n     adequate, ongoing resources to ensure that these deadlines \n     are met and new systems are property maintained and updated \n     into the future. Reliance on user fees will not be adequate \n     for this national security priority. Furthermore, if it \n     proves impossible to meet the deadlines in this legislation, \n     Congress must be willing to revisit them to ensure that the \n     legitimate cross-border flow of people, commerce and goods \n     can continue, or our economic security may be jeopardized.\n       Given the importance of this measure, we urge its swift \n     passage in the Senate and signature by the President.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     Chair, Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government \n         Information, Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write on behalf of the Alliance \n     for International Educational and Cultural Exchange, an \n     association of 65 American nongovernmental organizations that \n     conduct exchange programs of all types. We wish to \n     congratulate you and express our strong support for S. 1749, \n     the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act.\n       We have worked with your staffs as the legislation has \n     developed, and have had opportunities for input to help \n     ensure that the bill strikes the right balance between our \n     strong national interests in increased security and in \n     continued openness to exchange visitors, students, and \n     scholars from around the world. We believe you have succeeded \n     in accomplishing that important goal.\n       We look forward to the passage of this legislation, and to \n     continuing to work with you to ensure that the United States \n     remains fully, and safely, engaged with the world.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Michael McCarry,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 8, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: We write to urge you to cosponsor and help \n     enact S. 1749/H.R. 3525, the Enhanced Border Security and \n     Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001, and to commend Senators \n     Feinstein, Kyl, Brownback and Kennedy for their leadership in \n     developing this important measure. We support their \n     compromise version.\n       This legislation includes constructive changes to our \n     immigration policies that can help strengthen our nation's \n     security. These changes fill current gaps in our immigration \n     system and will increase our nation's intelligence capacity \n     as well as develop layers of protection both outside and \n     within the U.S. Among other provisions, this bill:\n       Provides consular and border personnel with the training, \n     facilities and data needed to prevent the entry of people who \n     intend to do this country harm.\n       Calls for vital improvements in technology to provide more \n     timely information.\n       Authorizes increased funding for the Department of State \n     and the Immigration and Naturalization Service so that they, \n     along with other federal agencies, can coordinate and share \n     information needed to identify and intercept terrorists.\n       Calls for a study to determine the feasibility of an North \n     American Perimeter Safety Zone. This study includes a review \n     of the feasibility of expanding and developing pre-clearance \n     and pre-inspections programs with protections for persons \n     fleeing persecution.\n       Includes provisions for a workable entry-exit control \n     system.\n       Provides for a one-year extension of the deadline for \n     individuals crossing the border to acquire biometric border \n     crossing cards.\n       S. 1749/H.R. 3525 is a bipartisan effort that merits your \n     cosponsorship and swift passage. The House passed this \n     measure in December. We urge the Senate to immediately take \n     up and pass this measure as well.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n       Church World Service.\n       Episcopal Migration Ministries.\n       Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.\n       Immigration and Refugee Services of America.\n       Institute of International Law and Economic Development.\n       Leadership Conference for Civil Rights.\n       Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services.\n       National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed \n     Officials.\n       National Council of La Raza.\n       National Immigration Forum.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American Council on\n\n\n                                International Personnel, Inc.,\n\n                       New York/Washington, DC, December 11, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Council on \n     International Personnel (ACIP) would like to thank you for \n     your leadership in enhancing our Nation's security. ACIP \n     believes the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform \n     Act of 2001 (S. 1749) takes appropriate measures to better \n     screen and track foreign visitors without imposing \n     unreasonable burdens on the mobility of international \n     personnel so vital to our Nation's economy.\n       ACIP is not-for-profit organization of 300 corporate and \n     institutional members with an interest in the global mobility \n     of personnel. Each of our members employs at least 500 \n     employees worldwide; and in total our members employ millions \n     of U.S. citizens and foreign nationals in all industries \n     throughout the United States. ACIP sponsors seminars and \n     producers publications aimed at educating human resource \n     professionals on compliance with immigration laws, and works \n     with Congress and the Executive Branch to facilitate the \n     movement of international personnel.\n       ACIP has long supported the enhanced use of electronic \n     communications and information technology to process \n     immigration petitions and visas, assess risks, identify \n     fraud, and speed legitimate foreign visitors across the \n     borders. ACIP members are heavy users of the INSPASS and Visa \n     Waiver programs. We believe that in the long run, machine-\n     readable documents and biometric technology will make these \n     programs even more successful. We fully support the expansion \n     of preclearance, the integration of agency databases and the \n     electronic transmission of visa files and passenger manifests \n     and hope this will eventually be used to facilitate \n     legitimate travelers as well as to apprehend those who pose a \n     threat. Efforts to standardize our laws with neighboring \n     countries is also a welcome step that should facilitate \n     commerce. In addition, ACIP is authorized to maintain an \n     Umbrella J Visa program for international trainees employed \n     by our member companies. While it is unclear whether the \n     Foreign Student Monitoring Program will eventually be \n     extended to programs such as ours, ACIP would be pleased to \n     participate in any pilot programs.\n       We appreciate that S. 1749 provides authorizations to \n     implement and maintain these important programs. We look \n     forward to your leadership in ensuring that adequate funds \n     are appropriated to enable the agencies to carry out these \n     missions within the ambitious timeframes. ACIP looks forward \n     to assisting you in this important work.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Lynn Frendt Shotwell,\n\n                                        Legal Counsel and Director\n     of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      University of California\n\n                                    Oakland, CA, December 3, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the University of \n     California, I am pleased to express our support for the \n     provisions regarding student visas in The Enhanced Border \n     Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001. This legislation \n     reflects a well-crafted balance between the nation's need to \n     enhance security with the benefits of international \n     education.\n       The University of California has more than 9,000 \n     undergraduate and graduate foreign students and approximately \n     23,000 foreign students in our Extension programs. We value \n     the contributions these students, and all of our students, \n     are making to education and research. Like you, we recognize \n     the tremendous benefits that UC students provide to \n     California and to our nation. International education is one \n     of our nation's best tools for sharing democratic ideas \n     around the world; we believe the instruction and research \n     opportunities UC provides are helping to better shape our \n     nation and democracy abroard.\n       The legislation you have introduced with Senator Kyl, \n     Senator Kennedy, and Senator Brownback will strengthen and \n     accelerate implementation of the foreign student tracking \n     system (SEVIS), and will provide interim measures until that \n     system is operational. On October 12, I wrote President Bush \n     asking him to support your request of $36.8 million\n\n[[Page S2619]]\n\n     for SEVIS. It is my hope that Congress and the administration \n     recognize the need to fund fully this tracking system. You \n     may be interested to know that our campuses are already \n     working with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) \n     to ensure the effective deployment of this system.\n       My colleagues and I appreciate your effort to work with us \n     in developing language that is agreeable to the University \n     and addresses your concerns about strengthening the student \n     visa system. As we have stated, the University of California \n     is ready to work with the INS and other relevant agencies in \n     implementing this legislation. Furthermore, we hope that \n     cooperative discussions will continue regarding the \n     collection of the fee associated with the tracking system.\n       Thank you for your leadership on national security issues \n     and your interest in working with the University of \n     California.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Ricahrd C. Atkinson,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I note the distinguished Senator from Arizona has \ncome to the Chamber. He is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nTechnology and Terrorism and has been the driving force behind this \nlegislation. I thank him for all his help. It has been a long road, but \nwe are almost there, we hope. I know he wants to make some remarks at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, Senator Feinstein, and I have been working \non issues relating to terrorism from the time I first came to the \nSenate. We have been either chairman or ranking member, respectively, \nof the committee ever since that time. I can think of few issues that \nhave galvanized our attention and effort--I can't think of any that \nhave accomplished that--as much as this legislation.\n  Of course, the reason is it is in response to what we found in the \naftermath of September 11--specifically, how the 19 terrorists who came \ninto the country and performed their evil deeds actually got here. What \nwe found, through testimony before the committee, was that they had all \ngotten here legally with visas. When we talked to the people who \ngranted those visas and worked in the system, many of them expressed \ngreat sorrow and disappointment that they had granted the visas. But \none in particular testified that, of course, she had no choice because \nshe had no information that would have told her she should deny the \nvisa.\n  That one little story is a metaphor for what is in this legislation. \nIf we had provided information to the people who grant visas, that \nwould have raised a red flag, at least with respect to some of these \nterrorists, that would have caused the consular offices to say, wait a \nminute, maybe we should not grant this visa.\n  I remember the testimony of one official saying, it is like the \ndriver of the car who is going through the school zone at 15 miles per \nhour and a child runs out from between parked cars. You hit the child \nand injure that child. You feel horrible about it, but you say: There \nis nothing I could do about it; I was driving 15 miles an hour through \nthe school zone, doing what I was supposed to do, and the child ran out \nin front of me. I could sense the degree of angst when she testified \nsaying: Yes, we granted this visa to Mohamed Atta, but we didn't know. \nThey could not know because we didn't have the system in place to tell \nthem that some of these people should have been denied visas.\n  We also had people coming in on student visas and then they stopped \ngoing to class. This legislation that Senator Feinstein has talked \nabout closes loopholes in the existing law that permit people who mean \nto do us harm to come into this country and stay here without being \ndetected. There is no question that, even if we passed this \nlegislation, it would still be possible for a terrorist to sneak into \nthis country and do something wrong. But if we pass this law and get it \neffective immediately, we can reduce substantially the probability that \nterrorists, such as those who came here prior to September 11, will \never be able to do that again.\n  That is the essence of the bill. I am not going to take the time this \nafternoon to go through the bill piece by piece. I will just mention a \ncouple of features of it in very general terms to make my point.\n  Due to Senator Feinstein's work, we found that prior to September 11, \nschools in the United States actively recruited foreign students \nbecause they paid a pretty high tuition to come to the schools, and the \nschools need money. We know that all of our schools, from the \nprestigious universities down to trade schools, can use extra money. So \nthey advertise for foreign students, who come here by the hundreds of \nthousands. We welcome them with open arms. But Senator Feinstein at one \npoint said: Do you think we should be a little more careful about who \nactually gets visas? The school said: Oh, no, we need the money. That \nmay not be exactly what they said, but that was the reason for being \nskeptical of any limitations that might be placed on their recruitment \nof these students.\n  So what Senator Feinstein said--and I joined her in this effort--was \nlet's craft a series of procedures that accompany the application for \nthe student visa, the accounting for that visa to the INS and Customs \nand the State Department, and the confirmation back to the school that \nthe individual should be arriving because the student visa has been \ngranted, and a confirmation back to the U.S. Government that the \nstudent is in fact enrolled in school, and so on--a series of \nprocedures that make it much more likely that the students these \nschools recruit actually will come to the school, attend classes, and \nwon't be involved in terrorism.\n\n  The multiple forms they used to have that INS used--the so-called I-\n20 form--will no longer be filled out by lots of different schools that \neach accept the student for attendance. All of those forms, in the \npast, have been either sold or shopped around in one way or another for \npeople to come into the United States ostensibly with a proper I-20 \nform from a school by which they have been accepted. But, of course, it \nwas a fraud because the student only went to 1 of the 10 schools by \nwhich he was accepted. He shopped around the other forms to friends who \nused them to come into the United States.\n  That is one of the many ways we have tightened up the law. We found \nthat people were coming into the country from nations that are on our \nterrorist list, such as Syria, a state sponsor of terrorism. Even after \nSeptember 11, it was into the teens--I think something like 19 students \nwanted to come and learn how to fly big airplanes in the United States \nfrom a country that is a state sponsor of terrorism, so designated by \nthe State Department. Our legislation makes it much more difficult for \nthat to happen. In fact, it puts the burden on the students to prove \nthey are not going to be engaged in terrorism. They can still come, but \nthey have a burden of proof there.\n  One of the most important things we do is coordinate information that \nwe gather on people abroad who want to come here, whether it is the \nCIA, FBI, INS, State Department, or even international agencies such as \nInterpol, or anyone else who may have information that would cast doubt \non whether an individual should be granted a visa.\n  All of that information will be available. It will not be put \ntogether in one database, but it is going to be accessible to the \npeople who make the decision whether to grant a visa. The consular \nofficer will be able to scroll down the list, and when he finds the \nname of the person involved, he will see whether or not there is a red \nflag there. It may say don't grant a visa because he is wanted for a \nfelony. That is fairly easy. It may say there is information pertaining \nto this individual that can only be shared with a very limited number \nof people, but it has a bearing on potential terrorism, and therefore \nyou need to back this up to your supervisor who can have access to the \nclassified information. One way or the other, though, any information \nthat should be available to the people who make the decisions will be \nmade available. That is probably the central feature of this \nlegislation. It is going to cost money.\n  Senator Byrd spoke before the Immigration Subcommittee this morning,\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\nand he said: I sure hope that if we pass this bill, you will all \nsupport the appropriations necessary to fund it. We all made the \ncommitment that we indeed would do that--that, clearly, we are going to \nhave to have the support of the INS and the appropriators in Congress \nand the rest of us to ensure that once we authorize this closing of \nloopholes, the programs we put into place to do that will be funded \nproperly and will be administered by the INS.\n  Senator Byrd raised the question about whether or not we should \nreform INS first. I don't think there is one of us here who doesn't \nthink they need to reform INS. But, clearly, we cannot wait. We cannot \nallow terrorists to come into this country while we are trying to \nfigure out how to reform INS. We have to ask the people at INS who work \nhard and try hard to begin to put into place the protections that are \nembodied in this legislation.\n\n  While we are also going about figuring out how to reform the INS, we \ncannot afford to not proceed with this bill, which would begin to close \nthose loopholes. So I hope our colleagues will come to the floor and \ndebate.\n  One of the questions was: Should we do this by unanimous consent or \nshould we have debate on the floor? We agreed to have debate. So \nanybody who wants that opportunity for debate now has it. I think that \nafter today, and perhaps Monday, if they have not come to the floor, we \ncan conclude that in fact there is no more debate necessary on the bill \nand we can move to its adoption. I hope we can do that very quickly.\n  I encourage my colleagues who want to speak to come here and do so. \nIf they have amendments, fine, we will consider those. We think it is \npretty good without amendments. We are taking up the House-passed bill, \nand it would be much easier to be able to pass that bill. If there are \namendments, let's see what they are. I hope we can quickly get this \nbill to the President. He said he wants to be able to sign it. I have \npersonally spoken with Governor Tom Ridge, who is anxious to move \nforward as quickly as possible to get this done.\n  I think we can at least say we have done what we can do. We cannot do \neverything to prevent terrorism, but we know we can do some things in \nthe Senate. I have felt pretty bad for the last several months that we \nhave not put this into place. I have asked, have I done everything I \ncan do to get this bill on the floor and get it started on closing the \nloopholes. The Senate can do something to fight this war on terrorism, \nand that needs to be done now. I will feel a whole lot better when we \nhave passed this bill and sent it on to the President and he has signed \nit into law. I will at least know I have done everything I can do, at \nleast with respect to these issues, to make sure we are not again \nstruck by people we should not have allowed into this country.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Tom Alexander\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to take 2 minutes of my colleagues' \ntime on an extraneous matter, if my colleagues will permit me. We would \nnot be able to do the work we do--I see Senator Feinstein's staff and \nmy colleagues can see my staff sitting here. LaVita and Elizabeth are \npeople who have made it possible for us to get this legislation before \nthe Senate.\n  Our staff means a great deal to those of us who work with them \nclosely. We know to a significant extent the successes we have are due \nto their efforts.\n  Today one of my staff members is leaving my employment to go to the \nDepartment of Labor. It is our loss and Secretary Chao's gain. He has \nworked with me since 1994. Most staff members do not stay around that \nlong. His name is Tom Alexander. There is not a staff member who has \never been employed by me who has worked harder, has been more \ndedicated, more loyal, and has been more effective on the issues that \nhe has handled than Tom Alexander.\n  I have told the rest of my staff that if they want an example of who \nto emulate, how to act, they should think of Tom. He is the kind of \nperson who sets the example, I said, with one caveat: Do not stay \naround in the evening as long as Tom does. I have told him to go home \nat 8 or 9 o'clock at night, and that is staying too long. Other than \nworking too hard, Tom has been that exemplary employee who, again, \nmakes us look good.\n  I will give a couple of notes about him so my colleagues have an idea \nof the kind of person he is.\n  He is a former Missouri tax prosecutor and worked in the Reagan White \nHouse and served in the first Bush administration Labor Department.\n  He also previously served on the legislative staff of Representative \nJim McCrery. I talked with Representative McCrery before I offered Tom \nthe job in my office. Jim recommended him highly and, as a result, I \nwas able to hire him.\n  He is married to Patricia. They have a son born last year, Shane. Tom \nalso has a 14-year-old son, of whom I know he is very proud, a \nsophomore in high school.\n  As I said, he has served on my staff since 1994 primarily--that, by \nthe way, is January 1994--primarily working on health care matters. He \nhas also served as my legislative director for the last year or so. He \nhas worked on issues dealing with emergency medical treatment, EMTALA, \nMedicare private contracting, Patients' Bill of Rights, IHS off-\nreservation reimbursement issues for Native Americans, antitrust, \nantigag rule, HMOs, and the teacher tax credit--a variety of issues \nthat are important to the people of Arizona and have resulted in good \npolicies for all of the people of the United States.\n  It is very rare I come to this Chamber to speak about an employee, \nbut Tom Alexander is special, and I hope by doing so, it will allow \nfolks who are not necessarily familiar with the staff of Senators to \nget just a little bit of an appreciation as to how much these people \nmean to us, how important they are in representing all Americans. They \nare what allow us to make the policies and do the work we do.\n  From the bottom of my heart, I thank Tom Alexander for his service on \nbehalf of the people of Arizona and the United States and service in my \noffice. Thank you, Tom.\n  Mr. President, I yield to Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kyl for those remarks. \nOne of the great treats of my tenure in the Senate, I guess now 9\\1/2\\ \nyears, has been to work with him. I do not think we have ever had a \ncross word between us. It has been a wonderful working relationship. I \nam very grateful for it. When we can work across the aisle the way we \nhave worked, we can be much more productive. So I thank the Senator \nfrom Arizona for his work. He is a great ranking member. He was a great \nchairman of the committee. I have enjoyed it thoroughly. I thank him \nfor his work on this bill. I also thank his staff.\n  I wish to comment about my staff also. She is LaVita Strickland \nsitting to my right. She is a Judiciary counsel. She is very mild \nmannered, but she has been very tenacious in the pursuit of the \nconsideration of this bill and has become very forceful. LaVita is \nenormously talented. I am very proud of her. I thank her for many hours \nof hard work. I think we have a good product. Thank you very much, \nLaVita.\n  I see the Senator from Kansas, the ranking member of the Immigration \nSubcommittee, has come to the Chamber. I wish to turn this over to him \nand also thank him for his cooperation. Senator Kyl and I sat down with \nSenators Kennedy and Brownback and had some good discussions and were \nable to put this together. Our respective staffs followed up.\n  I am very grateful to him for his cooperation and leadership as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I acknowledge Senator Feinstein. She \nhas talked about our cooperation and working together. I share the \npleasure she has had in that relationship. There is nobody I have \nworked closer with in the Senate, Republican or Democrat, than Senator \nFeinstein. It has not only been a good experience but has produced good \nresults, such as this legislation.\n  Since she mentioned LaVita Strickland, I will mention Elizabeth Maier \nof my staff. Elizabeth is one of the experts on immigration in the \nSenate. Working with Senator Brownback's staff and Senator Kennedy's \nstaff, those four staff people, working together in a bipartisan \nmanner, might\n\n[[Page S2621]]\n\nsuggest to Senators how we can work together in the future. I \nappreciate the work all of them did. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank my \ncolleagues for putting this bill forward. I particularly thank Senators \nKennedy, Feinstein, and Kyl for their great work and leadership on this \nlegislation.\n  I am delighted that we have this broad bipartisan bill to deal with a \nserious security issue in this country. I am hopeful we will pass this \nin short order so we can provide better border security for our Nation. \nIt is a delight to be with them in the Chamber and with my staff, David \nNeal, who has worked so hard on getting this legislation to the point \nwhere we can consider it and hopefully pass it.\n  The House has acted. The President wants it. We can act in short \norder and provide greater security at our borders. I thank my \ncolleagues for their leadership and all they have done on this \nparticular bill.\n  Mr. President, this really is a time of trial for our Nation. Those \nwere horrific acts on September 11 of last fall. We were shocked, and \nthis Nation went into a situation of prosecuting the war on terrorism \nand building up our defenses at home at the same time. This bill is a \nkey component of building those defenses at home.\n  Senators Feinstein, Kennedy, Kyl, and myself have worked on the bill. \nWe have to make sure we are secure at home. We have to make sure the \npeople who come into the United States seek to not do us harm but to do \nus good.\n  We have millions of border crossings each year. The number I have \nseen is about 250 million total legal border crossings into the United \nStates each year of people who are not U.S. citizens.\n  Out of that, we are looking for a handful that seek to do us harm. We \nhave to be able to be very smart about this and very targeted about \nthis in stopping them. We literally are looking for a needle in a \nhayfield.\n  I talked previously about it being a needle in a haystack. This \nliterally is a needle in a hayfield.\n  On September 11, we fell victim to evil of such incomprehensible \nbarbarism we did not see it coming. Confronted with the unthinkable, we \nfind our Nation now being tested. Do we have the ingenuity to defend \nourselves from this evil? What protections will we take to safeguard \nour people and our way of life? Can we thwart terrorism without \ncompromising the freedoms and values that make us strong?\n  That is the balance Senator Kennedy, Senator Feinstein, Senator Kyl, \nand myself really sought to try to achieve in this legislation, that \nbalance of protection and safeguarding the freedoms that are America.\n  I have no doubt we are up to this task. President Bush and the \ndedicated men and women of the Armed Forces, of law enforcement, and of \npublic service diligently fight the good and noble fight. To all of \nthese people we are very grateful.\n  I commend the administration for everything it has done and is doing \nto safeguard our great Nation. However, September 11 has shaken the \npublic's confidence in the laws and institutions that guard our \nborders. There are nagging concerns about whether our Government is \nfully prepared to intercept and prevent terrorists as they seek to \ncross our borders. That is why last fall my distinguished colleagues, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Kyl, Senator Feinstein, and I, combined our \nefforts to craft legislation that would close the security gaps in our \nimmigration system and make needed reform to our visa practices.\n  We assembled the legislation before us, the Enhanced Border Security \nand Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, to address several critical \nweaknesses in our border security. Let me underscore this point: Our \nlegislation does not make desirable changes to our law and practices; \nIt makes essential changes. It makes essential changes that we need not \nnow do; we needed them yesterday.\n  The importance of doing such now is critical. We should have done it \nyesterday, but now is the time we can finally do it. These are not \ndesirable; they are essential. We do not need them today. We needed \nthem yesterday. We have to get this done.\n  The provisions in this legislation are not created out of hurried or \nrash deliberation. Far from it. The border security bill was carefully \nvetted with our colleagues in the Senate before its introduction last \nNovember, and it was carefully manipulated and worked in bicameral \nnegotiations before its passage by the House last December. There were \nlots of negotiations, discussions, and people from whom we solicited \ninput on what we should be doing.\n  This legislation has widespread support in the Senate, including the \nmajority leader, the minority leader, the chairman and ranking member \nof the Judiciary Committee, the chairman and ranking member of the \nImmigration Subcommittee, and the chairman and ranking member of the \nTechnology and Terrorism Subcommittee.\n  This legislation has ringing endorsements from a wide array of \ninterests in the public, including family groups, business groups, law \nenforcement and academic institutions. We have extensively consulted \nexperts from both within the executive branch and outside it. In short, \nwe have utilized the insights of the affected agencies and the affected \npublic. Even though the legislation may contain some tough provisions, \nthe people and entities affected by this legislation see the wisdom in \nit.\n\n  This bill has broad bipartisan support for it carefully balances all \nthe competing interests in the immigration equation. Our Nation \nreceives millions of foreign nationals each year, persons who come to \nthe United States to visit family, to do business, to tour our sites, \nto study and to learn. Most of these people enter lawfully. They are \nour relatives, our friends, and our business partners. They are good \nfor our economy and a witness to our democracy and our way of life. \nThey become our ambassadors of goodwill to their own countries.\n  We do not want terrorists to shut our doors to the people we want to \nvisit. At the same time, we must take intelligent measures to keep out \nthe small fraction of people who mean us harm. This legislation \nrequires such measures and makes them possible.\n  The terrorists of September 11 exploited our lack of information and \ngovernmental coordination. The border security bill recognizes that the \nwar on terrorism is, in large part, a war of information. To be \nsuccessful, we must improve our ability to collect, compile, and \nutilize information critical to our safety and our national security. \nThis bill, therefore, requires that the agencies tasked with screening \nvisa applications and applicants for admission to the United States, \nnamely the Department of State and the Immigration and Naturalization \nService, be provided with law enforcement and intelligence information \nnecessary for them to identify terrorists.\n  By directing better coordination and access, this legislation will \nbring together the agencies that have the information and others that \nneed it, making prompt and effective information sharing between those \nagencies a reality.\n  Of course, to the degree we can realistically do so, we should seek \nto intercept terrorists well before they reach our borders. We must, \ntherefore, consider security measures to be placed not only at domestic \nports of entry but also at foreign ports of departure. To that end, \nthis legislation directs the State Department and the Service to \nexamine, expand, and enhance screening procedures to take place outside \nthe United States, such as preinspection and preclearance. It also \nrequires international air carriers to transmit passenger manifests for \nprearrival review by the Service.\n  Further, it eliminates the 45-minute statutory limit on airport \ninspections which compromises the Service's ability to screen arriving \nflights properly.\n  Finally, this bill requires these agencies to work with Canada and \nMexico to create a collaborative North American security perimeter, and \nthis is a point that I want to emphasize, as some of my colleagues have \nalready. We need to extend the perimeters of our borders in this \ncountry to include Canada and Mexico.\n  I was with the Attorney General last spring, in March of last year, \nbefore September 11, at the El Paso INS detention facility. At that \ndetention facility were people who had tried to come across our borders \nillegally.\n\n[[Page S2622]]\n\nThere were people there from 59 different countries, many of whom had \ncome in through Central America, some places in South America, had \ntaken land transportation up through Central America, through Mexico, \nto our borders. We need to extend that perimeter to include Canada and \nMexico and work closely and cooperatively with them to be able to stop \nthese people when they are in the process of trying to enter illegally \ninto the United States.\n\n  While this legislation mandates certain technological improvements, \nit does not ignore the human element in the security equation. This \nbill requires that terrorist lookout committees be instituted at every \nconsular post and the consular offices be given special training for \nidentifying would-be terrorists. It also provides special training to \nBorder Patrol agents, inspectors, and Foreign Service officers to \nbetter identify terrorists and security threats to the United States.\n  This legislation considers certain classes of aliens that raise \nsecurity concerns for our country, nationals from states that sponsor \nterrorism and foreign students from those countries. This bill \nexpressly prohibits the State Department from issuing a nonimmigration \nvisa to any alien from a country that sponsors terrorism until it has \nbeen determined that the alien does not pose a security threat to the \nsafety or national security of the United States.\n  As for students, this legislation fills data and reporting gaps in \nour foreign student programs by requiring the Service to electronically \nmonitor every stage in the student visa process. It also requires the \nschool to report a foreign student's failure to enroll, and the Service \nto monitor a school's compliance with this reporting requirement.\n  We certainly should be careful not to compromise our values or our \neconomy in this border security measure. However, we must take \nintelligent steps to enhance the security of our borders, and we must \ndo so now.\n  This legislation, which was already urgently needed when it was \nintroduced and put forward last fall, does just what I have articulated \nand does so without compromising our values or our economy. I certainly \nwill urge the swift passage of this critical legislation.\n  I inform Members we held a hearing this morning on this piece of \nlegislation. We had an expert from the American Immigration Lawyers \nAssociation, Miss Kathleen Cambell Walker, who went through the various \nprovisions of the bill and her strong support for it. She noted a \ncouple of key things I will pass on to Members. She felt it was \ncritical to put the increased funding for inspectors into the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service. It is good what we are doing. \nShe supports the legislation and thinks it is the right thing to do, \nbut we need more inspectors to enforce it, not just Border Patrol but \ninspectors to make sure the laws are followed.\n  Senator Byrd appeared before our committee after her and testified \nabout his desire to adequately fund this task, his desire to do it last \nfall, and the need to be able to do that now. Within the President's \nbudget is $742 million to help fund the enhanced border security \nmeasure.\n  The committee, in our deliberations, from the information we received \nfrom the Department of Justice, said this would take about $3.1 billion \nfor total implementation, about $1.13 billion this year for the initial \nfirst year implementation, to give Members some idea of the cost we are \ntalking about. Over half, two-thirds, of the cost for this year's \nimplementation is already built into the Bush budget. That is an \nimportant step we are taking to get the money needed to help enhance \nthis legislation and get it passed.\n  We have to have this information sharing. We have talked about it, \nbut the key point I make is currently we collect information from a \nnumber of different sources. INS has information, CIA has information, \nDIA, the FBI has information. They are mostly in stovepipes. We have to \nget the information shared when we are looking for the needle in the \nhaystack, this bad person who seeks to come into our country and do \nharm, among the millions who seek to come to our country and do good. \nWe need to know this of somebody desiring ill toward the United States \nso we will be able to get at them. That information sharing is \ncritical.\n  We need to have resources in the system to make sure if we put in \nbiometric cards we have biometric readers at the borders, equipment \nthat can read that. That funding will be critical to this legislation.\n  Down the road, we are going to have to consider reorganization of the \nINS. Bills are pending in the House to do that. We are working on one \nnow in the Senate. We should not wait on that reorganization before we \ndo the border security enhancement. It is important we do this border \nsecurity enhancement now. The reorganization of the INS will take some \ntime. We needed this legislation yesterday, last year. We should not \nwait on that to hold up this piece of legislation.\n  I discussed the preinspection and the passenger manifest list, the \nstudent program. We get a number of foreign students in the United \nStates. It is important we have them. We have to have better tracking \nof the foreign students. It is reported in the committee that two \ninvolved in September 11 were here on student visas. They did not \nreport to their student sites. We need better monitoring of foreign \nstudents. We can head some of this off in the future if we monitor \nforeign students.\n  We have other provisions but those are the most important. We need to \npass this bill. We should not take more than, I hope, a day or two to \nget it debated and consider any amendments, to get this passed and to \nthe President. The House has acted. It has passed this measure. We need \nto act and get it to the President to secure our borders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nEnhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001, of which I \nam an original cosponsor. I am relieved that the Senate is finally \nconsidering this bill, which the House has passed not once, but twice, \nand has the strong support of President Bush.\n  With the passage of the USA Patriot Act, Congress resolved some of \nthe ambiguities in the Immigration and Nationality Act as it related to \nthe admission and deportation of terrorists. We also provided the \nAttorney General the power to detain suspected terrorists before they \ncould do further harm. The changes to the law were very necessary, but \nmore must be done.\n  The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001 closes \nadditional loopholes in our immigration law, procedure, and practice \nthat have in the past provided terrorists access to our country. First, \nit strengthens our initial line of defense--the borders and our \nembassies abroad--by providing additional staff and training. Moreover, \nit breaks down some of the barriers that have prevented a comprehensive \ndata sharing operation between intelligence agencies, law enforcement, \nthe State Department, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nand compels the use of biometric technology to enhance our ability to \nconfirm the identity of those seeking admission into our country.\n  Second, it restricts the issuance of nonimmigrant visas to nationals \nof countries that sponsor terrorism by requiring that our government \nfirst conclude that the admission of that person poses no safety or \nnational security threat to the United States. And it repeals that \nprovision of the law compelling a 45-minute clearance time for arriving \naliens at our ports of entry, which has, to date, handcuffed the INS's \nability to properly screen all incoming travelers.\n  Finally, it solves some of the problems with our foreign student \nprogram. The bill provides for increased data collection from students \nso we can know more precisely who they are and where they will reside \nwhile in the United States. Also, under this bill, the State Department \nmust now confirm that the student has been admitted to a qualified \neducational institution before it can issue any student visa, and the \nschools themselves will be placed under the affirmative obligation of \nreporting, every single term, those who fail to attend. Finally, the \nbill requires the INS to periodically review the educational \ninstitutions and other entities authorized to enroll or sponsor foreign \nstudents to determine whether they\n\n[[Page S2623]]\n\nare complying with prescribed reporting requirements.\n  This bill deserves our support. The House of Representatives moved \nquickly on its passage last December and, again, last month. They \nrecognized the need for its provisions. Likewise we should move, and \nmove quickly, to send this bill to the President for his signature. We \ncan delay no longer. The principal parties, and I commend them, \nSenators Brownback, Kyl, Kennedy, and Feinstein and their staffs \ndeserve a tremendous amount of credit for the many hours of discussion, \nmeetings, and negotiations which have led to the end result. This bill \nhas the support of our government, the State and Justice Departments, \nand represents a very common-sense approach to further immigration \nreform. Thankfully, many of you agree, as evidenced by the nearly 60 \ncosponsors to the original bill. I am confident, then, that the Senate \nwill pass this profoundly significant legislation and I look forward to \nthat result.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have had a good presentation from our \ncolleagues on the issue of border security that has had several hours. \nI am enormously grateful for the presentation of my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein, and also Senator Brownback, Senator Kyl, \nand the thoroughness of their presentations. During the course of the \nday, since we have been considering this bill, we have been responding \nto a number of questions that have been brought up.\n  For all intents and purposes, I don't know another of our colleagues \nwanting to speak. I don't intend to foreclose that possibility, but I \nthink we were prepared to consider amendments this afternoon. We \nunderstood, as the majority leader indicated, there would not be any \nvotes, but we were hopeful at least that we would be able to consider \nsome amendments and set those aside and at least have the opportunity \nto review them this afternoon and put them in the Record so our \ncolleagues could examine them on Monday next. But we will look forward, \nwhen we resume this discussion on Monday, to considering other \namendments. We invite colleagues, if they have them and if they would \nbe good enough, to share those amendments with myself or the other \nprincipal sponsors. We will do the best we can to respond to them, and \nthose who are related we may be willing to accept. We will consider \nthem and indicate to Members if they are acceptable and, if not, why \nthey are not.\n  We are thankful to the leaders for their cooperation in arranging for \nus to be able to bring this matter before the Senate. I will not repeat \nat this time why there is a sense of urgency about it. I think that \ncase has been well made.\n  Earlier today, we had a good hearing on this subject matter and we \nreceived additional support for this measure, for which we are very \ngrateful. So I think it represents our best judgment on a matter that \nwe consider to be important to the security of our country. I hope we \nwill be able to dispose of this legislation in the early part of next \nweek.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is there an order for business following \nthe consideration of the pending legislation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.

Mr. President, I am once again before the Senate because \nof the situation regarding the ANWR amendment which will be presented \nto the Senate next week. We are not on the energy bill now. I have \nspoken briefly twice this week on energy and its relationship to the \npossible development of the 1.5 million acres on the Arctic Plain. We \ncall it the 1002 area. Some people call it ANWR.\n  ANWR is the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. During the period I was \nin the Interior Department in the sixties, the Arctic National Wildlife \nRange was created. That range was 9 million acres. It specifically \nprovided that oil and gas leasing under stipulations to protect the \nfish and wildlife could proceed in that 9 million acres.\n  The area that is now within the 1002 area was a portion of that 9 \nmillion acres. I have a chart to show that. It is a very interesting \nhistory. In the original area of the 9 million acres, there is the \ncoastal plain of the 1002 area which is an area set aside by an \namendment offered by Senators Jackson and Tsongas. I will talk about \nthat later. It is 1.5 million acres. The remainder of that original \nArctic wildlife range is now totally wilderness.\n  In 1980, there was an addition to the wildlife area in the Arctic. It \nis refuge, but it is not wilderness. So there are now, because of the \nact of 1980, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, 19 \nmillion acres in this Arctic area. It is, in fact, the Arctic wildlife \nrefuge. The part that is not refuge yet is the 1002 area which is \nspecifically, because of the Jackson-Tsongas amendment, available for \noil and gas leasing following that basic act.\n  I have to confess to the Senate and to anyone who might be interested \nin watching this presentation, I have not been sleeping well lately. I \nhave spent almost 34 years in the Senate, and I remember only one other \nnight that I did not sleep, and that was with regard to the time \nrecently when a very great and dear friend of mine passed away, and I \nwas chiding myself because I had not seen enough of him and found I did \nnot sleep.\n\n  Since I have been back from the trip to the Asian regions of the \nPacific with my great friend, Senator Inouye, during the last recess, I \nhave been trying to concentrate on the subject of the possible oil and \ngas development in Alaska, not only the oil potential of the 1002 area \nbut also the Alaska natural gas pipeline.\n  At the time that oil was discovered in 1968 in the great Prudhoe Bay \narea, which is on State lands and did not require Federal permission to \nstart oil was discovered there in enormous quantities. At the time of \nthe discovery, the wells came in somewhere around 500,000 to 1 million \nbarrels a day.\n  The great environmental organizations--I call them the radical \nenvironmental organizations--opposed the building of the Alaska oil \npipeline. As a matter of fact, that pipeline was delayed for over 4 \nyears by litigation brought by these radical groups trying to prove \neverything from we were going to kill the caribou to we were going to \ndestroy the area. They have alleged since that time that this area \nwhich we call the 1002 area is wilderness.\n  Wilderness is a word of art in our State because we have more \nwilderness in our State than all the rest of the United States put \ntogether. This area that was set up in the fifties by the Secretary of \nthe Interior and then approved by President Eisenhower was originally \nset up at the request of the Fairbanks Women's Garden Club. Fairbanks \nwas my first home in Alaska, and that area was set aside in response to \ntheir request that there be some area designated in which the interests \nof the fish and wildlife of the Arctic area would be protected, but \nthey specifically--specifically--excepted from that protection the \nconcept of oil and gas leasing subject to consideration of stipulations \nthat would, in fact, be required to protect fish and wildlife should \nthere be oil and gas development.\n  Prudhoe Bay is in the area of State lands, and this is Federal land. \nAs the President realized at the time we obtained statehood, we \nobtained the right to select lands. All other States of the Union had \nthe right on public lands to take sections 16 and 36 out of every\n\n[[Page S2624]]\n\ntownship. They selected those lands as they were surveyed.\n  With an area such as Alaska, which is one-fifth the size of all the \nUnited States, 20 percent of all the lands of the United States and \nhalf of the Federal lands are in the State of Alaska. We determined we \ncould not wait for surveying and asked Congress, and did receive, the \nright to select lands which were then to be surveyed out--not the whole \nState to be surveyed but our selection to be surveyed out.\n  Subsequently, our native people received in 1971 the right to, again, \nselect lands to satisfy their settlement of the Alaska Native land \nclaims in the Settlement Act of 1971 of some 40 million acres outright, \nand additional areas were represented by their traditional burial \ngrounds and traditional lands. So it adds up to about 45 million acres \nthat the Alaska Natives selected.\n  We are in the process now of trying to relate all of this to the \nAmerican public so they will ask their Senators to support what we want \nto do, and that is to open this 1002 area now--as it was committed to \nus in 1980 would be done--to oil and gas exploration and development.\n  To get this all into context, this chart shows our State of Alaska \nimposed upon the United States using the same scale. Normally, when one \nlooks at the State of Alaska at the top of the North American maps, \nthey see Alaska just a little place up at the top where people think \nthat has to be a small place.\n  Actually, it goes from the east coast to almost the west coast and \nalmost from Duluth down into the middle of Texas. It is a concept of \nspace that most people do not realize, almost three times the size of \nTexas. My old friend, Senator Tower from Texas, used to say he was \nafraid we might iron the place out and it would be as big as the whole \ncountry because there are a lot of mountains up there.\n  This is a route of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline which was the subject of \naction by the Senate in 1968. This is the ANWR outline with the 1002 \narea in green, and the area we seek to develop is right up there. Two \nthousand acres out of the 1.5 million acres will be developed according \nto the bill passed by the House authorizing us to proceed with oil and \ngas exploration in ANWR.\n  The problem I have been talking about all week is we face a different \ncircumstance than we did in 1973 when we sought to get the oil and gas \npipeline completed. It had been, as I said, subject to litigation for a \nseries of years and we determined we had to get legislative \nauthorization to proceed. My great and good friend and mentor, Senator \nJackson of Washington, was the chairman of the Senate Interior and \nIndian Affairs Committee, and he was the author of the Right of Way Act \nto amend the rights of way provisions to cross Federal lands for \nutilities and pipelines. We encouraged him to include a provision to \nauthorize the construction of the oil and gas pipeline, and to permit \nits immediate initiation. During that period of time, as a matter of \nfact, Senator Jackson sent out a letter--and I will have that put on \neveryone's desk on Monday. It was signed by himself and Senator \nHatfield--urging that the views expressed by these extreme radical \nenvironmentalists be ignored because of the great necessity to have \nthat oil because it was a matter of national security.\n  This is a poster of General Eisenhower back during World War II where \nhe called attention to the Petroleum Industry War Council. There were \nsome people leaving their work in the oilfields and enlisting in the \nArmy, and General Eisenhower, to his great credit, sent this message:\n\n       Your work is vital to victory . . . Our ships . . . Our \n     planes . . . Our tanks must have oil.\n\n  He was then the supreme commander of our expeditionary force and he \nsaid, ``Stick to your job. Oil is ammunition.''\n  We are at war again, and the same radical environmentalists are now \nopposing us moving out into another area of Alaska to explore for oil \nand gas. It is within this 1002 area.\n  In 1980, I had long and serious discussions with two great Senators. \nThis is the photo taken of Senator Jackson, Senator Tsongas, and \nmyself, standing outside in the hall, discussing the amendment that had \nbeen agreed to, that I agreed to support, that my colleague opposed, in \norder to settle the dispute over the Alaskan National Interest \nConservation Lands Act. That 1002 provision was authored by these two \nSenators.\n  As I said last week, God would that they would still be alive. We \nwould not be having these arguments because they were men of their \nword. They gave us their commitment. My State, my colleague and I, had \nopposed the Alaskan National Interest Conservation Lands Act because of \nthe original provisions in the House bill that would have prohibited \noil and gas development in the 1002 area. They crafted the amendment \nthat gave us the chance to proceed to develop oil and gas in that area, \nprovided there was an environmental impact statement filed, approved by \nthe Secretary of Interior and the President which then had to be \napproved by Congress, which then had the job of authorizing proceeding \nwith oil and gas development in that area.\n\n  It was 1980 that we received that commitment. At the time of that \ncommitment, we thought this would proceed in a year or two. As a matter \nof fact, the first environmental impact statement was made during the \nfirst Reagan administration. President Reagan asked Congress to approve \nit. Congress did not act. Then they ordered another environmental \nimpact statement, and the President asked Congress to approve it. It \ndid not. Subsequently, during the Clinton administration, Congress \ninitiated two acts, primarily at my request, to approve an \nenvironmental impact statement and direct the administration to \ncommence oil and gas leasing activity in this area. President Clinton \nvetoed those bills.\n  So we are now, 21 or 22 years later, based on the act of 1980, still \ntrying to see that the commitment made to Alaska, as part of the \ncondition for withdrawing almost 100 million acres of Alaska--which, \nincidentally, came ahead of the State selections, ahead of the Native \nselections. The only concession we could get out of the whole situation \nthat made any sense was the 1002 area, which we knew was our future.\n  I was just home to Alaska twice in the last 2 weeks, and I have to \nreport that my State is in dire trouble. Our timber mills have been \nclosed down. Our pulp mills are closed down. All our major mines are \nclosed down. There is no wildcat oil and gas activity in our State at \nall. Even the number of cruise ships that come to Alaska has been \nlimited now by action of the Federal Government.\n  Our future is still in resources. Half of the coal of the United \nStates is in Alaska. None of it can be reached because of an act of \nCongress. That act of Congress provided that in order to have the right \nto develop the coal of Alaska, an operator would have to restore the \nnatural contour. Well, that coal is found in areas of ice lenses and \nextreme cover of ice and water. Obviously, when coal is strip-mined, \nthere is a hole. The original contour cannot be restored.\n  That provision was added to a bill one day, over my great objection, \nand has prevented the development of any new coal mines in Alaska since \nthat time.\n  Our oil is in the Arctic. It is not only in our State. We have the \none in Canada, too. If we look at the map of the Arctic of the world, \nthat is where most of the oil is, up near the Arctic Circle and above \nthe Arctic Circle. We have the vast areas where oil in tremendous \nquantities has been found.\n  We believe within the area covered by 1002--I did not mention that \nwas a 7-year fight; from 1973 to 1980 we fought to try to preserve the \nright to develop this area. But this is a historic oil and gas activity \nin the Canadian area.\n  This is adjacent to us. Our wells are in the Prudhoe Bay area, very \nfew of them. These are the Canadian oil wells all over in this area, \nincluding the area of the Porcupine caribou herd. The Porcupine caribou \nherd is a Canadian herd. It is not an Alaskan herd. It comes into \nAlaska once a year, most of the time, and comes up during the calving \nperiod. It is not during the mating period but the calving period. The \ncalves have been dropped up in this area, not in the 1002 area but in \nthe area along the plain. There have been sometimes when they have gone \ninto the 1002 area and there have also been times in recent years they \nhave not come at all. One of the reasons for that is the path the \ncaribou wanders\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\nthrough Canada. In Canada, caribou is not a game animal; it is a \ndomestic animal. They can harvest as many as they want. These caribou \ncan be harvested in Canada. The numbers are going down, no question, \nbut not because of interference on our slope.\n\n  To the contrary, the central caribou herd--around the land of the \npipeline--has increased in size and is almost four to five times in \nnumber as before. The western caribou herd is not migrating anymore and \nis out toward Wainwright, AK. This map shows the withdrawal areas I \nmentioned. The areas are in the withdrawal land before the State of \nAlaska was granted statehood and before the Natives got their land. \nThese lands were set aside in 1980 by an act of Congress. One of the \nconditions in our favor was that we can explore that little area up \nthere in the 1002 area.\n  The western herd of caribou is out here. They could not migrate \nanymore. The central caribou herd has increased enormously, so has the \nwestern. It is the Porcupine herd that is reduced in numbers, but there \nis no oil and gas activity now that has caused that. We keep hearing we \ncaused that, but there is no oil and gas activity there. That is caused \nby hunting and by predators. We now do not have any control over the \nwolves. Those caribou travel thousands of miles to go to the Arctic \narea to drop their calves. They are, most of them, pregnant female \ncaribou and are easily killed by wolves. The same people who are trying \nto prohibit us from oil and gas activity bring on the problems of \ntrying to find some way to reduce the predators that are killing the \nPorcupine herd.\n  In my time in the Senate, I have taken literally 100 Senators to the \nNorth Slope to show them this area. Those are the caribou that do come \nto the oil and gas area. This is the central caribou herd. I don't care \nif it is winter or summer, you will find them there. In fact, when we \nfinished the oil pipeline, the university developed a new type of cover \nfor the tundra, and it happens to be a very great favorite of the \ncaribou. We have the oil industry replant that whole area with the new \nvegetation. It is tremendous food for them.\n  In passing, it is not just caribou that like the pipeline. The \npipeline is like a paved highway. Did you know oil coming from the \nground in Alaska is hot? If you go near the pipeline, you are walking \non a nice, warm sidewalk. The bears like it. We have great fondness for \nour wildlife. Alaskans go out of their way to make sure industrial \nactivity does not harm our fish and wildlife.\n  Returning to the 1980 act, if you want my history lesson for the day, \nwhen I was assistant leader, I sat here night after night and listened \nto the history lessons, as I call them, of the distinguished President \npro tempore, Senator Byrd, chairman of our committee. I wish God had \ngiven me the prodigious memory he has. I don't have that kind of \nmemory, but I like history lessons and I am trying to give one now.\n  In 1978, a year I was up for reelection, we had this act before us, \nthe Alaska National and Lands Conservation Act. In 1978, just before \nthe election, that bill had been brought out of conference and I had \nagreed to support it. My colleague was opposed to it. At the very last \nminute, Senator Gravel objected to that bill proceeding until the bill \nitself was read. An adjournment resolution had already been entered so, \nin effect, that request killed the bill.\n  Following that, I might add, I went back home to try to start getting \nready again for consideration of this bill, and riding with my wife and \nfive other people in a chartered jet we crashed going into Anchorage. \nMy wife Ann was killed and all the passengers, other than myself and \none other passenger, were killed. Those people killed were the head of \nwhat we called the Citizens for Management of Alaska Land. We were \ntrying to raise funds to, once again, present our position to the \nCongress in the period of 1979 and 1980.\n\n  By 1980 we had developed this bill after long arguments and meetings \nwith my great friends, Senator Jackson and Senator Tsongas. Senator \nJackson was chairman at the time. Section 1002, the Jackson-Tsongas \namendment started with:\n\n       The purpose of this section is to provide for a \n     comprehensive and continuing inventory and assessment of the \n     fish and wildlife resources of the coastal plain of the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; an analysis of the impacts \n     of oil and gas exploration, development, and production, and \n     to authorize exploratory activity within the coastal plain in \n     a manner that avoids significant adverse effects on the fish \n     and wildlife and other resources.\n\n  Those conditions were met. Two environmental impacts were followed. \nThere was a period of seismic activity that went on in the 1980s. We \nall know the largest reservoir that could contain oil or gas on the \nNorth American continent is beneath the 1002 area. There is no question \nabout that. That is a scientific fact.\n  When we get to the period of time when we try to look at this \ndevelopment, we are often told you can proceed without this. This is, \nagain, now moving over to the Prudhoe Bay oilfields, not just one but \nseveral now. This is Kuparuk, further to the west, Prudhoe Bay, and the \nSourdough Oil field, a small field adjacent to ANWR. We have within the \n1002 area the village of Kaktovik. They have lands that belong to the \nNatives, but by order of the administration at the time they got the \ntitle to those lands, they were prohibited from drilling on the lands. \nThey said they had to wait until the Congress authorized drilling on \nthe Coastal Plain. So if we pass this bill, they, too, will have the \nright to proceed to determine their own rights.\n  The oil pipeline goes now from Valdez to Prudhoe Bay. This is the \nWainwright area, which is the area of the caribou of the western herd. \nThis is the size of ANWR. It is equal, the refuge itself, to South \nCarolina. We are not talking about a small piece of land. But the \nproposed development area in this 1002 area, 1.5 million acres, of \n2,000 acres is 3.13 square miles from a State that has 565,000 square \nmiles.\n  We are at wit's end. That is why this Senator is losing some sleep. \nThat 2,000 acres is roughly the size of Dulles Airport. That is what \nthis bill limits us to use. We cannot use more than 2,000 acres of the \n1.5 million acres set aside in the Oil and Gas Exploration Act. It is \nnot wilderness.\n  I will discuss later the newspapers that keep talking about the \nwilderness area of ANWR. They are talking about the wilderness area of \nANWR where there is no oil and gas activity proposed at all. None at \nall. I believe one of the great problems we have is to try to deal with \nthe subject without a full explanation. The difficulty that I have \nright now is in trying to orient myself to the bill. We will file an \namendment next week--there has been a lot of gossip about this so I \nmight as well get down to talking about it on the record.\n\n  Yes, this Senator has been talking to people involved in the steel \nbusiness, to the steelworkers, to other labor unions, and I have been \ntalking to a great community of this Nation, the Jewish community. All \nhave an interest in the development of this area.\n  I have also been talking to people who are concerned about the \nAlaskan natural gas line. I will be talking about that soon, too.\n  I thank the Chair for his courtesy on this Friday afternoon. If I \ndon't get this out of me, I won't sleep tonight either.\n  One of the great problems we have been facing is the battles with the \npress, so let's start with that. Let's start with our own Washington \npaper. In the past, in 1987 and 1989, this newspaper argued in favor of \nproceeding with exploration on the Arctic coast. It said:\n\n       . . . But that part of the Arctic coast is one of the \n     bleakest, most remote places on this continent, and there is \n     hardly any other place where drilling would have less impact \n     on the surrounding life. . . .\n       . . . That oil could help ease the country's transition to \n     lower oil supplies and . . . reduce its dependence on \n     uncertain imports. Congress would be right to go ahead and, \n     with all the conditions and environmental precautions that \n     apply to Prudhoe Bay, see what's under the refuge's tundra. . \n     . .\n\n  In 1989 it said:\n\n       . . . But if less is to be produced here in the United \n     States, more will have to come from other countries. The \n     effect will be to move oil spills to other shores. As a \n     policy to protect the global environment, that's not very \n     helpful. . . .\n       . . . The lesson that conventional wisdom seems to be \n     drawing--that the country should produce less and turn to \n     even greater imports--is exactly wrong.\n\n  What do we see now? December 25, 2001--nice Christmas present for \nsomebody:\n\n\n[[Page S2626]]\n\n\n       Gov. Bush has promised to make energy policy an early \n     priority of his administration. If he wants to push ahead \n     with opening the plain as part of that, he'll have to show \n     that he values conservation as well as finding new sources of \n     supply. He'll also have to make the case that in the long \n     run, the oil to be gained is worth the potential damage to \n     this unique, wild and biologically vital ecosystem. That \n     strikes us as a hard case to make.\n\n  They made the case in 1987. They made the case in 1989. They are \nsaying George Bush should make it now. Where is the consistency of the \nWashington Post? What has changed in the Washington Post? The \nmanagement? They haven't changed any science. They haven't produced any \nscience.\n  Now, in February they said:\n\n       Is there an energy crisis, and if so, what kind? What part \n     of the problem can the market take care of, and what must \n     Government do? What's the right goal when it comes to \n     dependence on overseas sources?\n       America cannot drill its way out of ties to the world oil \n     market. There may be an emotional appeal to the notion of \n     American energy for the American consumer and a national \n     security argument for reducing the share that imports hold. \n     But the most generous estimates of potential production from \n     the Alaska refuge amount to only a fraction of current \n     imports.\n\n  That is wrong. They belie the fact that Iraq is currently threatening \nto withhold exports to us--or really to the international food program \nthat we buy from. In fact, our oil will produce as much as a 30 years' \nsupply from Iraq.\n\n  Today Iraq sends to every suicide bomber's family $25,000 in cash. If \nwe can believe the reports we got yesterday, even the Saudis have a \nfund now to pay the costs of education and maintenance for the children \nof suicide bombers. From where is that money coming? It is coming from \nthe United States.\n  Had Congress listened to President Reagan, had President Clinton not \nvetoed the bill, we would be producing oil from that area now.\n  At the height of the Persian Gulf war, 2.1 million barrels of oil a \nday came down from the Alaska oil pipeline. When I was home last week, \nit was 950,000 barrels. Meanwhile, we are now importing over 1 million \nbarrels a day from Iraq--at least we were until he shut it off.\n  There is no consistency in these national newspapers when they do \nthis. Why should one generation act on the recommendation in 1987 and \n1989 and another one be told now that is all wrong? There ought to be \nsome kind of integrity in the Washington Post.\n  The New York Times--an interesting thing, if you follow this. I am \nnot going to do it, follow the transition. When one of these papers \nchanges its mind, the other one changes its mind. This is the New York \nTimes. Then in 1987, 1988, 1989, the same thing.\n\n       Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . . . the most \n     promising untapped source of oil in North America.\n       . . . A decade ago, precautions in the design and \n     construction of the 1,000-mile-long Alaska pipeline saved the \n     land from serious damage. If oil companies, government \n     agencies and environmentalists approach the development of \n     the refuge with comparable care, disaster should be \n     avoidable.\n\n  In 1988 they say the same thing:\n\n       . . . the total acreage affected by development represents \n     only a fraction of 1 percent of the North Slope wilderness.\n\n  Again, they call it wilderness. It is not wilderness.\n\n       . . . But it is hard to see why absolutely pristine \n     preservation of this remote wilderness should take precedence \n     over the nation's energy needs.\n\n  That is the issue today. Should a small group of radical \nenvironmentalists block the United States from obtaining another source \nof oil to lead us toward total dependence on foreign sources? At the \ntime of the oil embargo in the 1973 area, we imported about 35 percent \nof our oil. Today we are approaching 60 percent. Now they turn around \non us, from having supported us through the whole series--1987, 1988, \n1989.\n  New York Times, 1989:\n\n       . . . Alaskan oil is too valuable to leave in the ground.\n       . . . The single most promising source of oil in America \n     lies on the north coast of Alaska, a few hundred miles east \n     of the big fields at Prudhoe Bay.\n       . . . Washington can't afford . . . to treat the accident \n     as a reason for fencing off what may be the last great \n     oilfield in the nation.\n\n  Now they attack my colleague, saying he is wrong in his estimates. \nThey are also saying:\n\n       The country needs a rational energy strategy . . . but the \n     first step in that strategy should not be to start punching \n     holes in the Arctic Refuge.\n\n  What happened to the New York Times? Change of management? Yes, \nanother change of management. Maybe they hired one of the radical \nenvironmentalists, for all I know. But that is not a national newspaper \nthat deserves any credibility. As far as I am concerned, I have written \nthem off. How can you believe them one year and have them turn around \nand not tell you what they said before, in 1987, 1988, 1989, is wrong? \nThey didn't even recognize in their own editorials that they had taken \nthose positions so the new young people, reading their paper, don't \nknow about that unless some of us call them to task.\n  Where was the editorial board that was involved in 1987, 1988, and \n1989, when this editorial board of the New York Times took a \ndiametrically opposite position? That is not a national paper anymore, \nas far as I am concerned. It is unworthy of credibility. Beyond that, I \nmight have some long statements about them next week.\n  Mr. President, I don't want to keep you too long, but I do want the \nworld to know that, starting next week, we are going to be on this bill \nfor a long time. When that bill goes in, I am told the leadership \nperseveres with their attitude--which was not Senator Mike Mansfield's \nattitude, it was not Senator Jackson's attitude.\n  In 1973, there we had the oil pipeline amendment up--conscious of \nwhat President Eisenhower had said, conscious of the approach that all \nof us had taken up to that time, that oil and the availability of oil \nto this country is a matter of national security as well as economic \nsecurity. The leadership now says we must have 60 votes--or we should \nnot even bring up the amendment.\n  I want leadership to know that I don't know that I have 60 votes, and \nneither does Senator Murkowski. We are going to bring up the amendment \nand we are going to debate it until we have 60 votes--until we have 60 \nvotes or unless they can get the votes to table our amendment. There is \na possibility that could happen.\n  But I want you to know that every steelworker in the country is going \nto know who denied them their legacy fund. Every coal worker who is \ngoing to fall short of the money on their funds under the act of 1992 \nwill know who did that to them.\n  Every member of the Jewish community who now supports the development \nof ANWR is going to know who denied them what they need. Part of this \nlaw extends the right of Israel to receive a portion of the output of \nthe Alaska oil pipeline in the event it is denied oil by its neighbors. \nMost people do not know that. Years ago that was enacted. It must be \nrenewed now. Our amendment renews that.\n  We support entirely the freedom of Israel. Our State insisted on \nsharing with Israel our oil as it came out of the pipeline if their oil \nwas shut off. So did the people who buy our oil.\n  The Senate ought to look to the groups who support an energy policy \nfor America. We have American veterans, the American Legion, Veterans \nof Foreign Wars, AMVETS, Vietnam Veterans Institute.\n  Catholic War Veterans, organized labor, the Seafarers International \nUnion, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the Maritime \nLaborers Union, the Operating Engineers Union, the Plumbers and \nPipefitters Union, and the Carpenters, Joiners and Builders Trade, the \nHispanic Union, the Latin American Latino Coalition, the United States-\nMexico Chamber of Commerce, Seniors Coalition, United Seniors \nAssociation, every major American Jewish organization, scientist \norganizations of America, Americans for a Safe Israel, American \nbusiness communities, National Black Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, and Alliance for \nEnergy and Economic Growth. I could go on and on with this list of who \nsupports this.\n  (Mr. INOUYE assumed the chair.)\n  I welcome the occupant of the chair, my great and long-time friend. \nAs I said last night, we will not keep you long.\n  We will have to put in orders, if ANWR produces oil, for 17 new \ndouble-hulled tankers. As a result of Exxon\n\n[[Page S2627]]\n\nValdez, we decreed in Congress--and the State industries agreed--that \nall new tankers to serve Alaska must be double-hulled. When this great \narea starts producing oil, 17 new double-hulled tankers will be built \nto carry the oil coming out of the Alaska pipeline.\n  The current occupant of the chair didn't see this chart. I want to \npresent it again for his benefit because the two of us served under \nthat great general. This is what he said during World War II to our oil \nfield workers: ``Stick to your job. Oil is ammunition.''\n  If the leadership followed the precedent set by Mike Mansfield, who \nopposed the Alaska oil pipeline amendment when there was a tie vote--\nthey supported the one provision which accelerated the litigation and \nrequired immediate construction of the pipeline. Senator Mansfield \nwould not permit a filibuster on the matter involving national \nsecurity. Senator Jackson was chairman of the committee. And both of \nthem voted against that oil pipeline amendment when it was a tie vote. \nThey did not try to filibuster against that amendment. Had they done \nso, we undoubtedly would not have the oil pipeline today.\n  If those two great leaders had opposed the one amendment that \naccelerated the construction of the pipeline, we would never have had \nan oil pipeline.\n  I believe the situation today is an odd one. I am sad that leadership \nnow perseveres in its statement to us that we must have 60 votes.\n  I close out by saying Alaska Senators are going to try to persevere \ntoo. We are going to stay here and the Senate is going to stay here \nuntil we get 60 votes next week.\n\n  I thank the President for his courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. STEVENS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wasn't prepared to present a lengthy \nargument in favor of or against it, but I must tell you that I support \nyou fully, sir. I support your proposal on ANWR. I did so when the \npipeline was proposed many years ago. I still recall that at that time \nthe opponents of the pipeline predicted the caribou herd in Alaska \nwould be decimated. I am a lover of animals. I was concerned. But today \nI am happy to tell you that instead of being decimated, the herd has \nincreased tenfold. There are more caribou than we ever had in our \nlifetimes.\n  The opposition to the use of ANWR at this time comes from many \nsources. These sources are my friends. As you may know, Mr. President, \nI have the privilege of serving at this moment as chairman of the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs. I am concerned about the plight of the \nNative Americans. Yes, it is true that there is a tribe--a nation--in \nAlaska opposed to the use of ANWR for drilling of oil--one tribe. I am \npleased to advise you, Mr. President, that the Federation of Alaskan \nNatives, representing all the other tribes, favors your measure. As \nchairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I feel almost compelled to \nsupport you if only on that basis.\n  But there are other reasons for my support. The next reason was given \nto me just a few days ago when the dictator of Iraq stated: Why don't \nwe use the oil weapon against the United States?\n  As long as the present condition continues, we will be hostage to \noil, we will be captives to oil. We may find ourselves, once again, \ngoing out into the desert to fight for oil, risking and sacrificing \nAmerican lives. And as chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nCommittee, I am not in favor of that, sir.\n  So when the time comes, I will be answering ``aye'' on your measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/12/senate-section/article/S2627-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A SENATE FRIENDSHIP\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while I disagree with the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Hawaii and the senior Senator from Alaska on this \nissue, I am forever amazed at the great relationship of the senior \nSenator from Alaska and the senior Senator from Hawaii.\n  We develop friendships in the Senate, and I have no question that my \nfriendship with Senator Inouye is one that will last me a lifetime. He \nis such a wonderful man. And I also have such warmth and feelings for \nthe senior Senator from Alaska. But with the example that is set by the \nSenator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii, in friendship and in \nworking together on issues, I am, each year, as a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, stunned by the ability of these two gentlemen \nto move through the Defense appropriations bill the way they do. This \nshould take weeks of our debate time in the committee and on the Senate \nfloor, but as a result of their working relationship, it is always held \nto just a short period of time.\n  So when the history books are written about the Senate, these two \nmen, who now stand before me and with me in the Senate--Senator Stevens \nand Senator Inouye--will be known for many things, for doing so many \ngood things for our country and for their respective States, but the \nthing I am going to remember is the example of friendship that I see \nbetween the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii. And I do \nnot mean in any way to demean the Senator from Hawaii because I know he \nbelieves in his position not because of friendship but because he \nbelieves in the merits of the case, as it has, I am sure, something to \ndo with the friendship they have. But the relationship of the two \nSenators is, as far as I am concerned, encyclopedic as to how we should \nwork with each other in the Senate.\n\n  So on behalf of the Senate, I applaud and congratulate these two \nSenators for the example they set for the rest of us on how civilly the \nSenate should be run--a Democrat from Hawaii, thought of as a liberal \nState in some people's minds, and a Republican from the conservative \nState of Alaska. What we have coming from those two States is two \npeople to show us that with different ideologies we can still work \ntogether for the good of the country.\n  So I say to both Senators, thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/12/senate-section/article/S2627-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2627-S2629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to speak on a subject that is very \nimportant to the American public--the importance of free trade and how \nfree markets can help the United States and the worldwide economy.\n  By working together to create and foster a free market atmosphere, we \ncan help all nations that actively promote and participate in \ninternational trade to improve the economic futures of their citizens. \nThis is good economic policy and good international relations.\n  As the ranking Republican member on the International Trade \nSubcommittee and as a member of the Intelligence Committee, I can tell \nyou that international trade has long been one of the most important \nforeign policy tools of the United States.\n  Trade was a key component of our post-World War II international \npolitical and economic strategy. For more than 50 years, international \ntrade contributed to stability and economic growth throughout the \nworld. It helped lift the nations of Europe and Asia out of the ruins \nof World War II. And it helped millions of Americans experience \nunprecedented prosperity here at home.\n  A large part of the reason that the Berlin Wall fell was the \ndifference in economic performance and promise between a centralized \ncommand and central economy and free markets. International trade can \nplay a similar role at the beginning of the 21st century. But, the \nUnited States must lead the way.\n  I am pleased that the administration, led by President Bush, Commerce \nSecretary Don Evans, and our United States Trade Representative Bob \nZoellick, has helped launch a new round of international trade talks. \nWe all have an interest in making the next World Trade Organization \nministerial succeed. I believe that success can only\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\nbe enhanced if the Congress passes legislation on Trade Promotion \nAuthority.\n  In my view, the prospects of favorable progress in the next \nministerial will increase if the United States signals to the world \nthat--even while we undertake an unprecedented military mission against \nterrorism--we will continue to give our trade agenda a very high \npriority.\n  Although there are some members of Congress who might think \notherwise, I believe that the new round of trade negotiation is clearly \nin our national interest.\n  Trade creates jobs--both at home and abroad. Trade can also help \npromote political stability in many regions of the world. It is in our \nnational interest to foster free trade.\n  Let's look at the facts. Ninety-six percent of the world's consumers \nlive outside our borders. Based on that fact alone, the United States \nwould be foolish not to pursue a vigorous trade agenda. But let me go \non. Exports accounted for about 30 percent of U.S. economic growth over \nthe last decade, representing one of the fastest growing sectors in our \neconomy. Almost 97 percent of exporters are small or medium-sized \ncompanies and, as my colleagues are aware, small businessmen are the \nengine of job growth.\n  In fact, almost 10 percent of all U.S. jobs--an estimated 12 million \nworkers--now depend on America's ability to export to the rest of the \nworld. Export-related jobs typically pay 13 percent to 18 percent more \nthan the average U.S. wage.\n  There are many reasons to believe that the best is yet to come in \nthis dynamic sector. Economists predict that there could be a 33 \npercent reduction in worldwide tariffs on agricultural and industrial \nproducts in the next WTO trade round. This action alone could inject an \nadditional $177.3 billion into the American economy in the next 10 \nyears.\n  I strongly support congressional passage for Trade Promotion \nAuthority legislation this year. TPA will provide a measure of \ncertainty to our trading partners that any agreement reached with USTR \nwill receive timely congressional consideration and will not die a slow \ndeath by amendment.\n  As part of granting this fast track authority, Congress naturally \nwill expect extensive consultation and notification procedures.\n  Success in passing TPA will require a close partnership between the \nexecutive and legislative branches of our government. The Constitution \ngrants Congress the authority to promote international commerce. \nHowever, the Constitution also gives the President the responsibility \nto conduct foreign policy. Thus, the very nature of our Constitution \nrequires a partnership between the executive and legislative branches \nof Government in matters of international trade negotiations. That is \nwhat the trade promotion authority bill is all about--a partnership \nbetween the executive and legislative branches of government to enable \nU.S. consumers, workers and firms to be effectively represented at the \nnegotiating table. And, I might add, farmers as well.\n  In my opinion, TPA is an essential tool for sound trade expansion \npolicy, a tool we have been without since its expiration in 1994. For \nover a decade, the United States has too often sat on the sidelines \nwhile other nations around the world continued to form trade \npartnerships and lucrative market alliances. The lack of fast track has \nput the United States at a disadvantage during trade negotiations.\n  As we come out of the economic slowdown, U.S. efforts to expand trade \nalliances around the world can help accelerate the economic recovery we \nare all hoping for. TPA can help put wind back into the sails of U.S. \ntrade policy.\n  Without Trade Promotion Authority, the United States is not the only \nloser. Since trade agreements must be mutually advantageous, workers in \ncountries that were not able to complete agreements with the United \nStates are also injured. Global economic growth is a tide that will \nlift many boats.\n  Trade can be a win-win situation. There will always be criticisms \nthat one side bested the other in any negotiation. Sometimes you come \nout a little ahead. Sometimes not. One thing is clear: If there is no \ntrade agreement--both sides will lose out on opportunities for their \ncitizens.\n  Last year, the United States exported more than $780 billion in goods \nand services to more than 200 foreign markets. In fact, exports \nprovided more than one-quarter of all economic growth in America. Jobs \ncan be created in agriculture, high technology, manufacturing, \nfinancial services and other industries. We know this to be true.\n  Free trade is not just a matter of economics. It is a fundamental \naspect of American foreign policy. Through trade our values are \nreflected abroad and citizens of developing nations have the \nopportunity to teach us about their culture and we can all discuss \nshared values.\n  As President Bush stated in his address on trade issues on April 4:\n\n       Fearful people build walls around America. Confident people \n     make sure there are no walls.\n       . . . I am confident. I'm confident in America products, \n     I'm confident in American entrepreneurs, I'm confident in the \n     American worker, I'm confident in the American know-how, I'm \n     confident in America's farmers, I'm confident in America's \n     ranchers. We need to be a trading nation.\n\n  I could not agree more with the President. Market-opening trade pacts \nwith developing nations not only present an opportunity for the United \nStates to increase American sales of U.S. goods and services abroad, \nthey also can serve as a catalyst to bring stability and prosperity to \neconomically stagnant nations of the world.\n\n  America's engagement in world affairs and trade can project to our \nstrengths and values. Vigorous efforts to forge free trade alliances \nbetween the United States and developing countries will help to foster \nrespect for the rule of law, competition and free-market principles in \nthe developing world.\n  As Majority Leader Daschle noted in a floor speech on March 21 in \nsupport of Trade Promotion Authority legislation:\n\n       Expanding trade also offers national security and foreign \n     policy benefits because trade opens more than new markets. \n     When it is done correctly, it opens the way for democratic \n     reforms. It also increases understanding and interdependence \n     among nations, and raises the cost of conflict.\n\n  I think that Senator Daschle makes a compelling point. We need to \nkeep up strong, international economic leadership and help more nations \nbecome prosperous. Trade can help us create new jobs, both at home and \nabroad, and help change the conditions that breed poverty and \ninstability overseas.\n  TPA is also good for Utah. The fact is that TPA can help bring new \njobs into Salt Lake City and across my State. Here are the facts: trade \nhas benefitted my home State of Utah. For example Utah's manufacturers \nproduced and exported $2.52 billion worth of manufactured items to 164 \ncountries around the world. In fact, an estimated 61,400 Utah jobs are \ntrade dependent and one in every six manufacturing jobs in Utah--\napproximately 20,300 jobs--are tied to exports. Furthermore, the bulk \nof international trade and export in Utah benefits small and medium \nsized companies. About 80 percent of Utah's 1,894 companies that export \nare small and medium sized businesses. Our record is good, but we can \ndo even better.\n  TPA is good for America. The passage of TPA improves the quality of \nlife for American consumers by providing a greater choice of goods at \nbetter prices. Past agreements have benefitted the typical family of \nfour an estimated $1,300 to $2,000 a year. Future agreements stand to \nsave Americans thousands more every year. TPA also builds on previous \nmarket-opening successes such as the North American Free Trade \nAgreement that generates $1.2 million a minute in trade for American \nexporters.\n  While we have important foreign policy goals that can be advanced \nthrough a rigorous program with respect to international trade, let us \nnot forget Tip O'Neill's famous observation: ``All politics is local.''\n  So, for both economic and foreign affairs considerations, I am \nhopeful that before our work is completed this fall, we will have taken \nup the bill that the Finance Committee approved--by the overwhelming \nmargin of 18-3 I might add--and send it forward to the President for \nhis signature.\n  The Finance Committee has done its work. I want to commend Chairman \nBaucus and ranking Republican member Grassley for leading the way for \nthis bipartisan achievement. I also\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\nwant to recognize the efforts of Senators Bob Graham and Frank \nMurkowski for their important contribution to achieving this consensus.\n  I urge the majority leader and Republican leader to act in a way that \nwill advance American interests abroad by bringing the TPA bill up for \ndebate and action.\n  I recognize that the reality is that the Senate will in all \nlikelihood also act favorably on Trade Adjustment Assistance \nlegislation--TAA--or the TPA bill will stall. So be it. I am for both \nTPA and TAA in any order, tied or untied. But let me be clear, I am not \nfor a loaded up TAA bill with health care provisions.\n  Let's get the job done for the American people. My constituents from \nfirms like Geneva Steel need assistance to cushion their loss of jobs \nlost through trade. But in addition to TAA, we need TPA to open new \nmarkets for the workers of Utah and others throughout the United \nStates.\n  Now is the time for the Senate to take up and pass Trade Promotion \nAuthority. Now is the time.\n  The longer we wait to come together on fast track authority--\nauthority that will undoubtedly provide billions of dollars to our \neconomy through increased trade--means the longer that American \nfamilies will have to endure a less than optimal economy. As the \nPresident noted ``Every day we go by without the authority is another \nday we are missing opportunities to help our economy, to help our \nworkers, to help our country, to relate to our friends around the \nworld.'' President Bush is right on target.\n  In closing, I urge passage of the Trade Promotion Authority \nlegislation. It is my hope that the majority leader will give us a date \ncertain when the Senate will have the opportunity to act on this \nimportant legislation. I hope that we pass TPA before Memorial Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/12/senate-section/article/S2629-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                CLONING\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the next few weeks, the Senate will \ndebate the important issue of cloning. Using cloning to reproduce a \nchild is improper and immoral--and it ought to be illegal. I think that \nevery member of the Senate would agree on this point.\n  But some want to use our opposition to human cloning to advance a \nmore sweeping agenda. In the name of banning cloning, they would place \nunwarranted restrictions on medical research that could improve and \nextend countless lives. In a letter to the Congress this week, 40 Nobel \nLaureates wrote that these restrictions would ``impede progress against \nsome of the most debilitating diseases known to man.'' I am saddened \nthat the President has endorsed these restrictions to the detriment of \npatients across America.\n  Senator Arlen Specter, Senator Diane Feinstein, and I have developed \nlegislation that bans human cloning, but allows medical research to go \nforward with strict ethical oversight. I am confident that our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this balanced and \nresponsible bipartisan approach--rather than voting to ban an area of \nmedical research that holds such great promise.\n  We must not let the misplaced fears of today deny patients the cures \nof tomorrow.\n  The recent announcement that rogue doctors may have initiated a \npregnancy through cloning shows how urgently our legislation is needed. \nSuch actions should be a crime, and our legislation will make human \ncloning punishable by fines and imprisonment.\n  But we must not confuse human cloning with medical research using the \nremarkable new technique of nuclear transfer. One creates a person and \nshould be banned. The other saves lives by helping doctors find cures \nfor diseases that deprive people of their dignity, their careers or \neven their very lives. We owe it to our fellow citizens to do \neverything we can to encourage this extraordinary research that brings \nsuch great hope to so many Americans. Medical research using nuclear \ntransfer does not reproduce a child or create carbon copies of \nourselves.\n  But this debate isn't about abstract ideas or complex medical terms--\nit's about real people who could be helped by this research. Dr. \nDouglas Melton is one of the nation's foremost researchers on diabetes. \nFor Dr. Melton, the stakes involved in this research could not be \nhigher. His young son, Sam, has juvenile diabetes, and Dr. Melton works \ntirelessly to find a cure for his son's condition.\n  One of the most promising areas of research on diabetes involves \nusing stem cells to provide the insulin that Sam--and thousands of \nchildren like him--need to live healthy, active lives.\n  But a shadow looms over this research. A patient's body may reject \nthe very cells intended to provide a cure. To unlock the potential of \nstem cell research, doctors are trying to reprogram stem cells with a \npatient's own genetic material. Using the breakthrough technique of \nnuclear transfer, each one of us could receive transplants or new cells \nperfectly matched to our own bodies. Can we really tell Sam Melton, and \nthe millions of Americans suffering from diabetes, or Parkinson's \ndisease or spinal injuries that we won't pursue every opportunity to \nfind a cure for their disorders?\n  Some have said that this research will put women at risk by \nsubjecting them to undue pressures to donate eggs. Our legislation \naddresses this concern by applying to all nuclear transfer research--\nwhether publicly or privately funded--the same strict ethical standards \nused in research funded by the NIH. These protections guarantee ethical \nreview, informed consent, and respect for the privacy of donors.\n  Congress has rejected calls to place undue restrictions on medical \nresearch many times in the past. In the 1970s we debated whether to ban \nthe basic techniques of biotechnology. Some of the very same arguments \nthat are raised against nuclear transfer research today were raised \nagainst biotechnology back then. Some said that the medical promise of \nbiotechnology was uncertain, and that it would lead to ecological \ncatastrophe or genetic monsters.\n  Because Congress rejected those arguments then, patients across \nAmerica today can benefit from breakthrough new biotechnology products \nthat help dissolve clots in the arteries of stroke victims, fight \nleukemia, and help those with crippling arthritis lead productive \nlives.\n  When in vitro fertilization was first developed in the 1980s, it too, \nwas bitterly denounced. And once again, there were calls to make this \nmedical breakthrough illegal. Because Congress rejected those arguments \nthen, thousands of Americans today can experience the joys of \nparenthood through the very techniques that were once so strongly \nopposed.\n  Congress was right to place patients over ideology in the past, and \nwe should do the same again today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/12/senate-section/article/S2629-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2629-S2630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             JESSE SEROYER\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the people of the great state of \nAlabama are going to benefit from the wisdom of President George W. \nBush in appointing Jesse Seroyer as their United States Marshal. I came \nto know Jesse well when I was elected Attorney General of Alabama in \n1994. My respect for him grew continuously. Jesse had one primary \nmotivation--to do the right thing. He was proud of his work and wanted \nthe Alabama Attorney General's office to be the best it could be. His \nfocus was always on the right goal--investigating cases thoroughly, \nclearing the innocent and prosecuting the guilty. Jesse leads by \nexample. He works hard, does the right thing and expects others to do \nthe same. While he is cooperative and a team player, he will not \nparticipate in or condone wrongdoing.\n  Jesse's career began with the Opelika police department in 1976. He \nworked vice and narcotics and worked with many different law \nenforcement agencies making cases all over Alabama. In 1987 he joined \nthe Attorney General's office as chief investigator. During his time \nwith the Attorney General's office Jesse has been invaluable in a host \nof important cases and activities. He has investigated white collar \ncrime, corruption, voter fraud, and violent crime cases. In addition, \nhe trained other investigators in his unit, conducted investigations of \njudges for the Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission, provided security \nand protection for the Attorney General and others, conducted all \ninvestigations under the Alabama\n\n[[Page S2630]]\n\nSports Agent Act, and assisted countless state, federal and local \ninvestigators in important investigations. In addition, he has helped \ndevelop and plan the investigative priorities of the Attorney General's \noffice. Jesse also served as a certified instructor for Peace Officer \nStandard and Training program for Alabama.\n  I, and Senator Richard Shelby, were pleased to recommend him to \nPresident Bush and I am certain that these qualities will make him a \ngreat Marshal.\n  When I became Attorney General, the office faced a serious budget \ncrisis. Indeed, it was a disaster. The office was forced to reduce its \nsize by one-third and to completely reorganize to meet our challenges \nwith less personnel. That is when I saw Jesse Seroyer rise to the \nchallenge. He took on many challenges and extra duties. Most \nimportantly, as the investigator with the most institutional knowledge, \nhe was invaluable to me and others in the office. It was a difficult \ntime and he was a tower of strength. Without his leadership and \ncooperation we could not have been successful.\n  More than just a respected law officer, Jesse Seroyer is a man of \nfaith and family. He married a very special lady, Novelette K. Ward, in \n1973 not long after graduating from Opelika High School. Their marriage \nhas produced two children, Steve and Jessica.\n  His faith is central to his life. He and his wife are active members \nof Greater Peace Baptist Church where he serves as a Deacon. He also \nserves as a Director for Boy Scout Troop 373, Opelika, Ala., and is a \nmember of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement \nExecutives.\n  Novelette is extremely talented in her own right. She is also a state \nemployee with the State Department of Education. She is a woman of rich \nChristian faith. At Jesse's investiture, she blessed the large crowd \nbeautifully singing ``America.'' It was a special way indeed for Jesse \nto start his new work.\n  Jesse Seroyer loves his God, his family and his country. He is \ntrained and ready for this new step in his career. I extend my special \nappreciation to President Bush for this nomination and to the Senate \nfor its unanimous confirmation. He will serve superbly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/12/senate-section/article/S2630-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE DEATH PENALTY AND THE INNOCENT\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, Monday, a man named Ray Krone was \nreleased from prison. Ray Krone had been convicted of murder. He had \nalready served 10 years behind bars. And he had been sentenced to die.\n  But Ray Krone is and always has been an innocent man. New DNA \nevidence proved that conclusively. He was convicted for a crime he did \nnot commit. And prosecutors now acknowledge that. As the local county \nattorney put it, ``He deserves an apology from us, that's for sure.''\n  To put it mildly, that is an understatement.\n  How would any of us feel if we were charged, tried and convicted by a \njury of our peers for a crime we did not commit? And then, to top it \noff, sentenced to die?\n  Ray Krone knows what that feels like. And, unfortunately, he is not \nalone. In fact, he was the 100th person to be released from death row \nwith proof of his innocence.\n  These 100 innocent people have experienced nothing short of a living \nhell. And the outrageous injustice of their convictions and their \nsentences should be a wake up call for all of us.\n  I take second place to nobody in my determination to fight the \nscourge of crime. As part of that effort, I believe we need to be very \ntough on violent criminals, including imposing long sentences with \nlittle or no opportunity for parole.\n  But while we get tough on crime, we also need to recognize that our \ncriminal justice system makes mistakes. Sometimes very serious \nmistakes.\n  Until recently, it was virtually impossible to know when innocent \npeople were wrongfully convicted. But with the advent of DNA \ntechnology, at least some of these cases finally are coming to light.\n  Why are innocent people convicted and sentenced to death? To a large \nextent, it is because our criminal justice system has serious systemic \nflaws.\n  Capital defendants often have lawyers who do a terrible job. \nSometimes, their failure is simply a result of carelessness and lack of \npreparation. They fail to find or interview key witnesses. They fail to \nthoroughly read the case law. They fail to object to unreliable \nevidence. They make a variety of mistakes.\n  I don't say this to criticize all defense attorneys. Most try to do a \ngood job. But too many are inexperienced, overworked and underpaid. \nEven if they worked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, they're just too \noverwhelmed to provide effective representation.\n  But ineffective assistance of counsel is just one reason why innocent \npeople find themselves on death row. Sometimes eyewitnesses make honest \nmistakes. Sometimes, witnesses give false testimony, such as jailhouse \ninformants seeking reduced sentences. Sometimes, prosecutors engage in \nmisconduct by, for example, withholding evidence that could help a \ndefendant's case.\n  Any of these factors can lead to a wrongful conviction. And we now \nhave 100 examples to prove it.\n  A system that sends 100 innocent people to death row can be called a \nlot of things. But fair, equitable and just are not among them.\n  In fact, our criminal justice system is badly broken. And before we \nsend any more innocent people to death row, we need to fix it.\n  That is why I am joining with Senator Feingold in cosponsoring \nlegislation to establish a moratorium on all Federal executions until a \ncommission can be established to review the death penalty system and \npropose meaningful reforms.\n  This wouldn't lead to the release of any convicted criminals, or \nthreaten public safety in any way. It would simply help ensure that \ninnocent people are not put to death.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. And I want to \nexpress my sincere appreciation to Senator Feingold for his leadership \non this critically important matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/12/senate-section/article/S2630-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a very \nspecial South Dakotan who has made a real difference in the lives of \nwomen, children, and families across my home State. Today is Loila \nHunking's last day as Childcare Services Coordinator for the State of \nSouth Dakota. While I'm sure this is not the last we have seen of \nLoila, I wanted to use the occasion of her retirement to honor her \ntireless work in many capacities for the people of the State of South \nDakota.\n  After some time as a reporter and editor for our State's largest \nnewspaper, the Sioux Falls Argus Leader, Loila turned to a career as a \nhigh school English and Journalism teacher in Brandon, SD. During this \ntime, Loila was an active member in the South Dakota Education \nAssociation, and also served in the South Dakota House of \nRepresentatives. Her time in the South Dakota Legislature is marked by \nher strong support for equal rights for women, enactment of a spousal \nrape law, credit regulation, and human rights issues. After leaving the\n\n[[Page S2631]]\n\nlegislature, Loila continued her work as an advocate in many \ncapacities, truly leading the charge for issues important to women.\n  In 1976, Loila developed the first tool to measure community child \ncare needs in South Dakota. Together with the Augustana Research \nInstitute, Loila worked to put together a survey questionnaire and \nprocess of statistical computation that would assess child care needs \nand the causation of those needs in communities across South Dakota. \nBecause of this survey, communities were able to explore the \navailability and scope of services and suggested relationships between \nwomen's career mobility, educational advancement, and child care \nopportunities.\n  As Chair of the South Dakota Commission on the Status of Women, Loila \nworked on a landmark publication that brought the serious issue of \ndomestic violence into the light of day in South Dakota. The report \npublished in 1979, and titled ``A Conspiracy of Silence: A Report on \nSpouse Abuse in South Dakota'' exposed the high occurrence of domestic \nviolence in our State for the first time. State officials and the \ngeneral population were stunned by the dramatic statistics the report \nrevealed. The report offered important data and information to \nlawmakers who soon realized that this was not an issue that could be \nignored.\n  Over the next two decades, Loila served as a member of the Sioux \nFalls School Board, the Sioux Falls City Commission, and as Chair of \nthe South Dakota Democratic Party. Her tenure in all these positions \nwas always marked by her devotion to the needs of children and families \nin South Dakota communities. In 1996, Governor Janklow appointed Loila \nas Childcare Services Coordinator for the state of South Dakota. He \nmade an excellent choice. Throughout her years in that office, Loila \nhas been dedicated to expanding, developing and improving childcare \nservices in our state. She will be greatly missed.\n  Over the years, I have known that I can always count on Loila to give \nme the story, straight. I have always appreciated her no-nonsense \napproach to policy, government, and politics. It's my hope that Loila \nwill find time in her retirement to continue to serve women, children, \nand all of South Dakota. She has always been a strong voice for those \nwho were in need of one. She truly has made South Dakota a better place \nto live. I offer her my whole-hearted congratulations and thanks upon \nher retirement, and wish her all the best in her future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/12/senate-section/article/S2631-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, April 10 marked the \n23d anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act, signed into law by \nPresident Jimmy Carter in 1979. The Taiwan Relations Act has enabled \nTaiwan to build successfully a democratically governed society and an \neconomy by which the Taiwanese people prosper.\n  However, for Taiwan to continue its economic and political \ndevelopment under the ominous threats posed by Communist China, the \nUnited States must remain committed to the Taiwan Relations Act. The \nUnited States must ensure Taiwan possesses a capable military deterrent \nuntil a peaceful settlement of cross-straits relations with the \nPeople's Republic of China is realized.\n  The United States cannot allow the People's Republic of China to \nbully Taiwan, as it did during the 1995 Taiwan legislative elections \nand in the 1996 and 2000 Presidential elections. I am quite pleased to \nsee the Bush administration's strong support for Taiwan. In particular, \nI was delighted to hear that the Bush administration would do \n``whatever it takes'' to defend Taiwan.\n  Taiwan has proven itself a worthy friend. Its dedication to \ndemocratic freedoms, processes and institutions, attention to human \nrights, and adherence to rule of law, as well as its words and deeds \nafter the events of September 11, 2001, have helped it gain strong \npolitical support in the United States.

I understand that \nthis body specifically exempted over-the-counter trading in energy \nderivatives from anti-fraud, anti-manipulation and other oversight \nregulation by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission back in 2000. \nHowever, I believe the Enron collapse, and the dramatic energy price \nspikes we saw last year in California and the Northwest, including in \nmy State of Montana, tell us that we should take a closer look at \nenergy markets and make sure we are catching market manipulators. I was \ndisappointed that cloture was not invoked on this amendment.\n  I also wanted to express my support for Senator Craig's amendment, \nand had I been here, my intention was to vote for the Craig amendment \nto strike title II of S. 517. With so much uncertainty in today's \nenergy markets. I was not convinced that the modified electricity \nrestructuring provisions in S. 517 did enough to protect the best \ninterests of consumers. This is a complicated area of Federal law, and \nI think the Senate needs more time to get it right. For that reason, I \nwould have supported Senator Craig's amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/12/senate-section/article/S2631-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2631-S2632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BILL TAYLOR\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the office of United States \nMarshal is one of the great and historic law enforcement positions in \nAmerica. This honor carries with it the responsibility of protecting \nthe Federal judiciary, tracking down fugitives from justice, delivering \ndefendants to trial, ensuring safety of witnesses, leading and \ncoordinating with local law enforcement and, in general, helping the \nentire federal legal system work together harmoniously and effectively \nto fight crime. Because Marshals often come from State and local law \nenforcement to their federal position, their experience helps further \ncommunication among all criminal justice agencies. This is critical \ntoday in fighting crime.\n  I was therefore extremely pleased William S. Taylor and that \nPresident Bush has chose him to be the U.S. Marshal for the Southern \nDistrict of Alabama. He has all the qualities necessary to be a great \nsuccess. First and foremost he is a good man. He loves his God, his \nfamily and his country. He has served each with distinction and \nfidelity. Bill is known for his honesty. He is always a gentleman, \nalways courteous, always cooperative with the public and his superiors, \nbut you may be sure he will not do things that he does not believe is \nright. On that point, he is rock solid.\n  I came to know Bill and his superior reputation when he served as \nPolice Chief of Jackson, AL, while I served as U.S. Attorney for the \nSouthern District of Alabama. During that time, we got to know each \nother well, working together on important criminal cases and even \nfishing together periodically. My mother, originally from Choctaw \nCounty, AL, later told me about his fine parents. Bill's father was a \nfine carpenter and brick mason respected throughout that area of the \nState. In 1994, I was elected to the office of Attorney General for \nAlabama and I prevailed upon Bill to join me as Alabama's Law \nEnforcement Coordinator. Bill was superb in that position and won the \nrespect of law enforcement personnel all over the state. He understood \ntheir needs and problems and worked to help them. Law enforcement \nofficers trusted him. In addition, I would call on him periodically to \nhelp us investigate difficult cases. He was a great asset as an \ninvestigator also. For more than a year, the chief of staff of my \nSenate office who was then the administrative officer of the Attorney \nGeneral's office, Armand DeKeyser, State Trooper Mike Barnett, Bill and \nI\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\nroomed together in Montgomery while our families remained at home. I \ncame to like and respect Bill even more during that time. His fidelity \nto the mission of the Attorney General's office and his high ideals \nwere extraordinary.\n  Indeed, Bill has a history of exceptional service. He was drafted \ninto the Army right after his graduation from Choctaw County High \nSchool in Butler. After undergoing rigorous training he was sent \ndirectly to Vietnam where he served with distinction for one year. Bill \nwas promoted quickly and ended his Army career with the rank of E-6. \nHis unit was involved in extensive combat taking heavy casualties and \nBill completed his tour of Vietnam having promoted to acting Platoon \nSergeant.\n  His superior performance in Vietnam was rewarded by a host of awards \nincluding the Bronze Star, the National Defense Service Medal with one \nbronze star, and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation \nBadge. When his country called, Bill Taylor went without complaint and \nserved with courage and distinction.\n  After leaving active duty he joined the Army National Guard and \ncontinues to serve in the Army Guard with distinction, now having \nattained his rank of Chief Warrant Officer Two. Indeed, Vietnam turned \nout not to be his only war. As a Guardsman, he was called again to \ncombat for 6 months service in Desert Shield/Desert Storm. A superb \nmilitary record indeed.\n  After Vietnam, Bill returned to his hometown of Butler and in 1969 \nwas hired as a police officer. At that point, a fellow Choctaw \nCountian, Larry Linder, then a lieutenant with the Jackson, AL, Police \nDepartment lured him to the Jackson Police Department. There Bill found \nhis calling. He served 2 years as a patrolman, two years as a \nlieutenant, 2 years as Assistant Chief and in 1975, commenced a \nsterling 20-year career as a police chief. Though very young, Bill did \na superb job as chief, creating a highly respected police department in \nJackson. He was selected for the prestigious national FBI Academy and \nundertook many educational programs. In fact, such was the excellence \nof his career, that in 1979 Chief William S. Taylor was named Citizen \nof the Year in Jackson and in 1980 he was selected as the Law \nEnforcement Officer of the Year for the state of Alabama. All this when \nhe was hardly 30 years of age.\n  Has any of this turned his head--made him ``too big for his \nbritches''? The answer is no. He is the same today as when he first \nanswered the call of his country to serve in Vietnam. He will lead the \nMarshal's office with fairness, professionalism, skill and integrity. \nPresident Bush is to be commended for this excellent nomination. One of \nhis most valuable attributes is his knowledge of and respect for local \nlaw enforcement. This is a critical quality for a modern marshal. \nWorking every day to enhance cooperation and coordination among all \nstate and local law enforcement agencies, as well as the federal \nagencies is one of the most important duties of the office. His \nexperience and the respect with which he is held will make him quite \nvaluable in this regard.\n  Bill is married to an exceptional lady in her own right, Catherine. \nThey have been married for 32 years and have three sons Patrick, Bobby \nand Jonathan. The Senate acted wisely when it unanimously confirmed \nPresident Bush's nomination of William S. Taylor. The people of the \nUnited States will continue to benefit from his leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/12/senate-section/article/S2632-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/12/senate-section/article/S2632-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/12/senate-section/article/S2632-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       H.R. 1009.

Res. 239\n\n       Whereas during World War II the S.S. Henry Bacon was \n     assigned the task of conveying war materials and supplies to \n     the beleaguered Russian nation via the dangerous Murmansk \n     Run, and faithfully fulfilled its mission;\n       Whereas in 1945 the S.S. Henry Bacon saved 19 refugees from \n     Nazi-controlled Norway and accepted these Norwegian refugees \n     from the British for passage to Murmansk;\n       Whereas the S.S. Henry Bacon, with a full crew and refugees \n     aboard, set sail for Scotland amid the worst storms ever \n     registered in the Arctic Ocean and suffered damage from the \n     force of the storms and from internal mechanical problems;\n       Whereas the S.S. Henry Bacon, while suffering from a loss \n     of steering capacity, lost its place in Convoy RA 64 and \n     became a stray, unable to communicate with the convoy and \n     required to maintain radio silence;\n       Whereas the S.S. Henry Bacon was left to its own devices: \n     engine room workers used a sledgehammer and wedge to \n     physically turn the ship;\n       Whereas the S.S. Henry Bacon, alone in that freezing sea, \n     came under attack by 23 Junker JU-88s of the German \n     Luftwaffe;\n       Whereas armed with only several small guns, the United \n     States Navy Armed Guard and the ship's Merchant mariners \n     fought gallantly against the oncoming torpedo bombers;\n       Whereas mortally wounded after 1 German pilot was \n     successful in delivering a payload to the ship, the S.S. \n     Henry Bacon fought back, shooting down 9 enemy planes;\n       Whereas when the S.S. Henry Bacon began to sink, her \n     captain ensured that all 19 Norwegian refugees would receive \n     a place in a lifeboat;\n       Whereas when the lifeboat supply was exhausted, crewmen \n     made rough rafts from the railroad ties that had been used to \n     secure locomotives delivered to Russia;\n       Whereas the S.S. Henry Bacon went down with 28 casualties, \n     including Captain Alfred Carini, Chief Engineer Donald \n     Haviland, Bosun Holcomb Lammon Jr., and the commanding \n     officer of the United States Navy Armed Guard, Lt. John \n     Sippola, but in its sinking kept the German planes from \n     looking further and locating the main body of the convoy;\n       Whereas the 19 Norwegian refugees were saved and ultimately \n     returned to Norway; and\n       Whereas the actions of the officers and crew of the S.S. \n     Henry Bacon, in the finest tradition of the United States \n     Merchant Marines and the United States Navy, have been \n     recognized by the people of Norway and Russia but, until now, \n     have not been acknowledged by our grateful Nation: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the valiant efforts of the crew of the S.S. \n     Henry Bacon; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation, \n     calling to memory the deeds, exploits, and sacrifices of the \n     officers and crew of the S.S.
