Mr. President, I am waiting for the amendment \nto arrive. I seek counsel of the manager of the bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we know the direction in which the \nSenator from Florida wants to go. He is deeply concerned about arsenic-\ntreated wood. What he is evaluating, based on our advice, is whether he \nwants to offer something that is a mandate or pursue a more prudent \ndirection in terms of a study. I believe his staff is coming over with \nthe amendment.\n  The Senator has a lot of concerns about this. I recommend he state \nnow what those concerns are, and when staff gets here we can step back \nand he can offer his amendment. I encourage the more prudent course; \nhowever, the Senator is within his rights. Either way, we look forward \nto hearing the Senator's arguments.\n  Also, I note the cooperation of my colleague, Senator Bond, that we \ncould start at 9:30 and be ready to move forward. He is missing a very \nimportant Republican caucus and I thank him for his cooperation. I know \nPresident Bush and the Vice President are here. In his commitment, \nparticularly to moving this bill and the funding for veterans and other \ncompelling needs, he was willing to be gracious enough to work with the \nDemocratic leadership and meet earlier in the day. I publicly thank \nhim.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my sincere thanks to my colleague from \nMaryland. Obviously, this is the most important thing we have to do. I \nshare Senator Mikulski's view we should begin discussion of this \nserious concern of the Senator from Florida. We look forward to working \nwith the Senator. I thank the Chair and the manager on the Democratic \nside, who has a very good idea. Normally, when she has a good idea, it \nis much more successful than some of the other approaches that might be \ntaken. I offer that as a humble suggestion.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I note the Senator from Florida is reviewing his \nmaterials with his staff. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1228 to Amendment No. 1214\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I send to the desk an \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1228.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ARSENIC IN PLAYGROUND EQUIPMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Health and Human Services has \n     determined that arsenic is a known carcinogen, and the \n     Environmental Protection Agency has classified chromated \n     copper arsenate (CCA), which is 22 percent arsenic, as a \n     ``restricted use chemical.\n       (2) CCA is often used as a preservative in pressure-treated \n     wood, and CCA-treated wood is widely used in constructing \n     playground equipment frequented by children.\n       (3) In 2001, many communities in Florida and elsewhere have \n     temporarily or permanently closed playgrounds in response to \n     elevated levels of arsenic in soil surrounding CCA-treated \n     wood playground equipment.\n       (4) The State of Florida recently announced that its own \n     wood-treatment plant would cease using arsenic as a \n     preservative.\n       (5) PlayNation Play Systems, which manufactures playground \n     equipment, announced in June 2001 that it would no longer use \n     CCA as a preservative in its playground products.\n       (6) In May 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency \n     announced that it would expedite its ongoing review of the \n     health risks facing children playing near CCA-treated wood \n     playground equipment, and produce its findings in June 2001. \n     The EPA later postponed the release of its risk assessment \n     until the end of the summer of 2001, and announced that its \n     risk assessment would be reviewed by a Scientific Advisory \n     Panel in October 2001.\n       (7) The EPA also plans to expedite its risk assessment \n     regarding the re-registering of arsenic as a pesticide by \n     accelerating its release from 2001 to 2003.\n       (8) The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which has the \n     authority to ban hazardous and dangerous products, announced \n     in June 2001 that it would consider a petition seeking the \n     banning of CCA-treated wood from all playground equipment.\n       (9) Many viable alternatives to CCA-treated wood exist, \n     including cedar, plastic products, aluminum, and treated wood \n     without CCA. These products, alone or in combination, can \n     fully replace CCA-treated wood in playground equipment.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.It is the Sense of the Senate that \n     the potential health and safety risks to children playing on \n     and around CCA-treated wood playground equipment is a matter \n     of Branch, state and local governments, affected industries, \n     and parents.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, in consultation with the Consumer Product \n     Safety Commission, shall submit a report to Congress which \n     shall include--\n       (1) the Environmental Protection Agency's most up-to-date \n     understanding of the potential health and safety risks to \n     children playing on and around CCA-treated wood playground \n     equipment;\n       (2) the Environment Protection Agency's current \n     recommendations to state and local governments about the \n     continue use of CCA-treated wood playground equipment; and\n       (3) an assessment of whether consumers considering \n     purchases of CCA-treated wood playground equipment are \n     adequately informed concerning the health effects associated \n     with arsenic.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I say to the chairman of the \nappropriations subcommittee, the Senator from Maryland, I thank her and \nthe Senator from Missouri, the ranking member, for giving me the \nopportunity to offer this amendment having to do with arsenic-treated \nwood. This problem has manifested itself, particularly in Florida \nrecently, because of arsenic leaching from treated wood on playground \nequipment and then flowing into the soil. The health departments have \nanalyzed the soil and found the level of arsenic at a level to create \nconcern about the danger to the children. Thus, local governments have \nbeen reaching out to the federal government, wondering whether they \nshould close their playgrounds.\n  We have asked EPA, the appropriate federal agency, to conduct the \nstudy. They say it is underway. Much to my horror, as my constituency \nof Florida is rising up in arms, wanting to know is this a danger or \nnot, EPA is on a schedule to do a study not to be completed until 2003.\n  I say to the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, this \nhas nothing to do with partisan politics. This has to do with safety \nstandards and EPA doing a study. The question is: When are they going \nto finish?\n  We urged the EPA to accelerate this study because of the conundrum \nconfronting local government in deciding whether to keep playgrounds \nclosed or whether to close other playgrounds that are now open. They \nwant some direction.\n  We are talking about arsenic. It is a poison. We talked about it last \nnight. We adopted the Boxer-Nelson amendment that will require the EPA \nto take certain standards into consideration when setting the level of \narsenic in our drinking water.\n  What alarms so many of us, and brought about the Boxer-Nelson \namendment last night, was that the EPA--which had announced the \ndeadline when they were supposed to come forth imposing this reduced \namount of arsenic in drinking water--announced that they were suddenly \npushing that off, thus the reason for the amendment having to do with \narsenic in drinking water, which passed overwhelmingly last night.\n  Now I bring to the Senate for discussion, and hopefully adoption, an \namendment that will require the EPA to accelerate this study. \nInitially, when we had voiced our concern because of the playground \nsituation in Florida, EPA had said it was going to complete its study \nby June. Then they delayed, and said it would be sometime in the fall. \nMind you, this is after we had pushed them pretty hard, because their \nstudy was not going to be completed until 2003.\n  This amendment requires them to complete this study within 30 days of \nenactment of this bill, so we can give some certainty as to the \nscientific conclusions. Is the arsenic in the treated lumber leaching \ninto the playground soil? Is this a sufficient hazard that the\n\n[[Page S8631]]\n\ncity governments and the county governments ought to be closing those \nplaygrounds, or is it at such a level that, with a change in this or \nthat--in the construction, in the wood--that we could eliminate this \npotential hazard to our children?\n  I bring to the Senate today a safety issue. Let me recap. What I am \nasking our colleagues to do is join me in our quest to determine if \narsenic-treated playground wood is hazardous to our children. That \ntreated wood is everywhere. It is in our playground equipment. It is in \npicnic tables. It is in desks. It is in fences. Mr. President, 98 \npercent of outdoor wood sold in the United States today is treated with \nCCA, chromated copper arsenate.\n\n  CCA is an insecticide that is 22 percent arsenic. As I stated, in our \nState and in other parts of the country, public playgrounds have been \nclosed or closely examined and are due to be closed because of the \npotential health hazards that may be posed by high concentrations of \narsenic found in the soil in and around the arsenic-treated wood \nplayground equipment.\n  There are communities all across Florida: Gainesville, Tarpon \nSprings, Tampa, Port Orange, Ormond Beach, Deland, Deltona, Clermont, \nMiami, whose local governments have shut down their parks and are \nlooking to the federal government, the EPA, for guidance as to whether \nor not those parks are safe.\n  Some communities, such as the one in Cambridge, MA, have already \ndecided to replace all of their playground and park equipment treated \nwith arsenic because many consumer and health groups have urged the \nState of Massachusetts to ban arsenic-treated wood. Imagine the horror \nof a parent whose child played in the soil on a playground with \nequipment treated with arsenic, and that playground was later closed \ndown or torn down due to the high concentrations of arsenic in the soil \nof that playground.\n  This amendment is designed to speed the process so the EPA will give \nus an answer because parents need to know whether their children are \nplaying on or around equipment that poses a health hazard.\n  At the beginning of this year when we first asked the EPA if \nchromated copper arsenate, CCA--that is arsenic-treated wood--was safe, \nthey said they would know in 2003, when they completed a reregistration \nof CCA as a pesticide. As I said earlier, we said that was not good \nenough. So the EPA revised its timetable and said they would complete \ntheir reassessment of the arsenic-treated wood by 2002. They said they \nwould tell us if the arsenic-treated wood playground equipment is safe. \nThen they changed that to by June of 2001. The EPA missed its own June \ndeadline. They now say they will complete a risk assessment regarding \nchildren and arsenic-treated wood at the end of this summer--on into \nthe fall. The EPA also plans to assemble a scientific advisory panel in \nOctober of 2001 to review the playground data.\n  Meantime the Consumer Product Safety Commission has agreed to conduct \na review of the safety of CCA-treated wood for use in playground \nequipment. As my colleagues know, the Consumer Products Safety \nCommission has the authority to immediately ban CCA-treated wood for \nuse in children's playground equipment if it finds that CCA-treated \nwood poses an imminent and immediate risk to children.\n  I am heartened but I am not satisfied with all these announcements \nbecause that is all they are: announcements, meaningless declarations, \nwhile the American people still do not know if arsenic-treated wood \nplayground equipment is safe.\n  Earlier, I introduced S. 877 that requires the EPA to complete a risk \nassessment of the hazards to children within a date certain and to \nrequire mandatory labels on each piece of arsenic-treated wood. The \nwood-preserving industry, in conjunction with EPA, recently committed \nto a voluntary labeling program.\n  I personally think mandatory labeling is necessary to ensure the \nAmerican people are properly informed. But that fight is for another \nday. We know arsenic is classified by the EPA and the World Health \nOrganization as a known human carcinogen.\n  In 1999, the National Research Council concluded that there was an \nindisputable link between arsenic and skin- bladder- and lung cancer. A \nUniversity of Florida researcher commissioned by the Florida EPA \nrecently declared that simply touching arsenic-treated wood could be a \nhealth risk for children. And a research team from the Connecticut \nAgricultural Experiment Station found that arsenic is readily available \non the surface of CCA-treated wood. The Environmental Working Group has \nconcluded from reviewing the Connecticut study and others that \nsignificant quantities of arsenic can be dislodged from the surface of \nCCA-treated wood and that the cancer risk could be as great as 1 in \n1,000. Therefore, the Environmental Working Group is seeking a ban of \nthe substance.\n  For all these reasons, we need the Environmental Protection Agency \nand the Consumer Product Safety Commission to give the American people \nthe guidance they deserve.\n  This amendment stresses the sense of the Senate that the potential \nhealth risk to children playing on and around CCA-treated wood and \nplayground equipment is a matter of great importance. This amendment \nsays the EPA must submit a report to Congress within 30 days of \nenactment, detailing the most up-to-date understanding of the health \nand safety risk to children playing on and around CCA-treated wood \nplayground equipment. It seeks the EPA's current recommendations to \nstate and local governments about the continued use of CCA-treated wood \nplayground equipment.\n  It mandates that within 30 days--no more delays. This amendment would \nrequire within 30 days of the enactment that the EPA come forth with \ntheir recommendations so the people of America will know what to do \nabout their children playing on these playgrounds.\n  Those are my remarks in offering the amendment.\n  Does the chairman of the committee have any particular inquiry she \nwould like to make at this point?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. No. I wish to make some comments.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, our colleague from Florida raises some \nvery valid concerns. All of us want to ensure that our playgrounds, our \nback decks, and our picnic tables and anything with wood outside are \nnot harmful to our children's health. If it is harmful to our children, \nit will be harmful to special needs populations such as the elderly. Of \ncourse, there is playground equipment that has a particular risk \nassociated with it.\n  The issue of arsenic in the ground and around playgrounds has also \nraised considerable attention. I acknowledge the validity of the \nSenator's concerns. I also want to acknowledge his frustration that the \nbureaucracy has not rigorously stood sentry over their voluntary effort \nand also that they have been a little slow in moving on an evaluation \nof this matter.\n  This is an issue of great concern to this committee. In fact, the \nissue is in two agencies--the EPA and the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. The good news is you have two agencies looking at it. The \nbad news often is getting them to work together and move it, which \nrequires bilateral treaty negotiation.\n  We think the Senator's amendment kind of moves it because that is \nwhat his amendment is. He doesn't take the position on the outcome. He \ndoesn't come in with a muscular amendment to mandate without an \nevaluation. We think the Nelson approach is very prudent. He wants to \nhave the EPA study, but at the same time he doesn't want the study to \nbe a career in and of itself.\n  We need to know. The kids need to know. The parents need to know. \nGuess what. The wood industry needs to know. They have been cooperating \nwith the EPA in a voluntary way for a voluntary program.\n  But to give you an idea of the complexity, the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission has jurisdiction over treated wood and any risk that \nmight come from wood; the EPA has jurisdiction over the chemicals used \nto treat wood. One has jurisdiction over the chemicals and the other \nhas jurisdiction over the wood. Now we are trying to get them to work \ntogether to come up quickly with an evaluation on treated wood.\n\n[[Page S8632]]\n\n  Both agencies have said they are working to ensure that wood-treated \nproducts are safe. The EPA has a voluntary labeling program with which \nthe forestry industry has cooperated, but an evaluation shows that it \nhas some very significant flaws. They say they are now working to \nenhance the program. But, again, I think we need to push them along to \ncome up with the report that we need.\n  Senator Nelson's amendment requires EPA, in consultation with the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission, to report to Congress on health and \nsafety risks of chemically-treated wood and to recommend how consumers \nand State and local governments can be better informed about the \npotential health risks. And I am sure the forest industry wants to know \nthat. They want to be good citizens. This is one of the important by-\nproducts.\n  In early July, the Agency completed its review of the American Wood \nPreservers Institute proposal to strengthen information available to \nthe consumer. The EPA says they are going to hold a public hearing of a \nscientific advisory board during the week of October 2 to give peer \nreview on the Agency's hazardous assessment methodologies for \ncalculating potential exposure in playgrounds.\n  The Senator's amendment says 30 days within enactment; Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Within enactment, or 30 days of the fiscal year?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Enactment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That pretty much takes us into October and November.\n  We think that is a strong message to EPA to move this process along. \nWe think it is important they hold public hearings. We think it is \nimportant that they consult with their scientific advisory board. But \nwe also would like them to operate within a 30-day framework to move \nthis issue along.\n  I thank the Senator. Rather than coming in saying legislate, mandate, \nand regulate, let's get the report. Then we can identify the most \nprudent way to protect consumers and to provide important information \nfor the industry.\n  I support this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida raises a valid \nconcern. We certainly want to ensure that our playgrounds, boardwalks, \nand backyard decks are not harmful to our children's health, our \ngrandparents' health, or to our neighbors' health.\n  The issue of arsenic in the ground around playgrounds receives \nconsiderable attention, as has already been indicated. Let me be more \nspecific. This issue is of great concern to two agencies funded in this \nbill, both the EPA and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n  For the information of all my colleagues, the CPSC has jurisdiction \nover treated-wood products and any risks that might come from them when \nthe wood products are used for playground sets and decks; the EPA has \njurisdiction over the chemicals used to treat the wood. These chemicals \nare used to prevent the wood in our decks, boardwalks, and playground \nsets from rotting and therefore becoming unstable and unsafe. Both \nagencies have been working to ensure that treated-wood products are \nsafe. I can appreciate the frustration the Senator from Florida feels \nabout the delay in seeing a result to those studies.\n\n  EPA currently oversees a voluntary labeling program so that consumers \nwho purchase treated-wood products are made aware of the potential \nrisks from the chemicals. Admittedly, the program can be more \neffective. EPA has learned that the program has flaws and is now \nworking to improve that program. By this fall, every piece of \nchemically treated wood will be labeled and there will be better \ninformation made available to the public.\n  I sympathize with Senator Nelson on the media attention in his State \non wood products treated with chromated copper arsenic, or CCA. As I \nsaid, EPA has already established a voluntary labeling program. There \nhas been extensive pressure on wood preserver manufacturers to ensure \nvoluntary compliance. Caution labels with EPA-approved wording will be \naffixed to CCA-treated lumber within 90 days, and information signs \nwill appear in lumber stores and home centers in about 30 days.\n  For the information of my colleagues and those who might be watching, \nthere is a Web site, www.ccasafetyinfo.com, and a toll-free number, \n800-282-0600, to answer consumer questions in both English and Spanish.\n  The products, while they may sound bad, have previously been approved \nby EPA and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. They have been in \nuse for over 70 years. As far as we are aware, no scientifically peer \nreviewed medical or science journal has ever documented harm to anyone \nfrom the regular use of CCA-treated wood. In spite of this, EPA and the \nCPSC are taking steps to put any doubt to rest by conducting further \nreviews specifically on the risk to children.\n  As the manager of the bill, the chair of the subcommittee, has \nindicated, there is to be peer-reviewed scientific discussion early in \nOctober, depending upon when this bill gets enacted. Thirty days may or \nmay not cover it. But it is clear that we will adopt it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment that would make sure we \ndo not wait until 2003 to get the results. We do not yet know when the \nscientific information can be ready, but whether it is 30 days or 45 \ndays or 60 days, I am confident it will, and must, be during this \ncalendar year, and sooner rather than later.\n  Sometimes you can set any deadline you want, but if you do not have \nthe scientific reviews, if they physically cannot get in, you cannot \ncome up with the study. I am sure EPA will do the study. This \namendment, that I trust will be adopted overwhelmingly, will send a \nclear signal to them that they must put all due speed behind it and get \nthis study completed as quickly as humanly possible.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I thank the \nSenator for framing it in a way that makes good sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Florida. This is an issue that he brought \nto my attention some months ago following the initial debate over the \narsenic standard. We had a good debate last night, with a very strong \nvote, to ensure that we get the right kind of standard as soon as \npossible so people will know what to expect from their drinking water. \nWe also made it very clear that we want to help communities be able to \nmeet these standards.\n  It should not be an unfunded mandate to take care of your health. We \nought to have the best scientific information, made available through \nthe studies that are done or commissioned, to provide the help that \ncommunities need to be able to protect themselves, particularly their \nchildren.\n  Senator Nelson came upon a problem I never knew existed. I cannot \ntell you how many times I have been around playground equipment that is \nwooden. I always thought it was really attractive. It is the kind I \npreferred. It is what I bought for my own daughter. It certainly never \ncrossed my mind that--for good reasons, to prevent pest and termite \ninfestations--manufacturers would want to treat that wood. I never \nthought about it.\n  But what Senator Nelson has determined--and I applaud him for this \nbecause it became an issue in Florida, and he brought it to our \nattention--is that something called CCA, chromated copper arsenic, is \nwidely used as a preservative in pressure-treated wood, including \nplayground equipment. This CCA is 22 percent arsenic.\n  I remember when I used to practice law, which seems as if it was a \nvery long time ago, I had a case that involved treated wood that was \ntreated at a plant in Tennessee. I went to visit it. The wood was \ntreated with all kinds of chemicals, but it was used for telephone \npoles; it was used for railroad tracks; it was not used in playground \nequipment.\n  What Senator Nelson has learned is that, through rain and natural \ndeterioration, the arsenic that is in this compound, CCA, to treat this \nwood, can leach into the ground and can even come off on one's hands. \nYou think about all those little hands and all those little mouths and \nthose little bodies kind of rolling around this playground equipment.\n\n[[Page S8633]]\n\n  I really commend the Senator for bringing this problem to our \nattention. Because of his hard work, the EPA and the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission are conducting reviews of the health and safety risks \nto children playing on and around CCA-treated wooden playground \nequipment.\n  I believe the Senator's amendment is necessary because, again, it \nsets a deadline. Otherwise, folks can just keep studying and talking \nand avoiding making a decision. But he is trying to put some teeth into \nthis appropriations bill, which I commend and support because just the \nother day I had a friend of mine say she heard Senator Nelson speak on \nthis issue in relation to playground equipment. She was just about \nready to buy some playground equipment for her grandchildren. She does \nnot know whether to buy it or not. She does not know whether it is safe \nor unsafe.\n  If you live in a State that gets as much rain as the good Senator's \nState of Florida, you have to be even more worried. If it is as humid \nas it is down there, you have to be more worried.\n  We do not want to make a decision that is not scientifically based, \nso we need to get these science studies done and the EPA and the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission making their decision. They have \nasked for public comment. But we should pass this Nelson amendment \nbecause it really directs the EPA to report to Congress as soon as \npossible--which is, in effect, a report to the public--so my friend can \ndecide whether or not she is going to buy wooden playground equipment \nor plastic or steel, or whatever choice she is going to make.\n  I commend the Senator for understanding this is an issue that is not \none of these abstract issues that only concerns somebody sitting in \nsome ivory tower somewhere. This is an issue that concerns every mother \nand father who takes their child to play at a playground or anybody who \nis thinking about buying equipment for their backyard.\n  We need to look to a nonpartisan, independent source such as the \nscientists who will examine this issue, find out whether this CCA is or \nis not a health hazard, or whether it can be fixed, and if it can, so \nit can be a problem that can be prevented. This is one of those public \nservice issues to which I really think we owe the people of this \ncountry an answer; otherwise, we may be unfairly tarring this industry. \nWe may be preventing people from buying playground equipment that is \ntotally safe. We don't know. We just know this CCA has arsenic in it. \nWe need to get to the bottom of whether that is harmful or not.\n  I commend the Senator for his approach. I hope my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle will support this amendment so we can get an answer \nsooner instead of later.\n  Mr. President, I yield back whatever time I might have been given.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I think the statement of all of our \ncolleagues points out why we really have to move this study along. I \nbelieve the committee is prepared to accept the Nelson amendment. As we \nmove to conference, we also want to consult EPA about how long it will \ntake them to collect their information.\n  Here is where we are. EPA and the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nare in the jurisdiction of this subcommittee. We take our mandated \nreports to agencies very seriously because then we need them for the \nfollowing year's appropriations. And the authorizers need them for the \nsecond session of the 107th Congress.\n  So let's shoot for this 30 days because I think there is this sense \nof urgency, particularly at the local government rec center level. \nRight now they are worried about two things. They are worried about \ntheir kids being exposed to arsenic-treated wood, and they are worried \nabout lawsuits.\n\n  Local government should not be worried about either one. It is our \njob to stand sentry and give the best advice. I am ready to stand \nsentry over the bureaucracy to ensure a timely completion of this \nreport so that not only will the concerns of Senator Nelson be settled, \nbut really the concerns of the Nation. We thank him for being so \nassertive in this area.\n  We are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept the amendment. We \nhave had a discussion with the Senator. The manager on the Democratic \nside and I are ready to push for this to make sure we get the \ninformation. We are happy to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am so grateful to the chair \nand the ranking member for their recognition of the emergency nature of \nthis issue. I am very grateful for their acceptance of the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to see that after almost 40 \nyears, the American people may finally see action that will protect the \npublic from arsenic.\n  I strongly support Senator Nelson's amendment to direct the EPA, in \nconsultation with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, to report to \nCongress on levels of arsenic in children's playground equipment, and \nto recommend how consumers and State and local governments can be \nbetter informed about these potential health risks. Preliminary studies \nhave shown that arsenic, used as a preservative in wood may be a \nharmful carcinogen, especially to children. Last April, the EPA itself \nfound a possible direct link between arsenic and DNA damage.\n  Senator Nelson's amendment sends a strong message to the EPA that \nparents must know if their children are safe, and we are taking long \noverdue action on other aspects of this issue too. Yesterday, we \nadopted Senator Boxer's amendment, which requires EPA to immediately \nput into effect a standard for arsenic in drinking water, and inform \nthe public about the amount of arsenic in the water. Last Friday, the \nHouse passed an amendment to reinstate the EPA rule wrongly delayed by \nthe Bush administration, to reduce the accepted standard of arsenic in \ndrinking water from 50 parts per billion to 10 parts per billion and \nprotect millions of Americans. That rule is the result of decades of \ndebate, scientific studies, rule-making, and public comment, and it \ndeserves to be implemented now.\n  We know that arsenic is a serious threat to public health. The 50 \nparts per billion standard for drinking water was originally set in \n1942, and is clearly out of date. A National Academy of Sciences study \nin 1999 found that arsenic in drinking water is extremely carcinogenic, \ncausing lung, bladder, and skin cancer. As a Wall Street Journal \narticle on April 19 stated on the 10 parts per billion standard, ``few \ngovernment decisions could have been more thoroughly researched, over \nso many years.''\n  Action by Congress is long overdue. Senator Nelson's amendment is a \nneeded step in the continuing battle to protect Americans from the \ndangers of arsenic, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on this amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1228.\n  The amendment (No. 1228) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are waiting for 10:30 for the Senator \nfrom Arizona to offer an amendment. If there is no business on this \nbill, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted to proceed up to 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bond are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I will take 2 or 3 minutes \nto speak in anticipation of an amendment that will be offered by \nSenator Kyl. I\n\n[[Page S8634]]\n\nreluctantly have to oppose the Senator's amendment, although I \nunderstand the situation he faces. His amendment would alter the \nformula for the State revolving fund for the Clean Water Act.\n  Senator Kyl's amendment would alter a Clean Water Act formula for the \nSRF that has been in place since 1987. While I recognize the Senator's \nconcerns about the lack of funds for his State and the money that goes \nto Arizona and other States in the face of these great economic needs, \nI have to oppose the amendment as the ranking Republican on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee which has jurisdiction over the \nClean Water Act.\n  Very simply, this is not the place to change the formula for the \nSRF--on an appropriations bill. I urge my colleague and other \ncolleagues, if Senator Kyl does offer the amendment, to think \nseriously. They can take a look at a chart, which I will enter into the \nRecord, which shows how all of these formulas will affect everybody's \nStates. If it is simply a matter of will they get more, will they get \nless, they can vote that way if they wish, but that is really not the \nissue. I hope my colleagues will understand that this is not the place \nto try to get into the authorizing business on something as complex as \nthe formula for the SRF, State revolving fund, for the Clean Water Act.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee has committed to examine \nthe waste and drinking water concerns of our country and amend the \nClean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Senator Jeffords has \npledged to move along those lines. I know when I was the chairman and \nSenator Reid was the ranking member, we did that, and I have been \nassured by Senator Jeffords that water infrastructure will continue to \nbe a priority for the committee.\n  I commit to Senator Kyl right now to examine the issue of the formula \nhe is looking at, and I urge him to allow us to put this together in a \nway that is a proper legislative package with the appropriate vehicle. \nIf the Senator does offer the amendment, I urge my colleagues to oppose \nit and work with me and others on the committee to solve the water \ninfrastructure problems over the years.\n  Finally, I recognize Arizona and other States, mostly in the West, \nhave been shortchanged on this formula, but this is a complex issue. It \nshould not be adjusted simply by raising somebody's numbers and \nlowering somebody else's, which is what is going to happen here. It is \nnot the way to do it. I hope we can do it otherwise, and I urge my \ncolleagues to consider that if there is a vote on the Kyl amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the chart to which I referred be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1229 to Amendment No. 1214\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if there is not an objection by the assistant \nmajority leader or ranking members of the committee, I offer this \namendment that was just spoken about.\n  I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. \n     Fitzgerald, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Brownback, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1229 to amendment No. 1214.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To specify the manner of allocation of funds made available \n   for grants for the construction of wastewater and water treatment \n         facilities and groundwater protection infrastructure)\n\n       On page 105, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4__. STATE AND TRIBAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, none of \n     the funds made available under the heading ``state and tribal \n     assistance grants'' in title III for capitalization grants \n     for the Clean Water State Revolving Funds under title VI of \n     the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1381 et \n     seq.) shall be expended by the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency except in accordance with the \n     formula for allocation of funds among recipients developed \n     under subparagraph (D) of section 1452(a)(1) of the Safe \n     Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j-12(a)(1)(D)) (including \n     under a regulation promulgated under that section before the \n     date of enactment of this Act) and in accordance with the \n     wastewater infrastructure needs survey conducted under \n     section 1452(h) of that Act (42 U.S.C. 300j-12(h)), except \n     that--\n       (1) subject to paragraph (3), the proportional share under \n     clause (ii) of section 1452(a)(1)(D) of that Act (42 U.S.C. \n     300j-12(a)(1)(D)) shall be a minimum of 0.675 percent and a \n     maximum of 8.00 percent;\n       (2) any State the proportional share of which is greater \n     than that minimum but less than that maximum shall receive \n     97.50 percent of the proportionate share of the need of the \n     State; and\n       (3) the proportional share of American Samoa, Guam, the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, and the United States Virgin \n     Islands shall be, in the aggregate, 0.25 percent.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire a moment ago, but it illustrates exactly why we need this \namendment. The Senator, who is the ranking member of the authorizing \ncommittee, says we should not be doing this amendment on an \nappropriations bill, which is the pending business before the Senate; \nwe should allow the amendment to come out of the authorizing committee.\n  He is right, in theory, because almost everyone recognizes the \ncurrent formula for allocating wastewater treatment grants under the \nEPA's program is unfair. It is way out of date. It is based on 1970s \ndata and, as he noted, especially for growth States, it is woefully \ninadequate.\n  The problem is the authorizing committee has had 14 years to change \nthe formula and has not done so. There comes a time when one's patience \nbegins to wear thin. In representing the interests of the States that \nare growth States, where needs far exceed what they were back in the \n1970s or even 1980s, I think we have an obligation to say enough is \nenough; it is time to change this formula.\n  Almost everyone in this body has at one time or another made note of \nthe fact that one of the unique things about the Senate is any 1 of the \n100 Senators can offer amendments to change law or to fix things. In \nthe House of Representatives where I served, it is more difficult to do \nthat because of the numbers of people and the rules.\n  The nice thing about the Senate is we have this opportunity. That is \nwhy it is frequently the case that amendments are offered on \nlegislation that comes before us, even though it would be nice to deal \nwith that subject in another way. We do it all the time. Mostly we do \nit when the need is so great, the case is so good, and the degree of \nfairness involved is such it would be unfair and unwise for us to do \nanything else.\n  I say to my friend from New Hampshire, who says let us take care of \nit in the authorizing committee, he has had many years to do that. This \nact has not been reauthorized since it was passed in 1987. It needs to \nbe reauthorized, and it needs to be fixed.\n  I commend Senator Jeffords, the new chairman of the committee, for \nsaying he intends to take this up so he can get a reauthorization. I \nhope that is done, and I hope it is done this fall. I also hope it \nincludes a formula reallocation if we are not able to do it in this \nbill, but we have heard that story year after year after year and \nnothing happens. There is a reason nothing happens--because the States \nthat have it good under the formula do not want to change. That is \nhuman nature. There is nothing wrong with that. I do not blame them.\n  As a simple matter of fairness, if a formula has grown so out of \nwhack over the years that it treats more than half of the people in \nthis country very unfairly, then something needs to be done. We have it \nwithin our power to do it.\n\n  This amendment is germane and will be ruled such by the \nParliamentarian if there is a question about it and, therefore, it will \nbe offered and it will be voted on.\n  Since there are far more Senators whose States benefit under this \namendment than those that would lose funds because they are getting \nmore than their fair share today, I hope it will be adopted. Those \nSenators who vote against this amendment, notwithstanding the fact \ntheir States benefit, will certainly have some explaining to do to the \nfolks back home.\n  What does the amendment do? We have some funds in the Federal \nGovernment that help localities construct facilities to ensure their \ndrinking water is safe and that they have good wastewater treatment \nfacilities. These are conducted under the Environmental Protection \nAgency.\n  The EPA does a needs survey every 4 years. It decides what \ncommunities need. It does this on a State-by-State basis. We base the \nallocations of the drinking water fund strictly on the basis of that \nneeds survey because we recognize EPA is not being political in this \nendeavor. EPA understands what the needs are. It does this survey and \nsays: Here are the communities that need the money the most.\n  The formula for the drinking water is based upon that EPA quadrennial \nneeds survey. EPA also does a quadrennial needs survey for wastewater \ntreatment, but we do not base our allocations for wastewater facilities \non the basis of that needs survey. No, we base it on a 1970s era \nconstruction grant program which has no relevance to wastewater \ntreatment, is way out of date, even if it ever did, is based on 1970 \ncensus data, I believe, and, therefore, has been overcome by events and \ntime with respect to the real needs throughout the United States.\n  Based on the chart, we can see visually what the situation is. There \nare several States that have a need, and that need, represented by the \nred bar, is based on the percentage of need the States are currently \nreceiving. In other words, EPA says: This is how much you need, and \nthen here is how much Congress gives.\n  To use my State of Arizona as an example, we can see Arizona receives \na very small amount, less than 1 percent. This is why I am offering the \namendment. My State is being treated very unfairly. Under the formula \nwhich does not provide a 100-percent allocation, Arizona, as all of the \nother States, would get up to this minimal level. We can see on the \nchart the blue line for all the States is the same. Those States below \nthe line would be brought up to that level.\n  The State of Maryland is the State that has the highest bar on this \nparticular chart. The percentage of current need fulfilled in the State \nof Maryland is far in excess of my State\n\n[[Page S8636]]\n\nof Arizona, even though my State of Arizona has more population and is \nfaster growing. Is that fair? This is according to the EPA. This is not \naccording to population, Jon Kyl, or the Governor of Arizona. This is \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's survey of needs. Here is Arizona, \nless than 1 percent, and here is Maryland, much higher.\n  What we are saying is, let's even it out and make sure everybody gets \nat least a percentage of what the EPA says they deserve to have. That \nis what we are trying to do, to make it fair for everybody.\n  Incidentally, the formula change is very simple. The amendment is a \ntwo-page amendment. It reads as follows: ``shall be a minimum of 0.675 \npercent and a maximum of 8.00 percent'' of the needs survey of the EPA. \nSo there is a top and a bottom, and within that, everybody receives \nfunds according to the percentage that EPA has recommended.\n\n  It reads further:\n\n       (2) any State the proportional share of which is greater \n     than that minimum but less than that maximum shall receive \n     97.50 percent of the proportionate share of the need of the \n     State.\n\n  That is the percent everybody within the maximum and minimum will \nreceive.\n\n       (3) the proportional share of American Samoa, Guam, the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, and the United States Virgin \n     Islands shall be, in the aggregate, 0.25 percent.\n\n  I note that even though the EPA lists Arizona as No. 16 on the list \nof the States in terms of need--we rank 16th from the top--we are 53rd \nin how much money is received after a couple of the territories and the \nDistrict of Columbia. That is why I am standing before you today.\n  There are many other States--I think 28--in addition to Arizona that \nare in the same box. Some are in a little worse shape than Arizona--\nactually, I do not think any are in worse shape than my State of \nArizona, but there are several that receive more because EPA has said \nthey need more than the State of Arizona. States such as New Jersey and \nIllinois, for example, receive substantially more money under this \namendment.\n  This is not about anything complicated. It does not take a lot of \nwork to figure out how it works. It is simply a readjustment based on \nEPA's own figures.\n  Included in the appropriations bill on VA-HUD and independent \nagencies is an increase in funding of $500 million over that requested \nby the President in the EPA's clean water State revolving fund. It is \nmy understanding that the increase brings current year funding up to a \nhistoric level of $1.35 billion.\n  I applaud both Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond, who are the \nchairman and ranking member respectively of the committee, for the work \nthey put in on it. Having been a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I know how difficult it is and how hard they work on this. I \nappreciate the work they have put in on it.\n  I wish to make it clear that I support the funding for this program \nestablished under the Clean Water Act of 1987. Our States do depend on \nthis revolving fund to provide much needed financial assistance. It \ncomes in the form of low interest rate loans to sewer utility \nratepayers who otherwise bear the brunt of the costs associated with \ncompliance of EPA clean water regulations. This is one of the ways in \nwhich we impose a mandate on communities but then help them to fulfill \nthat mandate financially.\n  It is particularly beneficial for customers of the small rural water \ncompanies that serve so much of the population in the Western and \nMidwestern States. Unfortunately, the EPA has been administering this \nprogram since its inception with a very seriously flawed allocation \nformula that I described earlier. It was based on a formula that was \nderived for Federal construction loans using data that was gathered in \nthe early 1970s.\n  During these 30 years, I think we are all aware of the fact that the \ndemographic distribution in the country has changed dramatically, as \nhave the other factors that would cause the EPA to rank localities \nbased upon their need for this kind of funding.\n  In my State of Arizona, our population has nearly tripled from 1.8 \nmillion to 5.1 million since 1970. Just think about the changes that \nhas required in terms of infrastructure in the State. I might add, that \ndoes not include a very large population that is probably not counted.\n  Much of that shift in population has come from other regions of the \ncountry, so you not only have burgeoning needs in the growth States--\nand I know the State of the Presiding Officer is in the same position--\nbut you also have declining need in some of the other States that \nhistorically have a higher population and receive more money to take \ncare of that population.\n  It should be obvious that over time these formulas should be \nadjusted, but as I say, it has never been adjusted, and I have no \nreason to believe that circumstances today create any greater \nopportunity for us to do that than last year or the year before or the \nyear before that.\n  The formula that currently exists reflects neither this current \npopulation distribution nor the EPA's documented need of individual \nStates as established in its quadrennial wastewater infrastructure \nneeds survey. The EPA will update its wastewater needs survey in the \nyear 2002, but based on the most recently completed survey from 1998, \nthere is a vast discrepancy in the percentage of need fulfilled from \nState to State.\n  I have no doubt that after this next survey, this chart is going to \nbe even more skewed. States that are primarily the growth States are \ngoing to be in an even more difficult situation--States such as \nCalifornia, for example, and my own State of Arizona.\n  Let me illustrate this disparity using, however, the 1998 EPA \nwastewater infrastructure need survey and the actual clean water \nrevolving fund allocations to the States in fiscal year 2000. The State \nof Arizona received funding in fiscal year 2000 to address only .41 \npercent; that is four-tenths of 1 percent of the validated \ninfrastructure needs. By contrast, four States with populations very \nsimilar to Arizona--Wisconsin, Maryland, Minnesota, and Louisiana--each \nreceived funding that met from 4 times to 7 times the percentage \nreceived by my State: 1.43 percent in the case of Louisiana and 2.89 \npercent in the case of Minnesota. So there is a 7-to-1 ratio of States \nwith almost equal population.\n  That is not fair. I understand why the Representatives of those \nStates want to defend what they have, but they cannot defend its \nfairness, so they are relegated to an argument that procedurally we \nshould not do it on this bill but on another bill. But we never get \naround to doing it on another bill. It is a catch-22 for us.\n  My constituents back home ask, Why is Congress so partisan and why \ncan't it ever just act in a fair way to get things done. I have a hard \ntime explaining it in this case because it is a totally bipartisan \nissue. There are winner States and States that have to give back some \nof the money they are in effect receiving today, in the future. And it \ndoesn't respect party lines. People from both parties are winners and \nlosers under this current formula and would be under the new formula. I \ndon't think anybody can defend a formula that, based upon EPA's own \nrecommendations, gives one State seven times more than another State of \nthe very same population. It is very hard to defend.\n  If my colleagues would refer to the floor chart again, we see by \ngraph what I illustrated in terms of actual numbers. It only includes \nthose States not covered by the minimum or maximum shares under the \nproposed formula, so it avoids a skewed representation.\n  I make another point about this amendment because there is another \nfund out of which the committee is able to allocate money, and it is \nbased on so-called earmarks. My change here, this amendment, this \nformula change, does not in any way affect those earmarks. I make that \ncrystal clear to everybody. Their earmarks are not affected today or \ntomorrow. They are totally outside the scope of this amendment.\n  Let me illustrate how the earmarks also work. There is only one State \nthat has double-digit millions of dollars in earmarks. That is the \nState of Missouri, which receives $10.250 million in earmark funds, in \naddition to the formula funds. My State, by the way, gets $1 million. \nSo there is a 10-to-1 ratio.\n  For those who say we even it out in the earmarks, no, it is not \nevened out\n\n[[Page S8637]]\n\nin the earmarks. There are only three other States that received over \n$5 million in earmarks: Maryland, Mississippi, and Arkansas. We have a \nsituation where not only does the formula discriminate but the earmarks \nalso discriminate.\n  We have and will hear the argument we should not be legislating on an \nappropriations bill. After having complimented the chairman and ranking \nmember, I note they represent two of these four States. They are able, \nin the committee, to ensure that their State is treated as they would \nconsider to be very fairly. However, they argue that those not on the \ncommittee shouldn't be able to do anything on the floor of the Senate; \nthat would be legislating on an appropriations bill; we cannot do that. \nAgain, it is a catch-22. You have to be on the Appropriations \nCommittee; otherwise, if you are not on the Appropriations Committee, \ndon't offer an amendment on the floor or they will come to the floor \nand say they will stick together and urge their colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment because it would be legislating on an \nappropriations bill. Again, a catch-22 situation.\n\n  Last year, I was on the Appropriations Committee, I voluntarily left, \nso I guess I can't complain, but I didn't think I would be treated \nunfairly as a result of leaving the committee. This boils down to a \nmatter of unfairness. Every one of my colleagues, I know, has only the \nbest interests of both their constituents and the country at large in \ntheir mind. But nobody wants to give up an advantage. If you are \ninadvertently given $100 in change from a clerk who should have given \nyou $10, do you keep the $100? Most would say no. It is similar here.\n  The allocation of funds boils down to fairness and honesty. I defy \nanybody in this body to tell me there is a more equitable distribution, \na more equitable fashion to distribute these funds than on the basis of \na proportional share of the total validated need as determined by EPA. \nI don't ask anything more than a fair share of funding for the people \nof Arizona, my State, and for all other Americans.\n  As I said, mine is not the only State that is adversely affected. In \nfact, a majority of the States are adversely affected by the unfair and \noutdated formula that is in the bill today. Using the simple needs-\nbased formula that I proposed, 27 States and the District of Columbia \nwill receive more than they are currently receiving--not their total \npercentage share but at least more than they are receiving now. Using \nthis formula, all but three States receive, at a minimum, their exact \nproportion of share of total need.\n  This is a very fair way to make an adjustment. Ordinarily, you have \nto take away from half and give to the other half. This formula works \nin such a way that very few States could argue they are being \nshortchanged. In the case of those States, they have simply been \nreceiving far too much in comparison to what EPA has said their needs \nare. Two of the three States I noted subjected to the cap in the \nformula will still receive substantially more than they do under the \ncurrent system.\n  It is time to do something to rectify what I think is a gross \ndisparity that impacts the health and welfare of so many of our \ncitizens. I ask my colleagues to recognize the inequity and join me in \nsupporting a reasonable reformulation that takes into account both the \naging systems in the East and the growing infrastructure needs in the \nWest that have been driven by this population shift over the last 30 \nyears.\n  I close by talking just a little bit about the way the committee has \nlegislated on an appropriations bill because we will hear we cannot do \nthat, and also to talk directly to some of my colleagues on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  I note the distinguished chairman of the committee is here. I \ncomplimented him--I don't know if he was here--on his, I think, \npublicly expressed but certainly privately expressed desire to take up \nin his committee later this fall the reauthorization of the underlying \nlegislation which is very sorely needed. I applaud the Senator for \nthat. Obviously, there is no commitment to take up the formula or to \nchange the formula, and it will be too late for the fiscal year 2000 \nfunds which, again, will fall far short of what is needed and will be \nunfairly distributed.\n  Before anyone votes no on this amendment because Members think it is \nan inappropriate vehicle, think for a moment about what happens to the \nfiscal year 2002 funds that we are appropriating if the necessary \nauthorization bill is not passed in time to affect the allocations. I \nsuspect my colleague from Vermont will confirm that would be a tall \norder to get a formula changed, done in time, and signed into law to \naffect the appropriations for fiscal year 2002.\n  Back to the question of legislation on an appropriations bill. \nOrdinarily, we shouldn't do something dramatically different on an \nappropriations bill than the appropriators have put in the bill. But it \nis not true that the amendment is outside of the norm of what we do. \nLet me focus attention on just a section of the State and tribal \nassistance grants, which is where we find the funding for the State \nclean water revolving fund. In other words, you do not have to go very \nfar afield. You can stay right in the same section and find out that we \nhave legislated on an appropriations bill.\n\n  On page 76, line 3, I see we are providing funding:\n\n       . . . for Drinking Water State Revolving Funds under \n     section 1452 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended, \n     except that notwithstanding section 1452(n) of the Safe Water \n     Drinking Act, as amended, none of the funds made available \n     under this heading in this Act, or in previous appropriations \n     Acts, shall be reserved by the Administrator for health \n     effects studies on drinking water contaminants.\n\n  On page 76, line 21, grants specified in the Senate report \naccompanying this Act are provided:\n\n       . . . except that, notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, of the funds herein and hereafter appropriate under this \n     heading for such special needs infrastructure grants, the \n     Administrator may use up to 3 percent of the amount of each \n     project appropriated to administer the management and \n     oversight of construction of such projects through contracts, \n     allocation to the Corps of Engineers, or grants to the \n     States.\n\n  And on page 78 line 4:\n\n       Provided further, That no funds provided by this \n     legislation to address the water, wastewater and other \n     critical infrastructure needs of the colonias in the United \n     States along the United States-Mexico border shall be made \n     available to a county or municipal government unless that \n     government has established an enforceable local ordinance, or \n     other zoning rule, which prevents in that jurisdiction the \n     development or construction of any additional existing \n     colonia areas, or the development within an existing colonia \n     [or] the construction of any new home, business, or other \n     structure which lacks water, wastewater, or other necessary \n     infrastructure.\n\n  So that is pretty heavy duty legislating, I would say. It comes \nstraight out of the appropriations bill before us, in fact the exact \nsame section I am attempting to amend.\n  Basically what we are saying is the Appropriations Committee can \namend and legislate when the bill is before the committee, but the rest \nof the Senators are denied that opportunity when the bill comes to the \nfloor.\n  As I said, as a general rule it is probably a good thing to let most \nof the work be done by the committee. But in a case such as this where \nthere is so much disparity, so much unfairness, and where we have not \nbeen able to get the authorizers to do this reauthorizing \nnotwithstanding many years of effort, I think we have to take the \nopportunity that lies before us.\n  Mr. Fitzgerald from Illinois, Mr. Brownback from Kansas, and Mr. \nMcCain are all cosponsors of this amendment and they and some other \nMembers would wish to speak on this amendment. But at this point, since \nI see the distinguished ranking member from Missouri here and the \nchairman of the authorizing committee, I will yield the floor to them \nfor their comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is with mixed emotions that I rise to \nrespond to the amendment offered by my good friend from Arizona, mixed \nemotions because, No. 1, I could not agree more with the emphasis he \nhas put on the need for clean water, safe drinking water, and proper \nwater infrastructure in this country.\n  One of the most important things we do on this committee is to get \nthe money that we need to assure healthy water--healthy wastewater \nsystems and healthy drinking water systems\n\n[[Page S8638]]\n\nthroughout this country. When we look at the needs for water \ninfrastructure, they are overwhelming. We have an annual shortfall of \nfunding of about $12 billion per year for clean water. Over the next 20 \nyears it is estimated we are going to need $200 billion in water \ninfrastructure. That excludes operation and maintenance.\n  We, the distinguished chair and I, have fought every year to increase \nthe amount of money set out by OMB. We have always said the President \nis underfunding water, but we all know OMB represents the bad guys. \nThey have always decided to cut the money going to the State revolving \nfunds to fund other priorities. So each year we have taken the \ninadequate--grossly inadequate--funds for State revolving funds for \nwater infrastructure and increased them. We have increased them because \neven with the increases we have been able to include, we are falling \nfar short.\n  I do not think there is any other environmental program which has the \npotential to have more impact on the health of this country than \nassuring clean drinking water, safe drinking water, and cleaning up \nwastewater. If we do not do those jobs well, we will have failed in the \nmost basic health requirements for our country.\n  I have heard, in every area of this country, the cries for more water \ninfrastructure. There is not a community in this country, I do not \nbelieve, urban or rural, that does not have tremendous funding needs to \nupgrade water and sewer systems: Baltimore, MD, St. Louis, MO, Safford, \nAZ. We all need it. It could be Delaware--the whole State could use \nsome. I know because this is a broad-scale problem. I appreciate the \nSenator from Arizona raising it to the level of bringing it to the \nfloor because I have been adamant, demanding of our ranking member on \nEPW and our chairman of EPW that they focus on water problems. I am a \nhumble toiling servant of the EPW committee, and I have said we have to \nhave water issues high on our agenda. It has been too long since we \nhave dealt with the Clean Water Act.\n  Certainly the funding formula ought to be one component of that \nreview because we have tremendous water needs throughout our country. \nWhether it is east coast, west coast, the Great Plains, the South, the \nNorth, we have water needs. That is why I am glad he brought it up.\n  The other part of the emotion is it is the wrong place. I am sorry, \nbut we cannot deal with reviewing a complicated formula as part of an \noverarching programmatic review that is needed on the entire water \nissue on this appropriations bill.\n  We come to the floor and we have just now received an amendment. The \namendment says that its proportional share, if there is a minimum of \n.675 percent and a maximum of 8 percent but the State proportional \nshare is greater than the minimum, then they shall receive 97.5 percent \nof the proportionate share.\n  If we fell below the minimum, if we really were way down and we fell \nbelow a minimum somehow, then we would be shut out. What happens to \nthose who fall below the minimum? What happens to those who are above \nthe maximum? How do you calculate the proportionate share?\n\n  These are all issues that ought to be worked out in a committee \nmarkup. They are complicated issues. I have questions that I could \ndebate all day long on how to make this formula work. I do not want to \ndo that in this Chamber. I don't think we have time to do that here. I \nwould like to have my staff spend time, working on a bipartisan basis \nwith the staffs of both sides, with the EPA, with the others who are \nknowledgeable, to figure out how this works, getting input from the \nStates and the localities that receive the funds to see how it works. \nThen I can turn in anger and disgust to a staff member if they cannot \nexplain it to me.\n  Right now we are looking at something that I think has great \nproblems. For that reason, among many others, I say, please, let's take \nthis to the authorizing committee.\n  If the author of this amendment had come to me last year or the year \nbefore or the year before or the year before, I would have been more \nthan happy to sign on to a bill that says let's update this formula. I \nwould be happy to sign on. And I have supported broader measures that \nsaid let's deal with this whole problem and figure out how we are going \nto meet the $200 billion water infrastructure needs over the next 20 \nyears. This is a vitally important matter for human health.\n  We talk about a lot of things that have only that much, that tiny \nimpact on the health of our country. We spend so much time debating \nthings that are about a gnat's eyebrow worth of difference, if we do \nthis or do that.\n  What we are talking about now is something that makes a huge \ndifference, that makes a difference between whether communities are \nhealthy, whether the children, the older people, the people who are \nsick, who are needy, are getting healthy water. Are the people in that \ncommunity subject to the disease that comes from untreated wastewater? \nThese are vitally important questions that need to be referred to the \ncommittee.\n  I know the new chairman of the committee has put this issue at the \ntop of his agenda. I know EPA is currently working on a needs survey \nfor clean water funding.\n  I understand the survey will be completed in early 2002. I would love \nto get in the middle of the debate over how we utilize these SRF funds. \nI would like for the authorizing committee to send a clear signal to \nOMB, to our Budget Committee, and to the Appropriations Committee that \nwe need more money in State revolving funds, or find another means of \nfunding them, because we are falling far behind.\n  I appreciate very much this significant issue being raised. I know if \nI were in Arizona I would want to have a good water infrastructure \nmyself because you get thirsty out there in the heat. But this, \nunfortunately, as the Senator so well surmised, is not the place, this \nis not the time, and this is not the vehicle. I wish him well in some \nother venue. I will be a strong supporter trying to help him get it \ndone.\n  I urge and plead with my colleagues to recognize the importance of \nthe issue he raised but to vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to say that the way the opposition to \nmy amendment was delivered by the distinguished Senator just proves yet \nagain why he is such an effective Member of this body and such a great \nrepresentative of his State and the constituents of the whole country. \nHe has in some sense agreed that we need to do something, but makes an \nargument, which he indicated last night he would have to make, in \nopposition to the amendment. I appreciate that fact. But I don't think \none could ever ask for an opponent to an amendment who has more \ngraciously expressed his views. I want to let the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri know that I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as was pointed out, I am chairman of the \ncommittee that has jurisdiction over this matter. I appreciate the \nSenator from Arizona bringing to the attention of this body the \nseriousness of the freshwater problems that we have in this country.\n  When I became the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, one of my top priorities was to craft legislation to ensure \nthat the Federal Government meet its responsibilities to assist \ncommunities in meeting their drinking water and waste water \ninfrastructure needs. Under the leadership of our ranking member, \nSenator Smith of New Hampshire, the committee has already begun to \ninvestigate proper procedures to ensure that every community in this \ncountry has good freshwater and is able to dispose of their waste \nwater.\n  I think it is important that we discuss this, and it has been brought \nup. But I would have to object very strenuously to the amendment. It is \nunder the jurisdiction of our committee, and we are dedicated to trying \nto help make sure that we have better quality water and the quantity of \nfunds available for making sure that we improve our freshwater system.\n  I have to object to the amendment on the basis that it is under the \njurisdiction of my committee. But I will certainly do all I can to work \nwith the Senator from Arizona as we move forward in the process of \ndeveloping a better system.\n\n[[Page S8639]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me also acknowledge the comments of the \nSenator from Vermont. They are very welcome. I appreciate the fact that \nthe authorizing jurisdiction lies within the committee that he chairs, \nand that in the ordinary course of events he is absolutely right; the \nformula should be modified when the act is reauthorized under his \ncommittee. There are reasons why we make exceptions to that.\n  Sometimes in the U.S. Congress, the exceptions prove the rule. There \nare frequent times when we don't do the work in the authorizing \ncommittee but rather do it on appropriations bills. In fact, every one \nof my colleagues--including, I am sure, the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee--will acknowledge that on more than one occasion we have \nground our teeth and said it looks as if the authorizing committees are \nno longer relevant around here; that the appropriators are taking the \njurisdiction from us and are making all of the decisions. It is \nprobably a bit of an exaggeration, but I am sure every one of us has \nfelt that at times.\n  I certainly appreciate the concerns expressed by the chairman of the \ncommittee, who has to protect his committee's jurisdiction. I \nabsolutely understand that. As I said, in the normal course of events, \nI wouldn't disagree with him at all, as a member now of several \nauthorizing committees, having gotten off of the Appropriations \nCommittee. But we are in a situation today where I think almost \neverybody will acknowledge that the formula is unfair, and yet we \nhaven't been able to get a reauthorization of this act since its \ninception in 1987. That is not the fault of the distinguished chairman.\n  But the fact is, it is very difficult to ever change formulas once \nthey are in place because of the opposition of the Senators who \nperceive that they would be losing under the formula. Let me turn to a \nchart that I think will also make the point.\n  Under the Kyl-Fitzgerald-McCain legislation, some States will lose \nsome of the windfalls that they have been receiving. But every State \nexcept three, as I have pointed out, still does very well. If you look \nin the far corner, there is a State that is pretty much above every \nother State. The line for New York State is way up here. It is true \nthat under our amendment it would be brought down to here. But every \nother State else in the formula is down here.\n  While it is true that there are States that will lose--and New York \nState, I confess to my colleagues from New York, will lose funding \nunder this act. They have been getting a windfall for a number of \nyears. That must be a testament to their great work before the \ncommittee. And I suspect a former Senator from New York also had a \nlittle something to do with that.\n  My point is, yes, there are a few States that will lose funding \nbecause they have been getting too much, and almost all of the other \nStates that are within this minimum-maximum range are way down here. I \ndon't think one can say it is unfair.\n  With respect to the comment that my colleague from Missouri made, \nthat is a complicated formula. I want to make it very clear exactly \nwhat we are talking about because it is the epitome of simplicity.\n  Three factors. In accordance with the wastewater infrastructure needs \nsurvey, what does EPA recommend?\n  You get 97.5 percent of the funds that are available. There is a \nminimum and a maximum. The minimum is 1.675, and the maximum is 8.0.\n\n  It couldn't be simpler. We have available a chart that shows exactly \nthe dollars and percentages--which States receive more, which States \nreceive less, and how the earmarks relate to that. We don't affect the \nearmarks in any way. The earmarks are untouched. The 2002 earmarks are \nindicated on this particular chart.\n  I don't think the formula is at all complicated. I don't think it \ntakes a lot of work to figure out how you fared under the amendment.\n  I also note that while the Senator from Missouri was concerned about \nStates that receive the minimum amount, actually we shouldn't be \nconcerned about the States receiving the minimum because, according to \nthe survey, they actually would receive less money than that but we \nguarantee that all States receive a minimum amount. They actually end \nup receiving more percentage-wise than they should based upon the \nrecommendations.\n  I think it is a very fair formula. It is very similar to other \nformulas that we have. We already have a similar kind of formula with \nrespect to drinking water under the same act. The EPA makes a \nrecommendation. We have a formula that allocates funding based upon \nthose recommendations.\n  I think, A, it is fair; B, the minimum States are protected; and, C, \nyou can see that only a few States that have been receiving what I \nwould refer to as windfalls are going to be rather substantially \nreduced. Everyone else is reduced only a small amount. There are a few \nStates that actually increase a fair amount. That is, frankly, because \nof the fact that they have been significantly shortchanged in the past.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to relate a few of the \nstatistics.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer represents the State of Delaware, \nwhich is currently receiving $6.7 million but would receive $9.1 \nmillion under the formula.\n  Let me start at the top. We all know California is a fast-growing \nState. It is slated to receive $97 million under the current \nallocation. It would receive $108 million under the Kyl-Fitzgerald-\nMcCain amendment.\n  I think the State of Illinois has been significantly shortchanged \nprobably more than any other State. It received $61 million. According \nto the allocation, it should receive $108 million. It would gain $48 \nmillion.\n  I think for the citizens of Illinois, it is just unconscionable that \nit has fallen that far behind.\n  The State of Ohio similarly has been receiving less.\n  The State of New Jersey, which is receiving $55 million, would \nreceive almost $75 million--about a $21 million increase.\n  This just illustrates the point. I could go on down the list.\n  Next is Pennsylvania, which is receiving $54 million but would \nreceive $61 million. The State of Florida receives $46 million; it \nwould receive $55 million. The State of Indiana receives $32 million; \nit would receive $50 million.\n\n  You can see how there are States that are really significantly below. \nJust in the spirit of full disclosure, going down to my own State of \nArizona, it receives $9 million; it should be receiving $22 million.\n  My point is, there are a lot of States that are way behind what EPA \nthinks they should be receiving. There are a few States that are way \nahead of what they should be receiving. But as I said, only three \nStates will actually receive less as a result of our amendment. Let's \nsee if I actually have those States listed.\n  All but three States will receive, at a minimum, their exact \nproportionate share of total need. And two of them subjected to the cap \nin the formula will still receive substantially more than they do under \nthe current system\n  Mr. President, there are other Members who would like to speak to \nthis amendment. I promised them they would have the opportunity. At \nleast two of them are tied up in the Commerce Committee, which I assume \nis going to be done with its business pretty soon. So I would like to \nhave an opportunity for them to speak. But I also note the \ndistinguished chairman of the subcommittee is in this Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to table the pending amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Would the Senator withhold? I want to speak. I also \nunderstand there are two other Members who wish to speak. Will the \nSenator withhold because I understand the other Senator from Arizona \nwishes to speak?\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If the Senator makes his motion to table, does that \nterminate the debate? I ask the Senator, in the spirit of----\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I withdraw my motion to table at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is withdrawn.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank both Senators because last night\n\n[[Page S8640]]\n\nthe Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, said he would be here at 10:30 this \nmorning, ready to offer his amendment and ready to debate it and line \nup his speakers. He really met that commitment. We thank him for \nhonoring that commitment.\n  Also, he made it very clear last night that the other Senator from \nArizona wished to speak. We want to be able to accommodate him because \nI think we have been moving along in a spirit of comity. I would just \nask the proponent of the amendment if we could encourage those speakers \nto come to the Chamber. My remarks will not be of a prolonged nature. \nIf the two Commerce Committee Senators could come over, I believe we \ncould have this amendment wrapped up before lunch and, I think, would \nbe moving in a well-paced way.\n  Again, we want to keep the kind of atmosphere of civility that has \nset the tone of the bill. If everyone would notice, there has not even \nbeen a quorum call. So I am ready to make my remarks. We would then go \nto those two other colleagues to speak.\n  I ask the Senator, are they coming?\n  Mr. President, we are going to have a little quorum call, just for \nclarification.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, again, I thank the Senator from Arizona \nfor proposing his amendment and moving with a promptness that is \nappreciated by both Senator Bond and I. I acknowledge the validity of \nmany of the concerns that the Senator from Arizona raises.\n  When you have a State such as Arizona, that certainly is growing in \npopulation, and you find out you are down on a list of Federal funds, \nit is, indeed, troubling.\n  I also acknowledge the fact that the Nation is facing a clean water \nfunding crisis. It is estimated that we have an annual funding \nshortfall for clean water infrastructure of at least $12 billion. I can \nhonestly tell the Senator that if I gave $1 billion to every State in \nthe Union over and above what is in our bill, it would be well used \nbecause it is needed.\n  We have heard about water problems from failing septic tanks in the \nDelmarva region that you and I represent, where the rural poor really \ndo not have the bucks to do it. We have heard about the big failing \nwater systems in the Chicagos and the Baltimores, where they were built \nover 100 years ago, and it is beyond the scope of this Appropriations \nCommittee to deal with it.\n  We need full-scale authorizing hearings on the needs for America's \nwater infrastructure--both the needs and the formula. So I acknowledge \nthat this is a big deal and a big problem.\n  There is not a community in this country--urban or rural--that does \nnot have some important funding need related to water, whether it is \nfrom Baltimore to St. Louis to Stafford or Scottsdale, AZ. However, I \nmust say, Senator Kyl's amendment is outside of the scope of the VA-HUD \nbill. I truly believe, because it is a formula change, that it will \ntrigger essentially a water war on the VA-HUD bill.\n  This is, indeed, an authorizing issue and should be addressed by the \nauthorizers in comprehensive water infrastructure legislation.\n  Last night we had an excellent discussion on the issue of arsenic. We \nall agreed that arsenic is a problem. We all agreed that complying with \nthe Federal mandate on arsenic will also be a problem. So our \ncolleague, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, offered an \namendment for authorizing on funding. We thought that was an excellent \nway to go and, wow, suddenly you had a Domenici-Mikulski-Schumer-\nClinton-Bond--an amazing list of cosponsors. The message of that was \nnot only that arsenic is a problem, but, like last night when we talked \nabout it, how do we pay for these water issues?\n  What we have done--again, working on a bipartisan basis--the VA-HUD \nbill does not break new ground on environmental issues. We essentially \nbroke no new ground, whether it was on enforcement, whether it was \nreallocating from sewers to State revolving funds, and so on. We \nessentially kept the framework from last year to get the President to \nput his arms around it, to get our new EPA Administrator to put her \narms around it, to then look at what EPA should be and what are some of \nthe new changes we need to make.\n\n  We think we have gotten off to a good start. Because this is a year \nof transition, both within the executive branch and also within this \nsubcommittee, that was the framework we approached, so that we could be \nprudent, that we would not lurch ahead in either the executive or \nlegislative branch and make mistakes that we would have to then go back \nand evaluate.\n  As my colleagues know, often on environmental issues, we end up with \neither unfunded mandates or, in some instances, unintended consequences \nto what seems to be a good idea.\n  The new chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works \nbelieves that water should be at the top of his agenda. He is here \ntoday to speak on that. EPA is currently working on a needs survey for \nclean water funding. This should be done early in the next calendar \nyear.\n  I cannot support the Kyl amendment until the authorizers have had an \nopportunity to examine the needs survey and we have the very important \ncensus data related to growth that the Senator from Arizona has talked \nabout. We all acknowledge that Arizona has grown, but we want to have \nmore data on that. Then we need to have recommendations on how to \nclearly allocate our clean water.\n  There is also another issue with the actual formula that the Senator \nis proposing. It is going to be a little geeky here so stick with me.\n  This amendment would require EPA to allocate the fiscal year 2002 \nclean water State revolving fund appropriation to the States using an \nallocation formula for the drinking water State revolving loan fund.\n  Remember, we have two revolving loan funds: one for clean water and \nthe other for drinking water. You might say: Why is that such a big \ndeal? Dirty water is dirty water, and why not commingle the formulas?\n  This is really inconsistent with the Nation's wastewater and clean \nwater needs. Drinking water systems and wastewater systems are \nfundamentally different. They deal with two different problems. They \nfocus on different pollutants. Wastewater systems concentrate on \nremoving pollution that deteriorates our rivers, lakes, and our bays--\nthe Chair is familiar with it--the nitrogens, the phosphorous. That is \nwhy we have those problems on the Chesapeake Bay.\n  The drinking water system removes pollutants and treats water to make \nsure it is safe to drink. One, we are drinking it; and the other drops \nit into the big drink like the Chesapeake Bay --two different things \nand two different kinds of pollution.\n  When we get our drinking water, we are not dealing with phosphorous \nand nitrogen and those issues with which we have had to deal.\n  In addition, the wastewater systems need to address shortcomings from \nthe past, such as combined sewer overflows. Anyone from the city knows \nthat this combined sewer overflow and the sanitary overflows are really \nbig issues. There is no parallel to those issues in the drinking water \nsystems. You can see how they are different. Then to use the same \nformulas, it gets to be a problem.\n  Also, this amendment has another fundamental flaw. It references a \nwater infrastructure needs survey to be conducted under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. EPA has advised the committee today that no such \nsurvey exists. The wastewater needs survey is required under the Clean \nWater Act, not the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\n  We are going to get lost here. We don't want to get lost on the \nSenator's needs or what we want to accomplish. This shows exactly why \nthis is the wrong place to offer this amendment. It is so complicated. \nWe have needs surveys. We have formulas. We have safe water. We have \nclean water. We have drinking water. We have dirty water. We have \nwastewater. We need to be clear that the formulas are based on the \nproblem to be addressed as well as on population.\n\n[[Page S8641]]\n\n  Section 2 of the Senator's amendment is unclear. The Agency would be \nat a loss on how to calculate the formula given this direction.\n  The needs for surface water quality projects differ geographically \nfrom drinking water projects. For example, some communities are served \nby central drinking water systems, but there is no municipal wastewater \nsystem. In another circumstance, a community may have a minor drinking \nwater problem but might have a terrible or significant combined sewer \noverflow or a sanitary sewer overflow. As a result, surveying the \nconstruction needs of drinking water systems has no connection to the \nwastewater treatment system in the same community.\n  The Presiding Officer was a Governor. I am sure he follows that. But \nmost of all, local government follows it.\n  Which brings me to another issue: Changes of this magnitude applied \nhere with such scant notice would severely disrupt State programs. \nStates must plan ahead. They have to use an expected range of \ncapitalization grants for planning purposes. You have to know what you \nare going to get and when you are going to get it. Changes of the size \nimplicit in the amendment would stop the State CWSRF, the clean water \nState revolving fund, loan programs for a significant period of time. \nThis means that States would have to scurry around, prepare new \nintended-use plans, hold public hearings, try to get their bond issues \nstraightened out.\n  As you know, States have capital budgets. We don't. Capital budgets \nare based on what is going to come out of general revenue and what able \nGovernors take to the bond market. A lot of our water and sewer is done \non bonds, particularly at the local level.\n  This is going to wreak havoc in all States. I know the Senator's \nintention is to get more money into some States. It will wreck havoc \neven in his own State.\n  Keep in mind, we will not only have the loss of money but we will \nhave the loss of time. It will affect our drinking water as well as our \ncommitment to the environment.\n  The clean water State revolving fund addresses clean water needs \nwhich are very different from drinking water. I have talked about that. \nThe use of the drinking water State revolving fund would misdirect \nresources, resulting in a mismatch between the allocation of Federal \nfunds by States and by the State's needs.\n  I could go on: Who are winners, and who are losers.\n  The important thing is, when it comes to water, there should be no \nlosers. We all have our needs. We all have our problems. These formulas \nwere originally established to meet those needs.\n  Maybe there is the need to adjust those formulas. In every formula, \nsome States gain and some States do not do as well as they should. \nFormulas are really complicated. They do approach the level of treaty \nnegotiations.\n  To try to do this on this bill would wreck havoc. It would trigger \nSenators coming to see what they are going to get and what they are \ngoing to lose.\n  The more prudent way would be for there to be some type of \ninstruction to EPA for evaluation. We would be happy to enter into a \ncolloquy with both Senators from Arizona. We would be happy to sign a \nletter to the very able Administrator at the EPA outlining the concerns \nthe Senators have. But we don't think we should have this amendment. If \nwe pass this amendment, it is going to wreak havoc in the States with \ntheir ability to administer their programs; it is going to wreak havoc \nwith the capital programs; it is going to wreak havoc with their bonds; \nand, most of all, it is going to wreak havoc with, really, the \nconfusion that is going to come with using one formula for wastewater \nand use it also for drinking water. We really encourage--because it is \nnot sound--this is not the place to enter into such a significant, \ncomplex public policy debate with enormous consequences to our \nconstituents, to our communities, to our States and their ability to \nmeet their fiscal responsibility as well as their environmental and \npublic health stewardship. I am telling you, this is really the very \nwrong place to do this amendment. I oppose it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the chair of the \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Maryland, for laying out the concerns, \nfirst, that the EPA has about it. I am relieved to see I was not the \nonly one confused by the formula. I tried to figure out how the formula \nin section 2 would work, and I found a lot more questions than answers.\n  The EPA has advised us that they don't know how the formula would \nwork. That is why I said a few moments ago that on these complicated \nitems there needs to be substantive hearings. There should be hearings \non how the changes might affect existing water bonding issues, existing \nwater programs in the States. There should be hearings on how these \nchanges would affect the States where the needs are. Most important, we \nneed to sit down with all of the players and make sure we have a \nformula that everybody understands and that works.\n  So I believe the EPA has given us the reasons that we described in \ngeneral about the problems in trying to adopt a significant change on \nthe floor. Having said that, I am very enthusiastically a supporter of \nthe suggestion the chair of the committee has made that we join either \nin a colloquy, letters and instruction, first, to the EPA, to present \nto us options for revising and updating the formula, if needed, for \nboth the drinking water revolving fund and the clean water revolving \nfund and the one that deals with wastewater, to give us their best \nassessment and to actually provide that to the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee so we will have something with which to work.\n  As I have said before, I am a most enthusiastic proponent of revising \nthese formulas and finding ways to put more money into this very badly \nneeded area, for investments for the future health and well-being of \nour community.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, let me say to my colleagues I very much \nsupport the Safe Drinking Water Act. There are tremendous needs \nthroughout America and in our Commonwealth of Virginia, especially in \nthe southwestern region of Virginia.\n  This issue deals with wastewater and the need for cleaning up our \nwastewater, where there are combined sewer overflow situations in \nLynchburg, Richmond, and other areas, as well as the Northern Virginia \narea, which flows into the Potomac, which affects the Chesapeake Bay, \nwhich is important to Virginia and the State of Maryland; and the \nChair's home State of Delaware has a few tributaries that flow into the \nChesapeake Bay. It is also important to Pennsylvania and New York, \nwhich are also part of that watershed.\n  Now, again, I am very much in favor of all these ideas. The question \nis: How do you meet the needs? In trying to determine how you meet the \nneeds for clean water, drinking water, and clean water as regards \nwastewater treatment, you want to have a good, objective, up-to-date \ndetermination of needs.\n  The drinking water allocations are based on EPA's recommendations. \nThere is a needs survey. But as I best understand it--and I may ask, in \na moment, my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, to join me to explain \nthis because some fellow Senators are saying they don't understand \nthis, and I want to have a better understanding.\n  The wastewater moneys are based on a 1970s population number and have \nnot changed since the law was passed in 1987, 14 years ago. As I \nunderstand this formula change, what it attempts is to bring in \nfairness and equity and address the needs for wastewater cleanup and \nbase the numbers on EPA's wastewater needs survey. So it is a similar \nsort of logic and formula and survey that is used for drinking water \nthat we would want to use for wastewater.\n  It strikes me, regarding the matter of fairness, that a minority of \nStates in this proposal get way more than the percentage EPA recommends \nunder the current formula and a majority receive much less--mostly in \nStates that are growing faster. Regardless, everyone recognizes--and I \nhaven't heard anybody listening to the debate on the floor or in \nbetween saying that the current formula is right--now is the time\n\n[[Page S8642]]\n\nto make sure the wastewater allocations, the taxpayer dollars, are \nbeing utilized in a way that addresses the needs of the various States.\n  The formula change also does not affect the so-called earmarks. That \nis separate and in a smaller pot of money. I ask the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. Kyl, if he will please take the floor and let me ask him a \nfew questions so we can clear up any misunderstandings that have been \nproffered here by others who may not seem to understand this proposal.\n  I ask the Senator from Arizona this: The current plan, the current \nallocation for wastewater moneys, is it a formula based on population \nfrom the 1970 census?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Virginia, my staff \nhas tried to find out the basis for the current formula, and they have \nhad a very difficult time getting anybody to tell them what it is. We \nhave gone back in the debates, in the records, and so on. As best we \ncan tell, it is a formula that is based upon a construction grant \nprogram using 1970s data, including population data. That is as clear \nas I can be about it. I urge anybody--of course, I find it interesting \nthat those who are opposing the amendment do so on procedural grounds, \nnot defending the existing formula. I haven't found anybody to defend, \nlet alone explain, what the basis of the existing formula is.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. If the Senator will yield for a further question, I ask \nthe Senator from Arizona this: The formula he is proposing here, \nthough, is based, as he states, on needs, actual needs. How do you \ndetermine those needs? What is the formula? What is the criterion by \nwhich needs are addressed?\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that question from the Senator because there \nhas been, I think, a misunderstanding here. My understanding is that \nEPA has at least two different ``needs surveys,'' as they call them. \nThey survey needs of communities for drinking water, and we use that \nsurvey with a formula for the allocation of drinking water moneys in a \ndifferent place in this bill. They also do a survey for wastewater \nneeds.\n  It is my proposal that we use that survey as the basis for the \nallocation of wastewater funds. Those are different surveys. We should \nnot confuse the two. We are not suggesting that we use the drinking \nwater survey for wastewater allocations. Leave the drinking water \nsurvey for the drinking water allocations and use the wastewater survey \nfor the wastewater allocations.\n  It is further my understanding that each of these is redone every 4 \nyears on a rotating basis.\n  In 2002, there will be the new 4-year wastewater treatment survey. \nTwo years ago, we had the most recent drinking water survey. So every 2 \nyears, we have a new survey. One is for drinking water; one is for \nwastewater. My concern is we will wait until the 2002 wastewater \nsurvey, and then it will be at least fiscal year 2003, or later, when \nit can be implemented, even if we are all in agreement to use that \nsurvey. Clearly, we will be yet another year or even 2 years down the \nroad without having made the formula safe.\n  To summarize, the Senator from Virginia is correct. There are two \ndifferent needs surveys, one for drinking water and one for wastewater. \nWe are not using the drinking water survey; we are using the wastewater \nsurvey. The formulas also differ slightly.\n  I believe there is a 1-percent minimum on drinking water for that \nfund. In ours, it is a .675-percent minimum, 8-percent maximum, and \neverybody else within that range receives 97.5 of what is available. It \nis a very simple formula and not dissimilar to the drinking water \nformula, but it is not the same formula.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if he will yield for a \nfurther question.\n  There was an assertion that this will affect some of the bonding and \nexpected amounts of money. The Senator is saying after the 2002 \nanalysis, or the survey for wastewater monies, which is calculated on \nan antiquated, outdated, inaccurate formula, there would be a change. \nEven if nothing happened, even if the Senate does not act in a \nfarsighted, appropriate way and vote for the amendment, there still \nwould be changes in allocations to the different States anyway. Isn't \nthat correct?\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator from Virginia is correct. That is based on two \nprimary factors:\n  First, as both the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from \nMissouri have noted, they have fought very hard for increased funding. \nOne never knows. Each year, from one year to the next, we never know \nwhat amount of money is going to be available; that is very true. It \nwould be folly for someone to count on a particular amount of money.\n  Second, as I said, we do not touch the earmarks. The earmarks come \nfrom a separate pot, basically, if we want to simplify it. That comes \nfrom a separate pot of money, and the committee can certainly do a lot \nof adjusting within their earmark authority from year to year. We \ncannot predict, obviously, from year to year what that would be.\n  So, yes, the Senator is correct. There are at least two bases, and \nmaybe others, for not knowing exactly how much money one is going to \nget from one year to the next, even under the existing formula.\n  Mr. ALLEN. As far as that is concerned in bonding and hypothecating \nexpected revenues from the Federal Government, it is a risky business \nfor State governments or local or regional municipal waterworks anyway.\n  As I understand it, the Senator is trying to make sure we are \nallocating scarce taxpayer resources; we are making a priority. \nObviously, on drinking water--and that is not affected by this--in the \nwisdom of the Senate, the House, and the Federal Government, they \nsaid--before the Presiding Officer and I were in the Senate, but it \nmade sense--let us make sure the money is getting to those who need it \nthe most.\n  The same logic is applied in the measure of the Senator from Arizona, \nas far as wastewater is concerned, which is very important for \nrecreation, for water treatment and, obviously, for our enjoyment and \nhealth.\n  It seems to me the Senator from Arizona is moving forward, making \nsure, when the survey is done next year, it will utilize a needs \nassessment, not outdated population figures that are 20 or 30 years \nold, and making sure we are getting the funds to the areas that need it \nthe most.\n  Most tributaries do not just flow out of one State; they start in one \nState and sometimes travel through several others. For example, as I \nmentioned, Delaware: Folks from Delaware say everything flows into the \nAtlantic Ocean or towards the oceanside. Some of the rivers or streams \nwill flow through Maryland into the Chesapeake Bay. Therefore, if there \nis some waste coming from a stream that--and I am sure there would not \nbe too much, but there can be from time to time, as we all know, on the \nDelmarva peninsula. But the point is, if one is cleaning it up on the \nriparian areas of the river in Delaware, that helps Maryland and that \nhelps Virginia as well.\n  Sometimes we look at it on a State-by-State basis. The Colorado River \nflows, obviously, out of Colorado through Utah, through Arizona, \nthrough a part of or at least the border of Nevada and California. The \nPotomac River actually starts some of the tributaries in Virginia, goes \nthrough West Virginia, obviously through Maryland, and obviously on the \nbanks of Virginia. The same with the Missouri, the Mississippi, the \nOhio, the Kanawa, the Cheat--all sorts of rivers go through many \nStates.\n  I ask the Senator from Arizona one final question: What would he say \nis the most salient point in how his proposal would more accurately \nreflect the actual wastewater treatment needs of this country than the \nold formula that is admitted by all to be outdated and wrong? How would \nhis proposal, in the most salient way, make it a more accurate \ndetermination and allocation of scarce funds to the actual needs of \nwastewater cleanup?\n\n  Mr. KYL. I will answer the question of the Senator from Virginia by \nsimply saying it is based upon EPA recommendations. We know growth \nStates, population changes, account for a big part of the increased \nneeds.\n  The Senator is also correct that there are some other localized \nfactors, including waterways, the existence of waterways and other \nfactors that bear on this. That is why I note that States that have \nbeen significantly underfunded include a big growth State such as \nCalifornia and the State of Illinois.\n\n[[Page S8643]]\n\n I just do not understand why Illinois has been so drastically \nunderfunded. Ohio, maybe that is because both Ohio and Illinois have \nsubstantial waterways, as the Senator from Virginia does.\n  New Jersey is another State that has been woefully underfunded. Yet \nit is not as big a growth State as California or my own State of \nArizona.\n  Indiana is another State that is underfunded. It could be that series \nof rivers in the Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois area. I cannot explain why \nthe EPA recommends exactly what it recommends and, in comparison to the \nexisting formula, why some States are so much out of skew. One general \nreason is that of population growth. There are others, as the Senator \nhas pointed out.\n  The main reason this formula makes sense is EPA looks at all of this, \napplies a needs-based test, makes the recommendations, and those are \nthe recommendations that we plug into the formula.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator from Arizona, and I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting the Senator from Arizona. I think it is the \nKyl-Fitzgerald-McCain amendment.\n  It is a matter of fairness. It is addressing actual needs, and there \nis a reason population would be more of a concern, because as \npopulation increases, obviously there may be a corresponding increase \nin wastewater treatment needs.\n  I conclude by saying I urge my colleagues to use objective standards. \nDo not use politics but look at objective needs to clean up the \nwastewater in this country.\n  I am very grateful to the Senator from Arizona for spending this \namount of time and effort to try to correct this inequity. It seems to \nhave been around for several decades, and this is the time to act. Who \nknows when we will have another chance, the way the Senate moves.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from Arizona. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this amendment. It will be good for the water in \ntheir States and the water throughout the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I reiterate before a fellow Bay Senator \nleaves the Chamber, EPA has informed me why this amendment has a \nfundamental flaw. The amendment references a wastewater infrastructure \nneeds survey to be conducted under the Safe Drinking Water Act. No such \nsurvey exists, according to EPA. The wastewater needs survey is \nrequired under the Clean Water Act, not the Safe Drinking Water Act. I \nwanted to make that point.\n  I have a question for the Senator from Arizona. I know he has put a \nlot of work into trying to develop this formula, but I really wanted to \nbring to his attention what EPA has apprised me of, and I think we need \nto check that. I know the Senator likes to always operate off the basis \nof fact.\n  The EPA says the agency would be at a loss as to how to calculate a \nformula given this direction. So there is no needs survey on which to \ncalculate it. We are getting ``section this of that act'' and ``section \nthat of that act,'' et cetera, which is why we need this in an \nauthorizing bill and not on an appropriations bill. I do not dispute \nthe Senator believes this--I want to share this information with him.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum to share this information with the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CORZINE). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Kyl \namendment be temporarily set aside at the concurrence of the managers, \nSenator Kyl and Senator Reid, and that when Senator Schumer offers his \namendment regarding the HUD gun buyback, there be 60 minutes of debate \nprior to a vote in relation to the amendment, with no second-degree \namendments in order to either the Kyl or Schumer amendments; that at \n12:30 p.m. today, Senator McCain be recognized to speak with reference \nto the Kyl amendment, with that time not charged against the time on \nthe Schumer amendment; that any time remaining after the time for \ndebate on the Schumer amendment be equally divided among Senators \nMikulski, Bond, and Kyl, with the understanding that Senator Fitzgerald \nwill have some of Senator Kyl's time; that at 1:55 p.m. today, there be \n2 minutes for explanation prior to a vote in relation to the Kyl \namendment, to be followed by 2 minutes prior to a vote in relation to \nthe Schumer amendment, with the time equally controlled and divided in \nthe usual form. I further ask unanimous consent that in case Senator \nKyl, in his original offer of amendments, cited the wrong statutory \nsection, he have the right to modify his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. There is no objection on this side. We believe this is an \nappropriate accommodation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1231 to Amendment No. 1214\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside and we move to the Schumer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1231.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To make drug elimination grants for low-income housing \n               available for the BuyBack America program)\n\n       On page 25, line 23, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That of the amount under \n     this heading, $15,000,000 shall be available for the BuyBack \n     America program, enabling gun buyback initiatives undertaken \n     by public housing authorities and their local police \n     departments''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be brief. I thank the Chair of the \nVA-HUD subcommittee for her help on this amendment and for her general \nhelp to this Senator, for which I am forever appreciative.\n  I rise to introduce an amendment to restore a valuable initiative to \nreduce gun violence in the Nation's public housing authorities. The \namendment sets aside $15 million of the $300 million that we allocate \nto the public housing drug elimination program for BuyBack America, a \ngun buyback program to eradicate violence in our Nation's public \nhousing authorities. BuyBack America was introduced by the Department \nof HUD in November, 1999. In the first year alone, it helped local \npolice departments in 80 cities take 20,000 guns off our streets. Guns \nwere bought back for around $50. The guns were taken in and then \ndestroyed.\n  Since the gun buyback policy was first introduced through New York \nCity's Toys for Guns programs in 1993--someone I have come to know, Mr. \nMateo, was the initiator--thousands of low-crime, underserved \nneighborhoods have seized the opportunity to eradicate gun violence. \nThe program works. From Annapolis to Atlanta, from San Francisco to \nSchenectady, it has helped raise gun control awareness and lower rates \nof violence. However, HUD last week announced its plans to discontinue \nBuyBack America. The program has been targeted as part of a campaign, \nin my judgment at least, by the administration against any kind of gun \ncontrol, no matter how moderate, how rational, and how protective of \nthe rights of legitimate gun owners--which this program clearly is.\n\n  In fact, the President's budget this year zeroed out funding for the \nentire Public Housing Drug Elimination Program, which had been funded \nthrough Senator Mikulski's leadership, and I know my colleague has been \ninvolved as well, for which we thank him.\n  If we do not set aside a certain amount for gun buyback programs, it \nwill not be done by the administration,\n\n[[Page S8644]]\n\ngiven its unfriendly position toward even modest measures dealing with \ntaking guns away from kids and criminals.\n  So I ask that this amendment be supported. I, temporarily at least, \nyield back my time with the right to come back later and speak further \non the amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I acknowledge the cooperation of the Senator working \nwith us. Before I speak on the amendment, I am going to inform the \nSenator that we are scheduled to move his amendment aside at 12:30 when \nthose tied up in Commerce are coming over. Then we are scheduled to \ncome back to the amendment of the Senator, I believe, at quarter of 1.\n  I want to advise the Senator of that. I think he was dealing with a \nvery pressing New York need and did not hear the unanimous consent \nagreement, though we had the cooperation of his staff.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor. I will be back \nat 12:45 to resume the debate.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Before he leaves, the Senator from New York should know \nI am going to support his amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Once again, the Senator from Maryland hits a home run \nfor New York, Maryland, and America. Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, one of the things that occurred in the \nVA-HUD budget as it came from the President was to eliminate $300 \nmillion for drug elimination in public housing.\n  The Presiding Officer's predecessor was one of the champions of that, \nthe distinguished former Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg. We \nworked hands on, on many of the items. We think that $300 million in \ndrug elimination is a very important program.\n  At the same time as we have been saying to the Senator from Arizona \nand others we are not going to break new ground in this bill because of \nthe transitions both of the executive branch as well as the legislative \nbranch, the committee has restored the $300 million in drug elimination \nfunds. We have restored that because we know we have to get drugs out \nof public housing. We know we have to make sure, in getting the drugs \nout of public housing, that public housing provides an opportunity to \nbe not only a way of life, but to lead to a better life.\n  We turned to the authorizers and we encouraged them to hold hearings \non what has the most efficacy, making sure public housing is neither a \nslum landlord nor an incubator for drug dealing, and we encouraged them \nto do that. The Schumer amendment mandates that we keep the gun buyback \nprogram which Secretary Martinez would like to eliminate.\n  We think, again, it is the executive branch acting and so on. We need \nconversation, again, on what is the most effective way to deal with \ncrime in our communities, gun violence in our communities. I have had \nin the past several years the most gruesome statistics in Maryland. I \nlike being from a State of Super Bowl champions, and I love the show \n``Homicide'' that was on, that was so terrific. But what I did not like \nwas the homicide rate. Thanks to Mayor O'Malley and Commissioner \nNorris, we are bringing that down. But gun violence--we are like a war \nzone.\n  The Schumer amendment would give our local police departments and our \npublic housing authorities the opportunity to operate a gun buyback \nprogram using Federal dollars. But it is their choice. In other words, \nthe Feds do not say you must do it, nor do the Feds say you cannot do \nit; it leaves it up to the local community whether they think it has \nefficacy in that area. It might not work in every community. We do not \nhave that one-size-fits-all on how to deal with ending violence and \ngetting drugs out of public housing. But each city or county should \nhave the opportunity to operate a gun buyback program if it chooses.\n  Many public housing complexes function almost as small cities unto \nthemselves. They have their own police departments; they have their own \ngoverning authority. They really are, in some instances, small towns. \nWe, of course, would like to make sure they have the sense of being a \nvillage. They have unique needs, require special help and attention.\n  This program was started in 1999 during the Clinton administration. \nIt provided up to $500,000 for police departments around the country to \nbuy back and destroy weapons. During the first year of operation, \n20,000 guns were taken off the street in 80 different cities.\n  The amendment gives our local police more resources in fighting \ncrime. We should not second-guess those local decisions on how to do \nit. Whether it is the cops on the beat or gun buybacks, it will allow \nthe local authorities to do that. We must do everything we can to \nprotect our citizens who live in public housing and those who live \naround public housing because everything that goes bad with public \nhousing goes bad with the neighborhood near public housing.\n  I support this Schumer amendment. I look forward to its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes from the opponent's \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chair of the \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Maryland, for explaining why this is an \nimportant but misdirected amendment.\n  First, I express my sincere appreciation to the chair of the \nsubcommittee for including in the bill the money that was zeroed out by \nthe administration for the drug elimination program. I worked with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from North Carolina several years ago to \ninclude money for eliminating drugs in public housing because it has \nbeen our heartfelt belief for a long time that we need to make assisted \nhousing--whether it be public housing or whether it be section 8 \nfinanced housing--the kind of housing where a mother, or mother and \nfather, would want to raise their children in a proper atmosphere.\n  Getting drugs out of public housing, making sure it is safe, is \nprobably one of the very first steps in addition to keeping the rain \nout and keeping the cold out in winter. Making sure it is safe and drug \nfree is vitally important. I was very disappointed that the \nadministration zeroed it out.\n  We now have it back in the bill, and there is the flexibility in the \nPHAs to use this money however they want. The amendment by the Senator, \nmy good friend from New York, would establish a $15 million set-aside \nin the public housing drug elimination fund for the gun buyback \nprogram. It is unnecessary because right now, if they wish to do so, a \nPHA can use money for the buyback. It takes away the choice and the \ndecision from the local levels.\n  Local public housing authorities can conduct drug buy-back programs \nunder the drug elimination grant. The bottom line is it is not \nmandatory. The PHA makes a choice, based upon its need to eliminate \ncrime and illegal drug activity, what is the best thing we can do in \nthis community to protect our friends and neighbors from drug crime.\n  That is a legitimate choice. I support that local choice, despite the \nfact to my knowledge there is no evidence that gun buyback programs \nactually reduce crime or illegal drug activity. They make people feel \ngood. It is a feel-good program.\n  But let me ask you, my colleagues. Let's apply a commonsense test. \nSometimes back home some of the things you hear on the street corner at \nthe place where you have breakfast make a whole lot more sense than \nsome of the very sophisticated things that we discuss up here. I was \ntalking to some of the guys out at the livestock market breakfast place \nwhere I go out for breakfast every Saturday morning. They said: Tell \nme. If you were a criminal and they had a gun buyback program, would \nyou go in and sell your gun to the gun buyback program?\n  I said: What do you mean? Say the cops or the PHA have a gun buyback \nprogram. Rather than using my good gun to go out and make holdups, I am \ngoing to get $5 for the buyback.\n  He said: No. You find an old gun that doesn't work, or you go out and \nsteal a few more guns. Say I have 15 or 20 guns that are inoperable, \noutdated, and ineffective. I will trade them in. You know what I can do \nwith that money. I can either get drugs or buy some ammunition for my \ngood gun.\n  Ask the gang back home. Go to the town square and ask them. How many\n\n[[Page S8645]]\n\ncriminals do you think are going to sell their guns to the buyback \nprogram? They are going to tell you none, or fewer.\n  That is just common sense. I don't believe there is any evidence on \nthe other side.\n  Having that said, if PHA believes it will make everybody feel good, \nand if they think it will help to use money for a gun buyback program, \ngo for it.\n  But I tell you it is one program that I just think doesn't meet the \ncommonsense test. It just does not make any sense to me.\n  I urge my colleagues to leave the discretion with the public housing \nauthorities and not seek to take money away from security needs, or \nfrom other things, or from programs that have some questions about it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First of all, I thank the managers of this bill for their courtesy. I \nknow they appreciate the fact that we had a markup of some important \nlegislation this morning in the Commerce Committee. I apologize for any \ndelay that may have caused in completing this very important \nappropriations bill. I thank the Senator from Maryland and the Senator \nfrom Missouri for their courtesy in not only allowing me to speak on \nthe amendment of my colleague from Arizona but also for allowing me to \npropose my amendment.\n  I understand that it is the wish of the managers that it be laid \naside after I propose it, and then I would speak on it after 2 o'clock. \nI ask the Senator from Maryland if that is the case.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona repeat his \nquestion?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, my understanding of the parliamentary \nprocedure is that at this time I will speak on behalf of the Kyl \namendment, propose my amendment, then ask that it be laid aside, and \nthat I would be allowed to speak on my amendment after the two votes at \n2 o'clock.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If the Senator will withhold, we have a very \ncomplicated unanimous consent here to accommodate Senators. I wish to \nbring to the Senator's attention that at about 5 until 2 we are going \nto have two votes: one on Kyl and one on Schumer. Then we will be happy \nfor the Senator to send up his amendment. Maybe we will not be happy \nwith the Senator's amendment, but we will be happy for the Senator to \noffer it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  Again, I express my appreciation for her accommodation. I know it is \ndifficult to accommodate each Senator who has a very busy schedule. I \nthank the managers for their accommodation to mine.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1229\n\n  I rise to support my colleague, Senator Kyl, as a cosponsor of his \namendment to the VA-HUD appropriations bill. I believe this is a very \ngood amendment, one that is entirely appropriate to this bill as it \ndirectly relates to a more fair distribution of Federal dollars for \nwater and wastewater infrastructure needs among the 50 States and \nterritories of our nation.\n  This amendment is simple--it will address a funding inequity in EPA \nfunding by applying the formula under the Safe Drinking Water Act \nrevolving loan fund to the Clean Water Act revolving loan fund for \nfiscal year 2002.\n  Why is this important?\n  For about 12 years, the EPA has managed a Clean Water State revolving \nloan fund for capitalization purposes to construct water infrastructure \nand related projects. The funds are distributed on a State-by-State \nbasis and utilized as seed money for State-administered loans for water \ninfrastructure needs. It operates as an important source of capital \nwith State flexibility to set their own priorities.\n  Back in 1996, the Safe Drinking Water Act was amended to establish a \nsimilar State revolving loan fund to address safe drinking water \ninfrastructure needs.\n  While these two operating loan funds are similar in intent, the Clean \nWater revolving loan fund utilizes outdated information in its \nallocation distributions. As my colleague, Senator Kyl, has noted, it's \nvery difficult to address the various States' growing needs when the \nallocation formula is based on information relevant to the 1970's.\n  I would like to describe how my State has changed since the 1970s. We \nhave grown from a very small State in the 1970s with two Members of \nCongress. As a result of the latest census, we are now a very medium to \na large State that will now have eight members of our congressional \ndelegation. Our State has grown, according to the 1990 to the 2000 \ncensus, in a 10-year period 40 percent--40-percent growth in a 10-year \nperiod.\n  There has been similar growth in other States in the West. New \nMexico, Colorado, California, and a number of other States have grown \nsignificantly--perhaps not percentage-wise as large as ours but \ncertainly in the case of numbers; Nevada has also experienced dramatic \ngrowth.\n  What Senator Kyl and I are arguing here is that there needs to be a \nreformulation to reflect demographic reality.\n  I want to point out what everyone who lives west of the Mississippi \nknows. Water is more precious than gold. Water is the limiting factor \nin the growth of our States in the West. Water is what will be and has \nbeen the cause of major disputes throughout the West.\n  I believe Mark Twain said that in the West whiskey is for drinking \nand water is for fighting. Mark Twain had it right because water is the \nkey factor in the ability of our States to sustain the growth and \nmaintain a lifestyle that allows people to choose to move to the West \nand have the kind of lifestyle that they deserve. The formula has not \nbeen updated to consider states with substantial growth or more recent \ndocumented needs established by the EPA in its own analyses.\n\n  In contrast, the similar Safe Drinking Water revolving loan fund has \nbeen operating by the designated allocation formula under the 1996 Act \nthat required the EPA to allocate funding according to the agency's \nDrinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey. While these two revolving \nfunds are substantially similar, only one uses updated and relevant \ndata. This is an unfortunate discrepancy and it should be fixed.\n  This amendment simply tries to fulfill the intended purpose of the \noriginal Clean Water Act by allocating important Federal dollars on a \nneeds-based system that is current and valid to the States' identified \npriorities.\n  Communities in my home State of Arizona have been frustrated by the \nformula distribution inequity as their water and wastewater needs \ncontinue to be underfunded and ignored. The Arizona State water \nauthority estimates it may have lost out on $250-300 million due to the \noversight in establishing a fair and updated formula. However, this is \nnot just about Arizona. It is about a majority of the States funded \nthrough the current Clean Water revolving loan fund distribution \nformula whom are facing the same disparities.\n  Unfortunately, the Clean Water Act has not been amended since 1987. \nWhile authorization for the act expired in 1990, the programs under act \nare continued by annual appropriations while the Congress continues to \nwork toward a comprehensive reauthorization.\n  In the meantime, Congress has circumvented the act by earmarking as \nmuch as 30 percent of the general funds available for water and \nwastewater needs for special interest projects through this \nappropriations bill. Many of these funded projects are not authorized \nin the Clean Water Act and do not abide by the funding distributions \nprocess identified in the act.\n  This continuing earmarking process is not a practice favored by State \nwater quality officials, State infrastructure financing officials, or \nby the EPA. Earmarking funds from the overall State revolving fund \ndecreases the amount available to other communities that desperately \nneed assistance. It undermines the intent of the State revolving loan \nfund; it does not allow States to determine their own priorities; and, \nit prolongs the wait for States to receive the necessary funds to \naddress their water needs.\n  In my review of the EPA section of this appropriations bill, I found \nthat one-fourth of the earmarks of the 180 earmarks included in the EPA \nsection are not targeted for States--but for\n\n[[Page S8646]]\n\nconsortiums, universities, or foundations. How is this abiding by the \nintent of the law?\n  While I disagree with the earmarking process and I hope that it \nchanges, I also understand that this amendment does not affect those \nprojects identified for funding in this bill under the current water \nand wastewater accounts. We did that, with all due respect, because we \nknew that if we affected any earmarking, we would remove whatever \nchance we might have of adoption of this amendment. What it will impact \nis the undesignated amounts of funding for the clean water revolving \nloan fund to ensure a more fair and equitable distribution for this \ncoming fiscal year. This is particularly important as this VA-HUD \nappropriations bill proposes to increase overall funding in this \naccount by $500 million, for a total of $1.35 billion.\n\n  With an estimated $300 billion needed over the next 20 years to fix \nour existing water systems and build new ones, we simply cannot allow \nthis inequity to continue.\n  EPA's guidelines stipulate that the intent of the revolving loan fund \nis:\n\n       To provide a basis for equal consideration of all eligible \n     water quality projects for state revolving fund funding.\n\n  Let's remedy this problem and fulfill the intent of this important \nact.\n  Mr. President, I would just like to mention my appreciation for \nSenator Kyl's efforts on this issue. As many of my colleagues may know, \nSenator Kyl's background in the legal profession was on issues of \nwater. I would put his credentials against those of anyone in this body \non this very important issue.\n  I already described earlier how important water is in the whole \nfuture of the western part of the United States, particularly those of \nus in the Southwest. Barry Goldwater, my predecessor, used to say quite \noften, only half humorously: ``We have so little water in Arizona, the \ntrees chase the dogs.'' We have not reached that point yet, but the \nfact is, what we do need, as in every situation where there have been \ndemographic changes--and in the Southwest and in the West there have \nbeen profound demographic changes, as we all know, since the 1970s and \nthe 1980s--we just need to upgrade and modernize this formula.\n  We are not asking for a special deal for Arizona. We are not asking \nfor a special deal for any State. We are simply asking--and we are not \neven affecting the present earmarking process, on which my views are \nwell known in this body--that an update year 2001 formula be \nimplemented so that everyone can receive funding according to the \ngreatest need, again, according to the guidelines that are stipulated, \n``to provide a basis for equal consideration of all eligible water \nquality projects for state revolving fund funding.''\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona for bringing forward what some view \nas an esoteric issue in some respects but a vital issue--a vital issue \nfor all of those States that are now not being treated on an equal \nbasis--of our water supplies and projects.\n  So I thank my colleague from Arizona and urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe amendment to the VA/HUD appropriations bill offered by Senator Kyl.\n  The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, of which I am \nthe new Chair, has jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act. Through the \nClean Water State Revolving Fund provisions of this act, Federal \nfunding is provided to communities throughout the Nation to protect \nwater quality. Senator Kyl's amendment would significantly alter the \nformula'' used in the ``SRF'' to allocate these federal funds among \nStates.\n  Last evening, in the debate related to arsenic, many Senators noted \nthe tremendous financial challenge that communities face in continuing \nto provide clean, affordable drinking water. It is important to \nrecognize that these communities face an equally tremendous challenge \nwhen it comes to keeping pace with the wastewater treatment, stormwater \nmanagement, and other types of water infrastructure they need to \nprotect water quality.\n  The Clean Water SRF was specifically designed to help communities \nmeet these water infrastructure needs. However, over the next 20 years, \nthe water infrastructure needs of our Nation are estimated to be as \nmuch as $1 trillion--$1 trillion. The current annual level of funding \nprovided through the SRF--averaging roughly $1 billion per year--comes \nnowhere near meeting needs of this magnitude.\n  Because these funds are so desperately needed by so many communities, \nthe Senate should proceed very cautiously when making changes to the \nClean Water SRF.\n  When I became the chair of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I stated that one of my top priorities was to craft \nlegislation to ensure that the Federal Government meets its \nresponsibility to assist communities in meeting their drinking water \nand wastewater infrastructure needs. Under the leadership of the now \nranking member, Senator Smith of New Hampshire, the committee has \nalready begun this process.\n  I am committed to continuing this effort, and I look forward to \nworking closely with Senator Smith, the chair and ranking member of our \nWater Subcommittee, and other members of the committee and the Senate \nas we move forward.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee will carefully consider a \nnumber of issues critical to meeting our national water infrastructure \nneeds as this legislation develops. Among these issues will be the \nsubject addressed by Senator Kyl's amendment--the allocation of money \nto States through the Clean Water SRF.\n  We will be thoroughly studying the current ``formula'' used for \nallocating Federal funds by this program and, if appropriate, we will \nmodify it to ensure it is fair and adequately serves the Nation.\n  As I mentioned previously, the tremendous water infrastructure needs \nfaced by our Nation--coupled with inadequacy of Federal resources \ncurrently available to help communities meet them--demands that we \nproceed cautiously.\n  I am concerned that changing the funding ``formula'' for the Clean \nWater SRF in an appropriations bill, as we rush to complete Senate \nbusiness before August recess, is not such a cautious approach.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Kyl amendment, \nand allow the Environment and Public Works Committee the opportunity to \ncraft legislation that reflects a carefully and thorough consideration \nof the solutions to our Nation's water tremendous infrastructure needs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the issue that my \ndistinguished colleague from Arizona has brought to the attention of \nthe Senate with his amendment, and that is the need to re-evaluate how \nwe distribute funding to the states under the Clean Water Revolving \nFund. The Senator is right. It appears that it has been a long time \nsince we took a hard look at where our most pressing infrastructure \nneeds are. And don't get me wrong, Montana looks like it would do very \nwell if Senator Kyl's amendment were to succeed.\n  But addressing the serious problems that exist with our Nation's \nwater and wastewater infrastructure is something that falls squarely \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks. This is an issue that needs the full time and attention of the \nauthorizing Committee. What is the most appropriate floor, or minimum \nshare for each state, because that's where Montana would fall. What is \nthe most appropriate ceiling? Again, I think this just is too important \nan issue to address in a short debate over an amendment to an \nappropriations bill. I understand that this is one of the issues \nChairman Jeffords plans to take up in the fall, and I will encourage \nhim to do that, because frankly, I agree with Senator Kyl that it's \nhigh time we took a look at these formulas to make sure we are spending \nour limited resources in the most efficient and effective way possible.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 1226, As Modified, To Amendment No. 1214\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, at this time I rise to offer an amendment. \nI have a modification to my amendment. I believe it is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1226, as modified to amendment No. 1214.\n\n\n[[Page S8647]]\n\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, No. 1226, as modified, is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To reduce by $5,000,000 amounts available for certain \nprojects funded by the Community Development Fund of the Department of \n    Housing and Urban Development and make the amount available for \n                     veterans claims adjudication)\n\n       On page 105, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. 428.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl, \nSenator Graham of Florida, and Senator Smith of New Hampshire be added \nas cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. At this time I understand it is the wish of the managers \nthat I lay aside this amendment and that we debate it following the \nvotes that will take place beginning at 1:55.\n  Mr. REID. I did not hear the request.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nbe laid aside until following the votes that will take place at 1:55.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1231\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains for \nboth sides on the Schumer amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 21 minutes 10 seconds; the \nopponents have 24 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Could you repeat that? The sponsor has how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 21 minutes 10 seconds; the \nopponents have 24 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will now speak on the Schumer amendment, \nand I will use such time as I might consume on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator may proceed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1231\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from New York brings an \namendment to this Chamber--certainly, I think, with the most sincere of \nintent--to set aside $15 million; in other words, to mandate the gun \nsurrender program that just a few weeks ago the Bush administration \nannounced it was terminating, largely because it does not work. So what \nI thought I would do, for the next few moments, is sketch for us the \nfacts about gun surrender programs over the last several years and why \nthey do not work.\n  As we know, there is no mandate in the law. President Clinton and \nSecretary Cuomo changed the description of the Public Housing Drug \nElimination Program to allow public housing authorities to make grants \navailable for gun surrender initiatives. It is interesting that of the \n1,000 housing authorities this change affected, only about 100 took \nadvantage of the program.\n  There is a peculiar reason they took advantage of the program. Very \nearly on, starting back in 1978, it became obvious gun surrender \nprograms were a great photo opportunity for local law enforcement and, \nin some instances, certain housing agencies or groups. Never mind that \nthey did nothing to deter crime. In fact, they were not taking off the \nstreets guns being used in crimes. It was an opportunity to get rid of \nsome old guns, some antiques, something that filled your closet that \nyour granddad had given you that might not be worth anything and you \nwanted to get rid of any way; and you did not know how to get rid of \nit; and along came local law enforcement that said: ``We are going to \nhave a gun surrender program.'' So you take a gun down to the police \nstation and get $50 or $100 or $150 for it.\n  The guns turned in belonged to people who least likely were involved \nin the commission of a crime. For example, senior citizens and spouses \nwho had inherited guns that may have been their husbands' who had \npassed away were the ones most often who came to sell their guns.\n  Some guns turned in were the cheap handguns purchased, as the Senator \nfrom Missouri mentioned, for the express purpose of selling them: You \ngo out on the street and buy a gun for $15 or $20 and sell it for $100. \nHey, let me tell you, folks are not stupid, they are going to play an \nadvantage if they can find one, and in many instances they did.\n  So let me give you a little history.\n  In 1978, when we first saw gun buyback programs, overall crime was \nnot significantly reduced in the 17-month period following the gun \nbuyback program in Baltimore, MD. I believe that was the first one, in \n1978. Who reports that? The Comptroller General of the United States.\n  Then we look at the 1992 Seattle gun surrender program. It too \nfailed. It did not reduce gun injuries, deaths, or crimes. It didn't \nsave anyone from being victimized by crime. But it made for a great \nphoto opportunity.\n  In 1996, the program that collected the greatest number of guns, as \nwas mentioned, was the Baltimore program. Yet the rate of gun killings \nrose 50 percent and gun assaults more than doubled while the program \nwas in effect. This was the largest gun surrender program ever \nimplemented, in terms of the number of guns purchased. Gun deaths shot \nup 50 percent. And assaults more than doubled.\n  If you want politics and you want publicity, then gun surrender \nprograms are great. You can show tables covered with 15- or 20-year-old \nguns that would never have been used in the commission of a crime. It \nis a great photo op.\n  In 1998, according to the National Institute of Justice looked at \nvarious crime fighting measures and asked, ``What doesn't work?'' Their \nanswer? Gun surrender programs. They failed to reduce violent crime in \neven two more cities: St. Louis, and Seattle.\n  Many of us who live part time in this city saw the publicity that \nwent on and the very good-faith effort the Washington, DC, police made \nin 1999 with\n\n[[Page S8648]]\n\ntheir gun surrender program. More than half of the 2,912 weapons bought \nby the District of Columbia police for $100 were 15 years of age or \nolder, according to the District of Columbia police themselves.\n  The Senator from New York knows as well as I do that guns used in \ncrimes are typically 9-millimeter or .38 caliber semiautomatic pistols. \nThose are the ones most often cited in crime reports that are used in \nthe commission of a crime. Such are not the guns collected by these \nprograms.\n  Gun surrender programs don't work. That is why the Bush \nadministration--the President, HUD Secretary Martinez--came forward and \nsaid: This is a bad use of scarce resources. If we are interested in \nmaking public housing safer--and we are--if we are interested in \ngetting drugs out of public housing--and we are--then the $15 million \nthe Senator from New York would waste on photo opportunities would \nbetter be used in law enforcement efforts within public housing and \nelsewhere.\n  What the Senator from Missouri, the ranking member of the \nappropriations subcommittee, has said is that within the current law, \nit is an option. In other words, if a housing agency wants to divert \nsome of its funds for a gun buyback, they can do so. But the reason \nnone of them do it is because they know it doesn't work. They know that \nfunds are limited, and they know that they can use their money \nelsewhere to more effectively improve the safety of the citizens who \nlive within those housing units and the community at large.\n  That is why gun surrender programs are on the wane today, are no \nlonger popular, unless you are interested in a photo op. The facts are \nout there. They don't work. In many instances, unless you have good law \nenforcement on the street and you have let the criminal know that if he \nuses a gun in the commission of a crime he is going to have to do time, \nthen the use of guns in the commission of a crime goes up. It has been \nproven in Baltimore. It is clearly true in Seattle. I don't think it \nchanged the statistics in Washington, DC.\n  We did get a lot of old guns and some antiques out of the closets of \nlaw-abiding citizens because it was a way for them to market them, in \nsome instances, for a great deal more than they might otherwise have \ngotten for them.\n  With that, I yield the floor and retain the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Senator Schumer's amendment would, if \naccepted, waste $15 million in taxpayer money on a program that has \nproved to be a failure. This amendment has more to do with partisan \npolitics than sound public policy. In my view, we should not spend even \none red cent of taxpayer money for such purposes.\n  Housing, Urban and Development Secretary Mel Martinez was right to \nterminate the gun buyback program. And he did so for a single, sound \nreason: such programs do not reduce crime. I will cite just a few of \nthe conclusions reached by those who have examined these programs.\n  First, ``overall crime was not significantly reduced in the 17-month \nperiod following the [Baltimore] buyback program.'' Report to the \nCongress by the Comptroller General of the United States, Handgun \nControl: Effectiveness and Costs, 2/6/78.\n  In addition, gun buyback programs may encourage gun thefts, with the \nGovernment serving, in effect, as a reliable fence for the stolen guns. \nSuch programs also give offenders a profitable way to dispose of \nweapons used in crimes. Dr. Philip J. Cook, criminologist at Duke \nUniversity.\n  Finally, another study found that ``[1992] Seattle buy-back program \nfailed to reduce significantly the frequency of firearms injuries, \ndeaths, or crimes.'' Callahan, et al., ``Money for Guns: Evaluation of \nthe Seattle Gun Buy-Back Program,'' Public Health Reports, July-August \n1994.\n  Thus, this debate should not be about gun politics. It should be \nabout our responsibility to spend the taxpayers' money wisely. If the \nsupporters of this amendment truly care about public safety, we should \nspend the $15 million dollars on hiring additional police officers to \npatrol high-crime public housing areas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. I think I have 21 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, it is always a pleasure to debate with my good \nfriend from Idaho, Senator Craig. He makes very good but not persuasive \narguments, at least in my opinion.\n  Let me say a couple things about this issue. First, we all know about \nmethods of proof. Senator Craig is citing statistics: Crime went up \nhere, gun use went up here while there was a buyback program. I could \nfind just as many localities where crime went down while there was a \nbuyback program.\n  The bottom line is, the buyback programs mainly occur in cities where \nthere is lots of other factors going on, and no one can prove one way \nor the other whether this works or doesn't work. You can't prove it \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n  Let's use commonsense logic. Commonsense logic is, if a gun is not in \nthe hands of a family, a person who doesn't want it, isn't our society \nlikely to have less gun violence? It is very hard to prove that is \nwrong.\n  Certainly, if you believe there is a moral imperative that everyone \nhave a gun, you are against this program. If you believe the way to \nreduce law enforcement is to give every man and woman and child a gun--\nthere are some who believe that--oppose this amendment. But if you \nbelieve gun owners have rights and Americans are entitled to have guns, \nbut there is also some danger to guns and that we should be careful, \nwhy not have a program that says: If you want--you are not being \ncompelled--if you want to bring your gun back in and get $50 for it, \nyou can. It is perfectly sensible and logical to think that works.\n  I don't want to oversell this program. It is not a panacea. We have \nnot put hundreds of millions of dollars in but merely 15. In the eyes \nof most people who should know, it has worked.\n  Let me quote the mayor of Houston in the State of Texas, hardly a \nState and a city known for its strong advocacy of gun control. Mayor \nLee Brown was the former police commissioner of New York City so he has \na great deal of law enforcement background:\n\n       Having spent my career in law enforcement, I recognize that \n     gun buybacks are a very effective way of reducing the number \n     of guns in circulation.\n\n  This has worked all over the country. In Lexington, KY, 1,517 guns \nwere purchased; Toledo, OH, 1,050; Atlanta, 838. We can talk about \ncriminals and kids going out and using the guns. What about accidents? \nIf a family doesn't want a gun in a home and doesn't know how to \ndispose of it, doesn't allowing them to go to their local police \nprecinct and have the gun bought back help?\n  Let's not debate theology here. I would be happy to debate theology, \nand I did with my good friend from Idaho in many different areas in \nterms of guns. But this is not a theological issue unless you are part \nof that small band who believe that the best thing that can happen to \nAmerica is everyone should have a gun. I don't. I am sort of agnostic. \nI don't think we should take away everybody's gun, and I don't think we \nshould give everybody a gun. I think we should let law-abiding people \nmake their own decisions. But the very logic that my good friend from \nIdaho uses: let people make their own decisions, is gainsaid by this \namendment.\n  Let's say somebody has bought a gun and wants to get rid of it. Why \nnot? I don't understand the logic of the opposition. I do understand \nthe opposition.\n  Let me say to my colleagues that the Bush administration, very \nquietly but really, has begun a campaign to roll back the moderate, \nsensible measures that we have had to keep guns out of the hands of \nchildren and criminals, not just in this issue. Attorney General \nAshcroft sent a letter to the NRA, where he said there had to be a \ncompelling State interest to have a gun control law. As a lawyer, we \nboth know that ``compelling State interest'' is next to impossible to \nprove. Many lawyers argue that under that theory the Brady law could be \nthrown out as unconstitutional, despite the fact that not a single \nperson has ever been shown to be legally deprived of a gun because of \nthe Brady law. Yet it has\n\n[[Page S8649]]\n\nkept hundreds of thousands of felons from buying them.\n\n  Then, amazingly enough--you know, we keep records on everything; the \nIRS keeps records; every agency keeps records--well, the FBI has kept \nrecords on gun purchases, as the ATF has, by gun dealers. Jim Kessler, \non my staff, a few years ago, found out something that changed the way \nwe think about gun control. He found that 50 percent of the guns used \nin crimes came from 1 percent of the dealers. Let me repeat that \nbecause it is an astounding finding. Fifty percent of the guns used in \ncrimes come from 1 percent of the dealers. When we found those numbers, \nI thought there was a real breakthrough because the NRA had always \nsaid, ``Don't pass new laws, enforce the existing laws.''\n  I, again, want to do something to reduce gun violence. And here we \nhad the opportunity to go after the 1 percent of the dealers who are \nputting guns, a hugely disproportionate amount of guns, into criminal \nhands. We could come down on them and not come down on all the others--\nthe very thing the NRA preaches, that most people who own and sell guns \nare law abiding was proven by this report and we could just come down \non the 1 percent. All of a sudden, the administration wants to destroy \nthe records so we can no longer come to 1 percent.\n  I will tell you what happened here. The administration stealthily has \nbeen moving to an extreme position on gun control. President Bush, when \nhe campaigned, did not take such positions, but that is where they are \nmoving. On issue after issue after issue, that has happened. That is \nwhy this buyback proposal, modest as it was, was taken out of the HUD-\nVA appropriation, not because they had done exhaustive studies about \nwhether it works or not, not because we could not afford it; these are \nno new dollars; they come out of an existing program, but because that \nnarrow band of ideologues, way out of the mainstream, the kind of \npeople who think many of our brave law enforcement people are black-\nbooted thugs, it was said, put pressure on the administration to move \nway over. Hence, they removed this provision.\n  Again, I say to my colleagues, anyone who tells you absolutely that \nthis program doesn't work doesn't have the statistics. Conversely, \nanyone who tells you we can prove beyond any doubt that it does work is \nalso overselling because they don't have the statistics either, and I \ndon't want to claim that. But by simple logic, particularly in inner \ncities where we know there are too many guns, giving people an \nincentive to sell the gun back, an unwanted gun, it is very hard to \ndisagree that it would reduce the amount of accidents caused in the \nhome by guns and the amount of crime caused by kids and criminals with \nguns.\n  So if you want to brandish your ideological sword, show the NRA that \nyou are with them all the way, vote against this amendment. If you want \nto reduce crime or have a good chance of doing it, get some very \ndangerous things out of the hands of those who don't want them, vote \nfor this amendment.\n  This is hardly the most important issue on gun control we will \ndebate. I am amazed it has brought such opposition, such attention, and \nsuch focus from the administration. But I do believe, with all due \nrespect to my colleague from Idaho, that the motivation to remove this \namendment is not people's safety, but an ideology that says everybody, \neverybody, everybody should have a gun, and that makes America a better \nplace.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will use such time as I might consume \nwithin our time limitation. I, too, enjoy engaging my colleague from \nNew York on this issue. The Senator from New York, as I said while he \nwas not on the floor, does, I think, bring this amendment with good \nintent. He has been an outspoken advocate of gun control and wants to \neliminate crime in which guns are used. I certainly want to eliminate \nguns crime. We all do.\n  Let me suggest to you today that while the Senator from New York \nmight like to engage me in a theological debate, this isn't one. This \ndebate is over $15 million and how it can best be used in housing \nauthorities to combat crime and drug use.\n  The committee has worked its will. They have said it is an option. If \nyou want to do a gun surrender program, it is an option but it is not \nmandatory.\n  Let me tell you one reason why.\n  I think the Senator from New York would find this an interesting fact \nbecause it comes from New York City. If I may have the attention of the \nSenator from New York, I found this a fascinating problem because what \nis happening out there is that somebody is gaming a bad program.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. When the Senator said this was an option before the \namendment, it was an option for the administration. As I understand it, \nit would not be an option in the New York City Housing Authority, or \nany housing authority that got $20 million out of this program; they \nwould not be allowed to take $1 million and set that aside for a \nbuyback program. The administration has the option of not allowing \nthese funds for this purpose under the present statute. If the Senator \nwill answer that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. We have the chairman of the subcommittee on the floor. I \nhave not read the specifics of the provision within the appropriation. \nBut I was told by the ranking member that housing authorities, under \nthis current legislation, have the option, if they choose, to do a gun \nbuyback. Is that accurate or inaccurate? I don't want to misstate the \nreality of the legislation.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I may answer----\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on \nVA-HUD if that flexibility exists within the law. Does the chairman \nknow that?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Let me advise the Senator what my staff told me. I \nmight also need a moment for additional clarification.\n  As I understand the legislation, there is currently an option. What \nthe Schumer amendment does is do a setaside, am I correct?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does that clarify it?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes. Therefore, the statement I made was accurate. I said \nthat within the law there is an option to use the money, if an \nauthority wishes to, for the purpose of a gun buyback. Is that an \ninaccurate statement?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield, it is true, it is an option. \nAs I understand it----\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is all I need to have.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I might finish.\n  Mr. CRAIG. On your time only.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to answer on \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The option has been foreclosed by the administration. \nThey said they would not spend any of this money and not allow the \nhousing authorities to spend any of this money for a buyback program. \nThat is what has happened. It would not be available to the housing \nauthority, even though in the law it is an option. The administration \nsets out regulations, and the buyback program would not be part of the \nregulation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I think that is appropriate. I am not going to disagree \nwith the Senator from New York on that proviso, because what is in the \nlaw today was done by the Clinton administration and not a mandate of \nthe Congress itself.\n  President Clinton and Secretary Cuomo did that by regulatory change. \nSo there is flexibility. What is true in the law, which we are dealing \nwith in this Chamber, is the option. The Schumer amendment would \nmandate a specific amount of money to be used for that purpose.\n  Let me quote an article I found most fascinating from the New York \nDaily News Online, July 28, 2000:\n\n       A gun buyback program to get illegal weapons off the \n     streets had to be altered yesterday after a stampede of court \n     officers [that is, law enforcement officers] tried to cash \n     in. Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes ordered changes \n     in the initiative when he found out that court officers--some \n     of them in uniform--were handing in their old .38 caliber \n     service revolvers. Because the program had pulled in only \n     about 200 guns since the one-month window began on July 1, \n     Hynes upped the reward on Monday from $100 to $250 per gun.\n\n\n[[Page S8650]]\n\n\n  In other words, it was not working, a point that has been driven home \nnumerous times. The Senator from New York says: It feels good. So let \nus dump $15 million because it feels good, while we all know it is a \nwhale of a photo-op.\n  Here is what happened, and this is a quote from the district \nattorney:\n\n       We had a surge last night of about 100 guns and they all \n     seemed to be .38 [caliber] service revolvers.\n\n  According to the article:\n\n       One court officer collected $1,500 by turning in six guns.\n\n  And even though people were gaming the system, officials had to pay \nfor the guns because they had made the offer. The point is----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me finish.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me finish my thought, and then I will be happy to give \nthe Senator his time to debate.\n  The reality is, it confirms the point that the program gets gamed. In \n1978, in Baltimore, it did not work. Crime went up. In this city over \n2,000 guns were purchased, many of them 15 years of age and older. They \nare not the current weapon used on the street in street crime.\n  If a family finds a gun on their hands which they inherited and they \ndo not know what to do with it, they could take it down to the local \npolice department and hand it in. They could do that. They do not have \nto be paid to get rid of a gun. They can hand it in or they can take it \ndown to a pawn shop and get a little money.\n  I find this a fascinating quote, and I think the Senator from New \nYork will find it fascinating also. The Boston Globe, Tuesday October \n24, 2000:\n\n       The threat was gun violence--\n\n  And I must say the threat today is still gun violence.\n\n     the stakes, the lives of urban youth.\n\n  The stakes today, in many instances, the lives of urban youth. Both \nthe Senator from New York and I are concerned about that.\n  The image was a body face down in blood and the sound was the wail of \nsirens, funeral hymns, and more gunfire. Amid the violence that gripped \nurban centers nationwide in the 1990s, America's call to stop the \nviolence was a cry of civic activism: Everybody turn in your guns.\n  It caught on with the made-for-television popularity. Guns for money. \nGuns for food. Guns for concert tickets. Guns for therapy, for shopping \ntrips, and in one town in Illinois, firearms for a free table dance at \na strip club.\n  In this case, the offer was and I quote\n\n       Buns for Guns. Around the country and in Boston, gun \n     buybacks spurred intense publicity. Private sponsors poured \n     money into the programs. Led by groups Citizens for Safety, \n     Boston collected 2,800 guns in four years.\n       With gun violence again on the rise this year--\n\n  That is the year 2000--\n\n     the cry to bring back the buyback is growing among some \n     Boston activists. But almost five years after the last goods-\n     for-guns event, crime specialists and some police officials \n     are warning against them, saying gun buybacks were and are \n     among the least effective tools for public safety.\n       Studies of gun buybacks, including a Harvard analysis --\n\n  And I know the Senator from New York says statistics do not matter. \nThis is just a feel good amendment, but we are talking about $15 \nmillion in taxpayer money\n\n     of Boston's program, say unanimously that the programs don't \n     work. In an interview yesterday, Boston Police Commissioner \n     Paul F. Evans said that in retrospect, buybacks failed to \n     produce the impact many had hoped for or expected.\n\n  I could go on to quote more of the Boston Globe article. Whether it \nis food for guns, tickets for guns, or money for guns, it did not work. \nThat is why the Bush administration has said it is a bad use of money. \nI do not care if one feels good or feels bad, or one does not want to \nbelieve in the statistics that come from Harvard University, the \nreality is we have to get at crime in our housing and it is not done by \nthrowing $15 million at a program that flat out does not work.\n  If someone has an old gun in their closet and they want to get it out \nof the hands of anybody in their family, take it to the police \ndepartment and give it to them. They do not have to be paid, or they \ncould take it to a pawn shop and get 5 or 10 bucks maybe.\n  The problem is that much of what we were buying for $100 to $250 was \nnot pawnable because it was old, it was antique, and it was \nnonfunctional. As the Senator from New York says, though, if it feels \ngood, then maybe we ought to do it. We should not do it for $15 \nmillion, not when our budgets are tight and not when we are scrambling \nover where to get money to do all other kinds of programs that are \nimportant to the American people.\n  I do not always agree with Harvard, but Harvard has studied the \nprogram in Boston and they say it does not work. Law enforcement says \nit does not work and ought not be used. My guess is, that is why \nPresident Bush and Secretary Martinez said, let's don't do it anymore. \nIt is not a philosophical or evangelical reason. The reality is: It \ndoes not work.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho is trying to \noversell his point. He says it does not work. He cited one anecdote \nfrom a police commissioner in Boston. Then he talked about the Brooklyn \nprogram. And then he talked about food and theater tickets. That is \nlike saying we ought to scrap all automobiles because the Edsel did not \nwork.\n  We are not talking about those programs. We are not talking about \n$100; we are not talking about $250; and we are not talking about \ntheater tickets. We are not talking about any of those. We are not even \ntalking about law enforcement unless they live in a public housing \nproject, and I do not think many do. We are talking about a program \nthat housing authorities have run with great success. Again, I am not \ngoing to cite statistics.\n  My friend from Idaho has some police saying this is ``feel good.'' \nNo, this is not feel good. It is life and death.\n  I am trying to be honest in saying neither he nor I can prove whether \nthese programs affect the statistics. It cannot be proven because there \nis no control. We do not have two identical cities or two identical \nhousing projects, one that had the program and one that did not.\n  I do not have to oversell my case because it is such a strong case. \nThe strong case is a simple case, and that is when guns are off the \nstreets and not in unwanted hands, our society is likely to be safer.\n  I go back to the argument I made before. There are some--maybe my \nfriend from Idaho--who do not believe that, but there are some who \nbelieve the more guns people have the better. Most people, most \nAmericans, most gun owners do not believe that.\n  As for his argument about old guns being turned in, the Senator is an \nexpert on law enforcement. Old guns are more dangerous. They misfire \nmore frequently; they fire inaccurately more frequently. And the \nprogram, as it is set up, is not supposed to give a reward for a gun \nthat does not work but only those that do. Again, more strawman \narguments, maybe about some programs somewhere that did not work, but \nthis program has.\n  We cannot cite the name and case, but someone is alive today because \nof this program. Probably more than one person is alive because of this \nprogram.\n  I ask my colleagues not to get wrapped up in the whole ideological \nfervor here; rather, to commonsense arguments, not some program about \nmovies for guns and not about some program about $250 for guns but \nabout this program which has a track record. Ask housing authorities \nthroughout the country and law enforcement people in those housing \nauthorities throughout the country if they\n  Because of this administration's assault on rational laws that keep \nguns out of the hands of criminals, they took it out. It would be a lot \nbetter for our society if we put it back.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If neither side yields time, \ntime will be charged equally against both sides.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 4 minutes 24 \nseconds remaining; the Senator from New York has 6 minutes 43 seconds \nremaining. Time will be taken from both sides until someone yields \ntime.\n\n[[Page S8651]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friends, if they do not wish to use all their \ntime, they can yield it back. Senator Kyl can speak on his amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be happy--I just made eye contact \nwith my friend from Idaho--to yield back my time. I believe he will \nyield back his, and we will vote at 1:55 p.m.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that some articles \nand some of those terrible statistics from different gun buyback \nprograms be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 2, 1994]\n\n                Add Gun Buybacks to the Public Wish List\n\n                           (By Erik Eckholm)\n\n       It may have started as a holiday exercise in wishful \n     thinking. But last week, as a ``toys for guns'' exchange in \n     Manhattan's embattled Washington Heights continued to draw in \n     scores of weapons each day, grizzled police veterans were \n     becoming believers and even the National Association for the \n     Advancement of Colored People had joined in, laying plans to \n     sponsor similar programs in other cities.\n       Before Christmas, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelley had \n     compared the new program to chicken soup: can't do any harm. \n     But his tone changed as the guns poured in in response to a \n     local businessman's offer of a $100 Toys-R-Us gift \n     certificate for each surrendered weapon, on top of $75 in \n     cash offered from an existing city gun-purchase program. \n     ``I'm converted,'' the Police Commissioner told reporters. \n     ``Sometimes chicken soup works.''\n       The N.A.A.C.P. saw the buoyant response as a glimmer of \n     sanity in a culture of urban violence that is especially \n     devastating to blacks. Other private sponsors have gotten on \n     board, with makers and sellers of athletic shoes and even \n     Dial-A-Mattress pledging gift certificates for their \n     products. And there was talk in Congress of tax breaks for \n     corporations that contribute.\n       Gun-purchase programs have been tried over the years in \n     many cities, with varied results. In New York City, the \n     standing cash-for-guns program had yielded modest numbers of \n     guns; somehow, this new combination of toys, Christmas, \n     private leadership, tabloid frenzy and a general desperation \n     about gunfire has worked magic, drawing in some 550 guns in \n     the first eight days of the program, which began Dec. 22.\n       In Dallas, too, an offer of coveted goods--tickets to \n     Cowboys games--seemed to pull in more weapons than cash \n     alone. Still, probably the most spectacular response yet to \n     any gun buying program involved cash only. In St. Louis in \n     the fall of 1991, the police over a one-month period \n     collected 7,547 guns by offering $50 for handguns and $25 for \n     rifles. But the program was not continued, a St. Louis police \n     official said last week, for one reason: money. The cost had \n     been $351,000, and no police department can sustain that \n     level of spending for long.\n       Corporate donations may help support the new programs, but \n     the question of costs and benefits remains. It is easy to be \n     skeptical. After all, what difference does it make to melt \n     down a few thousand guns in a country owning 200 million of \n     them? And nobody thinks criminals are selling off the tools \n     of their trade.\n       Buyback proponents point instead to more modest possible \n     benefits. Fewer guns in dresser drawers, they say, may mean \n     fewer accidental shootings, fewer crimes of passion, fewer \n     guns stolen for later use in crime and reduced chances of \n     teenagers grabbing household weapons to settle scores. \n     ``Taking guns out of circulation is a good thing in itself,'' \n     said Jeffery Y. Muchnick, legislative director of the \n     Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\n       But some criminologists are unenthusiastic about gun \n     purchase programs, arguing that resources could be better \n     spent and warning about possible unintended consequences.\n       Lawrence W. Sherman, a professor at the University of \n     Maryland and president of the Crime Control Institute, said \n     gun buybacks would have to be coupled with a national ban on \n     new sales of handguns, or at least of the semiautomatic \n     pistols wreaking the most havoc, to do any good over the long \n     term. ``Otherwise,'' he said, ``taking guns out of \n     circulation in the face of constant market demand unwittingly \n     subsidizes the gun industry.''\n       Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy at Duke \n     University, studies the economics of street guns and warns \n     that the entry of a major new gun buyer, albeit the police \n     department, can have unforeseen effects.\n       ``You can't see this as exempt from normal market \n     processes,'' he said. Between vouchers and cash, a person \n     could get $175 for a gun last week in New York, well above \n     the retail price of many new handguns. Dr. Cook says buyback \n     programs may encourage gun thefts, with government serving, \n     in effect, as a reliable fence. Such programs also give \n     offenders a profitable way to dispose of weapons used in \n     crimes, he said.\n       On the positive side, Dr. Cook said that if a sustained \n     gun-purchase program were to succeed in raising the floor \n     price for privately traded guns in a community, some teenager \n     seeking illegal guns could be priced out of the market. But \n     this would be achieved at enormous expense, he added, raising \n     questions about the best use of resources. In New York City, \n     at least, where restrictive laws have already prompted black \n     market prices of $250 to $300 for pistols retailing in the \n     South for $39, and prices of $500 or more for higher-quality \n     weapons, that floor would have to be quite high to seriously \n     alter the market.\n       At best, a gun-purchase program nibbles at the edges of gun \n     violence. ``The central problem of criminal justice is not \n     just to get the guns off the street, but to get the gunmen \n     off the street,'' said Thomas Repetto, a former police \n     officer and head of the private Citizen's Crime Commission in \n     New York. He calls for more aggressive enforcement of the gun \n     laws, using specially trained gun squads to identify and \n     arrest gun carriers, drawing on knowledge gleaned by \n     community police officers.\n       Still, whatever their weak points, buybacks are here and \n     happening. Even skeptics have to appreciate their symbolic \n     value in dispirited neighborhoods; responses like the one \n     elicited in Washington Heights suggest that people have had \n     it with senseless killings. ``You work on many fronts at \n     once,'' Mr. Repetto said, ``What's most impressive about \n     Washington Heights is the outpouring of community sentiment \n     against guns. That's even more impressive than the numbers of \n     guns turned in.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Oct. 24, 2000]\n\n            Specialists Cool on Calls to Revive Gun Buybacks\n\n                          (By Francie Latour)\n\n       The threat was gun violence. The stakes, the lives of urban \n     youth. The image was a body face-down in blood and the sound \n     was a wail of sirens, funeral hymns, and more gunfire.\n       Amid the violence that gripped urban centers nationwide in \n     the 1990s, America's call to stop the violence was a cry of \n     civic activism: Everybody turn in your guns.\n       It caught on with made-for-television popularity.\n       Guns for money. Guns for food. Guns for concert tickets. \n     Guns for therapy, for shopping trips, and in one town in \n     Illinois, firearms for a free table dance at a strip club: \n     Buns for Guns.\n       Around the country and in Boston, gun buybacks spurred \n     intense publicity. Police unveiled bins of guns. Private \n     sponsors poured money into the programs. Led by the group \n     Citizens for Safety, Boston collected 2,800 guns in four \n     years.\n       With gun violence again on the rise this year, the cry to \n     bring back the buyback is growing among some Boston \n     activists. But almost five years after the last goods-for-\n     guns event, crime specialists and some police officials are \n     warning against them, saying buybacks were--and are--among \n     the least effective tools for public safety.\n       Studies of gun buybacks, including a Harvard analysis of \n     Boston's program, say unanimously that the programs don't \n     work. In an interview yesterday, Boston Police commissioner \n     Paul F. Evans said that in retrospect, buybacks failed to \n     produce the impact many had hoped for or expected.\n       And despite Mayor Thomas M. Menino's appearance on the \n     White House lawn last year, where he and other mayors landed \n     President Clinton's $15 million federal program to fund \n     buybacks through local housing authorities, the city has yet \n     to take advantage of its share of that money and is unlikely \n     to do so.\n       ``We'll never know the impact of taking even one gun off \n     the street in terms of how many lives that act could have \n     saved,'' Evans said yesterday. ``But you have to step back \n     and analyze the bottom-line results. We found the \n     neighborhoods where we needed the guns to come in were the \n     neighborhoods that brought in the fewest guns.''\n       A series of studies published by the Washington D.C.-based \n     Police Executive Research Forum offers a bleak analysis.\n       In cities such as St. Louis and Seattle, surveys of buyback \n     participants showed that a significant minority planned on \n     using the money to buy a new gun. In St. Louis, the surveys \n     showed that those who had been arrested at least twice were \n     three times as likely as law-abiding citizens to say they \n     would buy a new weapon; 18- to 34-year-olds were 10 times \n     more likely than older participants to say they would do so.\n       According to a study of Boston's 1993 and 1994 gun buybacks \n     by Harvard criminologist David Kennedy, few buyback guns were \n     the semiautomatic pistols used in crimes. Nearly 75 percent \n     of the guns were made before 1968, with some qualifying as \n     museum pieces.\n       That was the case as recently as April, when Springfield \n     conducted a gun buyback using the federal funds. Malden and \n     Worcester have also participated in the federally funded \n     buybacks, which started last fall.\n       A spokesman for the Springfield Housing Authority, Raymond \n     Berry, said the city's Police Department took 287 guns off \n     the street. They included some handguns, but no assault \n     weapons, and some guns were donated to the Springfield Armory \n     National Historic Firearms Museum.\n       The Boston Housing Authority said this week it could spend \n     up to $20,000 from its drug prevention funding to coordinate \n     its own buyback. According to HUD, the federal government \n     would provide $43 for every $100 the city uses toward the \n     program. In the past, the city has paid $50 per gun.\n\n[[Page S8652]]\n\n       Some Boston Activists, including the gang-intervention \n     group Gangpeace and former members of Citizens for Safety, \n     have said that with gun violence on the rise, it is time to \n     take advantage of the federal money for a program that, at \n     the very least , offers residents a safe way to get rid of \n     unwanted handguns.\n       ``I think Boston is making a mistake by not reinstituting \n     the buybacks that relieved our streets of almost 3,000 \n     firearms,'' said Lew Dabney, who participated in buybacks \n     from 1993 to 1996.\n       The payoff from buybacks was not just in removing guns from \n     homes, Dabney argued, but in the way it empowered residents \n     to take action against gun violence. It allowed ordinary \n     volunteers to become civic heroes, broke down racial \n     barriers, and created memorable images such as that of \n     author/activist Michael Patrick McDonald coaxing teens to \n     turn over firearms.\n       According to HUD, the national buyback program has \n     recovered 21,600 guns from 95 public housing developments.\n       But a spokeswoman for the BHA said investments in youth \n     activities, community policing, and drug intervention were \n     more cost-effective ways to reduce violence.\n       Even of BHA wanted to initiate a program, spokeswoman Lydia \n     Agro said, it could not do so without the Police Department.\n       Yesterday, Commissioner Evans said he had discussed the \n     buybacks with BHA oficials, but none was planned so far.\n       ``I wouldn't rule another buyback out, ``Evans said. But \n     with the limited resources we have, and the money and man \n     hours in setting up a buyback, you have to ask what is the \n     value?''\n       Next to none, according to Kennedy, who authored the \n     Harvard study.\n       ``I don't think anybody who's looked at buybacks in my \n     detail thinks they have very much impact,'' Kennedy said.\n       On the one hand, he said, the buybacks offer a civic \n     function akin to garbage disposal, to help people remove \n     unwanted guns they are too afraid to handle.\n       But the cost of police departments can be considerable, \n     from staffing checkpoints and overtime costs to ballistics \n     testing and disposing of the guns.\n       The decision to pump $15 million into a national buyback \n     comes two years after a 1997 study commissioned by the \n     Justice Department called buybacks the lest effective use of \n     crime control dollars.\n       ``I think the best conclusion to draw is that the federal \n     HUD buyback program will be a waste of money,'' said Lawrence \n     Sherman, a criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania \n     who authorized the Justice Department study. ``The problem \n     is, there is still this wonderful idea of one life at a time, \n     one gun at a time, that you can associate with these \n     programs. There's an emotional aspect to crime prevention \n     that has nothing to do with the evidence about whether they \n     work or don't work.''\n\n               [From the National Review, June 15, 2000]\n\n  The Madness of Gun Buybacks--Andrew Cuomo's Policy is Full of Holes\n\n             (By Dave Kopel, of the Independent Institute)\n\n       Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo held a press conference last \n     week to announce his success in paying Americans not to \n     exercise their constitutional rights. Although Congress never \n     appropriated money for the project, Cuomo has used federal \n     tax dollars to conduct a ``BuyBack America'' program, which \n     Cuomo says has claimed more than 10,000 guns in recent weeks.\n       The program isn't really a ``buyback.'' Since Cuomo's \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development didn't sell the \n     guns in the first place, it can't buy them ``back.'' Nor will \n     the program contribute anything to public safety.\n       A criminal, for whom a gun is a tool of the trade, is \n     unlikely to sell his tool for $50. Instead, the typical \n     sellers in a ``buyback'' are the widows of hunters, other \n     older people, or other non-dangerous types--rather than \n     teenage gangsters who have suddenly decided to abandon a life \n     of violence.\n       Because most people who surrender their guns are very \n     unlikely to commit a violent gun crime, the public safety \n     benefit of a buyback, if any, must lie in reducing the supply \n     of guns which can be stolen, or in removing a potential \n     suicide instrument. But the buyback doesn't even provide much \n     in the way of disarmament: a study of a gun buybacks in \n     Seattle reported that sixty-six percent of sellers had \n     another gun that they did not surrender. Indeed, three \n     percent of gun sellers said they would use the money to buy \n     another gun, or would donate the proceeds to the National \n     Rifle Association. [Charles M. Callahan, et al., Money for \n     Guns: Evaluation of the Seattle Gun Buy-Back Program 84 PUB. \n     HEALTH REP. 474 (1994).]\n       Moreover, the guns sold at buybacks are often old or \n     defective. This shouldn't be surprising; a rational person \n     with a gun worth more than $50 would sell the gun at a gun \n     store for a fair price, rather than giving it to the \n     government for $50.\n       Unsurprisingly, the social science evidence shows that \n     buybacks have absolutely no positive effect in reducing gun \n     crime, gun accidents, or any other form of gun misuse. The \n     research is detailed is Under Fire: gun Buybacks, \n     Exchanges and Amnesty Programs, a book published by the \n     D.C.-based Police Foundation (a think tank for big-city \n     police chiefs).\n       The money wasted on the Cuomo buyback came from a Drug \n     Elimination Grant Program. Although Congress gave HUD money \n     for the battle against drugs (which are illegal), Cuomo used \n     the money to get rid of guns, which are not only legal, but \n     are specifically protected by the Second Amendment and by \n     forty-four state constitutions.\n       Why is so much energy invested in buybacks by the anti-gun \n     forces? One reason is that it's a path of relatively little \n     resistance. Gunowners may fight against efforts to take their \n     guns, but they are indifferent to the government buying guns \n     from other people.\n       Second, buybacks can be initiated without legislative \n     approval, as long as there's an executive branch official, \n     like Cuomo, willing to spend tax money ``creatively'' or \n     unlawfully.\n       More importantly, anti-gun activists really do believe that \n     guns are inherently evil. The people who want the government \n     to buy and destroy guns enjoy the same satisfaction that \n     others have enjoyed at book burnings, or at the \n     prohibitionists' rally where whiskey is poured into the \n     river. From the destroyers' viewpoint, there's no need to \n     wait for social science to find benefits from the \n     destruction. The destruction of the wicked object is good in \n     itself.\n       In a free country, destructionists have every right to \n     their own opinions, including opinions that paying other \n     people to stop exercising constitutional rights is a good \n     idea. But it's hard to balance the motives of a politician \n     who claims not to be against law-abiding citizens owning \n     guns--and then takes satisfaction every time a citizen \n     surrenders her firearms to the government to be melted into a \n     slab of useless metal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the New York Daily News, July 28, 2000]\n\n              Gun Buy-Back Backfires When Officers Cash In\n\n                           (By Mike Claffey)\n\n       A gun buy-back program to get illegal weapons off the \n     streets had to be altered yesterday after a stampede of court \n     officers tried to cash in.\n       Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes ordered changes in \n     the initiative when he found out that court officers--some of \n     them in uniform--were handing in their old .38-caliber \n     service revolvers.\n       Because the program had pulled in only about 200 guns since \n     the one-month window began July 1, Hynes upped the reward on \n     Monday from $100 to $250 per gun.\n       ``We had a surge last night of about 100 guns and they all \n     seem to be .38 service revolvers,'' said a source in the \n     prosecutor's office.\n       One court officer collected $1,500 by turning in six guns.\n       ``This is a program with good intentions to get illegal \n     guns off the street and shouldn't be bastardized by people \n     looking for a quick buck,'' said Hynes' spokesman, Kevin \n     Davitt.\n       ``We're going to be contacting those people who abused the \n     program and ask for our money back,'' Davitt said.\n       But a spokesman for the court system, David Bookstaver, \n     said it is not clear that the officers can be forced to do \n     that.\n       ``District Attorney Hynes has indicated that this is really \n     not in the spirit of what the program was designed for,'' \n     Bookstaver said.\n       But he added that court officials `` have no authority'' to \n     tell the officers to give the money back.\n       He said, however, that word was going out yesterday that \n     court officers can no longer participate.\n       Some court officers in Brooklyn were upset that Hynes had \n     forbidden them from participating in the buy-back offer. The \n     officers were allowed to keep their revolvers after they were \n     issued 9-mm. semiautomatics last year.\n       ``I have the flyer right here and it says, `Any working \n     handgun, sawed-off shotgun or assault rifle. No questions \n     asked.' '' said Bob Patelli a Senior Court Officers \n     Association delegate at Brooklyn Supreme Court.\n       ``If the DA sees fit to discontinue the program, fine. But \n     he's bound legally to pay for the guns he's already taken.''\n       Patelli added that the program was achieving its goal of \n     getting extra guns out of circulation.\n       ``It gets the gun off the street instead of leaving it is a \n     closet where children or a burglar could find them,'' he \n     said.\n       Last year, 659 firearms were turned in for $100 each. The \n     money comes from drug forfeiture funds, Davitt said.\n       ``We thought that perhaps $100 was not meeting the value \n     that some people place on these weapons,'' he said.\n       To be turned in, guns must be wrapped in brown paper and \n     can be taken to any Brooklyn precinct house. If the gun is \n     deemed operable, the desk officer is supposed to give the \n     person a pink voucher that can be redeemed at the district \n     attorney's office at 350 Jay St.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

I apologize for any confusion that might have caused.\n  I do think it has caused some confusion because I am in receipt of \none document which I understand has been circulated to some Members of \nthe majority that criticizes the amendment in two primary ways, the \nfirst of which is a suggestion that this amendment uses the same \nformula as used in the drinking water section of the bill. I suspect \nthe citing of the section might have created some of that confusion.\n  It has been clear from the outset, as I have described this over and \nover and I went through the description with the Senator from Virginia, \nthat the whole point of this amendment is to use a formula which is \nbased upon a needs survey established by the Environmental Protection \nAgency relating to wastewater treatment. I pointed out that there are \ntwo such needs-based surveys: One relates to drinking water; one \nrelates to wastewater.\n  Obviously, the drinking water needs survey should relate to drinking \nwater. That is exactly what the law provides. That is the survey that \nis used for the formula for drinking water. By the same token, the \nwastewater needs survey should apply to wastewater, but it does not. \nThe law today has a different formula and it is very difficult to \nunderstand the origins. As near as anybody can figure out, it relates \nto a construction grants program that was in existence in the 1970s. It \nhas nothing to do with this needs survey.\n  We say, just as we should have a needs survey by EPA driving the \ndecisions for drinking water, which we do, we should have a similar \nkind of formula for wastewater. The wastewater formula is not based on \nthe drinking water needs survey, it is based on the wastewater needs \nsurvey.\n  I note, in this document that has been circulated at least among some \nMembers of the majority, that the criticism is we should not have the \nsame formula apply to drinking water apply to wastewater. It does not. \nTo the extent there was confusion because one of the sections was \nmiscited in the amendment, I apologize for that, again. I thank the \nSenator from Maryland for allowing me to make that correction.\n  We are talking about two different needs surveys, two different \nformulas. We simply want the type of needs survey EPA conducts to apply \nto the formula in this case.\n  The second item I want to point out about the document is a complete \nerror in one of its comments. I quote from this document:\n\n       A number of other States, for example, Ohio, Illinois, \n     Florida, Indiana, and New Jersey, would receive reduced \n     allocations.\n\n  I assure all my colleagues from those States that is not only true, \nbut the reality is that the States cited are among the States that \nreceive the highest benefits of the formula change--Ohio, Illinois, \nFlorida, Indiana, and New Jersey. In fact, I think they are the \nhighest. Let me go through the numbers precisely.\n  For the State of Ohio, it would today receive $76,845,000. Under the \nformula, the pending amendment, it would receive $78,423,000. The net \nincrease is $3,577,000, when you take the earmarks into account.\n  For the State of Illinois, which I think receives the highest \nbenefit--I confess to the Presiding Officer, I do not know why Illinois \nwould have been so shortchanged in the past, but I appreciate his \nwillingness to cosponsor the amendment because of the clear \ndiscrepancy--under the current allocation, the State of Illinois would \nreceive $61,735,000. Under the pending amendment, Illinois would \nreceive $108 million, which is a net gain of $48,764,000, again taking \ninto account the $2.5 million earmarks. That is an increase from $61 to \n$108 million. The next State cited is Florida. Florida goes from $46 \nmillion to $55 million; Indiana goes from $32 million to $50 million; \nNew Jersey goes from $55 million to almost $75 million.\n\n  This document floating around titled ``Comments on Kyl Amendment,'' \nis not only in error; it is almost 180 degrees off. I can't explain why \nanyone would make this conclusion. The miscitation of the section \nnumber has nothing to do with these numbers. Somebody has grossly \nmisunderstood the amendment, misunderstood the charts or the formula, \nor in some other way deliberately misstated the facts.\n  I say to my Democratic colleagues who might have received this \ndocument, ``Comments on Kyl Amendment,'' this page-and-a-half document \nis wrong. It is wrong in the first half because we are not using the \nsame formula as the safe drinking water formula. And it is wrong in the \nsecond half, for what reason I don't know, but it is grossly wrong. It \ncould not be more wrong with respect to the States it claims are \nreceiving reductions. Those States happen to be the States receiving \nthe largest increases.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues who were not here for the earlier \npart of the debate, let me explain what we are talking about while I am \nwaiting for\n\n[[Page S8654]]\n\nSenator Fitzgerald, a cosponsor of the amendment. The bill we are \ndebating deals with, among other things, EPA, and it has sections \ndealing with funding from different funds for projects that the U.S. \nGovernment has mandated: To protect drinking water and to protect \ncommunities from problems relating to improper wastewater treatment. We \nprovide those mandates. Congress, therefore, provides funding to help \nlocal communities create the proper infrastructure to meet the \nrequirements of the statute and EPA.\n  As Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond have eloquently pointed out, it \nis always a struggle to get the funding to fill these needs, but they \nhave done a great job in getting additional funding this year for that \npurpose.\n  The problem is, whereas the drinking water portion is allocated on \nthe basis of EPA's recommendations and what they call the needs survey, \nthere is no such reference to EPA recommendations with respect to \nwastewater treatment. Instead, we are reverting to a formula based on \n1970s data. It has never been updated since the action was put into \nplace in 1987.\n  There is a legitimate suggestion we ought to go to the authorizing \ncommittee to try to fix this. The authorizing committee has had 14 \nyears to try to correct this, and my staff has repeatedly tried to make \ncontact with people to see if they would be interested in doing it.\n  Thus far, we have not had any success. Despite the fact that the \nchairman of the committee has indicated his willingness to take up the \nreauthorization this fall, there is no commitment to take up a \nmodification of the formula to meet the needs of the high gross States \nabout which I have been talking. There is absolutely no reason to think \nwe will succeed this year in modifying the formula through the \nauthorizing committee. Even if we were to succeed in doing that, the \nStates I named would receive tremendous shortfalls for the fiscal year \n2002. There is no way to fix it for the fiscal year 2002. I have a \ncouple of communities in my State that are in dire need of this \nfunding. There is no way they can get it.\n  We suggested this formula change, which is very simple. It says we \nshould use the needs survey of the EPA and provide 97.5 percent of the \nfunding available in accordance with that recommendation, and we have a \nminimum and a maximum so that no State gets more than 8 percent and no \nState gets less than the minimum we provide. That is similar to other \nformulas. It is very fair. It is very simple. It is easy to apply. The \nnet result, based upon the charts I showed earlier, will go a \nsignificant degree toward not only providing funding for those States \nand localities that need it the most, but reducing the significant \nunfairness in the formula that exists today. That is what we are \ntalking about. It is that simple.\n  For those Senators from the following States, I hope since they will \nreceive more money--again, let me note we are not affecting earmarks. \nWe have included the earmarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the Senator from \nArizona has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First, an inquiry about the time. Did the Senator from \nArizona consume the time to be allocated to the Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Fitzgerald?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. I inquire of the Senator from Maryland, maybe I \nmisunderstood the unanimous consent request. I thought because the \nSchumer time had been yielded back that all the remaining time was \ndivided.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That is correct. That is my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will state the time is parsed into \nthree allocations, three 10-minute segments: One for the Senator from \nArizona, one each for the chairman of the subcommittee, and the ranking \nmember.\n  Mr. KYL. I say to Senator Mikulski, if Senator Fitzgerald arrives, \nperhaps we can accommodate him in some way.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. As I understand, the distinguished ranking member has \n10 minutes. I am sure he will be happy to yield. We will not preclude \nSenator Fitzgerald from offering a comment.\n  We have debated the contents on this bill for a good part of the \nmorning. I think it has been a very constructive debate and a civil \ndebate, which we hope the Senate would be.\n  I will talk about process for a minute. The Kyl amendment is \nlegislating on appropriations. Ordinarily, I would offer a point of \norder exactly on that, to knock it down on the point of order under the \nrules of the Senate.\n  Because of something the House did--and remember, we work off the \nHouse bill, as I understand it, and I believe the Senator's analysis is \naccurate. We are not able to do that, so this will be a straight up or \ndown--it will not be straight up or down. Either Senator Bond and I \nhave declared our intent to offer a motion to table, which I am not yet \noffering, but we really are legislating on appropriations. This is so \ncomplicated.\n  Even with the good will from the standpoint of the Senator from \nArizona, myself, and Senator Bond, the ranking member, where we tried \nto explain this formula over that formula or that survey, it shows how \ncomplex this is. In fairness, to make sure we have a formula that works \nfor constituents, works for the communities, works for the taxpayer, we \ncannot deal with this formula on the Senate floor. This truly must be \ndone through the authorizing process.\n  I acknowledge the problems the Senator from Arizona has had when he \nsays it has been 14 years and it is time to take a new look and a fresh \nlook. Acknowledging the need for a new and fresh look, I also encourage \nthe Senator in the most collegial tone possible, to also be in \ndiscussions with the very able administrator of EPA. I have found \nAdministrator Whitman to be able, accessible, interested in hearing \nabout specific issues and specific problems. We did bring the Senator's \namendment to the EPA staff. They furnished a very competent \nanalysis. In fact, it was through them that we identified the error in \nthe drafting.\n\n  I do not really recommend that this amendment be agreed to. We really \ndo not know the consequences of the amendment. There is no way to \nevaluate the consequences of the amendment. It could have very dire \neffects.\n  There is no latitude to offer a point of order. We will be offering a \nmotion to table the amendment, but we do not want to table the problem.\n  The problem is a real problem. This is why, again, with the \nencouragement of the authorizers, I really share with my colleagues, \nworking with Administrator Whitman has been a very positive experience \nfrom this Senator's viewpoint. I suggest perhaps the Senator and \ncolleagues who are so passionate about this issue, as they have \nexpressed themselves on the floor, meet with her and get EPA to start \nworking on the analysis of exactly the consequences, which we would \nneed should we come to an authorizing hearing. Then, if the authorizing \nhearings do not quite get to it, we would have the benefit of their \nanalysis and their thinking.\n  Let's not table the problem. One of us will move to table this \namendment. But, again, I do not want to table the problem.\n  I know the time is growing short. We are awaiting Senator Fitzgerald. \nWe know Senator Bond is temporarily off the floor at a meeting with \nsome of his Republican colleagues. I believe the moderates are meeting. \nHe is available.\n  I will reserve my time for the end. I ask the Presiding Officer, how \nmuch time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 3 minutes 10 \nseconds remaining. The Senator from Missouri has 10 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I inquire of the Senator from Illinois how much time he \nwill need.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Only a couple of minutes; 5 minutes will be fine.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent 5 minutes from the time of the \nminority be allocated to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for her \ngenerosity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland for \nyielding me the time.\n  I rise to support my friend from Arizona, Senator Kyl, and compliment\n\n[[Page S8655]]\n\nhim on the amendment he has introduced. I think he has studied this \nissue very carefully. He has noticed that many States--in fact, about \n29 States--appear to get severely shortchanged in the current formula \nin the clean water development fund. His is a new formula that has a \nbetter rationale to it. We cannot really figure out what formula was \nused back in 1987 in the conference committee. They just picked an \narbitrary formula that seemed to steer a lot of money to a select \nhandful of States. But most States, the majority of States, come up \nshort under the current formula.\n  As I understand it, Senator Kyl's new formula is based on the same \nformula that is used in the safe drinking water revolving fund. It \ncertainly will make for a better need-based distribution of these \nimportant allocations of funds for wastewater treatment around the \ncountry.\n  I rise to support Senator Kyl's amendment. I understand the Presiding \nOfficer has joined as a cosponsor. This seems to be good legislation \nfor our State and a majority of States around the country. We all know \nfrom local communities around our States how important these funds are \nfor these water treatment projects.\n  I hope we will have a majority vote in favor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Allen from Virginia be \nalso listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time? If no one yields time, time will be deducted from \nthe time remaining to both sides.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, let's be clear. This amendment totally \nchanges the water formula--totally. New York loses $14 million, \nMaryland loses $2 million. There are winners and there are losers. \nUnder what I am suggesting, we table this and end this debate but we \nencourage the authorizers to really face the problem of water \ninfrastructure needs and to ask the Administrator of the EPA to \nevaluate these formulas, taking into consideration the needs of our \ncommunities, the new census data, and that we act in a prudent and \nmeasured way.\n  This is not the place to do this legislation. It is absolutely not \nthe place to do this legislation.\n  I yield the floor and ask how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 1 minute 15 \nseconds remaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I reserve that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 7 minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me just check on the time status. We are \nto begin the votes at 1:50; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 1:55.\n  Mr. BOND. Is there to be a time period for the proponents and \nopponents prior to that 1:50, or are we to use the time that is now \nallotted to us?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 1:55 there will be 2 minutes equally \ndivided before the first vote and 2 minutes equally divided before the \nsecond vote.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes from the time I \nhave remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 46 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BOND. I will use that.\n  Mr. President, again, I commend Senator Kyl, the Senator from \nArizona, for bringing to our attention the very important issue of how \nthese vitally important funds are allocated. I have raised my concerns \nthat the allocation he seeks to add in the appropriations bill should \ngo through a thorough process in the authorizing committee because it \nis very complex.\n  I have looked at the formula that has developed. I find that it has \nmany, many different aspects. He has figured in earmarks that are not \nincluded in the allocation. There is a 1-year formula that is extremely \nconfusing. The EPA has already advised us they would not know how to \nimplement it. Certainly the more I see of it the more I believe it must \nhave a thorough discussion, debate, hearings, and the work of the \nmarkup in the authorizing committee.\n  I commend him for bringing this to our attention. I urge my \ncolleagues to support our tabling motion.\n  On behalf of the Senator from Vermont, the chairman of the Committee \non Environment and Public Works, I move to table the Kyl amendment. I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Maryland yield back her \ntime?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) is absent because of a death in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 58, nays 41, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 266 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--58\n\n     Akaka\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Edwards\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--41\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Smith (OR)\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Domenici\n       \n  The motion was agred to.\n  Mr. BOND.

There will be 2 minutes evenly divided before \na vote on the Schumer amendment.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Idaho.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is a very contentious amendment. \nThe Senator from Idaho is entitled to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, is this a motion to table?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. A motion to table has been made.\n  Mr. BOND. Is the first time to be taken by the proponents of the \nmeasure or by the proponents of the tabling?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Craig sought recognition in support of \nthe motion to table.\n  Mr. BOND. I suggest that Senator Hutchison would wish 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Not at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order before we proceed.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is my understanding there are 2 minutes \nequally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Or per side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute in support of the amendment and 1 \nminute in opposition.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am speaking on the motion to table the \nSchumer amendment. Mr. Schumer wishes to allocate $15 million of this \nappropriation to what we call gun buybacks. He is taking $15 million \naway from AIDS and the homeless and Native American housing and the \nrevitalization of the public housing.\n  I am telling you what the record says. Since 1978, law enforcement in \nAmerica has clearly said gun buybacks\n\n[[Page S8656]]\n\ndon't work. They buy back old and obsolete and unused guns off the \nstreet, yes; out of homes, yes. Do they take away the semi-automatics \nor the .38s used in the commission of crimes? Absolutely not. That is \nwhy law enforcement in America today is backing away from gun buybacks. \nThe commissioner of law enforcement in Boston said, ``We won't use our \nmoney there anymore because it is ineffective.'' Crime goes up. Yes, \nthey are great photo opportunities, but it does not work.\n  That is why, 2 weeks ago, the Bush administration said we will \nallocate money in HUD for those things that work, where we can get at \ncrime through interdiction and law enforcement and not through a photo \nopportunity.\n  I ask you to vote to table the Schumer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this is a commonsense amendment. It says \nwe ought to continue, at a very modest sum of $15 million, a gun \nbuyback program. Contrary to what my friend said, it is supported by \nlaw enforcement. It has worked in public housing authorities, where it \nis most needed. We are not putting any restrictions on anyone who wants \nto keep their gun or use their gun, but if people wish to turn in their \nguns for a modest sum, get it out of the home to avoid accidents, avoid \na criminal getting their hands on the gun, avoid a kid going out with \nthe gun on the street, creating havoc, why not?\n  We should not make this any kind of ideological test. It is simple, \ncommon sense that buyback programs have worked. It is funded very \nmodestly. The administration wants to rescind it. We should keep it \ngoing. It is that plain and simple.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. \nGregg) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) is \nabsent because of a death in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to have the support and \ncosponsorship of this amendment of Senators Kyl, Smith, and Graham of \nFlorida. I am also especially grateful for the key support of \norganizations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American \nVeterans, AMVETS, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Council for a Livable \nWorld, and Citizens Against Government Waste.\n  This amendment provides funding for the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs--top priority--by adding $5 million that is desperately needed \nfor veterans claims adjudication and eliminating more than $5 million \nin nonveteran-related earmarked funds contained in the VA-HUD \nlegislation.\n  I want to get right to it. Currently, it takes an average of 215 \ndays--215 days--at any of the 58 VA regional offices to make a decision \non the hundreds of thousands of claims filed annually. There is \npresently a backlog of over 600,000 claims by our veterans.\n  That is an unacceptable situation. What we are talking about in this \namendment is a matter of priorities.\n  The amendment will not exceed the budget resolution caps because it \nis fully offset by cutting funding for 18 separate earmarks by 50 \npercent, not totally. I am not eliminating the funding for any program \nor earmark this year. I am eliminating half of the money. Frankly, $5 \nmillion is a small amount as compared with the more than $40 million or \n$50 million that is needed as stated by the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  I repeat, I am only cutting half from these specific earmarks in the \ncommunity development fund account of title II.\n  For the record, of the 255 total number of earmarked projects in this \nfund, nearly 9 out of 10 are for States well represented on the \nAppropriations Committee. The earmarks I propose to cut in half are \njust a few examples of the pages of earmarks totaling more than $140 \nmillion that are funded from the community development fund.\n  Unfortunately, the appropriators have substituted their judgment on \nhow best to spend the funds and have earmarked moneys for programs such \nas bicentennial celebrations, botanical gardens, art museums, art \ncenters, and heritage trails.\n  I point out the bill language as to what a community development \nprogram is all about:\n\n       The wide range of fiscal, economic, and social development \n     activities are eligible with spending priorities determined \n     at the local level--\n\n  Spending priorities determined at the local level--\n\n       but the law enumerates general objectives which the block \n     grants are designed to fulfill, including adequate housing, a \n     suitable living environment, and expanded economic \n     opportunities principally for persons of low and moderate \n     income.\n\n  ``Principally for persons of low and moderate income.'' I am going to \npoint out some things such as the deprived area of Newport, RI, that is \nsupposed to get some of this money, and other deprived areas of the \ncountry, as I say 9 out of 10 of which are in the States represented on \nthe Appropriations Committee.\n  I cannot stand here and tell my colleagues that some earmarked \nprojects are not valid and important, but decisions as to whether a \nproject should get taxpayers' funds should not be made by \nappropriators, bypassing the legitimate funding process. If we earmark \nfunds in this way, I would just as soon transfer some of the funds to \nhelp our veterans, unless we are willing to strike all the earmarks so \nthe community development fund can operate as intended. I doubt there \nwill be any takers.\n  Secretary Principi testified before the VA-HUD subcommittee of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee on May 2, 2001, that his No. 1 priority \nis to drastically decrease the backlog in claims against the VA. \nPresident Bush also recently emphasized this priority and has promised \na top-to-bottom review of VA benefits claims process.\n  Currently, it takes an average of 215 days--215 days--at any of the \n58 regional VA offices to make a decision on the hundreds of thousands \nof claims filed annually. Furthermore, the Veterans of Foreign Wars \nwrote me on July 30, 2001, that an investigation of claims processing \ndelays of their members found ``a lengthy list of hundreds of claims \npending over 720 days.''\n\n[[Page S8657]]\n\n  Balance 720 days for a VA claim with a World War II veteran, one of \nour greatest generations. We know how old they are. Isn't our \nobligation to the living as well as to the deceased?\n  Today there are nearly 600,000 outstanding claims awaiting \nadjudication by the VA, and that number is expected to continue to \nrise.\n  I imagine the managers of the bill are going to say this $5 million \nis unnecessary. Let me tell you what the veterans say. Let me tell you \nwhat the Veterans of Foreign Wars say:\n\n       On behalf of the 2.7 million members of the Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars of the United States, and its Ladies Auxiliary, \n     I would like to take this opportunity to express our support \n     for your amendment to S. 1216 that would increase the amount \n     available for veterans claims adjudication by $10 million.\n\n  That has been reduced to $5 million.\n\n       As you know, the Department of Veterans Affairs is not \n     completing quality work on benefits claims in an efficient \n     manner. In fact, an original claims for service connected \n     disability that does not require substantial development is \n     averaging 215 days. . . . Additionally, a recent request by \n     the VA Claims Processing Task Force for a list of original \n     claims pending over 720 days resulted in a lengthy list of \n     hundreds of claims.\n       Your amendment would provide additional dollars crucial to \n     VA's attempt to improve the quality and timeliness of \n     veterans' claims processing.\n       Thank you for all you do for American veterans.\n\n  From the DAV:\n\n       On behalf of the more than 1 million members of the \n     Disabled American Veterans (DAV), I am writing to express our \n     support for your proposed amendment to add $10 million for \n     adjudication of veterans' claims to S. 1216, the Fiscal Year \n     2002 VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill.\n       As you are aware, the claims backlog at the Board of \n     Veterans' Appeals is at an unacceptable level of \n     approximately 600,000 cases. These long delays that veterans \n     or claimants must endure for claims benefits decisions are \n     unconscionable.\n\n  That is what the disabled veterans say.\n\n       More needs to be done to ensure quality, timely decisions. \n     Employees need to be added to deal with this backlog. This \n     amendment will provide needed funds to assist in this effort.\n\n  Paralyzed Veterans of America:\n\n       On behalf of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, I am \n     writing to offer our support for your proposed amendment to \n     S. 216 . . . to provide additional funding for veterans' \n     claims adjudication, would bring this important account \n     closer to the level recommended by the Independent Budget, \n     which is co-authored by the Paralyzed Veterans of America, \n     AMVETS, the Disabled American Veterans and the Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars.\n       The chronic backlog faced by veterans seeking the benefits \n     they have earned is simply unconscionable. We must take \n     action. This additional funding will not solve the problem \n     overnight, but will be an important step forward to ensure \n     that veterans receive timely and accurate claims decisions.\n       We appreciate your commitment to addressing this problem.\n\n  In another letter:\n\n       Dear Senator McCain: AMVETS fully supports your amendment. \n     . . .\n       Disabled veterans must now wait months and sometimes years \n     for their benefit claims to be decided. Your amendment will \n     help VA fulfill its mission and improve the overall quality \n     and timeliness of the service provided to veterans and their \n     families.\n       We urge the Senate to approve your amendment. Veterans have \n     earned our respect and gratitude, and we thank you for your \n     good work on behalf of American veterans.\n\n  Now, the analysis for the Associated Press last year found that the \nbenefits administration takes longer to process claims than it did a \ndecade ago. It took 164 days in 1991 to complete an original claim, \ncompared with currently 215 days, and up to 3 years if appealed. There \nare more than a few veterans, such as 72-year-old Wayne Young of \nCuyahoga Falls, OH, who for more than 44 years has been waiting for \nfinal adjudication of his veterans claim benefits by the VA.\n  Secretary Principi directed a 10-person blue ribbon claims processing \ntask force that will review the Department's handling of applications \nfor veterans benefits. This task force will officially report to him \nthis fall. However, preliminary results indicate that the Secretary \nwill need an additional $40 million on top of the additional $132 \nmillion provided in the bill to hire additional claims adjudicators to \nassist already overworked VA employees in reducing the time it takes to \nprocess claims.\n  I am sure the managers of the bill will say they put in a sufficient \namount of money. I respect that view. I respect more the views of the \nveterans organizations who are the ones who are the advocates for and \ndefenders of the veterans of this Nation. I appreciate the dedication \nand efforts on behalf of veterans that the Senator from Maryland and \nthe Senator from Missouri have displayed year after year, time after \ntime. I just believe we need additional money.\n  The additional $5 million in funding that I am proposing in this \namendment for claims adjudication matters would allow the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to hire approximately 100 additional claims \nadjudication personnel to begin chipping away at this backlog or, at \nthe very least, slowing its growth a bit.\n  The current staff members handling these claims are considerably \noverworked. For every 10 claims for veterans' disability benefits, 4 \nare actually decided incorrectly, thereby increasing the number of \noutstanding claims for veterans awaiting to have their healthcare needs \nmet. This already unacceptable number will continue to increase, unless \nthe Congress appropriately funds the VA for personnel adjudication.\n  In an effort to try and accelerate the claims process and drive down \nthe backlog, claims personnel often ignore the Department's own rules \nin deciding claims. When the regional offices have rejected a claim, a \nveteran can appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals. Last year that \npanel overturned the regional offices 26 percent of the time, and sent \nback another 30 percent of cases. The VA special appeals court returned \n64 percent of its cases, mostly because of procedural problems. All the \nwhile, our veterans continue to wait for us to fulfill our promise to \nthem.\n  Secretary Principi has stated that his ``top priority is to the \nliving veterans, not the decreased. Many veterans die before their \nclaims are handled, we need to do a much better job of processing these \nclaims before these veterans die. Only 5 million of the 16 million \nWorld War II vets who saved the world are alive today. Every day, World \nWar II veterans are passing on before their claims are decided, and \nthat's a real tragedy.''\n  I stand alongside Secretary Principi on this most worthy endeavor to \nreform this badly broken system.\n  Mr. President, our veterans risked their lives in defense of our \nnation, whether charging the beaches of Normandy and Inchon, fighting \nin Vietnam, or putting themselves into harms way in Iraq and Kosovo. \nYet these great Americans must now wait and wait and wait just to get \nan answer from the Veterans Administration.\n  Instead of fulfilling a promise that America would take care of their \nmental and physical injuries incurred while honorably serving our \ncountry, we ``reward'' them with an overworked, inefficient process \nthat results in thousands of veterans everyday being turned away from \nbenefit that were earned, deserved, and promised.\n  This amendment will go a long way to help our veterans. It also \nrecognizes our government's solemn obligation to take care of these \nveterans' mental and physical health needs that resulted while \ndefending our great nation. In the words of President Abraham Lincoln, \ngiven during his second inaugural address on Mary 4, 1865, ``To care \nfor him who shall have borne the battle and his widow and his orphan.''\n  Secretary Principi is dedicated to carrying out this sacred \nresponsibility, and I have every confidence that properly funded, he \nand the others in his Department will ensure that we here in Congress \nfulfill our promise to the Veterans of the United States of America.\n  I urge my colleagues' support for this amendment.\n  Now I will talk about the projects for which the money has been \nreduced, actually cut in half. One is the desert space station in \nNevada, of $100,000. Please remember in the context of what the \ncommunity development programs are supposed to be for, and that is, of \ncourse, including adequate housing, a suitable living environment, and \nan expanded opportunities prescription appeal for persons of low and \nmoderate income, requiring grant recipients to use 70 percent of the \nblock grant funds for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income \npersons.\n  I repeat: Grant recipients are required to use at least 70 percent of\n\n[[Page S8658]]\n\ntheir block grant funds for activities that benefit low- and moderate-\nincome persons.\n  The title is out of this world. Tourists can look for \nextraterrestrials in the Nevada desert. Visitors to Las Vegas might \nfind an extraterrestrial or two if they knew where to look. Las Vegas \nis no stranger to the weird. Many would say the city is a weirdness \nmagnet unless proliferating Elvises, drive-through wedding chapels, and \nelaborate faux cities make sense. A bird's eye look at the town, \nhowever, shows that Las Vegas is simply a small, beautiful cluster of \nlights sitting within a vast and very dark desert expanse.\n  Some people come to this city looking for something out of the \ndarkness, something extraterrestrial. When it comes to alien mania, Las \nVegas is as popular as Roswell, NM. On the lonely roads that cross \nNevada, one of the least densely populated States, reports of swirling \nlights, government coverups, and UFO crashes are not considered odd but \ncommonplace occurrences.\n  When your client is ready for a break from the gaming tables and the \nglitz of the strip, you can suggest alien hunting as an alternative to \nLas Vegas' many wonders. Despite the secrecy, this craze won't go away \nanytime soon.\n  An hour away from the strip, in Pahrump, NV, a museum is being built \nin the shape of a spaceship, to be completed by 2005. It will be the \nofficial Area 51 artifact and information center. It will offer a 3-D \nIMAX center theater, a digistar planetarium, and an Area 51 theme \nrestaurant in the expectation of attracting 374,000 visitors annually.\n  The 95,000-square-foot facility will call itself the Desert Space \nStation Science Museum. What it is all about is the Area 51.\n  Adventure Las Vegas offers commissionable day tours that take \nvisitors to the perimeter of this top secret installation. Clients stop \nin Slot Canyon along the way to view ancient Indian petroglyphs that \nsome believe to be drawings of aliens. Then they travel through some \nremote and very mysterious areas, such as a dry lake bed where UFOs are \nrumored to have been observed. After observing these strange sightings, \nthey will drop into the Little Ale Inn Cafe. There they will have the \nchance to view top secret documents taken from Area 51 and possibly \nhave a conversation with Capt. Chuck Clark, and ex-Air Force captain \nand the author of The Area 51 Manual. The Area 51 Research Center, \nlocated at this quirky location, has a large amount of information \nabout this mysterious region on display, as well as for sale.\n  We are asking to take half a million dollars for the Desert Space \nStation Science Museum and give it to help our veterans have their \nclaims processed.\n  I mentioned earlier about the community development grant programs \nbeing for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons: \n$200,000 is for the Newport Air Museum.\n\n       Welcome to Newport: Rich in history, Newport prides itself \n     on being a vibrant community offering a wide variety of \n     events and activies year-round. Whether you were drawn here \n     to enjoy the music festivals, yachting regattas, mansion \n     tours, professional tennis at the Newport Casino or a day at \n     the beach, Newport offers you a picturesque location to relax \n     and enjoy.\n       This unique island community instantly blends the old and \n     the new--colonial homes stand feet away from modern \n     condominiums and offices. The bustling harbor glistens as \n     elegant yachts, luxury liners and lobster boats compete for \n     space. All of these combined are the charm that is Newport . \n     . .\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       However, Newport was rediscovered in the 1800's by the \n     country's wealthy citizens as the ideal location to spend \n     their summers. Suddenly, elaborate mansions and villas sprung \n     up along Bellevue Avenue and Ocean Drive--each more ornate \n     and luxurious than the one next door. These ``summer \n     cottages'' provided the perfect backdrop for ``The 400,'' an \n     elite group of the very rich. This extravagant era officially \n     opened the door to America's first resort.\n\n  They are going to spend $200,000 on an art museum in Newport, RI.\n  Harbor Gardens Greenhouse Project:\n\n       When some people think of Pittsburgh, they still envision \n     steel mills and smoky skies. Others identify the city by its \n     sports teams or its three rivers or its colleges and \n     hospitals or Heinz ketchup.\n       But who'd ever think Pittsburgh could become known for \n     producing orchids?\n       Well, Bill Strickland would.\n       The president of the Bidwell Training Center on the North \n     Side is trying to come up with $3 million to create something \n     called Harbor Gardens Greenhouse.\n       It would be a 46,000-square-foot glass facility located at \n     Bidwell offices on Metropolitan Street in Manchester and \n     ``dedicated to producing orchids,'' according to a recent \n     funding request submitted to the city's Urban Redevelopment \n     Authority.\n       Strickland readily admits that growing the delicate, \n     beautiful flowers would be ``untraditional'' for Pittsburgh \n     but insists that untraditional thinking is what may be needed \n     now.\n\n  I really believe it would be a good idea to grow orchids in \nPittsburgh. I also happen to believe our veterans need their claims \nprocessed as a greater priority.\n  Here is $1 million for a multi-purpose events center in Utah. I have \na copy of the minutes of the Richfield City Council meeting held on \nTuesday, September 19, 2000 at 7:00 p.m. in the Council Chambers of the \nRichfield City office building located at 75 East Center, Richfield, \nUtah.\n\n       Pledge of Allegiance was led by Mayor David Kay Kimball.\n       Roll Call was answered . . .\n       Ruth Jackson, representing the committee promoting the \n     multi events center gave a presentation to the Council. She \n     explained that they are going throughout the County giving \n     this presentation to educate the voters about the multi \n     events center and the upcoming bond election. They showed a \n     model representing what the building will look like when \n     constructed. It was also explained that there would be an \n     advisory board over the maintenance and operation manager of \n     the building and that some one from the City could sit on \n     this board giving the city some voice in how the building is \n     utilized. One point made is that the community may not need \n     this facility now, but it will within the next five to ten \n     years.\n\n  There is a beach resort shore trail in Hawaii. There is a \nbicentennial party, Louisiana Purchase Bicentennial Commission party \nfor $1 million; a river museum in Iowa, a couple of million dollars; \nCulver City Council Theater.\n  Idaho Virtual Incubator--that is kind of an interesting one. I don't \nquite understand it--$500,000, the Idaho Virtual Incubator:\n\n       The Idaho Virtual Incubator prepares businesses for e-\n     commerce, offers students ``hands-on'' experience through \n     virtual internships and fosters partnerships for job \n     creation, expansion and retention.\n\n  Madam President, I think I have made my point. We have over 60,000 \nunprocessed claims. The committee very wisely--and I appreciate it--has \nadded funding to help address this issue. We are trying to add more \nfunding. Not just in my view but the view of every veterans \norganization in America, this money is needed. Because of the rules, \nobviously, that I would be subject to a budget point of order, I have \nfound projects that I think are of lower priority than that of \nprocessing the claims of our veterans. Some of them are interesting, \nsome of them entertaining; some of them are outrageous.\n  But the point is, none of these projects that I have identified could \npossibly, in the view of any objective observer, have priority over the \nprocessing of our veterans' claims.\n  I mentioned earlier, only 5 million of our 16 million World War II \nveterans survive today. They are leaving us at a rate of 30,000 every \nsingle month. It seems to me our first obligation would be to provide, \nas rapidly as possible, a process where the claims they may have for \ninjuries or disabilities incurred in the service of this country would \ntake priority over desert space stations, or greenhouses, Wildwood \nvacation resorts, botanical gardens, multi-event systems, multipurpose \nradio, multipurpose events centers, et cetera, et cetera.\n  I think the choice is clear. I am not saying the earmarks themselves \nare something that I approve of; I do not. I am not attacking the \nearmarks. I am not trying to have them removed. I am trying to cut them \nin half so we can have an extra $5 million, which is not a lot of money \nwhen you consider the entire budget of this VA-HUD appropriations bill, \nso we can begin, at least, working with Secretary Principi, to provide \nfor veterans.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, on occasion I have an opportunity to travel\n\n[[Page S8659]]\n\nwith my colleague from Arizona and go through an airport somewhere in \nthe country. I remember not too long ago going to Dallas, TX, on our \nway to Phoenix. Veterans coming up to my colleague--he is a lot more \nrecognizable than I am--and saying, ``Thank you, Senator McCain, for \nfighting for us.''\n  Madam President, does the Senator from Maryland wish to speak at this \nmoment? If I took her time, I apologize for doing that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does the Senator wish to speak in behalf of the McCain \namendment?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, that is what I am doing, yes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. It was my understanding we would follow the tradition \nof alternating.\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield the floor to the Senator from Maryland. \nI did not realize she wished to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, thank you very much. I thank the \njunior Senator from Arizona.\n  Madam President, first of all, know that in talking about veterans \nand about the claims processing, not only wouldn't I argue with John \nMcCain, but I wouldn't argue with all the history that we have had on \nthis almost intractable problem. Cutting the time that a veteran must \nwait for a decision on claims processing has been one of my highest \npriorities since I originally chaired the committee in 1990. It seems \nas if we never get a handle on this issue.\n  The items of concern that were listed by the Senator from Arizona are \naccurate. Those are exactly the same problems my distinguished \ncolleague and ranking member, Senator Bond, and I had in an extensive \ndiscussion with Administrator Principi during our VA hearing.\n  They are absolutely right. It takes too long for claims. It is \nabsolutely wrong that our veterans who were willing to risk their lives \nand put their lives in the line of fire to defend the United States of \nAmerica have to wait in line to find out about adjudication, \nparticularly for a disability benefit. There is absolute agreement that \nit is wrong for veterans to have to wait 205 days or 7 months to get a \ndecision on the claim.\n  Having agreed on the problem, what my colleagues in the Senate need \nto know is, on a bipartisan basis, working with the executive branch we \nhave attempted to solve this problem.\n  First of all, for the VA-HUD bill, we put $1.1 billion in for the \nadministration of benefits. That is $1 billion-plus for the \nadministration of the benefits. We have also increased it by $132 \nmillion. Where did we get that number? We got that number from George \nBush. We got that number from President Bush. This isn't Barbara \nMikulski's number. This isn't Kit Bond's number. This isn't something \nthat we pulled off a Ouija board. This came from President Bush.\n  My colleague from Arizona says: I don't want to argue with you about \nwhat the veterans have to say. I don't want to dispute our veterans. \nBut I have to believe that President Bush and Tony Principi, the \nAdministrator of Veterans Affairs, knew what it would take to begin to \nreally solve this problem this year, which has been a disaster for more \nthan a decade. The money recommendation came from President George \nBush. That is from where the $132 million come.\n  Let's talk about our very able new Administrator of Veterans Affairs. \nI think the world of our new Administrator. I want to say this as a \nDemocrat. I think President Bush has given us an outstanding Veterans \nAffairs Administrator. I am so excited about the possibility of working \nwith Administrator Principi, a Vietnam vet himself, a former Under \nSecretary of VA during the Bush-Quayle administration, and with a \nsubstantial stint in the private sector picking up even more management \nskills.\n  Secretary Principi brings to us the heart and soul of a veteran--and \ncommitted to it because he was a foxhole guy himself; all the way up \nnow to the considerable experience he has had not only with VA but also \nwith the private sector.\n  I am telling you that Tony Principi and the President say we need \n$132 million. I am willing not only to take it to the bank, but I am \nwilling to take it to the Federal checkbook. That is where we got the \nmoney. I believe that it will really make a substantial dent.\n  We haven't been laggards, nor have we been deleterious, nor have we \ninvented numbers out of the thin air.\n  Let me tell you what we are going to buy with this new money. We are \ngoing to buy close to 900 new employees to handle the backlog, and also \nto handle the new cases triggered by legislation enacted last year. \nForty-six million dollars of that will be to hire these processors to \nimplement what they call ``duty to assist''--to actually help the \nveterans prepare their claims.\n  One of the problems in doing claims is that our veterans often don't \nprepare them properly. It is through no fault of the veterans. Many of \nthem have visual problems. They are old. They are not well. If you have \na disability, you stand to be pretty sick. And also you are pretty sick \nof the bureaucracy and you are pretty sick of the paperwork. But some \nof these new people will actually help the veterans do it right so we \ncan get it done in the right time.\n  There is a new law to require the VA to review 98,000 cases--we have \nto go over the backlog--and another 244,000 that were pending when the \nlegislation was enacted.\n  By the way, the VA will be able to also carry out a new policy of \nadding type 2 diabetes to the list of presumptive disability \nconditions. Over 100,000 new claims are expected to be in this \ncategory, particularly from our Vietnam vets.\n  Additionally, the fiscal year 2001 supplemental spending also gave \nthe Veterans Affairs $19 million in this category. We have $132 \nmillion, and in the supplemental that we just passed there is another \n$19 million. I think that takes us to $151 million. That is not potato \nchips, but it will buy us a lot of microchips to try to move this \nbacklog.\n  I think we are keeping our promises to our veterans. We have not been \nlaggards. We don't want to dump money on the problem, but we want to \nengage in solving the problem. That is why we ask the administration to \ngive us the right amounts needed, and we will see that we step up and \ndo that. That is where we come in on the money. That is why I am going \nto oppose the Senator's amendment. We are honoring President Bush's \nrequest, and we think if President Bush thinks it is adequate, the \nSenate ought to think it is adequate.\n  The other issue I am going to take up is this question of earmarks. \nPeople use the term ``earmarks'' as if it is a Darth Vader stain on the \nbill. Let me tell you, we can look at these projects; we can analyze \nthem; we can joke about them, and so on. But when you talk to \ncolleagues the way I have, we often end up meeting very compelling \ncommunity needs. I know the Presiding Officer has spoken to me about \nthe desperate need in her community to help the Meals on Wheels \ncommunity. As I understand, the ability to really meet that \noverwhelming caseload is tremendous. We are going to try to work with \nher. I do not know if you are on this hit list or not. But I do know \nthat when we follow the earmark, it is not something that a Senator \nmakes up out of thin air.\n  My distinguished colleague and I wanted to weed out the pork. We \nestablished criteria that is within the framework of the community \ndevelopment block grant. We don't even consider a project unless a list \nis filled out for a project. You filled one out. In fact, you filled \nout more than one because of the needs of the State of Michigan.\n  What is it that we ask? Question No. 1, can you demonstrate that it \nwill create jobs or a compelling human need? Does it create jobs or \nmeet a compelling human need? Does it benefit a low- or moderate-income \nneighborhood? Does it eliminate physical or economic stress? Is there \nmatching funds from a non-Federal source to show that there is \ngrassroots support behind this? And is it essentially limited to a 1-\nyear endeavor? That is what we ask our colleagues.\n  Does it create jobs? Does it help poor or moderate neighborhoods? \nDoes it eliminate that distress? Can you show there is money from other \nsources? And also, this is not meant to be a year to year to year to \nyear entitlement.\n\n[[Page S8660]]\n\n  I want to talk about one in my own neighborhood. It is money for \nsomething called the Fells Point Creative Alliance to develop the \nPatterson Center for the Arts. I think when you read it, I can \nunderstand where someone might think this is for some yuppie, artsy, \nGucci, woo woo kind of thing. I am not into ``woo woo,'' but I am into \nempowerment.\n  Let me tell you about the neighborhood. This neighborhood is called \nHighlandtown. In the city of Baltimore, neighborhoods have names \nbecause Baltimore, the very nature of it, is a city of neighborhoods. \nAnd, God, I love it. And I am so proud of it. I love those \nneighborhoods. The neighborhoods are really what make Baltimore.\n  It is not the Inner Harbor and not Camden Yards and not PSI Net \nStadium. The Inner Harbor is great in terms of an entertainment area, \nbut it is the neighborhoods that are the heart and soul of Baltimore. \nThis Highlandtown neighborhood was made up of people who represented \nthe Polish, the Italian, the German, and the Greek community. They \nbuilt this country. They sat on their white steps. They went to war. \nAnd while the men were at war on the battled front, the women were at \nhome being ``Rosy the Riveters'' on the home front. We are both men and \nwomen, the veterans of World War II.\n  That neighborhood is aging in place, as are the people in it. I have \na substantial number of aging World War II, GI, red-blooded Americans \nin that neighborhood, and their wives, who worked in factories called \nBethlehem Steel, Martin Marietta, building the radar at Western \nElectric, who live in that neighborhood.\n  They are old. And we are fighting off the predators, the predatory \nlending crowd, the flipping crowd. We are fighting off the drug \ndealers. What was once a proud neighborhood is now teeter-tottering on \ndisaster.\n  Now we have a new mayor and a new spirit. And guess what we are \ndoing. We are transforming that teeter-tottering neighborhood into \nrevitalization and creating a new village, with this theater being one \nanchor and the regional library being another. We are creating a new \nvillage, not only to keep out the bad but to build up the good.\n  With these young artists, we are creating a new sense of a new kind \nof village. So this isn't some gooshy little Playdough project. This is \nnot a gooshy little Playdough project.\n  Now, if the mayor of the city of Baltimore is ready to work to anchor \nit, we have the right people ready to anchor it. The police \ncommissioner is working to keep out the drug dealers. Our housing \ncommissioner is keeping out the predatory lenders. I do not think we \nshould eliminate this to keep out the empowerment money.\n  I will tell you, our people fought for their country. I think they \nnow are trying to fight for their neighborhood. That is what this \nproject is all about.\n\n  So I wanted to talk about mine. But behind every one of these \ncongressionally designated projects is a story such as this. So if you \nreally want to help the veterans of Highlandtown, you let me bring this \nhelp to them.\n  So, Madam President, I feel very strongly about this. I feel so \nstrongly about those veterans who are waiting in line. I do not want \nthem in line any more than my colleague does. He and I would be \npartners in this, including my wonderful colleague from Missouri. We \nare ready to go hand in hand. But do not punish neighborhoods to be \nable to help the neighborhoods.\n  Remember, our veterans fought for the neighborhoods. Now we have to \nfight for the neighborhoods and fight for our veterans, and not pit \nthem against each other.\n  Madam President, I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 4 p.m. today be equally divided and controlled in the usual form \nwith respect to the pending McCain amendment No. 1226; that no \namendments be in order to the McCain amendment; that the only other \namendment in order during this period be a managers' amendment; and \nthat at 4 p.m., if the managers' amendment has not been agreed to, the \namendment then be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, if the amendment has been agreed upon by the two managers \nand the two leaders, Senator Daschle and Senator Lott; that the Senate \nthen vote in relation to the McCain amendment; that upon disposition of \nthe above amendments, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate \nvote on passage of the bill, with the above occurring with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. No objection on this side.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, we have a difference of opinion, \nobviously. Do we want these projects that I described, or do we want to \ngo along with the strong recommendations of our veterans organizations? \nIt really isn't too much more complicated than that. Some of these \nprojects are absolutely ridiculous, but we have seen many other \nridiculous projects in this porkbarrel spending which has lurched \ntotally out of control.\n  But the fact is, do we want to have these projects funded--9 out of \n10 of them are the Appropriations Committee; things such as desert \nspace stations and orchid greenhouses--or do we want to add $5 \nmillion--which we are not destroying; we are only cutting in half--or \ndo we want to take the strong advice and recommendation of every \nveterans organization in America? It is that simple.\n  I would be willing to vote. I will be glad to be on record siding \nwith the veterans of America, with whom I have had some experience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I started to comment earlier about the \ndegree to which veterans organizations and individual veterans around \nthe country have relied upon my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, \nto carry their flag in battles here in the Congress.\n  It always personally impresses me when I see people come up to him, \nas I frequently do, and thank him for the work that he has done or \ntheir behalf.\n  It always pains me when either of us--and sometimes both of us--have \nhad to vote against the VA-HUD appropriations bill, which has money for \nmany veterans programs, because of our concern that not enough of the \nmoney is allocated to veterans programs vis-a-vis the HUD programs.\n  I have explained to my very good friend and colleague, Senator Bond \nfrom Missouri, on many occasions why I have cast that vote, wishing \nvery much that I could support the good work that he and others have \ndone in support of our veterans.\n  I recognize that, as a result, this particular amendment is, in many \nrespects, a symbolic amendment. It only takes half of the funding away \nfrom these projects that Senator McCain described. And it is a \nrelatively small amount of the money that we believe will be necessary \nto supplement the funds that have been made available for the \nresolution of these veterans' claims.\n  It is true that the committee has set forth an amount that was \nrecommended for the resolution of those claims, but it is also true \nthat this fall--when the blue ribbon task force established to make \nrecommendations comes out with its recommendations--we anticipate that \nthey will be for a lot more money that is needed to adjudicate the \nclaims of the veterans. It will be too late by then to get that money \nin this appropriations bill.\n\n  Senator McCain's effort was a modest attempt to put a very small \namount of money, but symbolically important to our veterans, as he \nnoted, back into the veterans part of this bill. It is for that reason \nI strongly support it.\n  I will not go through all of the other arguments Senator McCain has \nso eloquently cited as the basis for his amendment.\n\n[[Page S8661]]\n\n  I appreciate very much what Senator Mikulski said. She has taken the \namount recommended by the administration and put that in the bill. As I \nsaid, all of us recognize, as she noted, it is not nearly enough. The \nquestion is, do we exercise some independent judgment here, anticipate \nthat there will be a recommendation for funding in the future, but that \nit will come too late in this appropriations process or do we put that \nmoney into projects Senator McCain has targeted for at least some \ntreatment under his amendment?\n  I agree with him. The choice is clear. I tell all of my veteran \nfriends when they confront me and ask, why did you have to vote against \nthat VA-HUD appropriations bill there is a process in Washington to put \nthe sweet with the sour, to make sure that whatever you do that doesn't \ngo down very easily, you put something sweet with it so it is hard to \nvote against it.\n  Nobody wants to vote against veterans programs. We all want to \nsupport our veterans. That is why you take programs that can be subject \nto some criticism in the HUD portion of the bill, put them with the VA \npart of the bill and, voila, you have a recipe for success; Members \nwill not dare vote against it.\n  I have voted against it. I will probably vote against it again in the \nfuture. I hope my veteran friends, by observing what is occurring here \ntoday, appreciate the fact that when we try very hard to move some of \nthat money from programs that we think are not as useful for people \ninto the veterans part of the budget, you can see how hard that is \ngoing to be. That is why, at the end of the day, we fight as hard as we \ncan to get as much support for the veterans in the bill. And if we \ncan't get more than we have been getting, then in many cases we end up \nopposing the bill. While it is true and in some respects symbolic, I \nthink the symbolism is very important.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator McCain's amendment to begin \nto send two messages. The first message is to our veterans, that we \nunderstand your needs, we understand your requirements, and we support \nyou. Secondly, to those who have the difficult job of putting together \nthis bill, it is time to begin to exercise some discretion here, and \nwith respect to these projects that each Member likes so much, all \nearmarked projects, put less money against those projects and transfer \nsome of that money into the veterans part of the budget.\n  As Senator McCain said with respect to these World War II veterans, \nthey don't have much time left. I hope my colleagues will support his \namendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to Senator \nMcCain's amendment to S. 1216, the appropriations bill for VA HUD.\n  This amendment would remove badly needed resources for many \ncommunities throughout the country and specifically in Sevier County in \nmy home State of Utah. It furthermore seeks to overturn the carefully \ncrafted work performed by the Senate Appropriations Committee when \nputting together this bill. I understand that legislating oftentimes \nmeans making difficult decisions, but the cuts proposed by Senator \nMcCain go too far and would hurt too many.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to table this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Might I inquire of the Senator from Missouri or Maryland if \nit would be all right if I take a couple minutes off the subject of the \nMcCain amendment to simply talk about a part of what will be included \nin the managers' amendment?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I assume the Senator from Arizona is \ncontrolling the time of the other Senator from Arizona. He is free to \nutilize such time as he wishes. We will extend him our good wishes.\n\n\n  ALLOCATION FORMULA FOR STATE WATER POLLUTION CONTROL REVOLVING FUND\n\n  Mr. KYL. Let me thank the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from \nMaryland for agreeing to accept as part of the managers' amendment an \namendment which I was going to offer. They have done this in good \nfaith. I especially appreciate the fact that they have expressed \nsupport for what I am trying to achieve. I will explain it very \nbriefly.\n  It was an amendment that expressed the sense of the Senate \nessentially that since we were not able to modify the formula for the \nwastewater treatment programs under EPA by an amendment on the floor on \nthis appropriations bill, largely because of the argument that it is \nmore appropriately done on the authorization bill, the authorizing \ncommittee, in September, should take up the reauthorization of the \nlegislation, including an attempt to deal with this particular formula.\n  The operative paragraph says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works of the Senate should be prepared \n     to enact authorizing legislation (including an equitable \n     needs-based formula) for the State water pollution control \n     revolving fund as soon as practicable after the Senate \n     returns from recess in September.\n\n  That is the result of the fact that my earlier amendment was defeated \nbut, frankly, defeated on a technicality, as most of the individuals \nnoted.\n  There is a good case to be made for evaluating the current formula \nfor distribution of these funds, that it can be done in the authorizing \ncommittee, that it should be done shortly after we return here, and I \nhope it can be done in time for changes to be made to affect the fiscal \nyear 2002 numbers. That is the only way the formula can be made more \nfair for this next year.\n  I express to my colleagues, the managers of this legislation, my \nthanks for their willingness to include this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution in the managers' amendment as a way of at least moving \nforward on the reform that most people agreed to earlier but were not \nwilling to make on the appropriations bill itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I claim such time from the time of the \nopponents of this amendment as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. First, let me thank my dear friend from Arizona for his \namendment that is going to be in the managers' amendment. It is a \npleasure to be working with the Senator from Arizona again. He formerly \nwas on this committee. We regret he is no longer on our appropriations \nsubcommittee. We still miss him, but I assure you, our aim is getting \nbetter.\n  I would like to tell the Senator from Arizona that we strongly \nsupport his admonition/instruction to the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee to move on the subject which he addresses. That subject, of \ncourse, is the equitable allocation and the badly needed funding for \nour water infrastructure. I cannot emphasize too much how important \nthat is to the health and well-being of all of our people and to the \nprogress of this country.\n  He has done a great service, raising the question about allocation of \nthe revolving funds, and we look forward to working with him. We are \ngoing to have to provide more resources than are now available. I \nassure him and my other colleagues that we want to do that in an \nequitable manner. I look forward, as a member of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, to working with our chairman and ranking member \nto see that that occurs.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1226, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BOND. With respect to the amendment by the other Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, while I am very sympathetic to the point he has \nmade about the need to improve VA's claim processing, I join with the \nmanager of the bill, the distinguished chair, in opposing it.\n  We have been concerned. We have worked all year long to assist VA in \ndealing with the unacceptable backlog in VA claims processing. Nobody \nhas been a more forceful, consistent spokesperson about the need to \nbring up-to-date and up-to-speed VA claims processing than the Senator \nfrom Maryland. I have listened to her for hours on end in the \nAppropriations Committee as she has sought more money, as she has \nadmonished officials of the VA to get with it and get on the ball and \nget these claims processed.\n  This has really been a crusade she has led. I agree with her 100 \npercent. We are totally in agreement that VA claims processing is \nextremely important. It is a matter of justice and fairness to the \npeople who have protected our country, and we have a long way to\n\n[[Page S8662]]\n\ngo. We believe this should be the highest priority.\n  I agree with her, and I thank her for her kind words about Secretary \nPrincipi. We are excited to have a man of his background, his \ncommitment, and his dedication at the helm in VA.\n  This is a difficult management problem. It is a resource problem. It \nis a personnel problem. We are totally committed to supporting \nSecretary Principi as far as we can. Secretary Principi has set a goal \nof processing regional disability claims within 100 days by the summer \nof 2003. That is an admirable and, unfortunately, ambitious goal \nconsidering that it now takes VBA more than 200 days to process a \nclaim.\n  Nevertheless, he has set forth a timetable. He has set forth a budget \nhe needs. He has set forth his plan to develop an effective processing \noperation that will assure that our Nation's veterans receive the \nservice and the compensation they deserve. To address this need, to \nfulfill our part of the bargain, the bill before us provides \nsignificant funding increases to the VA, as requested by Secretary \nPrincipi. He said: This is my goal; this is where I want to be, no more \nthan a hundred days. We will get there by 2003. He told us what he \nneeded.\n\n  Our bill provides $1.1 billion for the administration of benefits. \nThat is $132 million, or a 13-percent increase over the fiscal year \n2001 level. And, at the request of the administration, we have already \nprovided the additional $19 million in the recently enacted fiscal year \n2001 Supplemental Appropriation Act that gives the VA the ability to \nhire new claims processors immediately. So that is actually $151 \nmillion that we are putting into Veterans Affairs.\n  This funding will increase the VA's budget and allow the VA to hire \nmuch needed additional staff, increase training, and modernize and \nupgrade information technology. Specifically, the VA will be able to \nhire and train 890 new employees to help resolve the backlog of cases \nand handle new cases due to legislation, such as the ``duty to assist'' \nenacted last year. This is a significant hiring increase. Bringing on \nall these people is a tremendous workload for the personnel section. \nTherefore, we have questions as to whether they could do more. They \nhave outlined for us what they think is the optimum capacity for hiring \nnew personnel, bringing them on board, giving them the training so they \ncan accomplish the goal that Secretary Principi has sent down the pike \nfor the 100-day limit for the processing of claims.\n  Frankly, the money that the Senator from Arizona has proposed is not \nin his request. It has not been requested by the person who has to do \nthe job, who has to administer and make sure the money is well spent. \nFrankly, I believe we need to stay with the responsible work plan that \nthe Secretary has outlined.\n  Finally, let me talk about some of the rhetoric we have heard on \nporkbarrel. I come from a background of working in State government. \nOne of the most important things we can do for the people in our States \nis to assure that we have strong communities. That means education, \nhealth care, and housing. But it also means strong communities. I spent \na great deal of time, when I was Governor, working on how we develop \ncommunities, how we bring together the facilities that are needed to \nmake sure we have livable communities.\n  Now, housing, obviously, in this budget is second only in priorities \nto taking care of our veterans. Veterans are our first priority. \nHousing is second. Below that, is assuring that the communities have \nwhat they need to be strong communities. We need good communities to \nsupport good housing so families can raise their children in the proper \nsetting.\n  I am very pleased that we have been able to put money into community \ndevelopment. This is a very important priority. This is something that \nis recognized across this country and is strongly supported.\n  There is $5,012,993,000 going into the community development fund. \nThese funds go back and are administered by locally elected officials \nand State-elected officials--except for roughly 2.8 percent of those \nfunds that are allocated here.\n  Now, if you don't think any of these buildings or any community \ndevelopment activities should be carried forward, you could save $5 \nbillion by knocking out community development funds. Given the many, \nmany different objects for spending, I can assure you, as one who lives \nin a small town and who travels to communities of all sizes in our \nState, the community development activities are vitally important from \na governmental standpoint, from a quality-of-life standpoint, and from \nan economic development standpoint. They help draw and attract the \nkinds of economic activities and the kinds of community activities that \nare beneficial. I believe in them. I believe it works.\n\n  Community development block grant funds are extremely important, and \nI will strongly oppose anybody who wants to cut the $5 billion we put \ninto community development block grants.\n  It is easy to pick out a project that has been recommended here and \nincluded by an elected Senator--anything you want--that goes to a \ndifferent State than yours and call it ``pork.'' If it is in your own \nState, it is a ``strategic investment.'' How is that $5 billion \nallocated? It is allocated by elected officials. That is what this \nprocess of government is all about. It is a republican form of \ngovernment. They elect people at the local level and State level to \nmake decisions on how to spend the money that is raised in taxes. A \nsmall portion of it--$5 billion out of the total budget--goes to \ncommunity development.\n  Who is best to make these decisions? We say, by and large, the \ndecisions should be made at the local and State level. This is money \nthe Federal Government raises and sends back for community development. \nBut do the people who are elected to serve their States in the Senate \nknow what some of those priorities are? I happen to think they do. I \ntravel around my State, and I know the need and the opportunities that \neconomic development initiative grants and community development block \ngrants can meet. I think those are very important.\n  Do we make decisions on all these funds? No, only about 2.8 percent. \nI think that anybody in this body who takes their job seriously is \ngoing to be seeing needs in their States. They are going to have the \nability to identify improvements and projects or buildings that would \nbenefit the communities--particularly the communities most in need, the \ncommunities needing a handout.\n  I am proud to have been able to work with the Senator from Maryland \nand with most of my colleagues. The 1600 requests we had went to \ncommunities all over this Nation to try to provide some funds for the \ntop priorities as identified by our colleagues from the 50 States in \nthe Nation. I will be happy to discuss at any length the contention of \nthose who think that community development funds from the Federal \nGovernment through the community development block grant are not \nnecessary. They make a great difference, and I do not apologize for the \nfact that those elected by the voters of the 50 States ought to have a \nsay in allocating 2.8 percent of that.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the committee chairman and the \nranking member of the subcommittee for their commitment and adherence \nto the needs of our veterans. I appreciate it very much. I know that \nall veterans and all Americans do as well.\n  I point out that there was a $132 million addition for the VA, and it \nwas a $211 million addition over the President's budget for community \ndevelopment grants. I listened carefully to the comments by the Senator \nfrom Missouri about elected officials being wise enough to determine \nspending for projects in their own State. I wonder if that wisdom now \nresides in the Appropriations Committee, where 9 out of 10 of the \nearmarks came from. I am sorry the rest of us are not as well informed. \nIn fact, I read this: Missouri, 15 projects, the largest number of \nprojects, for $9.150 million. And, of course, we can go down the list \nof the Appropriations Committee: Maryland, 13 projects, $5.260 million; \nWest Virginia, $8 million; Alaska, $7.490 million. Of course, there is \na dramatic demarcation there between these funds and those who are not \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee.\n  That may be some coincidence. I believe $5 million is a very modest\n\n[[Page S8663]]\n\namount of money. I described the projects that half the money is taken \nfrom, and I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to

John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the one million members \n     and supporters of the Council for Citizens Against Government \n     Waste (CCAGW), I would like to express our support for your \n     efforts to reduce wasteful spending in the fiscal 02 \n     appropriations bill for the Departments of Veterans Affairs \n     and Housing and Urban Development (VA/HUD). Your leadership \n     on these issues is greatly appreciated.\n       Last year, CCAGW chronicled a record of 6,333 pork-barrel \n     items in spending for fiscal 01 that totaled $18.5 billion. \n     Congress seems to be on track to beat that dubious \n     achievement. Ignoring the absence of earmarks in this year's \n     House VA/HUD spending bill, the Senate exceeded the record \n     levels of last year and added 256 earmarks in Community \n     Development Block Grants (CDBGs), totaling $138 million.\n       Some examples of this self-indulgence include: $1,000,000 \n     for a multi-purpose center for the Southern New Mexico Fair \n     and Rodeo in Dona Ana County, New Mexico; $750,000 for \n     development of an arts center in Baltimore, Maryland; \n     $500,000 for the Idaho Virtual Incubator at Lewis and Clark \n     State College in Idaho; $350,000 for the Harbor Gardens \n     Greenhouse project in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; $300,000 for \n     a heritage trails project in Kauai, Hawaii; $300,000 for a \n     new facility for Studio for the Arts in Pocahontas, Arkansas; \n     $250,000 for the Culver City Theater Project in Culver City, \n     California; $100,000 for development assistance for the \n     Desert Space Station in Nevada; and $100,000 for the \n     development of the Alabama Quail Trail.\n       Your amendment will eliminate much of this egregious \n     spending and spare the taxpayers from being forced to pay for \n     the appropriators' largess. CCAGW applauds your efforts and \n     urges your colleagues to support your amendment. The vote on \n     your amendment will be among those considered for CCAGW's \n     annual Congressional Ratings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Thomas Schatz,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       [Citizens Against Government Waste release, July 26, 2001]\n\n Pork Alert: CAGW's Pork Patrol Takes a Closer Look at Fiscal 2002 VA/\n                                HUD Pork\n\n       Next week, the Senate is expected to consider the FY 2002 \n     appropriations bill for the Departments of Veterans Affairs \n     and Housing and Urban Development (VA/HUD). The Senate \n     ignored the House request of zero earmarks and picked up \n     beyond where they left off last year, adding 256 earmarks \n     totaling $138 million for the Community Development Block \n     Grant (CDBG) program in the bill. The 13 VA/HUD \n     Appropriations subcommittee members gobbled up 101 of those \n     earmarks (39 percent), totaling $54.7 million. The other 16 \n     Senate appropriators received another 104 earmarks (41 \n     percent), totaling $55.7 million. That means 29 percent of \n     the Senate would get 80 percent of the projects and dollars, \n     proving, once again, that appropriators abuse their \n     privileges. A few examples:\n       Taxpayers Left Out in the Cold, Alaska. Senate \n     Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Ted Stevens (R-\n     Alaska) earmarked $2.25 million for the city of Fairbanks to \n     provide winter recreation alternatives to military and \n     civilian residents. Sen. Stevens might just have asked \n     federal taxpayers to send their old sleds and ice skates up \n     north.\n       Leadership Has Its Privileges, Missouri. Senate VA/HUD \n     Appropriations Subcommittee Ranking Member Christopher \n     ``Kit'' Bond (R-Mo.) earmarked $7.1 million in CDBGs for his \n     home state, including: $1 million for the City Market \n     renovation project in Kansas City; $1 million for the \n     University of Missouri-Kansas City Life Sciences Initiative; \n     and, $250,000 to the city of St. Joseph for redevelopment of \n     its downtown area.\n       We Have Enough Bull, New Mexico. Cowboys, cotton candy, and \n     kicking bulls must be on the mind of VA/HUD Approriations \n     subcommittee member Pete Dominici (R-N.M.). The senator \n     earmarked $1 million for infrastructure improvements and for \n     a new multi-purpose and event center for the Dana County \n     Rodeo and Fair. YEE-HAW!\n       Out of This World, Nevada. As if the International Space \n     Station didn't cost enough, a new tribute to man's heavenly \n     aspirations is being built in the desert. Senate \n     Appropriations Committee member Harry Reid (D-Nev.) must be \n     seeing stars over the $100,000 that was earmarked for a \n     futuristic space museum in his home state. It won't fly with \n     taxpayers.\n       Not-so Bravo, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. \n     Appropriators are taking taxpayers to the cleaners and the \n     theater. Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont are slated to \n     receive a total of $1.1 million for the refurbishment of \n     theaters and performance centers. Although some theaters may \n     be historic, preserving the past probably took a back seat to \n     preserving their starring role on Capitol Hill for VA/HUD \n     Appropriations subcommittee member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and \n     Appropriations Committee members Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) and \n     Jack Reed (D-R.I.)\n       Taxpayer Always Comes Last, Nevada. Known for tourists, \n     gambling, and friendly service, Las Vegas has made a name for \n     itself with its billion-dollar hospitality industry. From \n     showgirls to costumed Romans, the customer always comes \n     first. The taxpayer, though, obviously comes last. Senate \n     Appropriations Committee member Harry Reid D-Nev.) gamble \n     away $700,000 for a hospitality training facility in Las \n     Vegas.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, we are coming now to the closing \nmoments of this bill. I know we are waiting for a clearance to take up \nthe manager's amendment, and we should be coming to that shortly. As \nsoon as we have cleared the manager's amendment, I will be offering it.\n\n[[Page S8664]]\n\n  As we go into the final minutes, I am going to make some final \ncomments on the bill. We have really done a good job, and we have done \na good job working on a bipartisan basis, working with President Bush \nand his Cabinet.\n  There are 13 appropriations subcommittees. The big three are Defense, \nLabor-HHS, and VA-HUD. VA-HUD spends $84 billion of the taxpayers' \nmoney. Of that, $51 billion goes to veterans, and it is worth every \nnickel of it. Housing and Urban Development receives $31 billion. A \nsubstantial amount of that goes to community development block grant \nmoney, which is decided by the local community: housing for the \nelderly, the special needs population, and housing for the poor. We \nhave tried to use the best ideas and the best practices to make sure \nsubsidies are not a way of life but a way to a better life. That is \nwhat we have concentrated on again in this bill.\n  We have the Environmental Protection Agency. We have worked to clean \nup the environment. We have the National Space Agency and the National \nScience Foundation, very important for public investments in new ideas, \nin new knowledge, which always leads to America being on the \ncompetitive edge and the cutting edge.\n  We try to inspire young people through a national service program \nwhere they get value by working in the community and taxpayers get \nvalue by the work they do, and we create the habits of the heart that \nhopefully will inspire the next generation to have the spirit of \nvoluntarism.\n  We think we have done a very good job in this bill. The reason we \nhave done a good job is cooperation, collegiality, courtesy, and \ncivility. I thank my ranking member, Senator Bond of Missouri, for the \nway we have worked together on this bill.\n  This has been a very difficult year. First, there was the delayed \ntransition of the executive branch. President Bush took office in a \ntimely manner, but because of the delayed transition we were late \ngetting started. The President was late getting started. We have worked \nto catch up, and he has given us some terrific Cabinet people to work \nwith in VA-HUD, our Secretary of Housing, and our Administrator of the \nEnvironment. I extolled the virtues of our Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  So many people think we are pretty prickly in politics, but we think \nwe have worked well with the Bush administration. I have been delighted \nat their courtesy.\n  It was the Senator from Missouri, when there was the transition of \npower with the Democrats taking control, who, with enormous \ngraciousness, provided practical help in transitioning the gavel to me. \nHe was so courteous and the transition so effective and so seamless, \nthat we did not miss a beat in terms of holding our hearings, trying to \nbe responsible to the needs of our communities, and trying to be \nresponsible to the needs of the taxpayer.\n  In the most sincere and genuine way, I want to thank my colleague for \nhis graciousness because I believe we have truly been able to serve the \npeople and serve the Nation.\n  He has an outstanding staff, and I want to thank them now:--Jon \nKamarck, Cheh Kim, and John Stoody--for their wonderful work with my \nstaff. I thank my staff--Paul Carliner, Gabrielle Batkin and Joel \nWidder, a detailee from the National Science Foundation--for the \noutstanding job they have done.\n\n  This committee has also had a tradition of bipartisanship. We have \nkept that tradition, and I think America benefits from it. As we now \ncome to these closing minutes, we will really be able to complete our \nbill with pride.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time to yield. The time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that I be granted 3 \nminutes in order to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Madam President, I congratulate the two Senators who have been \nmanaging this bill. I thank them for their vision with regard to \nAmerica's space program, and indeed I have entered into a written \ncolloquy with the Chair of the committee that will be inserted in the \nRecord. I want to take this opportunity to express my concern and share \nthat concern with the Chair and the ranking member of the committee. I \nhave been afraid there may be some attempt, because NASA has had almost \n$5 billion of overruns in the space station, that there may be some \nattempt to punish NASA by the administration.\n  I want to express my concern that if we starve NASA of the funds it \nneeds, particularly with regard to the space shuttle upgrades, that \ncould endanger the safety of the space shuttle program. I do not have \nto even conjecture further for the chairman and the ranking member that \nshould there be another catastrophe in the manned space flight program, \nthat could severely not only cripple but end the manned space flight \nprogram.\n  I thank the Chairman and the ranking member for recognizing space \nshuttle upgrades need to be addressed, not only in the bill but when we \ngo to conference. I want to state clearly and unequivocally we cannot \nstarve this space shuttle upgrade program, because if we do, we are \ngetting to the point of risking the safety of the crews we fly.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I assure the Senator from Florida that we are safety-\nobsessed when it comes to the safety of our astronauts. In this bill, \nwe have actually provided $3.2 billion for the shuttle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator would suspend, the Senator has \nused 3 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We agree. The Senator can count on it, and everyone \nshould know he is a Senator-astronaut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to make one additional comment to \nthe Senator from Florida for whom I have the highest respect, \nadmiration, and appreciation of his advocacy for the space program. I \nsay in all candor to the Senator from Florida, he knows these cost \noverruns go on and on. There is no one more qualified than the Senator \nfrom Florida to start exercising some fiscal discipline because we do \nnot have an unlimited amount of taxpayers' dollars.\n  Unfortunately, before the authorizing committee, the Director of NASA \nkeeps coming back and back saying: We have it under control; we keep \nimposing caps, and every year they tend to increase.\n  Madam President, I say to the Senator from Florida, whom I admire \nenormously, he is beginning to lose support when the costs just \ncontinue without any end in sight, and that should be of concern most \nof all to the Senator from Florida who is the advocate and spokesperson \nfor this very important part of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If I may respond----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 4 minutes. The \ntime of the Senator from Maryland has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Maryland and 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I will claim 1 minute. I say to my colleagues from \nArizona and Florida, first, on the cost overruns, Senator Bond and I \nabsolutely agree. The space station is running a $4 billion overrun. We \nwant to shake, rattle, and roll this culture of permissiveness with \nthese overruns. We are trying to work with the administration to deal \nwith it.\n  While we are dealing with that, though, we want to ensure for each \nand every mission that we can send our astronauts into space and return \nthem home safely and maintain our shuttle upgrades.\n  I yield back whatever time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator from Arizona for yielding \n2 minutes. I agree with him. It is inexcusable that there is the lack \nof discipline so that the overruns to the tune of $5 billion have \noccurred on the space station. I agree with Senator McCain on that.\n  The fact is, however, that the space shuttle account has been starved \n40 percent less over the last 10 years, and\n\n[[Page S8665]]\n\nwe cannot continue to rob from Peter to pay Paul in other parts of the \nprogram without endangering the safety of the program.\n  The Senator and I share the vision of this country. We share the \ncharacter of the American people, which is, by nature, we are \nexplorers; we are adventurers. We never want to give that up because if \nwe do, we are dead as a country; we are a second-rate country. We want \nto continue to explore into the unknown, but we have to do that with \nthe utmost of safety. We all suffered through the tragic explosion of \nthe 25th flight of the space shuttle, and from that we learned that we \nsimply have to have the two-way communication and we have to have \nadequate resources.\n  There is a plan over the next 10 years of upgrading the shuttle so \nthat it provides reliable and safe access to space, and that is what I \nam advocating.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nArizona has 1 minute 10 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida. It is \nappropriate to say, though, when he says the budget was starved, that \nbudget was recommended by NASA. We agreed to administration budget \nrequests, and we were told time after time they could live within those \nbudgets. I do not disagree with the Senator's depiction that the budget \nwas ``starved'' or reduced, but those were the budget requests to which \nwe agreed. Therefore, we have to get much more realistic estimates of \nthe costs so that we can plan on them and also impose fiscal \ndiscipline, which I think the Senator from Florida will agree with me \nis somewhat lacking, at least in comparison to the pledges they make to \nthe Congress of the United States.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida. I look forward to discussing this \nwith him in the committee and also on the floor. It is a very important \nissue and one to which we have not paid enough attention. Now that the \nSenator from Florida is here, I think we will be paying a lot more \nattention.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I move to table the McCain amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. Nickles, I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) is absent because of a death in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announed--yeas 69, nays 30, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 268 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--69\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--30\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Dayton\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nickles\n     Rockefeller\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Domenici\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment our two managers. We have \ncome a long way, and, I understand we are not far off from the point \nwhere we can have final passage. The managers have done an outstanding \njob. My hope is that we could go back on Agriculture.\n  I announce to my colleagues that we have two remaining pieces of \nbusiness. We have, of course, the Agriculture bill, and we have \nnominations that I would like to be able to take up and complete.\n  If there is any way we could finish it tonight, there would be no \nsession tomorrow. I hope, perhaps, we can all work together to see if \nthere might be a way to accomplish the rest of our work tonight. There \nis still plenty of time. Then we can go all make our plane reservations \nfor tomorrow. I announce that if there is a way to do it, we sure would \nlike to find a way.\n  Again, let me compliment our colleagues for getting us to this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the leader very much for those \nkind words.\n  I have a unanimous consent request, and then we will go to final \npassage.\n  Once again, I thank Senator Bond and his staff and my staff for their \ncooperation. I also thank Senator Harry Reid who helped us move the \namendment process.\n  As you noticed, this bill had a minimum, and we are proud of our \ncontent and proud of our process.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1338\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I send the VA-HUD managers' amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski), for herself and \n     Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 1338.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Alabama why he \nsurprised us.\n\n[[Page S8666]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we have to clarify one of the amendments \nthat we thought was cleared. We ask our colleagues to please stay \nbecause we think we will be able to clear it.\n  While we are doing this clarification with our colleague from \nAlabama, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmanagers' amendment, as previously offered, with the deletion of the \nLott amendment, be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1338) was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me express my sincere appreciation for \nthe work of the chair of the committee. She has done an excellent job \nby making sure everybody knows what is going on. We have taken care of \nmany of the problems and challenges that arise in this bill. I thank \nher for the tremendous cooperation she has provided us throughout.\n  She said some kind words about collegiality, but on this side, what \nwe know about collegiality we have learned from the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland, which she has shown us in the past, on how to \nwork effectively, both as chair and ranking member. It is my great \npleasure to work with her. And I share her enthusiasm for cleaning up \nthe Chesapeake Bay. I assure you, Mr. President, it is one of my \nhighest priorities.\n  I express my appreciation to Senator Mikulski's staff: Paul Carliner, \nGabrielle Batkin, Joel Widder; and, obviously, to my staff: Jon \nKamarck, Cheh Kim, and John Stoody. They have made a very difficult \nbill work well.\n  I hope now that we can accept this bill and send it on to conference. \nI appreciate the work and accommodation of all of our colleagues who \nwere kind and understanding to know why we could not take all 1,600 \nproposed amendments worth $22 billion to add on to the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1214\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 1214, \nas amended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1214), in the nature of a substitute, was agreed \nto.\n\n\n                     epa's regulation of pesticides\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two important \nissues facing agriculture and EPA's regulation of the use of \npesticides.\n  First, as my colleagues know, 1996 capped a major shift in pesticide \npolicy in this country with the unanimous passage by this House of the \nFood Quality Protection Act (FQPA). This act, which was later signed \ninto law, provided new protections for infants, children, and other \nsubpopulations potentially vulnerable to the effects of pesticide \nresidues.\n  That act accelerated a trend in our country to move toward safer, \nreduced risk pesticides. It is important that all pesticides on the \nmarket meet FQPA's safety standards, and safer products allow farmers \nand others to better protect public health and safeguard our \nenvironment. It is a winning situation for everyone. Ensuring that \neffective, reduced risk pesticides continue to come to market is \nessential to ensuring that farmers and others continue to have a \ncomplete, effective, and affordable toolbox to address pest issues \nfacing agriculture, industry, and our urban areas.\n  An additional $5 million is needed to adequately support the \nregistration of additional safer, reduced risk compounds. I would ask \nthat this need be considered when this bill goes to conference.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator from Iowa yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be happy to yield to my friend from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I wanted to commend the Senator for bringing this matter \nto the attention of the Senate. It is my understanding that, in the \nlast few years, over half of the applications received by EPA for new \npesticides are for reduced risk, safer products.\n  In addition, there is a commitment by everyone, environmental groups, \nindustry, farmers, and others, that it is important to review the older \npesticides to ensure they meet today's higher health and safety \nstandards.\n  Given that some of the older pesticides have had their uses adjusted \nas a result of FQPA, this additional money will help ensure that our \nfarmers have a complete tool box to control the pests that threaten our \nagriculture. It will help bring new, cost-effective products to market \nand will help provide adequate alternatives for farmers.\n  It also helps ensure that farmers have the tools they need to \ncontinue to provide a safe and abundant supply of food. I want to \nexpress my support for these additional funds as well.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Idaho for his support and his \nhelp on this issue. He and I have worked together closely on several \npesticide issues over the years on the VA/HUD subcommittee, and I \nalways value his insights into agricultural issues facing this body.\n  The second issue I wanted to discuss involves EPA's pesticide \nevaluation process. Making evaluations of a particular pesticide's \nsafety requires complex scientific analyses that ultimately depend on \nhaving complete and reliable data to base the analyses upon. Data that \nyou need include pesticide residues in food and water and exposures to \napplicators and farm workers, among others.\n\n  While EPA's ability to conduct through scientific analyses on \npossible pesticide exposures from drinking water and to farm workers \nhas improved, additional work remains to be done.\n  I am urging that the conference committee consider including an \nadditional $1 million for this purpose.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Again, I commend my colleague for bringing this matter to \nour attention.\n  It is my understanding that this additional money could be used by \nEPA in a collaborative way between industry and the environmental \ncommunity to strengthen EPA's information and assessment techniques.\n  Better data, with enhanced methods to evaluate potential pesticide \nexposures, will result in more accurate and scientifically sound risk \nassessments, thereby contributing to better quality decisions by EPA.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague from Iowa to include \nthese funds in the final conference report.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If the gentlemen will yield, I thank the Senators for \ntheir discussion. Reduced-risk pesticides can provide farmers and \nothers with alternative pesticides that may present lower risks to \npublic health and the environment, and can help ensure that farmers \ncontinue to have the tools they need. Also, given the difficult task \nthat EPA faces in making timely, scientific decision about pesticides, \nproviding the tools that EPA needs to improve its decision making \nshould be a high priority.\n  I will work to ensure that these items receive every appropriate \nconsideration as the VA/HUD bill moves forward.\n  Mr. BOND. I rise in support of the statements by my colleagues Mr. \nCraig and Mr. Harkin, I have a longstanding interest in ensuring that \npesticides meet FQPA's safety standards based on factual, reliable \nscientific data. The additional funding discussed by Mr. Craig and Mr. \nHarkin for strengthening EPA's scientific analysis on\n\n[[Page S8667]]\n\nworker exposure and drinking water would also help enhance sound \nscientific decisions by EPA. Moreover, the additional funding for \nfaster review and approval of reduced risk pesticides will enable these \nproducts to be on the market sooner, and help ensure that farmers and \nothers have a complete tool box to control pests that attack their \ncrops and threaten public health.\n  I look forward to working with Mr. Craig, Mr. Harkin, and Ms. \nMikulski to consider these additional funds in the conference report.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to thank the distinguished chair and ranking \nmember of the VA/HUD Subcommittee for their consideration. I am also \nhopeful that we will be able to agree upon a legislative package that \nwill address several issues with pesticide fees currently facing the \nEPA and chemical industry. The Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, and I \nhave been working together in the Agriculture Committee to come up with \nlong-term fix for several pesticide fee provisions that expire this \nyear.\n  I am very hopeful that this work could lead to an agreement that \ncould help resolve issues that are likely to arise in conference on the \nVA/HUD bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would like to commend Senators Harkin and Lugar for \ntheir work in the Agriculture Committee on pesticide fees.\n  As they and my colleagues know, the legal authorization for the \ncollection of fees from pesticide manufacturers soon expires. The \nexpiration of the so-called maintenance fee authorization will mean \nthat EPA will face a significant funding shortfall as it attempts to \nimplement FQPA.\n  There has been a widespread consensus in Congress to prevent the \ntolerance fee rule from taking effect. We have postponed the rule for 2 \nconsecutive years, and another year postponement is included in this \nbill, as well as the House's version. I would urge the Senate to follow \nthe House's action and reauthorize maintenance fees at $20 million for \nfiscal year 2002. I would hope this is the first year of a multi-year \nfix. This would help maintain the critical base funding necessary to \nensure that FQPA protections for public health are realized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague from Idaho for putting his finger on \nexactly why it is so important to come to a resolution on these \npesticide fee issues.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would like to thank the Senators Harkin and Lugar for \ntheir efforts and leadership on this issue. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to find an agreement that is acceptable to all \nparties on pesticide fees.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I want to thank the Senators from Iowa and Idaho for \ntheir remarks. You've laid out the issues regarding pesticide fees and \nEPA funding very well, and I look forward to working with them and the \nSenator from Missouri to resolve them.\n  Mr. REID. As we have discussed, the legal authorization for the \ncollection of fees from pesticide manufacturers soon expires. The \nexpiration of the so-called maintenance fee authorization will mean \nthat EPA will face a significant funding shortfall as it attempts to \nmeet important FQPA pesticide protections for children. EPA is far \nbehind the schedule we set for them in that unanimously adopted law. \nThis means that the important FQPA provisions we wrote 5 years ago to \nprotect children from the dangers posed by toxic pesticides are still \nnot being fully implemented.\n\n  At a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing on EPA's \nproposed budget, EPA Administrator Whitman testified that she supported \nthese important protections. She has taken additional steps during her \ntenure which demonstrate her support in concrete ways. At the hearing, \nthe Administrator recognized that the shortfall I've mentioned above \nwould cause a reduction of 200 EPA employees dedicated to making sure \nour pesticide standards protect kids. She promised that those \nreductions would absolutely not occur.\n  To her credit, Administrator Whitman testified that this shortfall \nwould not be realized because she pledged to complete the so-called \ntolerance fee rule proposed during the Clinton administration. The \nadministration to its credit also took this position in its budget. The \ntolerance rule would provide roughly $51 million in fees to support and \naccelerate FQPA work. That was an important statement. It was an \naffirmation of FQPA's provisions that the costs of pesticide programs \nshould be paid for by the pesticide industry rather than by the \ntaxpayer. I look forward to working with the Administration to follow \nthrough on its pledge.\n  Recognizing, however, that it may be difficult to complete that \nrulemaking on schedule, it is extremely important that we extend the \nmaintenance fee authorization in conference to ensure that EPA has the \nfunds to at least continue their current level of work. I would \nunderscore the remarks of my colleague from Idaho that this \nauthorization needs to include an increase so that funding meets at \nleast the $20 million level.\n  Will my colleague from Maryland work in conference to ensure that EPA \nis provided with the critical base funding for FQPA children's health \nprotections by supporting the extension of such fees?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I want to thank the Senator from Nevada for raising \nthis issue. I look forward to working with him as well to resolve this \nissue in conference.\n\n\n                                NESCAUM\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nmanager of the bill in a brief colloquy regarding funding for the \nNortheast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM). As she \nknows, for many years now, NESCAUM has received support in the VA-HUD \nconference reports. The $300,000 in funds provided in previous \nSubcommittee bills has enabled the organization to do outstanding work \nthat is helping to protect the health and welfare of citizens in \nVermont and the Northeast from air pollution.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I would like to echo the words of my \ncolleague from Vermont. As Senators Bond and Mikulski know, I have \nsupported funding for NESCAUM before and would hope that we can \ncontinue that at current levels in the fiscal year 2002 bill. The \norganization is very important to developing workable and cost-\neffective air pollution control strategies in the Northeast. I \nencourage the Chair to continue that past support.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I appreciate the views of the chairman and ranking \nMember of the authorizing committee. As they have indicated, NESCAUM \nhas received support from the subcommittee from the past and I will \nensure that it receives every appropriate consideration as we move \nforward.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Chair for her consideration.\n\n\n          National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished Senator from Maryland and chairman of the VA-HUD-\nIndependent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. As the Senator knows, \nseveral years ago, NASA established the National Space Biomedical \nResearch Institute (NSBRI) to enlist the broad scientific community in \nthe effort to develop solutions to the health-related problems and \nphysical and psychological challenges men and women will face on long-\nduration space flights. These 2 to 3 year missions will one day allow \nastronauts to travel to other planets and explore our solar system. The \nInstitute also investigates ways to deliver medical care on these \nmissions through new technologies and remote treatment advances. While \naddressing these space issues, the NSBRI plans to rapidly transfer \ndiscoveries that will also benefit human health on Earth.\n  As the distinguished Senator knows, the NSBRI is headquartered in \nHouston, TX at the Baylor College of Medicine. Eleven other prestigious \nresearch organizations make up the 12-member consortium of NSBRI \nInstitutions, including the renowned Johns Hopkins University in \nMaryland. If we are to meet our established goals for human space \nflight and the continued exploration of the final frontier, we must \nbetter understand the physiological and psychological effects of space \ntravel on the brave men and women who we launch into space. The NSBRI \nis the primary institution charged with this task.\n\n[[Page S8668]]\n\n  I know that the Senator from Maryland shares my concern that NSBRI \nreceive adequate funding. I have been informed that in order to fully \nfund current NSBRI research projects, an increase above the president's \nFiscal Year 2002 budget is required.\n  I ask the Senator from Maryland to work with me in ensuring that \nNSBRI is provided with an increase in funding for NSBRI within the \navailable amounts appropriated in the bill.\n  Mr. MIKULSKI. I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas, and I \nshare her concern for the brave men and women who risk their lives to \nachieve the national goals that we have established for space travel. I \nagree that the health effects of these travels must be better \nunderstood, and that we should not endanger our astronauts who engage \nin long-term space travel without fully understanding the effects such \ntravel has on the human body.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for raising this important issue, and \nI offer my commitment to work with her to provide the NSBRI with the \nresources to achieve the goals we both share.\n\n\n         philadelphia's neighborhood transformation initiative\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to enter into a \ncolloquy with Senator Bond to discuss efforts to assist the city of \nPhiladelphia in its Neighborhood Transformation Initiative. On Monday, \nJuly 30, 2001, I met with Mayor John Street for an hour and a half \nregarding this initiative, which seeks to eliminate ``blight'' in the \ncity of Philadelphia as well as focus on the elements that are \nessential for a neighborhood to thrive. These elements include the \ndevelopment of recreational facilities, retail opportunities, \ntransportation, secure streets, cultural outlets and quality schools. I \nwas very impressed with Mayor Street's plan to transform the city. I \nbelieve that the city is on the right track and could provide the \nprototype for addressing overall blight that plagues so many American \nneighborhoods.\n  In order to assist Philadelphia in reducing inner city blight, I aim \nto provide even greater flexibility in the use of CDBG funds. I believe \nthis increased flexibility is imperative in order for the city to \ndevelop a long-term plan with a predictable funding stream.\n  Additionally, I understand that there may be additional funds \navailable in the HUD Neighborhood Initiative program when the VA/HUD \nappropriations bill goes to conference. I would appreciate any funds \nthat may be available for implementation of the city of Philadelphia's \nblight removal plan.\n  Mr. BOND. I understand that like so many neighborhoods in large urban \ncities, the neighborhoods in the city of Philadelphia have been \ndevastated by depopulation and that other Philadelphia neighborhoods \nare experiencing the initial signs of decline with stagnant or \ndeclining property values, rising crime, and a breakdown in public \ninfrastructure. Still, other neighborhoods are largely stable, but are \nhardly flourishing.\n  I respect what the Senator from Pennsylvania seeks to accomplish with \nthese provisions. The CDBG is a flexible block grant program used by \nStates and communities for critical projects such as affordable \nhousing, economic development, and human service projects. Last year \nthe committee provided approximately $5 billion for the program. While \nthis program is already a very flexible program, I am happy to work \nwith the Senator from Pennsylvania to assist the city of Philadelphia \nto use CDBG funding to develop a long-term blight removal plan.\n  I understand that the city of Philadelphia is in dire need of \nneighborhood development and blight removal, and I would be glad to \nwork with the Senator from Pennsylvania in conference to try to secure \nfunding under the Neighborhood Initiative effort for this meritorious \nprogram.\n\n\n                                  NASA\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, one of the agencies funded in \nthis bill is particularly important to me and to my constituents in \nFlorida: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA \nsupports programs that invest in our Nation's future. At present, \nNASA's most significant and visible investment is the International \nSpace Station. But, we have a problem on our hands: The Space Station \nis now expected to cost almost $5 billion dollars more than projected \njust a few months ago. If we are going to complete this project, we \nhave to find the money somewhere. Does the Senator agree?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I wholeheartedly agree. We must complete this project. \nIt is an investment in our children's future. This laboratory of the \nheavens will allow us to conduct research in tissue growth, looking at \nthe causes of cancer and potential medical treatments. We are going to \ninvestigate new drugs, and develop a whole new understanding of the \nbuilding blocks of life. Using the microgravity environment of space, \nour industries will develop new advanced materials that may lead to \nstronger, lighter metals and more powerful computer chips. The station \nwill also house experiments in combustion science, that could lead to \nreduced emissions from power plants and automobiles, saving consumers \nbillions of dollars. And these are just a few of the possibilities. At \nthe same time, I am deeply disturbed about the recent cost overruns in \nthe Space Station program. We have to find funds to complete the \nstation, and as Chair of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, I attempted to \nbalance this need with those of other programs within the agency.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator, and agree with her that \nrecently announced ISS cost increases are disturbing. Funding these \ncost overruns without adding more money to NASA's budget--as the Bush \nAdministration has proposed--necessitates cutting many of NASA's \nprograms, and possibly endangering the future viability of the station \nitself. At the same time, there are many other worthwhile projects \nbeing conducted at NASA--that have nothing to do with the space \nstation--such as research in extra-galactic astronomy using the Hubble \nSpace Telescope, global climate change research by remotely sensing the \nEarth, and launch technology development that could decrease the cost \nof getting to space by a factor of 10 or more. Not to mention the other \nhuman space flight programs impacted by station cost overruns. Cuts to \nthe Space Shuttle Program may have catastrophic consequences. We have \nto continue supporting these and other projects, but where will all the \nmoney come from? I recognize that this situation has tied the hands of \nappropriators in both chambers, and applaud the efforts of Senators \nMikulski and Bond, as well as Representatives Walsh and Mollohan in the \nHouse, in attempting to solve this problem. While the Chambers are far \napart in their approaches, I understand that Senator Mikulski plans to \nwork with conferees to support a combination of the priorities in each \nbill. Is this correct?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator is correct. The committee has endorsed the \nprojects included in the bill's report. At the same time, I also \nrecognize the need to support some of the priorities that were endorsed \nby the House. I plan to press for a marriage of the two bills during \nconference, combining the priorities of each Chamber. In fact, during \nthis year's appropriations process, I have especially appreciated the \ninput of Senator Nelson, as I believe that the combined interests of \nhis constituents in Florida, and my own constituents in Maryland best \nrepresent the diversity of programs supported by NASA. Although \nprograms in Florida largely focus on human space flight and supporting \na robust commercial space industry, and programs in Maryland center \naround the remote sensing of Earth and exploring our own solar system, \nwe both believe in doing everything we can to support a robust civilian \nspace program for our Nation and the world. For this reason, I look \nforward to continuing to work with Senator Nelson and his staff in best \nrepresenting the interests of both of our constituencies, as well as \nthose of the rest of my colleagues.\n  Mr. NELSON. I thank the distinguished Senator. I appreciate her \nsupport and that of her staff on this issue, and look forward to \ncontinuing to work with her.\n\n\n                      International Space Station\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with \nthe Senator from Maryland and chairwoman of the VA-HUD-Independent\n\n[[Page S8669]]\n\nAgencies Appropriations Subcommittee concerning the International Space \nStation and NASA's funding.\n  We are both concerned about the recently projected cost growth for \nthe International Space Station. I support a space station that is \nfully functioning, and in order to achieve that goal, NASA must work \nwithin the budget that Congress has given it. At the same time, I \nunderstand the difficulty in estimating the costs of such an amazing \nengineering feat. We are now within a year of the station being ``core \ncomplete,'' and I believe Congress must adequately fund the station so \nthat we can begin to see the benefits of its unique scientific \nresearch.\n  NASA's projected 5-year cost growth of over $4 billion includes many \nprogram liens that reflect 2 years of actual operational experience for \nthe station. That on-orbit experience has eliminated many unknowns and \nhas significantly enhanced NASA's awareness of what it takes to operate \nthe space station. Unfortunately, the greater awareness has come a \nprice tag that threatens reaching the full capability of the space \nstation as originally planned in terms of research, a permanent crew of \nsix, and a crew rescue vehicle.\n  I understand NASA is dealing with the budgetary challenges and has \nproposed a ``core complete'' plan for the station to stay within budget \nconstraints. Importantly, NASA and OMB have put into place an \nindependent external review board to assess the space station's budget \nand to assure the station will provide maximum benefit to the U.S. \ntaxpayer. This external review board will evaluate the costs and \nbenefits for enhancing research, a habitation module for a crew of six \nand a crew rescue vehicle.\n  Does the Senator agree it is important in conference that we not \npreclude the full review of these potential enhancements by the \nindependent external review board, and not preclude the ability of NASA \nto undertake these enhancements, in order to ensure the originally \nplanned capability for the space station?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am concerned about the continued cost overruns on the \nspace station and the lack of real urgency at NASA to really get the \nstation budget under control. We have to send NASA a message that it \ncannot keep spending more and more money that is meant for other \nprograms. The committee supports administration's objectives of reining \nin station cost growth, reforming program management to avoid cost \noverruns in the future, and creating an independent panel to validate \nthe budget estimates and management reforms. The external review \ncommittee will present its recommendations this fall to address the \nspace station funding problem. We are, necessarily, in a ``wait and \nsee'' mode until NASA and OMB give us a new plan that will be the \nresult of the independent external review.\n  I agree that we should not take any action that would prevent the \nachievement of the original scientific mission of the station. Despite \nthe space station funding challenge, the committee is committed to \ncompleting the station: one that is capable of supporting world-class \nresearch.\n  But let me say, I will ensure that the space station problems do not \nthreaten NASA's science programs. We can never shortchange safety or \nthe science, and I'm afraid with the overruns we are going to be \nshortchanging science.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator and would like to reassert that I \ndo not disagree with what you said about the real concerns with cost \noverruns that, it unchecked, will limit the space station's ability to \nperform as intended. I want to work with you to make sure that we do \nnot cut off capabilities of the space station, and thereby never see \nthe scientific contributions for which we have already made a \nsignificant investment.\n\n\n                         VETERANS' HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Maryland, the \nchair of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, to enter into a colloquy.\n  I had intended to offer an amendment to the bill before us to \nincrease the spending for veterans' health care.\n  I think the need is there, as the President's budget plainly shows \nthat next year VA will need nearly $1 billion to cover the cost of \npayroll and inflation. But the President's budget only provided an \nadditional $800 million.\n  VA needs additional funding to pay for the long-term care needs of an \naging population, emergency care coverage in non-VA hospitals, \nhepatitis C treatment, and new outpatient clinics.\n  I do understand the very restrictive allocation that Senator \nMikulski's subcommittee faces--due to a budget resolution not of her \nown making. Because of that, I have decided against offering my \namendment, but I would like to ask the Senator a question.\n  Toward the end of the year, I feel certain that Congress will need to \nrevisit various spending bills. I feel strongly that one of the areas \nwhich should receive more attention at that time is VA health care. I \nask, therefore, for the Senator's assurance that we can go back and add \nadditional funding for VA health care.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The subcommittee recognizes that increased funding for \nVA healthcare is very important to keeping our promises to our nation's \nveterans.\n  Within our allocation, which was very tight, we were able to provide \n$21.4 billion for VA medical care. This is $1.1 billion above the \nfiscal year 2001 level, $400 million above the President's request, and \n$100 million above the House.\n  The VA also retains copayments from veterans and third-party health \ninsurance. CBO estimates that these will provide an additional $900 \nmillion for VA medical care in fiscal year 2002.\n  VA will also carry over $882 million in unobligated medical care \nfunding from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2002.\n  This level of funding will allow VA to open at least 33 more \ncommunity based outpatient clinics, and improve waiting times for \nveterans to receive care.\n  We also provide $390 million for VA medical and prosthetic research. \nThis is $40 million above the fiscal year 2001 level, and $30 million \nabove the President's request. This funding is critical to making more \nprogress in: One, recruiting and retaining high quality medical \nprofessionals; two, the treatment of chronic diseases; three, diagnosis \nand treatment of degenerative brain diseases like Alzheimers and \nParkinsons; and four, research involving special populations, \nespecially those who suffer from spinal cord injury, stroke, nervous \nsystem diseases, and post traumatic stress disorder.\n  So within our tight allocation, the subcommittee was able to keep our \npromises to our nation's veterans.\n  But we recognize that there is always more we can do.\n  So I assure Senator Rockefeller that within our available resources \nwe will continue to do all we can to meet the needs of our Nation's \nveterans, and keep the promises we made to them.\n\n\n      Establishment of an Outpatient Clinic in Passaic County, NJ\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. president, I request unanimous consent to engage \nthe distinguished chairwoman of the VA/HUD appropriations Subcommittee \nin a colloquy about a critical health care matter facing the veterans \nin my State of New Jersey.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would be happy to accommodate my colleague from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank my distinguished colleague from Maryland. In \nmy State of New Jersey, the veterans population is facing an epidemic \nin receiving the health care services they need. They have earned these \nhealth care benefits by virtue of their service to our country in the \nArmed Forces, and I believe, as many other Members of this body \nbelieve, that we should make every effort to ensure that the men and \nwomen who have served their country in times of war should have access \nto quality and dependable health care when they need it.\n  The problems that the veterans of New Jersey come across in receiving \nthe care that they need are many. Each year, under the Veterans Service \nIntegrated Network, our region has been seeing its veterans health care \nfunding dwindle as it is reallocated to other parts of the country. \nThis means that there are fewer hospital beds, fewer doctors, fewer \nnurses, and fewer support staff members to respond to the needs of the \n750,000 veterans who still live in New Jersey.\n  This also means that there are fewer facilities where veterans can go \nto get checkups, prescriptions for much needed drugs or therapy and \nrehabilitation for ailments incurred during their service.\n\n[[Page S8670]]\n\n  Indeed, a veteran in New Jersey who puts in a request to have a \nroutine checkup may have to wait several months before they receive an \nappointment. I cannot overstate the critical situation that thousands \nof New Jersey veterans face each day. There is a severe backlog of \nappointments at all of the New Jersey's veterans hospitals and \noutpatient clinics and unless this matter is addressed in the near \nfuture, the problem will only become more acute.\n  Earlier this year, I met with members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars \nfrom New Jersey. In our conversation, they stated that one of the ways \nwe can alleviate the current problem being faced by the veterans in our \nstate is to establish a new outpatient clinic in Passaic County, NJ. \nThis new clinic could provide services to veterans throughout the \nnorthern part of my state where a large concentration of veterans live. \nCurrently, many veterans in this region of New Jersey have to travel \nlong distances to get health care, some even as far as New York City.\n  The House VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee agreed with the merits \nof establishing a new outpatient clinic in Passaic County, and \nencouraged the VA to establish one there. It is my hope that the \nmembers of the Senate will recognize this need as well and encourage \nthe VA to locate a new outpatient clinic in Passaic County. It will \nprovide a great measure of relief to a veterans population that has \nbeen underserved for many years.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his thoughts on \nthis matter.\n\n\n                    mooresville, nc library project\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Senator Mikulski, you have made available $140,000,000 \nfor the Economic Development Initiative (EDI) to finance a variety of \neconomic development efforts. I want to make you and your committee \naware of a project I think is worthy of an EDI grant.\n  The town of Mooresville, NC is in dire need of assistance in \nrebuilding its library. The current library has more than 60,000 books, \ndespite the fact that it was built to hold only 26,000. The Town plans \nto add 20,000 square feet to house library materials as well as \ncommunity room as well as a large research and reference area. The \nlibrary is on the National Register of Historic Landmarks. I am certain \nthis project will contribute to the overall revitalization of the \nneighborhood.\n  I am certain the Senator would agree that the Mooresville project is \na worthwhile investment. I respectfully ask you to urge members of the \nconference committee to provide $1 million in EDI funds for the \nMooresville library project.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for bringing \nthis project to the committee's attention. The subcommittee will give \nit every appropriate consideration as we move forward.\n\n\n                   state and tribal assistance grants\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith Senator Mikulski, the chair of the VA, HUD, and Independent \nAgencies Subcommittee.\n  As the Senator is aware, I have always been a supporter of the State \nand Tribal Assistance Grants program administered by the Environmental \nProtection Agency. Over the years, the STAG program has provided \nmillions of dollars to many of the rural communities throughout the \nState for wastewater treatment, waters systems, and programs designed \nto improve air quality.\n  For good reason, this program is tremendously popular with Members \nand I know that the chairwoman receives far more requests for funding \nthat she can possibly accommodate.\n  However, I would like to ask my friend to consider two STAG grant \nrequests for the State of Nevada should additional funds become \navailable to the subcommittee in conference.\n  The first involves funding for restoration of the Las Vegas Wash. As \nmy friend knows, the Las Vegas is the primary wetland area in southern \nNevada that filters the drinking water that supplies Las Vegas and the \nrapidly growing areas around it. For several years, the local, State, \nand Federal governments have been working cooperatively--a remarkable \nsuccess story--to restore and protect these wetlands. This STAG grant \nwill allow this important work to continue.\n  The second request is for Lake Tahoe. As the Senator from Maryland \nknows, I have always marveled at her commitment and dedication to \nsaving the Chesapeake Bay. I have similar passion for protecting and \nrestoring the Jewel of the High Sierra's, Lake Tahoe. The relatively \nmodest STAG grant I am seeking for Lake Tahoe will provide funding for \na series of air and water quality projects that will contribute to \nfulfilling the requirements of the Lake Tahoe Environmental Improvement \nProgram, a 10 year Federal, State, local, and private sector blueprint \nfor saving Lake Tahoe.\n  All I ask is that my friend and colleague give these two requests her \nconsideration during the House-Senate conference committee.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the distinguished assistant majority leader for \nhis thoughtful words. I agree that the two matters you have brought to \nmy attention are important and worthy. Senator Bond, our ranking \nmember, and I will certainly work with the House conferees and consider \nthese grant requests for funding.\n\n\n               sewer infrastructure funding for michigan\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the fiscal year \n2002 Appropriations Act for VA/HUD and Independent Agencies, which \nincludes funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, I wonder if \nthe distinguished Senator from Maryland would be willing to consider in \nconference funding for sewer projects in Michigan.\n  In Michigan, we are facing an urgent need to maintain and improve our \naging sewer systems. In southeast Michigan alone this will cost between \n$14 and $26 billion over the next 30 years. I would greatly appreciate \nthe committee's assistance in protecting water quality in Michigan by \nfunding these much-needed sewer projects.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. So many of our communities are facing enormous funding \nneeds to upgrade aging wastewater infrastructure, including Michigan \ncommunities, and we regret that we could not fund the new combined \nsewer overflow program within existing funding constraints. The Senator \nfrom Michigan's request will receive every appropriate consideration as \nwe move forward.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Maryland and the committee for \ntheir hard work in putting together this important legislation.\n\n\n               georgia community redevelopment initiative\n\n  Mr. MILLER. I rise to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished \nsubcommittee chairwoman about a very important community development \ninitiative taking place within the great State of Georgia.\n  First, I thank the distinguished subcommittee chairwoman for her \ncontinued support of community redevelopment and empowering \nneighborhoods. Additionally Senator Mikulski, through her tenure as \nranking member and now chair, has always made education one of her top \npriorities.\n  In my State of Georgia, three institutions of higher education, which \nare also Historically Black Colleges and Universities, are \nparticipating in a group community redevelopment initiative. Morehouse \nCollege, the Morehouse School of Medicine and Spelman College have \nformed a nonprofit corporation--College Partners, Inc.--and are working \nwith the city of Atlanta in a land acquisition deal. The deal will \nresult in the expansion of the Atlanta University Center, AUC, space, \nas well as surrounding community development and revitalization.\n  The West End community, which sits at the boundary of these AUC \ncampuses, has been unable to significantly capitalize on the renewed \ninterest in residential and commercial development within the Atlanta \narea. This community has high unemployment, low educational attainment, \ndeteriorating and/or vacant housing, and a preponderance of families \nthat live at or below the Federal poverty level. All of this exists \nless than three miles from downtown Atlanta, where there sits prime \ncommercial developments.\n  Acquisition of the land in question will allow the campuses to expand \nand enable the surrounding community development process to continue \nand remain on target with the objectives of the city's empowerment \nzone, which already has improved the neighborhoods east and north of \nthe campuses.\n\n[[Page S8671]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I appreciate very much the comments from the Senator \nfrom Georgia. How will the surrounding neighborhood benefit from the \nresult of the land acquisition?\n  Mr. MILLER. Each participating school, which are all currently land-\nlocked, will be able to expand their capabilities and establish and/or \nexpand programs in their particular areas of expertise. But what makes \nthe initiative so worthwhile is that the program expansion will move \nbeyond the confines of the institutions and out into the community. For \ninstance, Morehouse College will continue its partnership with Fannie \nMae Foundation and HUD to provide leadership training to community \norganizers, local nonprofit organizations, and members of the \nNeighborhood Planning Units. Morehouse also plans to establish a \ncharter school. Morehouse School of Medicine will be expanding its \nCommunity Health and Preventive Medicine Programs, as well as expand an \ninitiative to stimulate the interest of and introduce minority \nelementary and middle school students to medical and science careers \nearly in their education. Finally, Spelman College plans to provide \nlocal residents with training in early childhood development and \nchildcare while simultaneously providing a hands-on laboratory for \nstudent education majors. In addition to the request for the CPI \nproject, as we have discussed, Spelman College is seeking additional \nfunds to renovate one of their primary buildings, Packard Hall, and \ninclude its use in the larger community revitalization efforts. \nSpecifically, $1 million is sought from the Economic Development \nInitiatives account in your bill for each of these projects, for a \ntotal of $2 million. This funding is urgently needed to ensure the \ncompletion of this vital community development initiative.\n  I hope that language for both College Partners, Inc., and Spelman \nCollege can be included in the conference report for these initiatives \nthat work to further community revitalization and educational \nattainment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I appreciate the inquiry from the Senator from Georgia \nand the subcommittee will work with him and Mr. Cleland to ensure that \nthese initiatives receive every appropriate consideration as we move \nforward.\n\n\n          Acquisition and Revitalization of Atlanta's West End\n\n  Mr. Cleland. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, the chairman of the Subcommittee, \nMs. Mikulski, regarding a joint collaboration between three of \nGeorgia's finest academic institutions, Morehouse School of Medicine, \nMorehouse College and Spelman College. As the Senator is aware, these \nneighboring institutions have come together for the purpose of \nacquiring and revitalizing an 11 acre parcel of land in Atlanta's West \nEnd community that is contiguous to all three schools. The acquisition \nof this land is critical to the future success of each institution, due \nto the fact that all three schools are essentially landlocked.\n  The acquisition of this property will enable each school to \nsignificantly expand their education and community based programs, as \nwell as contribute to the revitalization of Atlanta's West-End \nCommunity. All three institutions are working very hard to secure \nprivate resources for this project. However, given the scope of this \ninitiative, the schools are also seeking federal support from the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development's Economic Development \nInitiative program.\n  I applaud the Chairman for her leadership in promoting community \nrevitalization programs in the VA-HUD appropriations bill. I would ask \nthe Chairman if she would give every consideration to supporting the \nimportant initiative I have just described in the upcoming conference \nwith the House on the VA-HUD bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am aware of the joint collaboration between these \nthree Historically Black institutions in Atlanta, and I applaud their \neffort to contribute to the revitalization of Atlanta's West-End \nCommunity. I would tell the Senator that during the development of this \nyear's bill, we received a large number of meritorious requests for \nprojects within HUD's Economic Development Initiative account--\nincluding the project he just described. With respect to the \nconference, I can assure my friend from Georgia that this project will \nreceive every appropriate consideration.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the gentlelady for her leadership and look \nforward to working with her as the process moves forward.\n\n\n                              Spina Bifida\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention \nof my colleagues the No. 1 permanently disabling birth defect in the \nUnited States. Spina Bifida is a neural tube defect and occurs when the \ncentral nervous system does not for properly close during the early \nstages of pregnancy. The most severe form of Spina Bifida occurs in 96 \npercent of the children born with this disease. People with Spina \nBifida often have paralysis of muscle groups, difficulties with bowel \nand bladder control, and learning and developmental challenges. There \nare approximately 70,000 individuals living with the challenges of \nSpina Bifida in our Nation.\n  This is also a very preventable birth defect. Sixty million women are \nat risk of having a child born with Spina Bifida, and each year \napproximately 4,000 pregnancies in this country are affected by Spina \nBifida. Unfortunately, only 2,500 of these children are born. This \ntranslates into approximately 11 Spina Bifida and neural tube defect \naffected pregnancies in this country each and every day. Yet, if all \nwomen of childbearing age were to consume 0.4 milligrams of folic acid \nbefore becoming pregnant, the incidence of folic acid-preventable Spina \nBifida would be reduced between 50-75 percent. Let me repeat this. If \nall women of childbearing age had a multivitamin with 0.4 milligrams of \nfolic acid everyday with breakfast, we could reduce the incidence of \nthis birth defect by 50-75 percent.\n  Fortunately, we are working to get the word out regarding the \nimportance of folic acid consumption. Created by the Children's Health \nAct of 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National \nCenter on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities' mission is to \nimprove the health of children by preventing birth defects and \ndevelopmental disabilities. I have just heard that the center's folic \nacid prevention campaign has reduced neural tube defect births by 20 \npercent. This public health success should be celebrated, but it is \nonly half of the equation--2,500 babies are born each year with Spina \nBifida.\n  Much more must be done to improve the quality of life for those \n70,000 individuals and their families that live with this disease day \nin and out. Major medical advances have permitted babies born with \nSpina Bifida to have a normal life expectancy and live independent and \nfulfilling lives. However, living with this disease can be expensive--\nemotionally, physically, and financially. The lifetime costs associated \nwith a typical case of Spina Bifida--including medical care, special \neducation, therapy services, and loss of earnings--exceed $500,000. The \ntotal societal cost of Spina Bifida exceeds $750 million per year. The \nSocial Security Administration payments to individuals with Spina \nBifida exceed $82 million per year. Tens of millions of dollars are \nspent on medical care covered by Medicaid and Medicare. Clearly we need \nto do more to improve the quality of life for people suffering from \nSpina Bifida. With improved quality-of-life for individuals and \nfamilies affected for Spina Bifida, the stigma and fear associated with \na Spina Bifida birth will decrease significantly.\n  I support efforts to examine the current state of and opportunities \nin the practice of secondary prevention--including in utero surgery--\nand efforts to reduce and prevent secondary health effects of Spina \nBifida. One step of many we must take to improve the quality of life \nfor those suffering from this disease is in the creation of a national \nregistry of persons affected by Spina Bifida and its secondary \nconditions so we can know who is affected and how we can help them.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I, too, share my distinguished colleague's concern \nabout this permanent and disabling birth defect. The exact causes of \nSpina Bifida are unknown. While we know that consumption of the \nrecommended daily dosage of folic acid plays a tremendous part in the \nprevention of this disease,\n\n[[Page S8672]]\n\nwe still have much to learn. We also need to help those that suffer \nfrom this disease and their loved ones deal with the day-to-day \nchallenges of living with this birth defect. As more and more \nindividuals with Spina Bifida live longer, it is increasingly important \nto ensure that their quality-of-life is maximized--this includes \neducational and vocational attainment, amelioration of secondary health \neffects, and ongoing support for them and their families. In 1996, this \nSenate passed the Agent Orange Benefits Act which provides benefits for \npersons affected by Spina Bifida whose biological father or mother is \nor was a Vietnam veteran. I was proud to support this important Act, \nbut I am troubled that not all of the 3,000 eligible families have been \nidentified by the Veterans Administration.\n  Mr. BOND. How many families have been identified under the Agent \nOrange Benefits Act?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Only 900 families out of the 3,000 eligible have been \nidentified for these benefits.\n  Mr. BOND. Is there a reason why less than half of the eligible \nfamilies have been identified since passage of the Agent Orange \nBenefits Act.?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The Veterans Administration's funding capacity to \nconduct outreach, educational, and programmatic initiatives has been \nlimited to this number so far.\n  Mr. BOND. I, too, am concerned about the effects of this devastating \ndisease and am pleased to stand with two of my colleagues on this \nimportant public health issue. I supported the passage of the \nChildren's Health Act last year that created the new birth defects \ncenter at CDC and I am pleased that their prevention education efforts \nhave already led to a downturn in Spina Bifida cases. I am also pleased \nthat the identified families to date are utilizing the benefits under \nthe Agent Orange Benefits Act. I, in addition to the distinguished \nSenators from Kansas and Maryland, support efforts that would improve \nthe quality of life for those suffering from this condition and further \nsupport the development of a national registry. Both the CDC and the \nVeterans Administration are making strides in the study of this disease \nand I support a collaborative initiative for the two agencies to \nimprove upon existing registries of persons affected by Spina Bifida, \nand other birth defects, especially for those whose father or mother \nserved our nation during the Vietnam war.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I agree with my colleague from Missouri. The key to \ndeveloping and maintaining a national registry will be the \ncollaboration between the various federal agencies. I also support \ncollaboration between the CDC and the Veterans Administration to \nfurther conduct outreach education initiatives to ensure that all of \nthe 3,000 eligible families receive benefits as designated under the \nAgent Orange Benefits Act.\n  I thank the Senators from Kansas and Missouri for their support of \nthis bipartisan effort to begin to establish the groundwork for \nimproving the quality of life for individuals affected by Spina Bifida.\n\n\n  NSF EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (EPSCoR)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Mikulski and Ranking \nMember Bond for their foresight and leadership in providing a $256 \nmillion, or 6 percent, increase for the National Science Foundation. I \nalso appreciate their willingness to provide $85 million for the NSF \nExperimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, EPSCoR, \nprogram. EPSCoR is a proven program that is helping researchers in \nhistorically underfunded States to improve their competitiveness for \nfederal R\n  The managers of this bill have been gracious enough to accept an \namendment from me that increases the EPSCoR funding in the Senate bill \nto $90 million in fiscal year 2002. This modest $5 million increase \ndoes not need to be offset because it comes out of the amount already \nappropriated through the NSF Education and Human Resources line-item.\n  EPSCoR helps these States to build infrastructure and expertise in \nareas of scientific importance to the States and the Nation by \nproviding seed money that allows smaller research universities to hire \nfaculty, obtain equipment, support the development of young faculty \nmembers, and other vital tasks that the Stanfords and MITs of the world \ntake for granted.\n  While I am glad that the EPSCoR level in the Senate bill is $10 \nmillion above the current level and the President's budget request, we \nare still falling woefully short of the level needed to help under-\nfunded States. The top 5 States--California, New York, Massachusetts, \nColorado, and DC--received 48 percent of total NSF funding in 2000. One \nState alone receives twice as much NSF funding as the 21 EPSCoR States \ncombined. California received $452 million in NSF funding in fiscal \nyear 2000, which is 15 percent of the total NSF funding. The 21 EPSCoR \nStates, plus Puerto Rico, share only 7 percent of total NSF funding, \n$207 million.\n  In 1990, the NSF EPSCoR budget was only $8 million. While it is true \nthat this funding has grown steadily in the years since then, these \nincreases have been extremely modest in comparison to total Federal R \nexpenditures. In fact, even with the additional co-funding that NSF \nprovides to EPSCoR grantees, the $90 million, plus the $25 million in \nco-funding, in total EPSCoR funding provided under my amendment would \nstill represent only 2.5 percent of the total NSF budget in fiscal year \n2002.\n  I have already heard from a number of my colleagues who support my \namendment and 17 Members of the Senate joined Senator Nickles and me in \nsending a letter to the subcommittee requesting this funding level.\n  EPSCoR is good Federal policy. At its most basic, scientific research \nis about ideas. When you have research institutions in 5 States \nreceiving half of the basic science research funding, a whole universe \nof ideas are left unexplored. EPSCoR has been invaluable to States like \nNorth Dakota becoming more competitive for Federal research dollars. \nNorth Dakota's total NSF funding increased by 307 percent from 1990-\n1999. The number of competitive NSF awards that North Dakota \nresearchers received increased by 71 percent between 1993-1998. More \nthan 30 topnotch young faculty were brought to North Dakota, through \nthe support of EPSCoR, that would otherwise have gone elsewhere. Those \nEPSCoR-supported researchers have successfully competed for more than \n$12 million in Federal and private R funding.\n  EPSCoR is also a key to economic development in EPSCoR States like \nNorth Dakota. A single, typical $100,000 research grant generates \n$230,000 back into the local economy, according to an analysis by NDSU. \nEPSCoR-supported researchers were awarded 12 patents between 1986-1999. \nMichael Chambers, whose early research was supported by an EPSCoR \naward, has now founded Aldevron, a biotech company in Fargo. The Small \nBusiness Administration named Michael its Region 8 Young Entrepreneur \nof the Year in 2000.\n  The NSF EPSCoR program has also funded an innovative program in North \nDakota that supports university faculty and students in providing \ntechnical expertise to North Dakota companies with scientific questions \nand problems. More than 180 students, a dozen faculty members, and 75 \ncompanies have benefitted from the program so far. For instance, Dr. \nJoel Jorgenson of Fargo designed an on-board recorder, monitoring and \nread-out system to solve a problem for Global Electric MotorCars (GEM) \nof Fargo, which is now the nation's largest manufacturer of \nNeighborhood Electrical Vehicles. GEM has since been acquired by \nDaimler-Chrysler and will be doubling its 130-employee workforce by the \nend of 2001. Dr. Robert Nelson with North Dakota State University \ndevised a means for Ottertail Power Company to detect when and where a \nfault has occurred on its power line, increasing the efficiency of the \ntransmission lines.\n  Despite the progress being made to help EPSCoR States improve their \ncompetitiveness, they still tend to lag behind--especially in winning \nlarge-scale center and multidisciplinary awards. Addressing this \nchallenge is the next step needed to improve competitiveness, and full \nfunding for EPSCoR at the $90 million level called for by the amendment \nI have offered is key.\n  I think $90 million for the NSF's Education and Human Resources for \nthe EPSCoR program is important to ensure full implementation of the \nNSF EPSCoR's new infrastructure program.\n\n[[Page S8673]]\n\n The additional $25 million in cofunding will ensure a robust NSF \nEPSCoR program next year. I thank the Chair and the Ranking Member of \nthe Subcommittee for agreeing to include my amendment.\n\n\n      low-income housing assistance in new york and massachusetts\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe that we need to provide additional \nclarification regarding section 226 of the VA/HUD Fiscal Year 1999 \nAppropriations Act, Public Law 105-276, that provides a prohibition of \npublic housing funding for certain State-developed housing in New York \nand Massachusetts, covering some 12,000 units. This transfer has been \ndescribed as the ``federalization'' of this housing, but it should be \ncalled a sham, with the analogy of a husband walking out on his wife \nand children and leaving them with nothing. This housing was developed \nby State government with no nexus to public housing.\n  To be clear, the Senator Banking Committee in the Quality Housing and \nWork Responsibility Act of 1998 had sought to fund the long-term \nhousing needs of low-income housing developed with New York and \nMassachusetts funding with new Federal public housing funding, despite \nthe fact, as I have noted, that these are not public housing units and \nhave absolutely no nexus to public housing or any Federal housing \nprogram.\n  As a result, the Congress passed section 226 of the VA/HUD Fiscal \nYear 1999 Appropriations Act to ensure for fiscal year 1999 and every \nfollowing fiscal year, including all appropriation acts in every \nsucceeding fiscal year, that these state-developed low-income housing \nunits remain the responsibility of New York and Massachusetts, and not \ncreate the unusual, unfair and unique precedent of requiring the \nFederal Government to fund this housing as public housing. The costs of \nthis ``federalization'' will exceed $100 million annually for New York \nalone, totaling well over $1 billion in the next 10-year period. This \nlikely is an underestimate of costs. I warn all Members that this \nscheme will result in a reduction of funds to all PHAs throughout the \nNation, each will see a loss of needed funds whether the public housing \nis in Baltimore, MD; Kansas City, MO; Anchorage, AK; San Francisco; \nWest Virginia and every other State.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The legislation is clear on its face that it is a \npermanent law and a permanent prohibition on funding these State-\ndeveloped low-income housing units as public housing. In addition, to \nfund State-developed units as public housing, there must be an \naffirmative change in law, a change I cannot support.\n  Frankly, it is not fair to other States to have their funding cut to \npay for State-developed and supported housing in New York and \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree with everything you have said and I am embarrassed \nfor these States and their attempt to transfer the responsibility for \ntheir own low-income housing responsibilities to the Federal Government \nthrough public housing funding. Even more important, unlike the current \nchairman and ranking member of the House VA/HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee, we were responsible as Senate chair and ranking member \nfor the VA/HUD Fiscal Year 1999 Appropriations Act which included this \nprovision that rejected the federalization of these State-developed \nunits as public housing. The law was drafted as a permanent prohibition \non the use of Federal funding for these units and I urge both New York \nand Massachusetts to acknowledge their responsibility to maintain this \nlow-income housing for low-income families. We have been in a period of \neconomic growth and these States should accept their responsibilities \nto their State residents consistent with their promise to provide \naffordable low-income housing.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank both Senator Bond and \nSenator Mikulski for their hard work on this important legislation \nwhich provides federal funding for the Departments of Veterans Affairs \nand Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies. \nUnfortunately, I must again speak about the unacceptably high funding \nlevels of parochial projects in this appropriations bill. Although the \nlevel of add-ons in some sections of this bill has decreased, this bill \nstill contains approximately $523 million in porkbarrel spending.\n  Overall, this bill spends 7.6 percent higher than the level enacted \nin fiscal year 2001, which is greater than the 4 percent increase in \ndiscretionary spending that the President wanted to adhere to. In real \ndollars, this is $2.69 billion in additional spending above the amount \nrequested by the President, and $8.015 billion higher than last year. \nSo far this year, with the appropriations bills considered, spending \nlevels have exceeded the President's budget request by nearly $7 \nbillion. A good amount of this increase is in the form of parochial \nspending for unrequested projects. In this bill, I have identified 492 \nseparate earmarks totaling $523 million, which is greater than the 400 \nearmarks totaling $472 million, in the legislation passed last year.\n  The committee provides $23.8 billion in discretionary funding for the \nVA. That amount is $452.7 million more than the President's budget \nrequest and $1.5 billion above the amount in fiscal year 2001. Some \nprogress has been made to reduce the overall amount of earmarks for the \nVA in this spending bill. Chairman Byrd of the Appropriations \nCommittee, and Chairman Mikulski of the VA-HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee, have held the amount in earmarks to approximately $24 \nmillion this year. Nonetheless, it is $24 million that will not be \navailable for higher priorities.\n  Among other Senators who have stood on the Senate floor to fight for \nadditional funding for veterans healthcare, I am concerned that the \nCommittee has directed critical dollars from veterans healthcare to \nfund spending projects that have not been properly reviewed. Certain \nprovisions funded under the VA in this legislation illustrate that \nCongress still does not have its priorities in order.\n  One especially troubling expense, neither budgeted for nor requested \nby the Administration over the past ten years, is a provision that \ndirects the VA to continue the ten year old demonstration project \ninvolving the Clarksburg, West Virginia, Veterans Affairs Medical \nCenter (VAMC) and the Ruby Memorial Hospital at West Virginia \nUniversity. Several years ago, the VA-HUD appropriations bill contained \na plus-up of $2 million for the Clarksburg VAMC that ended up on the \nAdministration's line-item veto list and since then the millions keep \nflowing.\n  Last year, the Committee ``recommended'' $1 million for the design of \na nursing home care unit at the Beckley, West Virginia, VAMC. This year \nthey strengthened their report language urging ``the VA to accelerate \nthe design of the nursing home care unit at the Beckley, WV VAMC.''\n  This year, for Martinsburg, West Virginia, the Committee provides $1 \nmillion for a feasibility study to establish a Center for Healthcare \nInformation at the Office of Medical Information Security Service at \nthe Martinsburg VAMC to identify solutions to protect the privacy, \nconfidentiality, and integrity of the sensitive medical records of the \nVA patient population.\n  Alaska also has a number of items that will include funding above the \nbudget request of the President and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. \nThe Committee report directs the VA to start up and operate by 2002 a \ncommunity-based outpatient clinic (CBOC) on the Matanuska-Susitna \nValley, Alaska, costing $1 million. The Committee initially directs the \nVA only to report by March 30, 2002, on its progress to establish a \nMatanuska-Susitna Valley CBOC, but then expects the VA to ensure it is \noperational by 2002. It further recommends that all veterans living \nfarther than a 50-mile radius from Anchorage be authorized to use \ncontract care from local private physicians.\n  For St. Louis, MO, the committee ``encouraged'' the VA to pursue an \ninnovative approach at a cost of $7 million for leasing parking spaces \nat the John Cochran Division of the VA Medical Center in St. Louis as a \nmeans to address a parking shortfall at the VA hospital. The committee \nalso suggests that funds be transferred from the minor construction VA \naccount in order to secure additional private sector investment for \nthis VA Medical Center.\n  The Committee also directs the VA to explore new uses for the Miles \nCity, Montana VA facility and to continue to support the Hawaii VA \nPacific Tele-\n\n[[Page S8674]]\n\nmedicine Project. In addition, the Committee directs the VA to conduct \na feasibility study on the need for a VA Research Center for the \nClarksburg VAMC on the campus of West Virginia University.\n  Additionally, the committee ``expects'' the continuation at the \ncurrent spending level of the Rural Veterans Health Care Initiative at \nthe White River Junction, VT VAMC. The current level is an astounding \n$7 million.\n  On a more positive note, one provision directs the VA to submit a \nreport on the number of homeless veterans and the type of homeless \nveterans services that the VA provides. I am pleased that the Senate \nVeterans Affairs Committee has focused on the critical plight of our \nNation's homeless veterans. I had hoped, however, that they would have \nprevailed in conference in recent years on a relevant amendment that I \nhad first offered to the VA-HUD appropriations bill in 1999, which was \nadopted, but later dropped in conference. I hope that the proposed VA \nreport provides the catalyst for legislation next year. I am \ndisappointed that it has already taken this long to address this \nmatter. We owe it to these less fortunate veterans who served their \ncountry so well only to find nowhere to call home.\n  Although the Committee report calls for yet another study on the \nVeterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) system, I continue to be \npleased by the General Accounting Office and the VA reports, which \nrecommend that veterans health care funding should be shifted from \nnortheastern states to southern and southwestern states. This helps \nensure that critical health care funding for veterans follows them to \nthe actual locations where their medical care takes place.\n\n  While I am encouraged by the increase specifically in veterans health \ncare funding over last year's enacted levels, we must do much more. We \nmade a promise to our veterans that we would take care of their mental \nand physical health needs incurred for their many sacrifices for our \nNation. The VA currently has a backlog of 600,000 claims. Currently, \nfour our of every 10 claims for veterans' disability benefits are \ndecided incorrectly further contributing to the backlog. The millions \nin dollars wasted in porkbarrel spending would go a long way to \ndecreasing the backlog in veterans claims by funding additional claims \nadjudicators and training.\n  This bill also contains the funding for the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development. The programs administered by HUD help our Nation's \nfamilies purchase their homes, helps many low-income families obtain \naffordable housing, combats discrimination in the housing market, \nassists in rehabilitating neighborhoods and helps our Nation's most \nvulnerable the elderly, disabled and disadvantaged have access to safe \nand affordable housing.\n  Unfortunately, this bill shifts money away from many critical housing \nand community programs by bypassing the appropriate competitive process \nand inserting earmarks and set-asides for special projects that \nreceived the attention of the Appropriations Committee. This is unfair \nto the many communities and families who do not have the good fortune \nof residing in a region of the country represented by a member of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Some of the earmarks for special projects in this bill include: \n$300,000 for the County of Kauai, Hawaii, for the Heritage Trails \nproject; $750,000 for infrastructure improvements to the School of the \nBuilding Arts in Charleston, South Carolina; $100,000 for development \nassistance for the Desert Space Station in Nevada; $1 million for the \nLouisiana Department of Culture, Recreation, and Tourism for \ndevelopment activities related to the Louisiana Purchase Bicentennial \nCelebration; $450,000 for the City of Providence, Rhode Island, for the \ndevelopment of a Botanical Center at Roger Williams Park and Zoo; \n$200,000 for the Newport Art Museum in Newport, Rhode Island for \nhistorical renovation; and $500,000 for the Lewis and Clark State \nCollege for the Idaho Virtual Incubator.\n  This bill also funds the Environmental Protection Agency which \nprovides resources to help state, local and tribal communities enhance \ncapacity and infrastructure to better address their environmental \nneeds. I support directing more resources to communities that are most \nin need and facing serious public health and safety threats from \nenvironmental problems. Unfortunately, after a review of this year's \nbill for EPA programs, I find it difficult to believe that we are fully \nresponding to the most urgent environmental issues. Nearly one-fourth \nof the 180 earmarks provided for the EPA are targeted for consortiums, \nuniversities, or foundations.\n  There are many environmental needs in communities back in my home \nstate of Arizona, but these communities will be denied funding as long \nas we continue to tolerate earmarking that circumvents a regular merit-\nreview process.\n  For example, some of the earmarks include: $250,000 for the Envision \nUtah Project; $250,000 for the Central California ozone study; $750,000 \nfor the painting and coating assistance initiative through the \nUniversity of Northern Iowa; $2.5 million for the National Alternative \nFuels Training Consortium in Morgantown, West Virginia; and $3.9 \nmillion for the Mine Waster Technology Program at the National \nEnvironmental Waste Technology, Testing, and Evaluation Center in \nButte, Montana.\n  While these projects may be important, why do they rank higher than \nother environmental priorities? It is also important to note that none \nof the 180 earmarks for the EPA were even requested by the President's \nbudget.\n  For independent agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, this bill also includes earmarks of money for locality-\nspecific projects such as: $5 million for the planetarium for the Clay \nCenter of the Arts and Sciences in Charleston, West Virginia; and $2 \nmillion for the University of Mississippi Geoinformatics Center.\n  I also want to comment on the many cost overruns and management \nproblems at NASA. Last year, as part of the authorization bill for \nNASA, Congress established a cost cap on the International Space \nStation. Before establishing this cost cap, we worked with NASA to \nensure that the funding levels of the cap were accurate. NASA indicated \nthat the funding levels were sufficient to complete the Station. \nEarlier this year, NASA notified the Commerce Committee of $4 billion \nin cost overruns for the International Space Station.\n  I know that it is difficult, if not impossible, to envision NASA \nhaving cost overruns for one year that amount to twice its annual \nbudget. I can only conclude that either NASA did not know about the \ncost overruns or they knew and did not notify Congress about these \nproblems. In either case, it is a major shortfall in the program's \nmanagement.\n  However, NASA has attempted to pay for these cost overruns from \nwithin existing budgetary limits. NASA has proposed drastic reductions \nin the station design. Included in these reductions is the crew return \nvehicle. This cut has reduced the maximum crew for the station to three \nastronauts. Given the fact that two and a half astronauts are required \nto operate the facility, only half of an astronaut's time can be \ndevoted to research.\n  A recent NASA and OMB agreement reveals that research time by the \npermanent crew will be limited to 20 hours per weeks. This amount of \ntime may be further reduced if NASA makes its goal of providing 30 \npercent of the research time available to the commercial sector. NASA \nis currently exploring several options of how to increase crew research \ntime. With this limitation on research time, the question for us is \nwhether the Government wants to continue spending on this project which \nmay add up to $100 billion, for only 20 hours of research per week in \nreturn.\n  To further add to the cost concerns, NASA announced earlier this year \nthat the X-33 program, a joint program with Lockheed Martin, would be \ncanceled. This cancellation represented another $1 billion investment \nwith no final product. It is our understanding that the Defense \nDepartment is reviewing the program to see if they can utilize any of \nthe project.\n  I continue to be concerned about NASA fundamental management \napproaches. An example of NASA's mismanagement is the ill-fated \nPropulsion Module that was supposed to provide a U.S. capability for \nlong-term propulsion of the space station. This program\n\n[[Page S8675]]\n\nwas canceled, due to cost growth and poor management. According to the \nGeneral Accounting Office, NASA began to build the Propulsion Module \nfor the Space Station before it had completed a project plan, a risk \nmanagement plan, or developed realistic cost and schedule estimates.\n  Further review revealed that the propulsion model design proposed a \ntunnel diameter that was too small to accommodate crew operations and \ndid not have detailed analyses to even quantify the amount of \npropulsion capability that would be required. This lack of planning led \nto a $265 million increase--from $479 to $744 million--and schedule \nslippage of 2 years.\n  I am greatly concerned that NASA has significant infrastructure \nproblems for the Space Shuttle program looming in the near future. Many \nof the vital facilities to support the Shuttle program are literally \nfalling apart. The Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space \nFlight Center, built in the early 1960s for assembly of Apollo/Saturn \nvehicles and currently used to prepare the Space Shuttle launch \nassembly, has nets inside the building to prevent concrete from falling \nfrom the roof onto the workers and equipment below. The sidings on the \noutside of the building are becoming loose due to time and weather. \nAddressing the risks associated with a crumpling infrastructure is in \nof itself a Shuttle upgrade project that has potential to increase the \noverall safety and reliability of the Shuttle program. These \nrenovations along with many others will be costly. NASA must start \nmaking plans today to address these infrastructure problems on an \nagency-wide basis in order to prevent a crisis. We must get these \nmanagement problems under control.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman Mikulski and \nSenator Bond for all of the hard work they have put into the Fiscal \nYear 2002 VA-HUD Appropriations bill. Given the serious fiscal \nrestraints facing the Congress this year as a result of the budget \nresolution and the unsound tax cut, they have masterfully negotiated \nthe many and often competing demands of the programs under the \nsubcommittee's jurisdiction.\n  In particular, I would like to thank Senators Mikulski and Bond for \nrestoring much needed funds to a number of important Department of \nHousing and Urban Development programs that were slated for drastic \ncuts under the President's budget.\n  Despite the economic prosperity that our country has experienced, \nmany Americans are still lack safe and affordable housing. In my own \nstate of Rhode Island, 46 percent of Rhode Islanders are unable to \nafford this rent without spending over 30 percent of their income on \nhousing. In terms of homeownership, the average sales price of a home \nin Rhode Island went up by $24,000 between 1999 and 2000. In the same \nperiod, the number of houses on the market decreased by over 50 \npercent, and only 25 percent of these homes were affordable to low-\nincome families.\n  This housing affordability crisis has been affecting families around \nthe country. The latest HUD worst case housing needs study indicates \nthat there are over 4.9 million low-income Americans who pay more than \n50 percent of their income for rent. In addition, a broader study done \nby the National Housing Conference, the mortgage bankers and others \nshows that 14 percent or 13.7 million American families have worst case \nhousing needs. Ten million of these people are elderly or work full or \npart-time.\n  This is why I was so concerned about the President's budget proposal \nto cut HUD programs by $1.7 billion. Once you factor in inflation, the \nAdministration was proposing to cut housing programs by $2.2 billion, \nan 8 percent real spending decrease compared to Fiscal Year 2001.\n  One of the President's cuts that most concerned me was the $859 \nmillion net cut in public housing, the program that supports some of \nour nation's most vulnerable families. In my own state of Rhode Island, \napproximately two-thirds of our public housing units are used by the \nelderly and disabled.\n  I also was disappointed by the Administration's decision to eliminate \nthe public housing drug elimination program (PHDEP). This flexible, \ncommunity-based program has made public housing much safer by helping \nlocal housing agencies create comprehensive anti-crime and anti-drug \nstrategies.\n  I applaud both Senators Mikulski and Bond for restoring funding to \nboth of these programs. The VA-HUD bill before us today contains almost \n$3 billion for the Public Housing Capital Fund, $650 million more than \nthe President's request, and $300 million for the drug elimination \ngrant program.\n  I also approve of the bill's requirement that 30 percent of the \nfunding for HUD homeless programs be set aside for permanent housing \nfor the disabled homeless. This shows the Senate's commitment towards \nhelping end homelessness, not just funding programs for those who are \nhomeless. Likewise, the committee's allocation of $500,000 for the \nInteragency Council on the Homeless will help Federal Government \nagencies better coordinate their programs for preventing and ending \nhomelessness. I also want to commend the committee for putting Shelter \nPlus Care renewals for the homeless in a separate account. As chairman \nof the Housing Subcommittee, I personally believe that the long-term \nsolution to the renewal problem should be solved by transferring \nrenewals to the Section 8 program, and I hope the committee considers \ndoing this in the future.\n  I am also pleased about the language in the bill supporting the \nreauthorization of the Mark-to Market program. I held a subcommittee \nhearing on this issue on June 19, 2001, and the Banking Committee \nsuccessfully marked up a reauthorization bill yesterday morning on \nAugust 1, 2001. It is my hope that this important legislation will be \nenacted into law well before the expiration of the original program on \nSeptember 30, 2001.\n  I also would like to commend both the administration and the \ncommittee on increasing funding for HUD's office of Lead Hazard Control \nby $10 million. Nonetheless, much more needs to be done. I, and a \nnumber of my colleagues, believe that this number should be much higher \nand will continue to work to increase funding for this extremely \nimportant program. No family in this country should be forced to live \nin housing that can cause permanent brain damage to their children.\n  Finally, I was pleased to see language in the bill asking HUD to \ninstitute a computer program to adequately calculate the amount of \ncredit subsidy necessary to support the FHA multifamily mortgage \ninsurance programs and to establish a task force to determine the costs \nof multifamily defaults. I am disappointed that the administration has \nchosen to allow this program to stay shut down. Clearly, the FHA \nmultifamily program has some problems that need to be solved; however, \nthe administration's solution of raising the insurance premiums misses \nthe larger point of ensuring that these programs continue to construct \naffordable housing. Thus, I also support the bill's language regarding \nthe need for FHA premium changes to be made through notice and comment \nrule making. I hope to work with my colleagues over the next several \nmonths to see if we can't come up with a longer term solution to the \nrepeated shutdown of this important FHA insurance premium program.\n  There are two issues with this year's VA-HUD appropriations bill that \nI hope we can address as the bill moves forward. The first is the \nCommittee's decision to cut Section 8 reserves from two months to one \nmonth, without protecting public housing authorities from budget \nshortfalls. The second is the implications of the decision to expand \nthe traditional rescission language to include all funds recaptured \nfrom the Section 8 program.\n  I know that the chair and ranking member of the subcommittee care \nvery much about supporting hard-pressed parents who are struggling to \nprovide a decent home for their children. The Section 8 program is the \nprinciple source of housing assistance for these extremely low-income \nparents who face the most acute housing needs of any segment of our \npopulation. It is an especially critical support for parents who have \njust left welfare and who may be earning too little to afford decent \nhousing. It also helps parents move their kids out of areas of \nconcentrated poverty and into neighborhoods with educational and \nemployment opportunities.\n  For all these reasons, we must maintain our commitment to the Section \n8\n\n[[Page S8676]]\n\nprogram and make sure it works efficiently. Keeping the Section 8 \nreserves at adequate levels is an important part of making this housing \nprogram work. Basically, the Section 8 reserves provide additional \nfunds to Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) whose voucher program costs \nexceed their budget allocation in a given year. Thus, if a PHA \napproaches the final months of its fiscal year and needs more funds to \npay landlords or pay for utility costs, it can request up to 2 months \nof additional funding from HUD. The reserves are critical to the \nprogram's financing because HUD bases each PHA's annual budget not on \nits expected costs in the coming fiscal year, but rather on its actual \ncosts in the prior year. Since the factors that cause such increases \ncan be unpredictable from year to year, sufficient reserves are \nnecessary so that PHAs won't be forced to reduce the number of families \nthey serve.\n  I am also concerned about the current rescission language in the \nbill. It is not unusual for Congress to reclaim Section 8 monies that \nHUD does use. However, this year's bill goes one step further by \nrescinding all future recaptures from Fiscal Year 2002 and prior years, \nand diverting them into other accounts, some of which are not even \nrelated to the housing needs of low-income families.\n  As I mentioned previously, PHAs' budgets are based on the prior \nyear's actual costs and not on their expected costs if they adopt \nchanges to serve more families. They may need additional resources \nbeyond their budget allocations if they succeed in making their \nprograms work better. But this bill cuts the Section 8 reserves that \ncould provide these additional resources. And, by rescinding all \nrecaptures that HUD could make this year and next, it deprives HUD of \nfunds to ensure that PHAs that are increasing voucher utilization do \nnot get caught in a budget squeeze. HUD may also use recaptures to \nadjust contracts with owners under the project-based Section 8 program \nif unforseen costs arise, such as rising utility prices. If HUD does \nnot have the resources to make these adjustments, these owners may opt-\nout of the Section 8 program. Finally, HUD can currently redirect at \nleast some recaptures to offset Section 8 costs in the upcoming fiscal \nyear, reducing the appropriated dollars needed to maintain the size of \nthe program. This in turn, frees up funds to provide more new vouchers.\n  If we are serious about helping extremely low-income families benefit \nfrom voucher assistance, then we need to ensure that the needed \nresources are available to make this program work well and efficiently. \nBut this bill contains two provisions that run the risk of doing just \nthe opposite. Both the reduction in reserves and the rescission could \nrun the risk of undermining the financing of the Section 8 program, and \nundermining efforts to serve more families with vouchers. Let's not run \nthis risk. Let's ensure that the Section 8 program is our first \npriority for use of recapture funds.\n  Again, I thank Senators Bond and Mikulski for all of their hard work \non this bill and I hope that we will be able to discuss these matters \nin more detail, and that we work together to find ways to address these \nissues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to adjourn until \nSeptember, I thank the members of the Senate Appropriations Committee \nwho have worked so hard to report nine bills from committee for the \nfiscal year that begins on October 1. In particular, I thank my \ndistinguished colleague, the ranking member on the full committee, Ted \nStevens and the chairmen and ranking members for the five bills that \nhave passed the Senate.\n  The five chairmen and ranking members include Senator Barbara \nMikulski and Senator Kit Bond on the VA/HUD and Independent Agencies \nbill, Senator Harry Reid and Senator Pete Domenici on the Energy and \nWater bill, Senator Patty Murray and Senator Richard Shelby on the \nTransportation bill, Senator Richard Durbin and Senator Robert Bennett \non the Legislative Branch bill and Senator Conrad Burns on the Interior \nbill.\n  We have a longstanding tradition on the Appropriations Committee of \nworking together on a bipartisan basis to produce the thirteen \nappropriations bills. This year, we established a goal of reporting \nnine bipartisan and fiscally responsible bills prior to the August \nrecess. We have met this challenge. I thank my good friend Ted Stevens \nfor his leadership in helping us meet this goal.\n  Based on that tradition of bipartisanship, the transition in party \nleadership on the Appropriations Committee was seamless. The hard work \nof the committee to produce 13 bills preceded the transition and \ncontinued after I assumed the chairmanship and the committee was \nreorganized on July 10, 2001. This is a credit to all of our colleagues \nand our dedicated staff who have labored unceasingly to bring these \nbills to the Senate.\n  Producing the fiscal year 2002 appropriations bills has been a \nparticular challenge this year. With the election of a new President, \nthe President's budget was sent to the Congress on April 9, 2001, 2 \nmonths later than in a normal year. When we received the President's \nbudget, it included a number of proposed reductions in discretionary \nprograms. We have scrutinized the budget and where appropriate we\n\n[[Page S8677]]\n\naccepted the proposed cuts, but in other cases we had to restore cuts \nin programs that have broad bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  Restoring these cuts, while funding programs that are important to \nall Americans, has been very difficult, given the very tight limits on \ndiscretionary spending contained in the budget resolution. I did not \nvote for that budget resolution, but we have worked together on a \nbipartisan basis to produce bills that are within their 302(b) \nallocations. We do not have unlimited resources at our disposal, so we \nhave been forced to make difficult decisions. Nevertheless, we believe \nthe bills that the committee brought to the Senate have been fair, \nbalanced, and served the needs of the American people.\n  We have held the line while making sure that we kept our promise to \nour Nation's veterans, we have helped the poor move to a better life by \nrebuilding neighborhoods, we have protected the environment and \ninvested in science and technology and we have funded disaster relief \nprograms in response to floods and other natural disasters to provide \nassistance to our citizens in their time of need.\n  We have funded our Nation's transportation systems to promote safe \ntravel on our roads, in the air and on our waterways. We have invested \nin our Nation's energy independence and funded our natural resource \nprograms. We have invested in our Nation's infrastructure for bridges \nand dams and navigation projects.\n  I thank the many Senators who have dedicated themselves to this task \nand I look forward to working to send thirteen bipartisan and fiscally \nresponsible appropriations bills to the President. I have spoken with \nthe House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young and the Ranking \nMember David Obey and urged them to move quickly to conference on the \nappropriations bills. I had pressed the House to complete conference \naction on two of the bills before the August recess, but the House did \nnot name their conferees. However, our staffs will be working during \nAugust to resolve differences between the House and Senate bills so \nthat we can go to conference on several of these bills when Congress \nreturns in September.\n  I am committed to producing 13 bills this year. We should not go down \nthe road employed in recent years of producing omnibus appropriations \nbills that rob Members of the opportunity to read, let alone understand \nthe contents of the bill.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. For the information of our colleagues, there will be \nthree votes shortly on three nominees that we will take from the \nExecutive Calendar. We are in the process of drafting a unanimous \nconsent request to accommodate debate and the vote on those three \nnominees.\n  I urge colleagues to stay in proximity of the building and the floor \nbecause these votes will happen shortly. The distinguished chair of the \nJudiciary Committee has reported them out, and I thank him and applaud \nhim for his expedited work on these nominations. There will be a short \ndebate and then there will be votes. They will not be stacked, but as I \nunderstand it, there is a request for time on each of the nominees.\n  We will have those votes and, hopefully, at that point, we will be \nable to announce further legislative business.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the distinguished leader will yield, it is my \nunderstanding--and I have not had a chance to speak with the \ndistinguished ranking member, but I hope there will be a very short \ntime on these nominees on statements, in such a way that the leader \nwill be able to propound, if he wishes, a request that the last two of \nthe three votes be 10-minute votes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if we can accommodate all Senators with \nthat understanding, we will make that part of the request. If Senators \nwish to be heard on these nominations, I hope they will let us know. \nShortly, we will propound that unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the majority leader will yield, he is not propounding a \nunanimous consent at this point?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Shortly. Not at this point.\n  Mr. LOTT. The majority leader is to designate a short period of time \nfor each one of these nominations; is that right?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It was my understanding that there were requests for \ntime on each nominee. If there is not, then it is my desire to have a \nperiod during which Senators could speak to the nominees and we would \nhave three stacked votes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8677-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8677-S8678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe votes on these nominations, the Senate then resume consideration of \nthe Agriculture supplemental bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask that \nthe unanimous consent request be amended to provide for a vote on Lugar \namendment No. 1212, with 60 minutes of debate prior to the vote on the \ncloture motion.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object to that temporarily. I need to \nconsult with my colleagues and certainly the chair and the manager of \nthe bill, but perhaps that is something we might be able to do. We will \ncertainly work with the Republican leader to provide him with some \ninformation in that regard at a later date.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, further reserving my right to object, I \nappreciate the spirit in which Senator Daschle made his comments. We \nare going to try and find a way to get the Agriculture supplemental \nappropriations bill done, and done in a reasonable period of time, \ncertainly before too late tomorrow.\n  I want to add to that, I appreciated what he had to say earlier \ntonight about his willingness to try and find a way to get completion \non this bill, even tonight, so we would be able to go ahead and go to \nour constituents and our families tomorrow.

MUELLER TO BE DIRECTOR OF FEDERAL BUREAU OF \n                             INVESTIGATION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nominations will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of William J. Riley, from \nNebraska, to be a Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit; Sarah V. Hart, \nfrom Pennsylvania, to be Director of the National Institute of Justice; \nand Robert S. Mueller, III, from California, to be Director of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are going to have a series of votes on \nnominees, all of whom went through the Judiciary Committee this \nmorning. Mr. Riley was the subject of nomination hearings before the \nJudiciary Committee on July 24. That was the fourth of five nomination \nhearings I scheduled in less than 3 weeks the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee was allowed to have such hearings. Mr. Riley's was the fourth \njudicial nomination, the second nominee to a Court of Appeals \nconsidered by the Judiciary Committee since that date.\n  I mention this because the Senate Judiciary Committee, in the less \nthan 4 weeks we have been allowed to have a full committee, has \nprobably moved through judicial nominations faster than at any time in \nthe past several years.\n  We will also have nominations of a Department of Justice nominee, \nalso voted on this morning. The most important of all of these, I \nbelieve, is the nomination of Robert Mueller to be Director of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation. We received his paperwork and \ncompleted it on July 24. We are now at August 2, again probably a speed \nrecord, to get this nomination before the Senate for confirmation. I \nthank the Senators on both sides of the aisle for making it possible to \nmove that rapidly.\n  Mr. Mueller served as a Federal prosecutor in three different U.S. \nattorneys' offices, main Justice, in both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. He testified he either personally prosecuted or \nsupervised the prosecution of just about every type of Federal criminal \noffense, including homicide, drug trafficking, organized crime, \ncybercrime, major fraud, civil rights, and environmental crime.\n  Mr. Mueller answered some very searching questions of Members on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I think all of us have enormous respect for so many of the men and \nwomen in the FBI. They are the best trained and best motivated law \nenforcement agents anywhere in the world.\n  Many of us share also the concern that some within the hierarchy of \nthe FBI let them down as a result of the problems with Waco, Ruby \nRidge, the Hanssen spy case, and the foul-ups in the FBI lab.\n  I thought that whoever the next Director was owed it to all the \nwonderful men and women in the Bureau to make it better. I am convinced \nRobert Mueller can. I told him we were expediting his nomination, we \nwere moving his nomination faster than any nominee has ever moved for \nsuch a prominent position, whether it has been a Republican President \nor Democratic President. It is because of our faith in him. We know he \nhas a difficult job ahead of him.\n  I told him that all Americans look forward to his making sure the FBI \nis the preeminent law enforcement agency in the world and that he has \nthe faith, and the hope, of 100 Senators. All 100 of us have an awesome \nresponsibility. We represent a quarter of a billion people, and we have \nto make the judgment: Is the President's choice the best person?\n  I believe it is. I have that faith in him. I have the faith that \nAttorney General Ashcroft has done a very good job in his work, and I \napplaud Attorney General Ashcroft for what he has done. I applaud \nPresident Bush for his appointment. We will move forward on that.\n  Mr. President, the Senators from Nebraska made a powerful statement \non behalf of William Riley of Nebraska to serve as a judge for the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. That is one of \nthe reasons it moved so quickly. I see the former Governor of Nebraska, \nnow a distinguished colleague in this Chamber, former Governor Nelson \nand now-Senator Nelson. I yield to Senator Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Nebraska have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his \nkind remarks and for his shepherding through his committee in record \ntime the nomination of William Riley. I have known Bill Riley since our \nlaw school days at the University of Nebraska College of Law. He had a \ndistinguished career at the University of Nebraska, serving as editor \nin chief of the Nebraska Law Review.\n  Rather ironically, his first job out of law school was clerking for \none of the judges on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, the same \ncourt which he seeks to preside in today.\n  He has been a member of a number of community and professional \norganizations, and in addition to his professional accomplishments, he \nhas been active in his community, participating in the Boy Scouts for \nmore than 25 years, serving as a juvenile diversion judge as a leader \nfor young boys and girls charged with nonfelony crimes, and offering \nlegal services to financially disadvantaged members of the community.\n  He possesses not only the legal intellect, the experience and the \nexpertise to be an excellent judge, but he has also displayed \nthroughout his entire career high ethical standards. It is a real \npleasure for me to have the opportunity to comment so positively on Mr. \nRiley's qualifications and to thank the committee and the chair for \nmoving this expeditiously.\n  It is a good indication that on a bipartisan basis, this Senate can \nact in a very timely manner on these nominations. I thank the chairman, \nand I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the call of the quorum count against whatever \ntime is still pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I strongly recommend Bill Riley to the \nEighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. I know that he will be an \nexcellent appellate judge and will serve with distinction. He will \nbring to the bench the knowledge, experience and temperament he has \nacquired throughout his distinguished career.\n  I would like to thank the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Leahy, and ranking member Hatch for the expeditious manner in \nwhich they handled Mr. Riley's nomination.\n  Bill Riley received his undergraduate degree from the university of \nNebraska in 1969 and graduated with distinction in 1972 from the \nuniversity of nebraska College of Law. Bill began his career by \nclerking for the Honorable Donald P. Lay on the Eighth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. That's right, the Eighth Circuit. Who would have known that \nalmost 30 years later Bill would be nominated to the same court?\n\n[[Page S8679]]\n\n  Since 1973 Bill has practiced law with the firm of Fitzgerald, \nSchorr, Barmettler & Brennan of Omaha, where he is now chair of the \nfirm's litigation department. Bill has had a varied trial practice \nincluding business litigation, Federal securities law, U.S. copyright, \ntrademark and patent suits, ERISA claims, corporate environmental \npollution claims and various contract disputes.\n  Bill is board certified in civil trial practice by the National Board \nof Trial Advocacy, 1994, and an associate of the American Board of \nTrial Advocates. Bill is also a fellow of the American College of Trial \nLawyers, which, as you know, is limited to 1 percent of lawyers in each \nState and only lawyers with 15 years of trial experience. From 1992 to \n1994 Bill also served as chair of the Federal Practice Committee for \nthe U.S. District Court.\n  Bill has found time to not only represent his clients, but to share \nhis time and talents with other lawyers in Nebraska. Bill is a master \nattorney and charter member of the Robert M. Spire Inns of Court, which \nis a teaching organization for younger trial lawyers and law students. \nHe has also been President of the Omaha Bar Association, a member of \nHouse of Delegates of the Nebraska State Bar Association, and past \nChair of the Ethics Committee for the Nebraska State Bar Association. \nOver the years Bill has spoken at numerous legal seminars and \nconferences and his talents and time with other lawyers have \ncontributed to the improvement of our legal system.\n  In addition to his active trial practice, Bill also teaches Trial \nPractice as an Adjunct Professor at Creighton University School of Law. \nHe is married to Norma J. Riley and has three children, Brian, Kevin, \nand Erin.\n  Bill Riley is fully prepared for the challenges that lay ahead for \nthe Eighth Circuit. He possesses the integrity, experience, intellect, \nand temperament to be an exceptional Federal judge. I strongly \nrecommend his confirmation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am also pleased that we will vote on a \nnominee who is extremely well-qualified to serve in the important \npositions of a circuit judge.\n  The judicial nominee is William Jay Riley, who has been nominated for \nthe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Riley graduated in 1972 from \nNebraska Law School, where he was Editor in Chief of the Nebraska Law \nReview and was Order of the Coif. After graduation, he served as a law \nclerk for the court to which he has now been nominated before entering \nprivate practice. Mr. Riley will be a fine addition to the Eighth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  I have examined the records of this nominee, and I support him \nwithout reservation. I urge all of my colleagues to vote to confirm Mr. \nRiley.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to today to vote to confirm \nWilliam J. Riley of Nebraska to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit. Mr. Riley was the subject of a \nnominations hearing before the Judiciary Committee on July 24th, which \nwas the fourth of five nominations hearings I have scheduled since the \nSenate was allowed to reorganize on June 5. Mr. Riley's was the fourth \njudicial nomination considered by the Judiciary Committee since that \ndate, and the second nominee to a Court of Appeals. The Judiciary \nCommittee has considered and the Senate confirmed three judicial \nnominees in that period of time, and Mr. Riley will be the fourth, \nbefore the August recess begins.\n  William J. Riley, 54, is a native Nebraskan, and a graduate of the \nUniversity of Nebraska and the University of Nebraska Law School. Mr. \nRiley served as a law clerk to the Honorable Donald Lay of the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and went on to a distinguished \ncareer with the Omaha law firm of Fitzgerald, Schorr, Barmettler & \nBrennan. Over the course of his legal career he handled a variety of \ntypes of cases, including insurance defense, commercial litigation, and \nplaintiffs' personal injury, and his clients have ranged from \nindividuals to large corporations. He has extensive litigation \nexperience in both Federal and State courts.\n  Mr. Riley has been active in bar activities at the State and local \nlevel, and in other professional associations. He served as chair of \nthe Nebraska State Bar Ethics Committee from 1996-1998, and in that \ncapacity he was responsible for a non-discrimination amendment to the \nNebraska Code of Professional Responsibility. He has also been a member \nof the Nebraska State Bar's House of Delegates for the last three \nyears. He is on the Executive Council of the Omaha Bar Association, is \nits immediate past president, and in the past served as its treasurer. \nHe also served as chair of the Federal Practice Committee of the U.S. \nDistrict Court in Nebraska, and is active in the American College of \nTrial Lawyers and the American Board of Trial Advocates.\n  I am always glad to see qualified nominees who are supported by both \nhome-State Senators, and Mr. Riley is such a nominee. In this case, \nboth of the Senators from Nebraska, Chuck Hagel, a Republican, and Ben \nNelson, a Democrat, strongly supported his nomination. Both contacted \nme to ask that he be scheduled for a hearing, and both came to his \nhearing and spoke convincingly on his behalf.\n  Senator Hagel told the Judiciary Committee about Mr. Riley's, \n``knowledge, experience, and temperament,'' and that he knows Mr. \nRiley, ``will be an excellent addition to the Eighth Circuit and will \nserve with distinction.''\n  When Senator Ben Nelson introduced Mr. Riley at his hearing, he too \nattested to Mr. Riley's credentials, and underscored the nominee's \nsupport from both sides of the aisle, telling us that ``Mr. Riley \nexemplifies the kind of nominee that we would like to see put forth for \nthese very important judgeships. He is not only a qualified person for \nthis position, but he has earned broad bipartisan support and respect \nin Nebraska as well.''\n  I know that both Senator Nelson and Senator Hagel believe that this \nsort of bipartisan support is a crucial component of a successful \nnomination, and they followed through by working together with the \nWhite House to find a qualified candidate on whom they could agree. I \nhope the process that they undertook, like the one that recently \nproduced the two District Court judges in Montana, demonstrates the \nadvantages to such an approach.\n  I hope it makes clear that when the President works with Members of \nthe Senate from both parties on the selection of qualified, consensus \ncandidates to be judicial nominees, those nominations are likely to \nmove more smoothly through the confirmation process.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof William J. Riley, of Nebraska, to be a U.S. Circuit Judge for the \nEighth Circuit? On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, \nthe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nThompson) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) is \nabsent because of a death in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell).

Hart to be the Director of the National Institute of Justice, \nthe research and development agency of the Department of Justice.\n  For the last 6 years, Ms. Hart has served as Chief Counsel of the \nPennsylvania Department of Corrections, and before that as an Assistant \nDistrict Attorney in Philadelphia for many years.\n  And it is not only her resume, but the strong support of former \nDistrict Attorney from Philadelphia, my good friend Senator Specter, \nthat makes it easy for me to vote to confirm Ms. Hart.\n  I hope that, once confirmed, Ms. Hart will take her stewardship of \nthe National Institute of Justice seriously. The NIJ is tasked with \nundertaking objective, independent, non-partisan research on crime and \njustice issues. In order to do that it is crucial that NIJ remain \nindependent from the political aims of the administration and the \nJustice Department, and remain committed to publishing its research no \nmatter what the results.\n  Ms. Hart assured us, both at her hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee, and in answer to written questions submitted to her, that \nshe understands this, and I look forward to seeing the results of the \nresearch conducted by NIJ under her supervision. In particular, I look \nforward to seeing the NIJ study on the role of racial bias in the \nfederal death penalty carried out in a way that is true to its original \nintent, and not in a way that presumes before it even begins that \nracial bias is not a problem. And, again, at her hearing, and in \nwriting afterwards, Ms. Hart assured us that would be the case.\n  Because of those answers, and, as I said, because of Senator \nSpecter's support, I am pleased to be able to vote to confirm Sarah \nHart.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, Sarah Hart is an outstanding choice to be \nDirector of the National Institute of Justice. She is an accomplished \nlitigator who understands criminal justice issues. As a prosecutor in \nPhiladelphia for 7 years, she assembled an impressive record of trial \nvictories. And her subsequent experience litigating consent decrees \nmade her an expert in issues related to the administration of criminal \njustice systems. Throughout her career, Ms. Hart has focused on the \nrights of victims of crime. I am pleased to support Ms. Hart's \nnomination, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of her \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, are these 10-minute rollcall votes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Sarah V. Hart, of Pennsylvania, to be Director of the National \nInstitute of Justice? On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) is absent because of a death in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n    robert s. mueller, iii, to be director of the federal bureau of \n                             investigation\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have moved swiftly in the Judiciary \nCommittee to consider and move forward the nomination of Robert S. \nMueller, III, to be Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \nHis nomination was sent to the Senate on July 18 but his paperwork was \nnot completed until July 24. Less than one week later, we held 2 days \nof hearings, on July 30 and 31, and made sure that the committee \nconsidered his nomination the same week, on August 2, in order to \nensure committee and Senate consideration of this important nomination \nbefore the August recess. The committee unanimously and favorably \nreported this nomination. I thank the Democratic and Republican members \nof the committee for their cooperation and attention in allowing this \nnomination to move forward on an expedited basis.\n  Mr. Mueller has had an outstanding career in law enforcement, serving \nas a Federal prosecutor in three different United States Attorneys' \nOffices and in Main Justice under both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. As he testified at his confirmation hearing, he has \n``either personally prosecuted or supervised the prosecution of just \nabout every type of Federal Criminal offense, including homicide, drug \ntrafficking, organized crime, cyber crime, major frauds, civil rights \nand environmental crime.''\n  Mr. Mueller was the only witness at his hearings. The committee did \nnot call other witnesses we are in the midst of intensive and ongoing \nFBI oversight hearings. These FBI oversight hearings were an integral \npart of the committee's preparation to consider the nomination of a new \nFBI Director, and Mr. Mueller's opening statement at his confirmation \nhearings specifically addressed significant issues raised in the prior \nhearings.\n  At the oversight hearing on June 20, 2001, the committee examined \nboth outside oversight mechanisms and methods to restore confidence in \nthe FBI. Witnesses included former Senator John C. Danforth, who \ninvestigated the events at Waco as Special Counsel to the Attorney \nGeneral; the Honorable William H. Webster, former FBI and CIA Director, \ncurrently heading a review of FBI security in the aftermath of the \nHanssen espionage case; Glenn A. Fine, current Inspector General of the \nDepartment of Justice; Michael R. Bromwich, former Inspector General of \nthe Department of Justice; and Norman J. Rabkin, Managing Director, Tax \nAdministration and Justice Issues, General Accounting Office.\n  At the oversight hearing on July 18, 2001, the committee considered \nthe reform of FBI management with views from inside and outside the \nFBI. Witnesses included Raymond W. Kelly, former New York City Police \nCommissioner and Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service; Bob E. Dies, \nFBI Assistant Director for Information Resources; Kenneth H. Senser, \nActing FBI Deputy Assistant Director for Security Programs and \nCountermeasures; John E. Roberts, Unit Chief, FBI Office of \nProfessional Responsibility; John Werner, former Supervisory Special \nAgent, FBI Office of Professional Responsibility; Frank L. Perry, \nSupervisory Senior Resident Agent, Raleigh, North Carolina, and former \nhead of the Office of Law Enforcement Ethics at the FBI\n\n[[Page S8681]]\n\nAcademy; and Patrick J. Kiernan, Supervisory Special Agent in the Law \nEnforcement Ethics Unit at the FBI Academy.\n  This nomination comes at a crucial juncture for the FBI. Mr. Mueller \nacknowledged at his confirmation hearing ``that the Bureau's remarkable \nlegacy of service and accomplishment has been tarnished by some serious \nand highly publicized problems in recent years. Waco, Ruby Ridge, the \nFBI lab, Wen Ho Lee, Robert Hanssen and the McVeigh documents--these \nfamiliar names and events remind us all that the FBI is far from \nperfect and that the next director faces significant management and \nadministrative challenges.'' Mr. Mueller reminded us ``that these \nproblems do not tell the whole story of the FBI in recent years.'' He \ncorrectly observed that the FBI has had ``astonishing success during \nthe same period'' and that ``the men and women of the FBI have \ncontinued, throughout this period of controversy, to do an outstanding \njob.'' Nevertheless, Mr. Mueller recognized that ``highly publicized \nproblems have, indeed, shaken the public's trust in the FBI.'' The \nJudiciary Committee aims to forge a constructive partnership with Mr. \nMueller to get the FBI back on track. Congress sometimes has followed a \nhands-off approach about the FBI. Until the Bureau's problems are \nsolved, we will need a hands-on approach for awhile.\n  The rights of all Americans are at stake in the selection of an FBI \nDirector. The FBI has extraordinary power to affect the lives of \nordinary Americans. By properly using its extraordinary investigative \npowers, the FBI can protect the security of us all by combating \nsophisticated crime, terrorism, and espionage. But unchecked, these \nsame powers can undermine our civil liberties, such as freedom of \nspeech and of association, and the right to privacy. By leaking \ninformation, the FBI can destroy the lives and reputations of people \nwho have not been charged or had a trial. Worse, such leaking can be \nused for political intimidation and coercion. By respecting \nconstitutional safeguards for criminal suspects, the FBI can help \nensure that persons accused of Federal crimes receive a fair trial and \nthat justice is served. Our paramount standard for evaluating a new \nDirector is his demonstrated adherence to the Constitution as the \nbulwark of liberty and the rule of law. This is necessary to assure the \nAmerican people that the FBI will exercise its power effectively and \nfairly.\n  Throughout is career and in his testimony at his confirmation \nhearing, Mr. Mueller has showed his commitment to these principles. He \ntestified, ``I care deeply about the rule of law. In a free society a \ncentral responsibility of government. I believe, is to protect its \ncitizens from criminal harm within the framework of the Constitution.'' \nHe stressed that ``the FBI is vital to the preservation of our civil \norder and our civil rights.''\n  This was the sixth time the Judiciary Committee has held confirmation \nhearings for an FBI Director since 1973, when the first nomination was \nmade under the 1968 law requiring Presidential appointment and Senate \nconfirmation of the FBI Director.\n  That first nomination hearings, along with enactment in 1976 of the \n10-year term for the Director, were conducted against the backdrop of \nWatergate. The nominee then was L. Patrick Gray, an Assistant Attorney \nGeneral who became Acting Director after the death of J. Edgar Hoover \nin 1972. Gray held that position when the Watergate break-in and cover-\nup occurred. At the time of his confirmation hearings in early 1973, \nvery little of the scandal was known beyond the reporting of the \nWashington Post. Patrick Gray had met with the President's Counsel John \nDean, so this committee prepared to subpoena Dean and expected strong \nresistance in the name of Executive privilege. Other events then took \nover, the Gray nomination was withdrawn, and he later admitted \npersonally destroying evidence. Those were dark days for the Bureau.\n  Lost confidence in the FBI is not just a PR problem. The challenges \nfacing the next FBI Director are different from the issues of abuse of \npower three decades ago but are just as tough. The American public has \nlost some confidence in the Bureau. This is not just a PR problem. This \nerosion of public trust threatens the FBI's ability to perform its \nmission. Citizens who mistrust the FBI will be less likely to come \nforward and report information about criminal activity. Judges and \njurors will be less likely to believe the testimony of FBI witnesses. \nEven innocent or minor mistakes by the FBI in future cases may be \nperceived in a sinister light that is not warranted. Since FBI agents \nperform forensic and other critical work for many law enforcement \nagencies on the Federal, State and local levels, the repercussions of \nthis decline in public confidence in the FBI has rippled far beyond \nFederal criminal cases.\n  In his confirmation testimony, Mr. Mueller took special note of the \nimpact within the FBI: ``The shaken trust, in turn, inevitably affects \nthe morale of the men and women who serve at the Bureau.'' He pledged \nto ``make it my highest priority to restore the public's confidence in \nthe FBI, to re-earn the faith and trust of the American people.''\n  Constructive oversight is necessary. For too long, the Congress has \ntaken a hands-off approach to the FBI. Problems have been allowed to \nfester. The Congress has a duty to the American people to conduct \nsystematic and ongoing oversight of the FBI to ensure it meets the \nhighest standards of professionalism, competence, and adherence to the \nlaw. Constructive, bipartisan oversight of the FBI can greatly improve \nits effectiveness. While reviews by Inspectors General and other \noutside experts are important--the ultimate test is accountability to \nthe people through the Congress.\n  Three principles guide the Judiciary Committee's oversight of the \nFBI. First, our task is to rebuild confidence in the FBI as a vital \nnational asset, not to tear it down.\n  Second, when we look at mistakes, we do so as an essential first step \nto find and fix their cause. The purpose is not to detract from the \noutstanding work of the dedicated professional men and women of the FBI \nwho go to work every day to keep this nation safe. Highly publicized \nmistakes have created an impression that the Bureau is unmanageable, \nunaccountable and unreliable. Unfortunately, these mistakes detract \nfrom the outstanding performance of FBI Special Agents and other \nemployees who handle the most complex criminal, terrorist, and \ncounterintelligence cases day in and day out. Only by fixing those \nproblems, and continuously improving the organization, will the \ntremendous work done by so many agents and employees get the full \ncredit it deserves.\n  Finally, our efforts will be to reach bipartisan solutions that make \nthe FBI better able to fulfill the weighty mission we demand of it. \nWorking with the new Director and the Attorney General, I am convinced \nwe can achieve these goals.\n  Several Members discussed with the nominee his views on providing \ninformation to Congress. In response to Senator Schumer's concern about \na request he had made for documents from the FBI on a policy issue \nregarding records of gun sales, Mr. Mueller said:\n\n       I do believe that the Bureau should do everything possible \n     to accommodate the requests of Congress. If there are \n     documents that relate to the policy, that are generated by \n     the FBI, then I believe the Department of Justice and the FBI \n     should do everything possible to accommodate the request of \n     Congress, consistent with its law enforcement \n     responsibilities.\n\n  Mr. Mueller repeated this assurance when Senator Specter cited a \nnumber of problems in getting FBI documents over the years. Mr. Mueller \nstated, ``I absolutely agree that Congress is entitled to oversight of \nthe ongoing responsibilities of the FBI and the Department of \nJustice.'' He added that ``it is incumbent upon the FBI and the \nDepartment of Justice to attempt to accommodate every request from \nCongress swiftly and, where it cannot accommodate or believes that \nthere are confidential issues that have to be raised, to bring to your \nattention and articulate with some specificity, not just the fact that \nthere's an ongoing investigation, not just the fact that there's an \nongoing or an upcoming trial, but with specificity why producing the \ndocuments would interfere with either that trial or for some other \nreason or we believed covered by some issue of confidentiality.''\n  Mr. Mueller cited two cases, BCCI and BNL, when he was head of the \nJustice Department's Criminal Division\n\n[[Page S8682]]\n\nwhere an accommodation was reached to provide information to Congress \non pending cases. He said he ``would expect that we would always have \nthat ability to accomplish the accommodation that is necessary for \nCongress to discharge its responsibilities in oversight.'' Questioned \nfurther, Mr. Mueller said ``congressional oversight is appropriate, \neven if there is a pending prosecution or investigation'' and ``it is \nincumbent upon us to attempt to accommodate the necessity of the \noversight committee to have the information it needs.'' He went on to \nsay there may be ``the assertion of executive privilege'' and ``where \nthere is a clash or disagreement between the executive and the \nlegislative, I believe the courts are the final arbiters.''\n  Senator Grassley expressed concern about a deliberate pattern of \ndenying, delaying or simply not complying with legitimate requests and \nasked the nominee how he would change the Bureau's penchant for denying \nlegitimate access to documents and witnesses. Mr. Mueller replied that \nif there is an investigation by a committee of Congress, he would \n``expect to have somebody responsible for assuring that we are \nresponsive on that particular issue'' and, where ``some confidential \ninterests'' are implicated, ``to state honestly and directly to the \ncommittee what should be done to accommodate the committee's request.'' \nHe would like to ``foster a change in the perception so that you do \nhave the feeling at the end of the day that the FBI has been \nresponsive.''\n\n  Accommodation, rather than obstruction, of congressional requests for \ndocuments will be Mr. Mueller's goal. That is a positive promise.\n  Three core problems: The questions being asked about the FBI are \ndirected at three interrelated issues: the Bureau's security and \ninformation technology problems, management problems, and insular \n``culture.'' The committee is in the midst of examining each of these \nareas at oversight hearings that began in June shortly after I became \nchairman.\n  Serious security breakdowns and information technology inadequacies: \nIn the national security field, our country depends on FBI \ncounterintelligence to protect the most sensitive intelligence, \nmilitary, and diplomatic secrets from foreign espionage. The espionage \ncase of Robert Hanssen demonstrates, however, that the FBI's own \nsecurity and the investigation of espionage in its own ranks failed \ndramatically, with enormous potential consequences. What is more \ndisturbing is how many red flags the FBI apparently overlooked during \nthe many years that Hanssen was a spy. The reviews by the Inspector \nGeneral and Judge Webster will not be done for many months, but \ntestimony before the Committee in July shed light on how this spy was \nable to operate with impunity for so long. We were told that there were \nno less than 15 different areas of security at the FBI that were broken \nand needed to be ``bolstered, redesigned, or in some cases established \nfor the first time.''\n  The committee intends to continue its oversight work in this area, \nincluding closed sessions with the Director and other FBI officials to \nconsider classified aspects of FBI information security.\n  One of the things Director Freeh did after Hanssen's arrest was to \nrequire periodic security-screening polygraph exams for FBI agents with \naccess to the most sensitive information. Reviews are currently \nunderway that focus on the benefits and risks of the polygraph as a \nsecurity screening tool. If the FBI needs wider use of polygraph exams, \nthere must be firm assurances of consistency in their administration, \napplication and quality controls. In response to a question from \nSenator Hatch, Mr. Mueller said he is willing to continue the \nrequirement for polygraph exams for managers handling national security \nmatters. He confirmed that he had already completed that polygraph \nexam. He stated his belief that ``you don't ask people to do that which \nyou're unwilling to do yourself.''\n  The FBI needs to fully join the 21st century. This is the information \nage, but the FBI's information technology is obsolete. The committee \nhas been told that the FBI's computer systems have not been updated for \nover 6 years; that more than 13,000 desktop computers are so old they \ncannot run on today's basic software; that the majority of the smaller \nFBI field offices have internal networks that work more slowly than the \nInternet connections many of us have at home; and that the \ninvestigative databases are so old that FBI agents are unable to store \nphotographs, graphical or tabular data on them.\n  Hard-working, dedicated FBI agents trying to fight crime across the \ncountry deserve better, and they should have the computer and network \ntools that most businesses take for granted and many Americans enjoy at \nhome.\n  To the credit of former FBI Director Louis Freeh, in the last year of \nhis tenure, he reached outside the Bureau for fresh management \nperspectives and expert advice. He recruited two new senior FBI \nofficials, who were not career agents but were brought into the FBI \nfrom IBM and the CIA to develop plans for addressing the Bureau's \nsecurity and information technology problems. The Director should \ncontinue to look for the best advice from outside the Bureau, while at \nthe same time identifying leaders within the Bureau who are committed \nto necessary reforms. In the months ahead the committee will watch \nclosely to see if the Director backs up the proponents of reform when \nthey face opposition from Bureau officials wedded to the status quo.\n  At his confirmation hearings Mr. Mueller placed great emphasis on the \nneed ``to upgrade the information systems and to upgrade the systems \nand procedures to integrate modern technology. Every FBI manager, \nindeed, every agent needs to be computer literate, not a computer \nprogrammer, but aware of what computers can and cannot do to assist \nthem with their jobs.''\n  When asked by Senator DeWine how quickly he would be able to fully \nimplement the FBI's information technology plan, Mr. Mueller said the \nBureau has ``a 3-year technology update plan called Trilogy, and the \ngoods news about that is that it's laying the foundation, whether it be \nthe networks or the software, the hardware, the user interfaces for \nbringing the FBI agent into the modern era.'' He added that the ``not-\nso-good news is that once we have that structure in place, there's a \nlot more to do.'' Mr. Mueller cited in particular ``the storage and \neach retrieval of documents, of imaging documents when they come in \nimmediately so that you have ultimately what is referred to in the \nprivate sector as a paperless office.''\n  The security and information technology problems facing the FBI are \nnot problems of money. The Congress has poured money into the FBI. They \nare management problems and they can no longer be ignored. Mr. Mueller \nhas seen the FBI up close for many years--as Acting Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, as Assistant Attorney General, and in three United States \nAttorneys' offices. The committee wanted to know what management \nobjectives he would bring to the job, based on his past experience, and \nwhat other resources he would draw on to bring about needed changes.\n  Mr. Mueller spelled out his overall ``management priorities'' in his \nopening statement to the committee: ``Underlying these priorities is my \nbelief that the core asset of the FBI is its employees. I am committed \nto providing the leadership, and management, and energy necessary to \nenable these talented and dedicated people to do their jobs as \neffectively as possible.'' His first priority will be ``to recruit, \nencourage, and select the highest quality leadership'' resulting in ``a \nmanagement team that reflects the diversity of our society.'' Second to \n``review carefully management structures and systems'' with special \nconcern ``about the span of control, the degree of decentralization, \nand whether responsibilities are clearly defined.'' Third is to rebuild \nthe information infrastructure, as discussed earlier. Fourth is for the \nFBI ``to review continuously its priorities and its allocation of \nresources'' in order to ``anticipate the challenges the Bureau will be \nfacing 10 and 20 years into the future and prepare now to meet those \nchallenges.'' Fifth is to ``develop the respect and confidence of those \nwith whom it intersects, including other law enforcement agencies, both \ndomestic and international, and Congress.''\n\n  Mr. Mueller added that he would ``move quickly on administrative and \nmanagement changes.'' Personnel\n\n[[Page S8683]]\n\nchanges would be made first. Changes in structure and span of control \nwould take more time, with input from a management consultant study \ncommissioned by the Attorney General, other pending reviews, and ideas \nfrom other executives who rule large organizations.\n  The management structure at the FBI may simply have become too \nunwieldy. when the Bureau was smaller, its headquarters could \nreasonably attempt to keep track of the activities in its field \noffices. In recent years, however, the Bureau has grown tremendously \nwith 56 field offices, plus 44 overseas legal attaches. It may not be \npossible for headquarters to effectively monitor field activities. The \nbelated production of documents in Oklahoma City bombing case happened \ndespite 16 separate orders from headquarters for pretrial production of \nthose documents. Similar problems arose in the Wen Ho Lee case, where a \nfield office disregarded instructions from headquarters. At the FBI \noversight hearings Former New York Police Commissioner and Customs \nCommissioner Ray Kelly testified that a regional structure makes a \nlarge law enforcement organization more manageable.\n  At the confirmation hearings I asked Mr. Mueller whether this is \nsomething that would be considered. He replied, ``Absolutely,'' and \nsaid he ``did read Commissioner Kelly's testimony with some interest.'' \nHe added, ``I would look at that proposal with a view to whether it \ngoes toward affording appropriate span of control.'' He went on to \nstress the need ``to have the technological infrastructure be such that \nI would be able to review, as would the intermediate managers, review \nthe work on critical cases or critical classes of cases by turning on \nyour computer and using the mouse to click on a series of cases to see \nwhat has been done the last 3 days, what you expect to be done in the \nnext 30 days.''\n  Senator Kohl asked if it was realistic to expect big changes quickly, \ngiven the size of the FBI with more than 27,000 employees and a budget \nof more than $3.5 billion. Mr. Mueller replied, ``I do think that one \ncan relatively quickly, over several weeks/months, learn the \ninstitution and learn the people, learn what are the largest problems, \nwhether it is span of control, what are the larger personnel problems \nand in a relatively short time. And I don't want to specify any \nparticular time, but certainly within months start to make substantial \nchanges.'' He added that making ``the most critical decisions'' about \npositions of leadership ``is not an extraordinarily time-consuming \nundertaking.'' Changing the organizational structure and the span of \ncontrol ``will take longer time than perhaps making some personnel \nchanges.''\n  I asked the nominee what management problems caused the FBI's failure \nto produce documents in the McVeigh case. Mr. Mueller cited two \ncontributing factors. One was ``the lack of an infrastructure to have \nall documents coded and readily available'' in a case with ``a huge \nvolume of documents spread across any number of offices in this country \nand internationally.'' Second was ``accountability'' and ``overlapping \nareas of responsibility in various areas of the FBI'' which make it \n``very difficult to have accountability.'' There was ``perhaps a \nfailure of accountability down to the lowest levels.'' Mr. Mueller said \nhe would address this issue: ``It has been my practice in the past to \nidentify areas of responsibility, put somebody in charge of that area \nof responsibility and hold that individual accountable for discharging \nthat responsibility. And I want to make certain that where that is done \nwithin the Bureau, there is clear accountability.''\n  I also asked Mr. Mueller to discuss the time of his own reporting to \nthe Attorney general on the document production problem in the McVeigh \ncase. He testified: ``Turning to the issue of the time line, upon \nhearing about the issue, I heard about it I believe on a Wednesday \nafternoon. On that Friday, the decision was made to put over the \nexecution of Mr. McVeigh. When I heard about it on a Wednesday \nafternoon, the initial response, and I believe I talked to the \nprosecutor that night or the following morning, the initial thrust of \nwhat I was concerned about is to make certain that defense counsel were \naware of this immediately so that defense counsel could make its or \ntheir own interpretation of whether these documents contained any Brady \nor exculpatory information.''\n\n  Mr. Mueller also testified:\n\n       I was not aware, I don't believe, at the outset the extent \n     of the commitment to turn over documents until the following \n     morning. And I actually had brief discussions with Mr. \n     Ashcroft's staff on Wednesday afternoon, I think it was, \n     about it, but I did not have an opportunity to fully brief \n     the Attorney General until the following day, at which point \n     I did have an opportunity to brief him more expansively that \n     the fact that I had mentioned previously to his staff, that \n     there was an issue. And, thereafter, the discussions ensured \n     as to what was the appropriate response we would take to the \n     fact that these documents had come to our attention.\n\n  Both Senator Feingold and Senator Sessions raised concerns about the \nFBI's failure to provide information to prosecutors in the 1963 \nBirmingham bombing case. Mr. Mueller testified that he shared this \nconcern. In cases ``involving national security information that may \nbear on a particular prosecution,'' there may be ``valid reasons for \nkeeping certain of the information from the prosecutors that go into \ncourt,'' but mechanisms exist ``to assure that there is no Brady \ninformation, exculpatory information that should be given to the \ndefense.'' He added that the day-to-day problem of FBI inability to \nproduce documents quickly ``is attributable in part to its antiquated \nfiling system.'' He said his objective is to have an FBI system to \nimage documents into a database to make them ``immediately accessible \nso that you do not have the problem such as you saw with he prosecution \nof the McVeigh documents.''\n  Mr. Mueller expressed his willingness to reach out to experts \nwherever they may be found, including in and outside the FBI to address \nmanagement and infrastructure problems. He stated that he has ``reached \nout, and will continue to reach out'' to ``persons who have been in the \nBureau previously'' and ``persons in large corporations, CEOs, who have \nrun successful corporations to try to identify those management \nstructures that worked well and would work best at the FBI.'' He also \nis ``looking forward to receiving the report of the consulting firm \nthat is charged with looking at the FBI from top to bottom.'' Mr. \nMueller added that he ``would welcome the insight from any other \nindividuals, assuming it is a combination of individuals with \nexperience in management and private industry, law enforcement, and \nother walks of life.\n\n  With regard to FBI personnel management, Mr. Mueller agreed that \npromotion of diversity within the FBI to ensure that the FBI employment \nlevel is reflective of America is a priority. The FBI should be more \nsensitive to recruiting and training minorities. In addition, Mr. \nMueller acknowledged in response to questions from Senator Durbin that \n``racial profiling is abhorrent to the Constitution, it is abhorrent in \nany way, shape or form. And I would make certain that from the first \nday an FBI agent sets foot in the academy in Quantico that that refrain \nis repeated as part of the training, and as one goes through the ranks, \ncontinuous retraining, and focus on the fact that the FBI, in order to \nbe the preeminent law enforcement organization in the country if not in \nthe world, has to have an unblemished record with regard to addressing \nand strongly attacking any indication of racial profiling.''\n  It is especially important to understand how the nominee views the \nFBI Director's relationship with the Attorney General in the overall \nmanagement structure at the Department of Justice. Too often in the \npast Directors have had the final word on management of the Bureau. Of \ncourse, there are legitimate concerns about political interference with \ninvestigations, as Watergate demonstrated. The FBI Director is not, \nhowever, unique in having to resist with interference. Both the FBI \nDirector and the Attorney General have that duty, and they should work \ntogether to ensure the integrity of both investigations and \nprosecutions. The FBI Director should be part of the Justice \nDepartment's leadership team.\n  I asked Mr. Mueller under oath at his confirmation hearing to give \nhis commitment that if he were ever pressured politically by the \nRepublications or the Democrats to affect an investigation, that he \nwould resist that pressure with\n\n[[Page S8684]]\n\nall his might. Mr. Mueller replied, ``Absolutely.''\n  I questioned the nominee on how he sees the FBI Director's \nrelationship with the current and subsequent Attorneys General, since \nhe may work with more than one Attorney General over his 10-year term. \nMr. Mueller testified:\n\n       This is the most difficult issue I think that a director of \n     the FBI has to address, in that the FBI has its ultimate \n     responsibility to the American people to be independent, to \n     pursue its investigations without any favor to one political \n     party or the other or to any particular individual, no matter \n     how powerful that individual should be. And on a day-to-day \n     basis, on the other hand, I do believe that, absent \n     extraordinary circumstances, the Director of the FBI, and the \n     FBI, is a component of * * * the Department of Justice, \n     reporting to the Attorney General. And there should be a \n     close relationship on, for instance, policy matters, and \n     there is a requirement in almost every matter that the \n     Attorney General be apprised of that. And, again, I report, \n     in essence, to the Attorney General and then to the \n     President.\n\n       There may be circumstances--there have been in history--\n     where it is important for the FBI and the Director of the FBI \n     to put * * * the interests of the people above that reporting \n     structure. And I hope that I do not have occasion to meet \n     such a situation, but there is the possibility, perhaps even \n     the probability, that I will. If there is an occasion where I \n     believe that for reasons of political influence or the \n     influence of the powerful that the Bureau is asked to do \n     something that is inappropriate, wrong under the \n     Constitution, that under those circumstances I have an \n     obligation to find a way to address that. It may be going \n     elsewhere in the administration. It may be going to Congress. \n     It may be going to the American people. I don't know what the \n     exact answer is. But I hope I do not have to face that \n     situation because it will be the hardest decision that, \n     should I be confirmed as Director, would have to make.\n\n  I consider this answer to be a model for all Mr. Mueller's successors \nas FBI Director.\n  Senator Specter and Senator Sessions asked the nominee what he would \ndo if he had information that the Attorney General was taking an \nimproper law enforcement action for political reasons. Mr. Mueller \nreplied that he would ``go to the Attorney General first before I made \nperhaps a disclosure to Congress.'' He would also ``explore other \nalternatives or a variety of alternatives in order to make certain that \njustice was done.'' Questioned further on the second day of the \nhearing, Mr. Mueller said that ``if it was a matter of substantial \nconsequence'' and he ``was turned down by the Attorney General, I would \nthink I'd have an obligation to inform the Senate of that, and produce \nthose documents.''\n  In the discussion of this issue, reference was made to a memorandum \nfrom FBI Deputy Director Esposito to FBI Director Freeh, dated December \n9, 1996. In that memorandum Mr. Esposito said Lee Radek, chief of the \nJustice Department's Public Integrity Section, had made a comment to \nDirector Freeh. According to the Esposito memorandum, Mr. Radek had \ncommented that there was a lot of ``pressure'' on him regarding a case \nbefore the ``Attorney General's job might hang in the balance.'' The \naccuracy of this memorandum has been seriously questioned. At a \nSubcommittee hearing on May 24, 2000, Mr. Radek testified that he felt \npressure from the Attorney General to do a good job, but that there was \nno connection in his mind between any such pressure and whether or not \nthe Attorney General would continue in her job as Attorney General \nduring the second Clinton Administration. Mr. Esposito's second-hand \naccount has not been corroborated. This episode should be a warning of \nthe risk that lower level officials may seek to sabotage political \nappointees. The use of this memorandum as a straw man for questioning \nthe nominee should not imply agreement by other Members to its \ncredibility.\n  The nominee was also asked to consider the possibility that he and \nthe Attorney General might decide to withhold information on national \nsecurity matters from a President if the President were the target of a \ncriminal investigation. In response to a question from Senator Specter, \nMr. Mueller stated, ``There may be an occasion where it's possible, \nyes.'' Mr. Mueller also explained that, if disclosing ``information to \na target would hamper or undercut the investigation,'' he would expect \n``that any decision as to whether or not that information should be \ndisclosed to the target would be made in conjunction with the Attorney \nGeneral. But the decision may well be that that information should not \nbe disclosed.'' Mr. Mueller went on to state, ``If it is national \nsecurity information, on the other hand, that bears upon the security \nof the United States, I think we have an obligation to assure that \nanything within those materials that bears on the national security \nfinds its place in the national security structure.''\n  I am troubled by an apparent inconsistency in this response, because \nthe President bears full and ultimate responsibility for the national \nsecurity structure and all the diplomatic, military, intelligence, and \nother actions necessary to protect the nation's security. An FBI \nDirector must find a way to accommodate the legitimate needs of the \nPresident to exercise his constitutional responsibilities for national \nsecurity, just as it accommodates the needs of the Congress to exercise \nits oversight responsibilities.\n  The FBI ``culture'' needs an overhaul. The committee is receiving \ntestimony in our oversight hearings showing that, too often, the \nindependence that is part of the FBI's culture has crossed the line \ninto arrogance. Senator Danforth expressed concern to this committee \nabout entrenched executives at the FBI who have created a closed and \ninsular culture resistant to disclosure of mistakes and to reforms. His \nconcern was echoed in testimony the committee heard from experienced \nFBI Special agents, who told us of a ``club'' mentality among some \nBureau executives who resist criticism or change that threatens their \ncareers. Senator Danforth recommended that the new director should be \nprepared to clean house to the extent necessary to implement needed \nchanges.\n  If there is one message that a new Director should get from recent \nproblems, it is that FBI executives need to be more willing to admit \ntheir mistakes. Too often their response is to protect the Bureau from \nembarrassment or shield self-serving executives from criticism and \nneeded change. As Senator Danforth testified, the FBI helped fan the \nflames of conspiracy theories at Waco by covering up evidence that it \nused pyrotechnic rounds, even though they had nothing to do with \nstarting the fire. The present FBI culture makes it easier to cover up \nrather than admit a mistake. A new Director must understand that this \ntype of conduct risks a far greater cost in the lost of public \nconfidence, as compared with admitting mistakes when they occur.\n  Let me cite one example that occurred just a week ago. In its recent \nweekly newsletter for FBI employees, the FBI reported on the Judiciary \nCommittee's July 18 hearing. But the newsletter reported on the \nTestimony of the two senior FBI agents, who told us about what they \nwere doing to fix the security and information technology problems at \nthe FBI. Their testimony was also the only testimony posted on the FBI \nwebsite. Yet, the testimony of the four other FBI agents who testified \nabout problems of a double standard in adjudicating discipline and \nabout retaliation within the FBI was ignored--not mentioned in the \nnewsletter nor posted on the Website. Ignoring the testimony will not \nmake it disappear. This kind of attitude makes it much harder to make \nthe changes that need to be made. If the FBI tries to suppress \ninformation that things have gone wrong, it will never get them fixed.\n  When I asked Mr. Mueller at his confirmation hearings about this \nnewsletter, he stated ``that it is important that everybody in the \nBureau look at both the good and the bad in order to address it.'' \nAfter my remarks at the nomination hearings, FBI Headquarters decided \nto send the testimony of the four other FBI agents to the field \noffices. That was the right decision.\n  In his opening statement, Mr. Mueller discussed the broader concerns \nabout the FBI's culture:\n\n       [A]s we examine the mistakes of the past, we must be \n     resolved to respond quickly and forthrightly to the mistakes \n     of the future. Three elements are critical to a proper \n     response: First, we must be willing to admit immediately that \n     a mistake has occurred. This includes providing timely \n     information to the appropriate committees of Congress. And \n     for matters involving cases and courts, immediately informing \n     the court and defense counsel as appropriate. Failure to \n     admit one's mistakes contributes to the perception of \n     institutional arrogance.\n\n[[Page S8685]]\n\n       Second, those responsible for the mistake must be held \n     accountable. This does not mean punishing employees for \n     simple errors in doing their jobs. Nobody is perfect, and we \n     want to encourage people to come forward immediately when \n     mistakes are made, but we must hold people accountable, and \n     we cannot tolerate efforts to cover up problems or to blame \n     others for them. If confirmed, I will be committed to \n     inculcating a culture which understands that we all make \n     mistakes and that we must be forthright and honest in \n     admitting them and correcting them as quickly as possible. We \n     must tell the truth and let the facts speak for themselves. \n     The truth is what we expect in our investigations of others, \n     and the truth is what we must demand of ourselves when we \n     come under scrutiny . . . .\n       And, third, every significant mistake must be examined to \n     determine whether broader reform is necessary. We must learn \n     from our mistakes or we will be bound to repeat them.\n\n  I questioned Mr. Mueller about two recent cases where mistakes have \nnot been rectified. Documents provided to the Committee on the Justice \nDepartment's January 2001 decision on Ruby Ridge discipline revealed \nthat discipline given to some FBI agents in January 1995 was incorrect. \nAnother example was a CIA officer who was initially suspected of \nespionage before the FBI discovered that Hanssen was the real culprit. \nThe CIA officer was cleared and allowed to return to his work, but the \nFBI did not formally notify him or his family that he is no longer \nsuspected of any wrongdoing. Mr. Mueller agreed to look into these \nmatters.\n  In other questioning of the nominee, Senator Sessions observed that \nthere has been a concern in the FBI that if somebody made an honest \nerror, the hierarchy would be too hard on them. He saw this as a factor \nin the lack of willingness to come forward with and admit an error. Mr. \nMueller agreed and said ``the bedrock principle ought to be to tell the \ntruth . . . the sooner the better.'' Senator Specter asked Mr. Mueller \nwhat his response would be when an FBI official deliberately does not \ncorrect a mistake in testimony to Congress or deliberately does not \ndisclose important information. He replied that ``absolutely anybody \nwho lies deserves the strongest sanction, up to and including dismissal \nfrom the FBI.''\n  Another concern about the FBI culture is the Bureau's treatment of \nlocal law enforcement agencies. Senator DeWine asked how the nominee \nintended to set the right tone for the FBI in this area. Mr. Mueller \nreplied that one way would be ``outreach'' to address any complaints \nsuch as stealing an investigation. He also stressed that ``the FBI can \nand should allow others to trumpet its successes.'' He stated, ``In my \nown mind, the praise that makes the biggest difference is that that \ncomes from others with whom you've worked. And my hope would be that we \ncould operate on that principle.''\n  Senator Grassley expressed concern about a culture of arrogance at \nthe FBI, exemplified by the practice of holding press conferences in \nvery high-profile cases before the investigation is complete. Mr. \nMueller responded that he is ``not a great one for press conferences'' \nand that in cases where the FBI assists local law enforcement ``I would \nmuch rather have, at the conclusion of an investigation, that the state \nand locals stand at the podium, do the press conference, and thank the \nFBI.''\n  Senator Specter, citing an unanswered letter he sent to Director \nFreeh about leaks in the press regarding an alleged investigation of \nSenator Torricelli, asked what action the FBI Director could take to \npreclude these types of leaks. Mr. Mueller replied, ``Generally \nspeaking . . . I abhor leaks. They are detrimental to the mission of \nthe FBI. They are detrimental to most particularly the individual who \nis the subject of them. I think you set a standard of very harsh \ntreatment when an investigation is conducted and somebody is determined \nto have leaked.'' He pledged to ``do everything in my power to assure'' \nthat Justice Department regulations on public statements ``are abided \nby and that any breach of those regulations is treated firmly.'' He \nalso agreed ``to determine whether there is predication'' for an \ninquiry on the leaks regarding Senator Torricelli and, if there is \npredication, to ``conduct an inquiry.''\n  To ensure full investigation of mistakes, I support the change made \nby the Attorney General to give the Justice Department's Inspector \nGeneral full authority over the FBI. The Inspector General statute \nshould be amended to make this regulatory change permanent. Witnesses \nat the oversight hearings expressed concern that the Inspector General \nwill not get the same cooperation from FBI personnel as a separate \nInspector General for the Bureau. The Director's responsibility \nincludes ensuring that FBI personnel cooperate fully with the Inspector \nGeneral. One former Justice Department Inspector General testified \nthat, when his office sought FBI personnel to work on a review of FBI \nperformance, experienced Agents were reluctant to participate and \ndeclined to have their names listed in the report. Agents did not view \nthis work as ``career-enhancing.'' A Director must make clear that FBI \nexecutives should reward--not discourage--participation in Inspector \nGeneral, and other oversight, investigations of Bureau performance.\n  The committee has heard disturbing testimony about retaliation \nagainst FBI Agents who are tasked to investigate their colleagues or \nwho discuss issues with the Congress, either directly or through \ncooperation with the General Accounting Office, which assists in \ncongressional oversight. It is important that a new Director send a \nclear message to FBI employees that he will not tolerate retaliation \nagainst agents who conduct internal investigations or who bring \ninformation about wrongdoing to the Congress directly.\n  In response to a question from Senator Durbin about his proposal for \na separate FBI Inspector General, Mr. Mueller noted the Attorney \nGeneral's recent action and said he sees the Inspector General from the \nDepartment of Justice ``working very closely with the FBI Office of \nProfessional Responsibility to allocate responsibilities.'' He added, \n``If I were the Attorney General I might have some concern about a \nseparate Inspector General feeding the perception that the FBI was a \nseparate institution accountable only to itself. And I'm not certain in \nmy own mind whether or not what the accountability you seek cannot be \ndischarged by an Inspector General with appropriate personnel in the \nDepartment of Justice, as opposed to establishing another Inspector \nGeneral in the FBI.''\n  Senator Durbin asked what steps the nominee would take to ensure that \nthere will be a healthy relationship with an Inspector General in the \nmanagement of the FBI. Mr. Mueller replied that the FBI Director should \nmeet weekly or every other week ``with the Inspector General to review \nthe cases, in the same way that the Attorney General meets with the \nInspector General.'' Mr. Mueller also stated, ``To the extent that the \nInspector General in the past was hampered by having to go to the \nAttorney General and specifically requesting authority, that has been \nremoved.''\n  Internal investigations must also lead to fair and just discipline. \nHere the recent record is troubling. An internal FBI study that was \nreleased at the Committee's July hearing found a double standard at \nwork, with senior FBI executives receiving a slap on the wrist for the \nsame kind of conduct that would result in serious discipline for lower \nlevel employees. The most vivid example occurred when seven Senior \nExecutives submitted false travel vouchers to they could fly to \nWashington for the retirement dinner of a Deputy Director. They \nreceived only letters of censure for a voucher fraud offense that could \ncost an average Agent his or her career. Two of them actually received \npromotions and cash awards. In another case, the argument was asserted \nwithin the Justice Department that the FBI Director may not be \ndisciplined because he is a Presidential appointee and that, in any \nevent, the FBI Director should not be disciplined for exercising poor \njudgment. This argument conflicts with the basic principle that all \npublic officials should be held equally accountable.\n  In his opening statement, Mr. Mueller said it is ``very important \nthat there be no double standards in accountability. I know there have \nbeen allegations that senior FBI officials are sometimes treated more \nleniently than more junior employees. Any such double standard would be \nfundamentally unfair and enormously destructive to employee morale. If \nanything, senior FBI officials should be held to a higher standard than \nother employees,\n\n[[Page S8686]]\n\nfor, after all, they should serve as an example. I commit to this \ncommittee, to the employees of the FBI, and to the American people that \nthere will be no such double standard should I become director of the \nFBI.''\n\n  In response to my questions, Mr. Mueller put even greater emphasis on \nappointing ``leaders in the FBI who are held to a higher standard'' \nbecause they ``serve as example for others in the FBI.''\n  During the confirmation hearings, Committee members raised issues \nregarding the scope and methods of FBI investigations.\n  Senator Feingold asked if the nominee was willing to consider \nrequiring FBI agents to record interviews electronically, a practice \nconsistent with the practice of many law enforcement agencies around \nthe country. Mr. Mueller said that he would and that the FBI no longer \nhas a ``hard and fast rule'' against it. Interviews may be recorded \nwith the approval of the Special Agent in Charge. While working \nhomicides in the District of Columbia, Mr. Mueller saw ``the advantage \nof the use of recording interviews.'' However, given the thousands of \nFBI interviews conducted daily including background investigations, he \nthought it would be ``counterproductive to require recording and \ntranscribing all such interviews.'' The FBI ``will continue to look at \nit, particularly in an instance where it is important that a confession \nor critical evidence relating to a terrorist attack needs to be \ndeciphered accurately with no room for error.''\n  Senator Feingold also expressed concern about the FBI's difficulty \ndistinguishing between peaceful political dissent and criminal activity \nin the past and possibly in the targeting of Arab Americans today. He \nasked what steps Mr. Mueller would take to ensure that the Bureau does \nnot infringe on fundamental First Amendment rights and restricts itself \nto investigating only criminal activity. Mr. Mueller replied that he \ndoes ``share the concern.'' Citing his experience in criminal \ninvestigations, he said he ``would insist that whenever we are \nundertaking an investigative enterprise, that there be adequate \npredication for the steps we take to pursue that investigation.'' He \nalso said he would address the problems of ``span of control'' and the \nFBI's computer infrastructure in order to ``have transparency of \ninformation all the way to the top.'' This would ``provide the \noversight necessary'' to assure that ``predication is being looked at, \ndemonstrated, before a particular important investigation is going \nforward or a class of investigation is going forward.''\n  Senator Specter raised the issue of FBI agents asking someone who has \nbeen arrested if they have information about some other person who is a \npublic figure, with the suggestion that the case against the individual \nunder arrest will go easier if that individual is able to identify \nsomebody who is well known. Mr. Mueller responded that ``a general \ntargeting, without predication, is anathema to the Bureau, and to the \nextent that any incident such as that comes to the attention of the \nDirector, it should be dealt with firmly.''\n  Senator Cantwell raised a privacy concerns, which I share, about the \nFBI's Carnivore system, or DCS-1000, and new technologies such as a key \nlogger system. Mr. Mueller said he was sensitive to those concerns and \nhad talked with a number of privacy groups when he was Acting Deputy \nAttorney General. Asked by Senator Cantwell to review Carnivore, Mr. \nMueller said the Justice Department is conducting such a review and he \nwould look at it when it is completed.\n  The Fourth Amendment must be kept up to date in response to new and \nemerging surveillance technologies. This is an issue about which I \nalerted Mr. Mueller that the FBI should anticipate increased oversight \nfrom the Judiciary Committee and increased concern on both sides of the \naisle. I asked the nominee to look at the procedures in place for law \nenforcement access to electronic information because so much of it is \nstored in the hands of third parties. Our aim should be to make sure \nthat privacy is properly protected in the electronic age, whether it is \na keystroke, thermal imaging, or dealing with the proliferation of \nsmall companies that hold our data. Mr. Mueller agreed to do so, \nobserving that ``there are issues where there is a law enforcement \ntool, there are privacy interests implicated, and yet one doesn't know \nwhere the line is.''\n  Privacy interests are also implicated by the Attorney General's \ndecision to cut-back on the retention of records of gun sales to \nlegitimate gun owners. Mr. Mueller initially acknowledged that this \ndecision ``could'' subvert the FBI's effort to keep guns out of the \nhands of criminals and go after the bad dealers, but noted that he was \n``not familiar with the debate or what evidence there is, what study \nthere has been of the impact of the change, but, yes, it could.'' Mr. \nMueller accepted my invitation to work with members of the Committee \nand the Attorney General to ensure that the National Incident Criminal \nBackground Check System maintains an accurate auditing system, but also \nprotects the legitimate rights of gun owners.\n  The FBI has long been considered the crown jewel of law enforcement \nagencies. Today, it has lost some of its earlier luster. The next FBI \nDirector has both a great challenge and a great opportunity to restore \npublic confidence in the Bureau, and the Judiciary Committee stands \nready to help. The Committee needs to forge a strong and constructive \noversight partnership with the leadership at the Department of Justice \nand the FBI to shape the reforms and find the solutions to make the FBI \nthe premier law enforcement agency that the American people want and \nexpect it to be.\n  Robert Mueller seems well prepared to meet this challenge and take \nadvantage of this opportunity as the next Director of the FBI. With a \nstatutory ten-year term, the position of FBI Director is unique in our \ngovernment, and confirmation of a nominee to that position is an \nexceptionally serious responsibility for the Senate.\n  With full consciousness of that responsibility, I urge my colleagues \nto confirm the nomination of Robert S. Mueller, III, to be Director of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am very pleased that the Senate will \nvote today on the confirmation of three excellent nominees for high \noffice.\n  The nomination of Robert Mueller to be FBI Director is particularly \nsignificant. I consider the FBI to be one of the most important \nagencies of the Government, and the post of FBI Director to be one of \nthe most consequential in the world. The FBI Director is trusted to \ncommand huge resources that touch the lives of people around the globe. \nHe is charged with protecting the most important resource in America--\nour people. And the Director holds a term--10 years--that exceeds that \nof any elected Federal representative. The Director thus has great \npower and great insulation from the popular will--a combination that \nrequires this body to be especially vigilant in its confirmation \nreview. But after examining Bob Mueller's record, meeting with him \nprivately, listening to many people who know him, and questioning him \nat the Judiciary Committee hearing earlier this week, I am extremely \nconfident that President Bush has chosen the right person for this \nposition. Mr. Mueller has the judgment, integrity and dedication to \npurpose that will make him an excellent FBI Director.\n  I will mention two things about Mr. Mueller that particularly strike \nme on his long list of professional accomplishments. The first is his \nmilitary record. For his service as a Marine during the Vietnam war, \nMr. Mueller was awarded the Bronze Star, 2 Navy Commendation Medals, \nthe Purple Heart, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. The second \nparticularly notable item is that in 1995, after 2 years as a senior \npartner in the distinguished firm of Hale and Dorr, Mr. Mueller left to \nbecome a regular, line prosecutor in the homicide section of the \nDistrict of Columbia's U.S. Attorney's Office. This was after he had \nserved as the head of the Criminal Section in the Department of Justice \nand in other high offices. This speaks volumes about Mr. Mueller's \ncharacter, values, and commitment to public service.\n\n  Of course, Mr. Mueller will need to muster all his skill and \nexperience to execute his new assignment. He will step into the FBI at \na time of some disruption caused by several high-profile \nembarrassments. But he will have the inheritance of former Director \nLouis Freeh's tremendous work, and he will be supported by the Bush \nadministration and Attorney General Ashcroft in\n\n[[Page S8687]]\n\nparticular. I hope he has support from Congress as well. We should be \ncareful to act in ways that encourage positive change at the FBI and \navoid distracting the bureau from its mission.\n  I again applaud President Bush for his choice of Bob Mueller to be \nFBI Director. I have every confidence that he will prove to be an \nexcellent leader and a force for positive change at the FBI.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm the \nPresident's nominee, Mr. Mueller.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise to support the nomination of \nRobert Mueller to be the Director of the FBI. I also want to thank my \nfriend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for holding a hearing \nand a committee vote on Mr. Mueller's nomination this soon after \nPresident Bush's forwarding of Mr. Mueller's nomination to the Senate. \nIt is my hope that when we return from summer recess, we will be able \nto keep the same pace with President Bush's many other critical \nnominees.\n  Mr. Mueller will have a big job in front of him as the new Director \nof the FBI. The Bureau is plagued with culture problems which have \neroded the public's confidence in their ability to effectively \ninvestigate crime and apprehend criminals. The senior management of the \nFBI has fostered a culture of arrogance that has produced abuse of \npower and coverup. The FBI has been embarrassed time and again by the \nmisconduct of its senior management. First there were the tragedies at \nWaco and Ruby Ridge. The FBI retaliated against Dr. Fred Whitehurst \nafter he blew the whistle on the FBI crime labs. There was also the \nbotched investigation into the Wen Ho Lee matter and the FBI's failure \nto turn over evidence to the defense in the Timothy McVeigh trial.\n  As an ardent advocate of FBI reform, what often gets lost in my \ncomments is the respect that I have for the thousands of men and women \nserving their country as FBI employees. My criticisms of the FBI's \nmanagement culture should in no way minimize the great sacrifices that \nour honest and hardworking FBI agent and support personnel make every \nday for our country. But these men and women, as well as the American \npeople, deserve a law enforcement organization that has integrity and \ncredibility. The FBI management system is broken, and this does a real \ndisservice to the hardworking agents on the street.\n  Mr. Mueller and I met in my office a few weeks ago to discuss this \nculture of arrogance and his plans for reform. In the three short weeks \nsince that meeting, the FBI's culture of arrogance has continued to \nraise its ugly head. Just a week after the meeting, the national papers \nwere filled with headlines that the FBI couldn't find its guns. The FBI \nhas lost or had stolen from them 440 firearms and 171 laptop computers. \nThe Inspector General is currently conducting an investigation to \ndetermine the extent of the damages, but we do know that one of the \nlost guns was used in the commission of a homicide and at least one of \nthe laptops contained classified information about two espionage cases.\n  A day after that revelation, four senior FBI agents testified before \nthe Judiciary Committee that the Bureau has dual standard for the \ndisciplining of employees. According to these men, Senior Executive \nService employees are given slaps on the wrists for their infractions, \nwhile the rank and file agents are often punished to the letter of the \nlaw.\n  Most recently, last Thrusday, the public saw a good example of how \nsome SES employees abuse their power: The Washington Times reported \nthat a group of FBI managers staged a conference entitled ``Integrity \nin Law Enforcement'' that we merely a sham and a cover, so that senior \nFBI managers could obtain improper reimbursements for traveling to a \nretirement party for veteran agent Larry Potts. The Washington Times \nfurther reported that ``no one was disciplined other than to receive \nletters of censure.'' This lack of discipline directly counters the \nletter of the law. In 1994, Director Freeh issued a ``Bright Line'' \nmemo dictating that voucher fraud and the making of false statements \nwould result in dismissal. Had the rank and file done this, they would \nhave been fired.\n  These most recent FBI blunders are further eroding public confidence \nthat the FBI is up to the task their Nation has called upon them to do.\n  But, not all the news is bad. In the weeks since our meeting, the \nAttorney General has issued an order to enlarge the jurisdiction of the \nDepartment of Justice Office of Inspector General. The Inspector \nGeneral will not have primary jurisdiction over allegations of \nmisconduct against employees of the FBI and DEA. This is an important \nand encouraging step toward overall FBI reform. I hope it will help to \nsolve the problems that the FBI has with their management culture. \nPrevious to this, the Inspector General could not initiate an \ninvestigation within the FBI or DEA, without expressed permission from \nthe Deputy Attorney General. I have been saying for many years that the \nFBI should not be allowed to police itself, and I am encouraged by this \nnew step toward the establishment of a free and independent oversight \nentity. Along these same lines, Senator Leahy and I will soon be \noffering a bill to make permanent what the Attorney General's Order \naccomplished regarding oversight of the Bureau and the reporting of \nmisconduct by FBI employees. This bill is critical to having lasting \nreform.\n  In order for a true change in the FBI's management culture to occur, \nthere must be vigorous oversight by an independent IG, as well as by \nthe Congress. With the Attorney General's order and the work of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, there will be oversight. But, there must \nalso be a strong leader known for honesty and integrity at the helm of \nthe Bureau. Mr. Mueller has sterling credentials and a great deal of \nexperience. He has also impressed me with his history of reform while \nthe U.S. Attorney for San Francisco. A similar overhaul is needed at \nthe FBI. However, I'm converned that Mr. Mueller still doesn't fully \ncomprehend the culture problems that exist at the FBI. As the new \nDirector, he must be committed to fundamentally changing the Bureau's \nmanagement culture.\n  That being said, I am suporting Mr. Mueller's nomination. Based on \nthis responses to the concerns that I have raised with him, the \ncommitments he has made to reform the culture of the FBI, as well as \nthe many recommendations he has received in support of this nomination, \nI trust that he will be able to institute the much needed reform of the \nFBI's management culture. I will be voting to confirm Mr. Mueller to be \ndirector of the FBI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe confirmation of Robert Mueller to be Director of the FBI and to \ncomment about the hearings which were very important in establishing \nstandards for congressional oversight.\n  Mr. Mueller brings outstanding credentials to the position of \nDirector of the FBI: an excellent academic background, an excellent \nprofessional background, served as U.S. attorney in Boston, as U.S. \nattorney in San Francisco, as Assistant Attorney General in charge of \nthe Criminal Division, earlier this year was acting Deputy Attorney \nGeneral.\n  One of the things he did which I found enormously impressive was \nwhile in private practice in a very lucrative context, he called up the \nU.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and asked for a job trying \nhomicide cases. That was after he had been Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Criminal Division. That was his devotion to public service and \nhis devotion to law enforcement and his devotion to prosecution.\n\n  I found that unique based on my own experience as an assistant \ndistrict attorney before becoming D.A. of the city of Philadelphia. \nPeople ask me from time to time what my favorite job was. It is not \nSenator or D.A., but assistant D.A. where you really get into the \ncourtroom and try so many cases. He brings an outstanding background to \nthis very important and very difficult job.\n  Arguably, the Director of the FBI is the most powerful man in \nAmerica. I say that because the Director has a 10-year statutory term. \nThe most the President of the United States can serve is two 4-year \nterms for a total of 8 years. What the President does is subject to \nconsiderable public scrutiny, unlike the record of the FBI where\n\n[[Page S8688]]\n\nmost of its work is done on a confidential basis and in secret. So it \nis a very powerful position.\n  Mr. Mueller comes to this job with a very troubled Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation. Recognizing that and the problems they have had with the \ncrime laboratory and the Hanssen case and Waco and Ruby Ridge, they \nhave also had tremendous successes. They have had successes on the \nUnibomber, the Trade Center bombings, the Embassy terrorist attacks, \nKhobar Towers, and many successful actions thwarting terrorist attacks \nwhich are not publicized.\n  When a mistake is made by a public official or by an agency like the \nFBI, they are plastered across the front pages. Their successes are not \nnoted. Many of them are confidential so their informants and sources \nare not disclosed. While it is a troubled agency, it is still a very \nfine agency. It has performed investigative service for the United \nStates. The FBI responsibilities have increased enormously in the last \nfew years, fighting organized crime overseas and international \nterrorism.\n  I think Director Freeh did as good a job as could be done under very \ndifficult circumstances. I analogize Director Freeh to the story of the \nDutch boy who is trying to keep the water from coming through the dyke. \nHe runs around and sticks his finger in the holes of the dyke. No \nmatter how many holes he plugs up with his fingers, more water comes \nin. That was a problem Director Freeh had. I think overall he did as \ngood a job as could be done under the circumstances.\n  Notwithstanding that overall evaluation, I do believe there were very \nserious shortcomings in the responsibility of the FBI and by Director \nFreeh to congressional oversight. I believe the oversight function is \nan enormously important function; Congress has to oversee the way our \nappropriations are spent and oversee the way the executive branch \nfunctions. We have not done enough in that regard. We did not do the \noversight necessary in Waco where there was the incident on April 19, \n1993. No one can establish cause and effect, but chances are good that \nhad there been effective oversight immediately after the Waco incident, \nthat the Oklahoma City bombing would not have occurred 2 years to the \nday on April 19 of April 1995. It took until 1999 with the inquiry by \nformer Senator Danforth to do appropriate oversight there.\n  This Senator tried hard in mid-1995 to pursue oversight as to Waco \nand as to Ruby Ridge. Finally, we did have hearings on Ruby Ridge. That \nwas an example of effective congressional Senate oversight. I had the \nopportunity to chair that subcommittee. It is not just my view but a \nwidespread view. Randy Weaver was on the mountain at Ruby Ridge and a \nvirtual army went out to bring him off the mountain. The results were \ndisastrous. The U.S. Marshal, Marshal Degan, was killed. Randy Weaver's \nwife, Vicki, was killed. Randy Weaver's son, Sammy Weaver, age 14, was \nkilled in a gunfire fight.\n\n  The FBI finally conceded they had violated the constitutional \nstandards in use of deadly force on their rules of engagement. It took \na Senate oversight hearing to bring that out and to get that matter \ncorrected. Regrettably, to this day, Ruby Ridge was a 1992 incident and \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee worked in 1995 and published a report in \nDecember. To this day, that matter is still under investigation with \nsubstantial reason to believe there has not been appropriate action \ntaken by way of discipline.\n  One of the things Mr. Mueller committed to do was to revisit that \nsituation.\n  The oversight function is a matter which our Judiciary Committee has \nnot pursued, as I stated. I had the opportunity to chair a subcommittee \non Department of Justice oversight in 1999 and in the year 2000. In the \ncourse of that oversight inquiry, when we were investigating campaign \nfinance reform and sought to get a report made by Charles Labella, who \ncame in as a special assistant. We could never get the report, even \nthough the Department of Justice had a duty to provide it to the \nJudiciary Committee on oversight. When we finally issued a subpoena for \nthe Labella report in April of the year 2000, we did obtain the report.\n  At that time, we obtained another document which classifies as a \ndynamite document which should have been turned over to the FBI long \nbefore. This is a memorandum dated December 9, 1996. I ask unanimous \nconsent the text of this memorandum be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1)\n  Mr. SPECTER. This memorandum, dated December 9, 1996, is from \nDirector Freeh to one of his top deputies, Mr. Esposito. It relates to \na conversation which Mr. Esposito had with a top-ranking official in \nthe Department of Justice named Lee Radek of the Public Integrity \nSection.\n  The kernel of the memorandum is contained in paragraph 4 which I will \nnow read:\n\n       I also advise the Attorney General of Lee Radek's comment \n     to you that there was a lot of ``pressure'' on him and PIS, \n     Public Integrity Section, regarding this case [and that \n     refers to the Democratic national campaign matter which is \n     the caption of the memorandum] because the ``attorney \n     General's job might hang in the balance'' or words to that \n     effect.\n\n  Now, this conversation between Mr. Esposito and Mr. Radek occurred in \nDecember of 1996 at the precise time when President Clinton had not \nstated whether he would reappoint Attorney General Reno. There was an \nenormous furor over the issue of campaign finance irregularities. The \nGovernmental Affairs Committee conducted an extensive investigation in \n1996.\n  Now, had this memorandum been disclosed, as I think it should have \nbeen, and had the Senate known a top Department of Justice official was \ngoing easy on this investigation because of protecting the Attorney \nGeneral's job, the demands for independent counsel might have come out \nentirely differently. That was a major matter.\n  When I saw this memorandum in December of the year 2000, I told \nDirector Freeh I thought he had an absolute duty to have turned over \nthis memorandum contemporaneously with the event, and he disagreed, \nsaying it would have destroyed his relationship with the Attorney \nGeneral--and his relationship had a lot of problems, in any event. I \nadmired Director Freeh for his taking a stand that independent counsel \nshould have been appointed, and in many respects he did act in a \ncourageous way on that particular subject. But this memorandum was \ndynamite. By the time it came up in the year 2000, it was a cold \npotato, it was an old matter.\n\n  I said to Director Freeh that he must testify about this issue, and \nhe said he wouldn't do so. To my chagrin, I could not get a subpoena \nfrom the Judiciary Committee to compel Director Freeh's attendance and \ntestimony.\n  We did bring in Mr. Esposito and we did bring in Mr. Radek, put them \nboth under oath and had them testify, and they told contradictory \nversions. Mr. Radek said, well, he had made a comment about pressure \nand he had made a comment about the Attorney General's job hanging in \nthe balance, but there was no connection between the two. That is set \nout fully in the record and can be reviewed by anyone who cares to do \nso, to evaluate the credibility of Mr. Radek in saying that--although \nhe had said there was a lot of pressure and he said the Attorney \nGeneral's job hung in the balance, that there was no connection between \nthe two.\n  When Attorney General Reno testified 3\\1/2\\ years after the fact, she \nsaid she didn't recall any such conversation with FBI Director Freeh \nbut if it had occurred, she was sure she would have taken some action. \nBut, as I say, at that point it was totally stale, not subject to any \nreal investigation or congressional oversight on that point.\n  Before the confirmation hearing with Mr. Mueller, I met with him for \nthe better part of an hour in my office and went over that memorandum \nand other matters about which I had questioned him. During the course \nof his testimony on Monday, 3 days ago, when I asked him if that was \nthe kind of a memorandum which ought to have been disclosed, he was \nequivocal. He was equivocal about a number of other matters. At the \nsuggestion of the chairman that Bob Mueller and Arlen Specter sit down, \nwe did Tuesday morning in my office for the better part of an hour. And \nwhen he resumed his testimony on Tuesday, he said that that memorandum \nfrom Director Freeh should have been made a part of the record, that \nthat was appropriate congressional oversight and it should have\n\n[[Page S8689]]\n\nbeen disclosed. I consider that important because we really have to \nestablish standards as to what Mr. Mueller will do as FBI Director and \nwhat is appropriate congressional oversight.\n  Another matter that I had discussed informally with Mr. Mueller \nbefore the confirmation hearing, and then questioned him about during \nthe confirmation hearing, was the issue of the obligation of the FBI, \nof the Department of Justice, to submit to congressional oversight on \npending criminal investigations and on pending criminal prosecutions. I \ncited to Mr. Mueller a summary of the law which appeared in \nCongressional Research.\n  During the course of my questioning of Mr. Mueller on Monday \nafternoon of this week, I had asked him about his recognition of the \nauthority of Congress to have the last word on oversight, and to have \naccess to pending FBI investigations and pending FBI prosecutions. At \nthat time, I read to him extracts from the Congressional Research \nService which summarized the law on the subject in a publication dated \nApril 7, 1995, as follows:\n\n       . . . a review of congressional investigations that have \n     implicated the Department of Justice or the Department of \n     Justice investigations over the past 70 years, from the \n     Palmer Raids and Teapot Dome to Watergate and through Iran-\n     Contra and Rocky Flats, demonstrates that the Department of \n     Justice has been consistently obligated to submit to \n     congressional oversight regardless of whether litigation is \n     pending so that Congress is not delayed unduly in \n     investigating misfeasance, malfeasance, or maladministration \n     in the Department of Justice or elsewhere.\n  Skipping some:\n\n       In all instances, investigating committees were provided \n     with documents respecting open or closed cases that included \n     prosecutorial memoranda, FBI investigative reports, summaries \n     of FBI interviews memoranda.\n\n  Another facet of the same report:\n\n       In the majority of instances reviewed, the testimony of \n     subordinate Department of Justice employees, such as line \n     attorneys and FBI field agents, was taken formally or \n     informally and included detailed testimony about specific \n     instances of the Department's failure to prosecute alleged \n     meritorious cases.\n\n  In my questioning of Mr. Mueller on Monday afternoon, he was \nequivocal about his recognition of those legal principles. As I say, we \nhad a meeting in my office for the better part of an hour Tuesday \nmorning at the suggestion of the chairman. During that time, we came to \na meeting of the minds, as we had on the memorandum of December 9, \n1996, so that when Mr. Mueller testified on Tuesday afternoon, he did \nsay that it was appropriate for Congress to inquire as a matter of \noversight into pending criminal investigations, so that he agreed with \nthe language of the Congressional Research Service and did agree that, \nin the final analysis, Congress had the last say as to what was \nappropriate for congressional oversight.\n  There was a bit of qualification when he talked about appropriate \ncases. Of course, there has to be responsibility in what the Congress \nasks for. But when the Congress presses it, the law is established that \nif it ends a criminal prosecution because Congress believes the \noversight is warranted for legislation, then Congress has the paramount \nauthority.\n  I discussed with Mr. Mueller the frustration of congressional \noversight in the Wen Ho Lee case, which was illustrative of Congress \nreally not doing sufficient oversight and the intransigence and \nnoncompliance by the Federal authorities.\n  The Wen Ho Lee case was a matter under investigation really for \ndecades. To this day, we do not know whether Dr. Wen Ho Lee was a major \nspy or was a victim of overreaching by the FBI and the Department of \nJustice.\n  The case came to a head in August of 1997, when FBI Director Freeh \nsent one of his top deputies to talk personally with Attorney General \nReno to request a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct.\n  Attorney General Reno delegated that authority to someone who had no \nexperience in the field, and ultimately the warrant was turned down. \nAnd there was no followup by either Attorney General Reno or FBI \nDirector Freeh. That resulted last year in legislation, so that it is \nnow a statutory obligation. When the FBI Director makes a request, the \nAttorney General has an obligation to respond in writing, and the FBI \nDirector has an obligation to follow up personally.\n  The Wen Ho Lee case then languished for 16 months until December of \n1998, when it was reinvigorated because the Cox commission was about to \ncome out with a report from the House of Representatives highly \ncritical of the Department of Energy and the Department of Justice, \nincluding the FBI. At that time, Department of Energy Secretary \nRichardson initiated a polygraph of Wen Ho Lee conducted by a private \nagency, which was reported to have cleared Wen Ho Lee of complicity, \nsaying he passed the polygraph. It was later held in question and later \ndiscredited. Meanwhile, Dr. Lee had continuing access to highly \nclassified information.\n  Finally, the FBI proceeded with a search warrant in April of 1999 and \nthen waited until December of 1999 before indicting Wen Ho Lee and \narresting him. At that time, they manacled him and held him in solitary \nconfinement, with no explanation ever forthcoming as to why he could \nstay at large for months and months and months and then be worse than \npublic enemy No. 1.\n  During that period of time, a Judiciary subcommittee with oversight \nof the Department of Justice was proceeding to try to get records and \ndocuments and, significantly, without success. Our efforts are \nsummarized, and there are many letters, but this one is illustrative, \ndated November 30, from me to Director Freeh saying:\n\n       I am very much concerned about the repetitive problem that \n     the FBI fails to produce records and that they are then \n     discovered at a much later date.\n       I know you will recall the incident in September 1997 when \n     the CIA advised the Government Affairs Committee of certain \n     information in FBI files concerning foreign contributions \n     which the FBI had not disclosed.\n\n  That one was a very vituperative hearing where the FBI had not turned \nover the information and the CIA came forward and told us what was in \nthe FBI files. Then the FBI belatedly conceded that it was in fact in \ntheir files.\n  My letter to Director Freeh of November 30 goes on:\n\n       By letter dated November 24, 1999, I wrote asking for an \n     explanation about the failure of the FBI to turn over records \n     pursuant to subpoenas in the Ruby Ridge hearings.\n\n  We had no response there.\n  Going on:\n\n       With respect to Waco, there has been a series of belated \n     disclosures. Last August, it was disclosed that incendiaries \n     were fired at the compound contrary to Attorney General Janet \n     Reno's previous testimony. Shortly thereafter, the FBI \n     discovered extensive documents in Quantico which had not \n     been previously disclosed. A few days ago, the press \n     reported another incident where the FBI found documents \n     long after they were supposed to have been produced, some \n     four days after Department of Justice attorneys had \n     advised a Federal Judge in Waco that there were no such \n     records.\n       The Department of Justice has recently advised that \n     Attorney General Reno's testimony before the Judiciary \n     Committee on June 8, 1999 was incomplete because she did not \n     have access to certain FBI records.\n\n  The letter goes on and on.\n  I ask unanimous consent, instead of reading it at length, that it be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am not unaware that this is a somewhat lengthy \nstatement, but believe me, it is a short summary of efforts made to \nfind out what was going on in the Wen Ho Lee investigation and where we \nwere being stonewalled by the FBI. Had we had access to these records \nand had we conducted the oversight, we would have perhaps been able to \ncorrect some of the serious errors which were in process.\n  Another illustrative letter was from me to Director Freeh dated \nJanuary 3, 2000. I will read only one paragraph.\n\n       I am writing to renew my request--which was first made in \n     writing on September 29, 1999--for access to the ten pieces \n     of intelligence information referred to in the July 1999 \n     Inspector General's Special Report on the Handling of FBI \n     Intelligence Information. . . .\n\n  Then a note:\n\n       We have been waiting for the 10 pieces of intelligence \n     information for an unreasonably long time.\n\n  Again, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8690]]\n\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Then the Department of Justice accepted a guilty plea \nfrom Dr. Wen Ho Lee on 1 count of 59 counts and then was thoroughly \nchastised by the Federal judge for the way they had conducted the \ninvestigation.\n  Then Dr. Lee was debriefed, and we are still waiting for answers from \nthe FBI as to what has occurred in the case going up to August of 2001 \non an oversight which has been in process for years.\n  I talk about this at some length because of the importance of the \nJudiciary Committee pursuing this oversight and finding out what is \ngoing on in the FBI. We have a very significant advance made on a \nrecognition by Mr. Mueller, who will be sworn in as Director of the \nFBI, that the Congress has a right to pending FBI investigations and to \npending FBI prosecutions.\n  They can't hide behind the assertion that, well, it is confidential \nand subject to investigation or subject to prosecution.\n  The hour is growing late. One other matter I want to put on the \nrecord at this point is the issue on which I questioned Mr. Mueller \nabout the leaks on the alleged investigation into Senator Robert \nTorricelli. As I said to Mr. Mueller at the hearing on Tuesday \nafternoon, the day before yesterday, all I know about that is what I \nread in the newspaper. But I had written to Director Freeh back on June \n8 of this year, saying:\n\n       I am interested to know whether you have initiated any \n     investigation on the leaks which have appeared in the press \n     concerning an alleged investigation of Senator Bob \n     Torricelli; and, if so, what that investigation has \n     disclosed.\n\n  As I said Tuesday, and repeat today, I haven't gotten an answer to \nthe letter. I asked Mr. Mueller for a commitment that he would \ninvestigate to see what had happened because of the devastating nature \nof this leak. But this leak is one of many. The papers have been filled \nwith stories about Dr. Wen Ho Lee and many other matters. But we have a \ncommitment from the Director to respond on the Torricelli matter.\n  Briefly, in conclusion--the two most popular words of any speech--I \ncomment about the problems in the FBI, but I do acknowledge, as I did \nat the outset, that I believe the FBI is a very important and good \ninvestigative organization, and that we find the errors, we find the \ndifficulties, and they are publicized. But I do believe that the Senate \nis at fault, the Congress is at fault in not pursuing oversight. It is \na very tough thing to do because you have to make the request \nrepeatedly and you have to insist on it and you have to follow up on \nit. When we will have a Director who concedes that Congress is entitled \nto information on pending investigations and pending prosecutions, then \nwe know where we ought to head.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 December 9, 1996.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Mr. Esposito.\n     From: Director, FBI.\n     Subject: Democratic National Campaign Matter.\n       As I related to you this morning, I met with the Attorney \n     General on Friday, 12/6/96, to discuss the above-captioned \n     matter.\n       I stated that DOJ had not yet referred the matter to the \n     FBI to conduct a full, criminal investigation. It was my \n     recommendation that this referral take place as soon as \n     possible.\n       I also told the Attorney General that since she had \n     declined to refer the matter to an Independent Counsel it was \n     my recommendation that she select a first rate DOJ legal team \n     from outside Main Justice to conduct the inquiry. In fact, I \n     said that these prosecutors should be ``junk-yard dogs'' and \n     that in my view, PIS was not capable of conducting the \n     thorough, aggressive kind of investigation which was \n     required.\n       I also advised the Attorney General of Lee Radek's comment \n     to you that there was a lot of ``pressure'' on him and PIS \n     regarding this case because the ``Attorney General's job \n     might hang in the balance'' (or words to that effect). I \n     stated that those comments would be enough for me to take him \n     and the Criminal Division off the case completely.\n       I also stated that it didn't make sense for PIS to call the \n     FBI the ``lead agency'' in this matter while operating a \n     ``task force'' with DOC IGs who were conducting interviews of \n     key witnesses without the knowledge or participation of the \n     FBI.\n       I strongly recommended that the FBI and hand-picked DOJ \n     attorneys from outside Main Justice run this case as we would \n     any matter of such importance and complexity.\n       We left the conversation on Friday with arrangements to \n     discuss the matter again on Monday. The Attorney General and \n     I spoke today and she asked for a meeting to discuss the \n     ``investigative team'' and hear our recommendations. The \n     meeting is now scheduled for Wednesday, 12/11/96, which you \n     and Bob Litt will also attend.\n       I intend to repeat my recommendations from Friday's \n     meeting. We should present all of our recommendations for \n     setting up the investigation--both AUSAs and other resources. \n     You and I should also discuss and consider whether on the \n     basis of all the facts and circumstances--including Huang's \n     recently released letters to the President as well as Radek's \n     comments--whether I should recommend that the Attorney \n     General reconsider referral to an Independent Counsel.\n       It was unfortunate that DOJ declined to allow the FBI to \n     play any role in the Independent Counsel referral \n     deliberations. I agree with you that based on the DOJ's \n     experience with the Cisneros matter--which was only referred \n     to an Independent Counsel because the FBI and I intervened \n     directly with the Attorney General--it was decided to exclude \n     us from this decision-making process.\n       Nevertheless, based on information recently reviewed from \n     PIS/DOC, we should determine whether or not an Independent \n     Counsel referral should be made at this time. If so, I will \n     make the recommendation to the Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 30, 1999.\n     Director Louis Freeh,\n     Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Louis Freeh: I am very much concerned about \n     the repetitive problem that the FBI fails to produce records \n     and that they are then discovered at a much later date.\n       I know you will recall the incident in September 1997 when \n     the CIA advised the Governmental Affairs Committee of certain \n     information in FBI files concerning foreign contributions \n     which the FBI had not disclosed.\n       By a letter dated November 24, 1999, I wrote asking for an \n     explanation about the failure of the FBI to turn over records \n     pursuant to subpoenas in the Ruby Ridge hearings.\n       With respect to Waco, there has been a series of belated \n     disclosures. Last August, it was disclosed that incendiaries \n     had been fired at the compound, contrary to Attorney General \n     Janet Reno's previous testimony. Shortly thereafter, the FBI \n     discovered extensive documents in Quantico which had not been \n     previously disclosed. A few days ago, the press reported \n     another incident where the FBI found documents long after \n     they were supposed to have been produced, some four days \n     after the Department of Justice attorneys had advised a \n     Federal Judge in Waco that there were no such records.\n       The Department of Justice has recently advised that \n     Attorney General Reno's testimony before the Judiciary \n     Committee on June 8, 1999 was incomplete because she did not \n     have access to certain FBI records.\n       Similarly, Mr. Neil Gallagher has sought to correct his \n     testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee on June \n     9, 1999 because he was not aware of certain FBI documents \n     when he testified.\n       On the eve of our Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on Wen Ho \n     Lee on November 3, 1999, we were given important documents at \n     the last minute which have been in the FBI files since \n     December 19, 1997 and December 10, 1998.\n       These are only a few of the many instances where documents \n     have been disclosed by the FBI long after they should have \n     been made available. Would you please let me know why so many \n     documents have been produced so late and what procedures you \n     now have or are putting into place to prevent this from \n     happening in the future. As I know you understand, every time \n     we get late disclosures, we have to go back and retrace our \n     inquiries. Of even greater importance is the issue of the \n     reliability of FBI responses to our document requests.\n       I would appreciate a response as promptly as possible so \n     that we can proceed.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 3, 2000.\n     Hon. Louis J. Freeh,\n     Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Freeh: I am writing to renew my request--\n     which was first made in writing on September 29, 1999--for \n     access to the ten pieces of intelligence information referred \n     to in the July 1999 inspector General's Special Report on the \n     Handling of FBI Intelligence Information Related to the \n     Justice Department's Campaign Finance Investigation, and any \n     analysis regarding the validity of such information and its \n     suitability for use in a prosecution or relevance to a plea \n     agreement. These ten pieces of information are covered by the \n     November 17, 1999, resolution of the Judiciary Committee, \n     which authorized a number of subpoenas.\n       I would also appreciate your assistance in ensuring that \n     the background check and clearance request for my Chief \n     Counsel, Mr. David Brog, it processed in an expeditious \n     manner.\n\n[[Page S8691]]\n\n       Both of these matters are important for the Judiciary \n     subcommittee which I chair to be able to conduct its \n     oversight in a prompt and thorough manner.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I served on the subcommittee on \noversight effort on the FBI and the Department of Justice. I thought if \nthe American people had seen that, they would have known that he was \ncommitted to getting to the truth, as he is always, and that there was, \nindeed, vigorous oversight at least with regard to those aspects of the \nFBI and the Department of Justice.\n  Nobody is perfect. Everybody makes mistakes. But it is our duty to \nask tough questions and insist on excellence. I am a big fan of the \nFBI, but they are not perfect. I am a big fan of the Department of \nJustice, but they are not perfect. Senator Grassley and Senator Specter \nhave been tough on them and demanded excellence, and I respect that. I \nthink it is very healthy. I believe that Bob Meuller, who I knew at the \nDepartment of Justice for many years, is a professional's professional, \nwho is a tough leader with the kinds of insight into the FBI's \nstrengths and weaknesses that would allow him to have a unique \nopportunity to make a positive change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Robert S. Mueller, III, of California, to \nbe Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation? The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

It sends a \nstrong signal. We have somebody who wants to preserve the very best of \nthe FBI and to correct those areas where there are problems. I think he \ncan do both. He comes with a strong mandate from the Senate, and that \nwill help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I compliment the distinguished chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee for his expeditious work on these \nnominations and so many others. We have broken some records. His work \nand determination demonstrate real fairness and ensure these people \nhave the opportunity to serve at the earliest possible date. His \nwillingness to do that and his desire to work with the leadership are \nvery much appreciated. I want to commend him publicly for that.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, on July 20, I was pleased that we were \nable to confirm a number of judicial and executive nominations. We \nconfirmed Judge Roger Gregory for a lifetime appointment to the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Last year and earlier \nthis year, he was unable even to get a hearing from the Republican \nmajority.\n  Having gotten that hearing, his nomination was reported favorably to \nthe Senate on a 19 to 0 vote by the committee and the Senate voted to \nconfirm him by a vote of 93 to 1 vote. The supposed controversy some \ncontend surrounded this nomination was either nonexistent or quickly \ndissipated. In addition we have confirmed the two nominees to the \nDistrict Court vacancies in Montana in order to help end the crisis in \nthat district that was brought to our attention by Chief Judge Molloy.\n  Today we report and the Senate is confirming William Riley, nominated \nto the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Mr. Riley \nwas strongly supported by both his home State Senators, one a respected \nRepublican and one a valued Democratic Senator.\n  In the entire first year of the first Bush Administration, 1989, \nwithout all the disruptions, distractions and shifts of Senate majority \nthat we have experienced this year, only five Court of Appeals judges \nwere confirmed all year.\n  In the first year of the Clinton Administration, 1993, without all \nthe disruptions, distractions and shifts in Senate majority that we \nhave experienced this year, only three Court of Appeals judges were \nconfirmed all year. In 1993, the first Court of Appeals nominee to be \nconfirmed was not until September 30. During recent years under a \nRepublican Senate majority, there were no Court of Appeals nominees \nconfirmed at any time during the entire 1996 session, not one. In 1997, \nthe first Court of Appeals nominee was not confirmed until September \n26.\n  Having confirmed our first Court of Appeals nominee on July 20, the \nSenate this year is ahead of the pace in 1993, the first year of the \nClinton Administration, and ahead of the pace in 1996 and 1997, when \nthe Senate was under Republican control.\n  A fair assessment of the circumstances of this year would suggest \nthat the confirmation of a single Court of Appeals nominee this early \nin the year and the confirmation of even a few Court of Appeals judges \nin this shortened time frame of only a few weeks in session should be \ncommended, not criticized. Today we confirm our second Court of Appeals \nnominee.\n  The Judiciary Committee held two hearings on two Court of Appeals \nnominees in July. In July 1995, the Republican Chairman held one \nhearing with one Court of Appeals nominee.\n  In July 1996, the Republican Chairman held one hearing with one Court \nof Appeals nominee, who was confirmed in 1996. In July 1997, the \nRepublican Chairman held one hearing with one Court of Appeals nominee. \nIn 1998, the Republican Chairman did hold two hearings with two Court \nof Appeals nominees, but neither of whom was confirmed in 1998. In July \n2000, the Republican Chairman did not hold a single hearing with a \nCourt of Appeals nominee.\n  During the more than 6 years in which the Senate Republican majority \nscheduled confirmation hearings, there were 34 months with no hearing \nat all, 30 months with only one hearing and only 12 times in almost six \nand one-half years did the Judiciary Committee\n\n[[Page S8692]]\n\nhold as many as two hearings involving judicial nominations in a month. \nOver the last 6 years only 46 nominees were confirmed by the Republican \nmajority in the Senate to the Courts of Appeals around the country.\n  This Democratic Senate has confirmed two within the month the Senate \nhas been reorganized before the August recess. So without acknowledging \nthe unprecedented shifts in majority status this year, our productivity \ncompares most favorably with the last 6 years. With the confirmation of \nWilliam Riley to the Eighth Circuit, we have exceeded the record in \nfive of the last 6 years.\n  I am considering holding another judicial confirmation hearing in \nAugust, during the Senate recess. No such hearing was held during any \nof the last 6 years. If we proceed, it may be the first time a judicial \nconfirmation hearing was held during the August recess.\n  I went to the White House for the President's announcement of his \nfirst judicial nominations as a demonstration of bipartisanship. I \nnoticed our initial hearing on judicial nominees within 10 minutes of \nthe Senate adoptions of S. Res. 120 reorganizing the Senate just before \nthe July 4 recess. We held two hearings in July. We confirmed two Court \nof Appeals Judges in July. The facts are that the Democratic majority \nin the Senate has proceeded fairly.\n  I have also respectfully suggested that the White House work with \nSenators to identify and send more District Court nominations to the \nSenate who are broadly supported and can help us fill judicial \nvacancies in our federal trial courts. According to the Administrative \nOffice of the U.S. Courts, almost two-thirds of the vacancies on the \nfederal bench are in the District Courts, 75 of 108. But fewer than \none-third of President Bush's nominees initial 30 nominees have been \nfor District Court vacancies.\n  The two who were consensus candidates and whose paperwork was \ncomplete have had their hearing earlier this month and were confirmed \nJuly 20.\n  I did try to schedule District Court nominees for our hearing last \nweek, but none of the files of the seven District Court nominees \npending before the Committee was complete.\n  Because of President Bush's unfortunate decision to exclude the \nAmerican Bar Association from his selection process, the ABA was only \nable to begin its evaluation of candidates' qualifications after the \nnominations were made public. We are doing the best we can, and we hope \nto include District Court candidates at our next nominations hearing.\n  There has been talk that the President will be sending more District \nCourt nominees to the Senate today or tomorrow.\n  If he does, I hope that they are consensus candidates and that their \nhome state Senators have been involved in the selection process. \nUnfortunately, they are being received late in this short session and \nwithout the peer review that the ABA had traditionally provided at the \ntime of the nomination for more than 50 years. We will do the best we \ncan to proceed with mainstream candidates with broad-ranging support in \nthe limited time available to us before the Senate adjourns this year \nand given the heavy legislative agenda that we must accomplish.\n  When some Republican Senators bemoan the current vacancies, they \nshould also acknowledge that many of the current vacancies could have \nbeen filled and should have been filled over the last several years. \nIndeed, if the 65 judicial nominations sent to us over the past few \nyears by President Clinton had been acted upon, we would have scores \nfewer vacancies.\n  At the end of the last session of Congress in which there was a \nSenate Democratic majority, in 1994, there were 63 vacancies on the \nFederal courts, which included several new judgeships created by \nstatute in 1990 and as yet unfilled. When the Senate returned to a \nDemocratic majority on June 6 of this year, there were 104 vacancies. \nWhen the Senate was finally allowed to reorganize and made its \nCommittee assignments on July 10, there were 110 vacancies.\n  Of the judicial emergency vacancies, almost half would not exist if \nPresident Clinton's qualified nominees for those positions had been \nconfirmed by the Republican majority over the last few years. I noted \nlast week that the Republican Senate over the last several years \nrefused to take action on no fewer than a dozen nominees to what are \nnow emergency vacancies on the Courts of Appeals.\n  I remind my colleagues of their failure to grant a hearing or \nCommittee or Senate consideration to the following: Robert Cindrich to \nthe Third Circuit; Judge James A. Beaty, Jr. and Judge James A. Wynn, \nJr. to the Fourth Circuit; Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno and H. Alston \nJohnson to the Fifth Circuit; Judge Helene White, Kathleen McCree-Lewis \nand Kent Marcus to the Sixth Circuit; Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth \nCircuit; James Duffy and Barry Goode to the Ninth Circuit.\n  Those were 12 Court of Appeals nominees to 10 vacancies who could \nhave gone a long way toward reducing the level of judicial emergencies \naround the country. Our first confirmation this year was of Judge Roger \nGregory to a judicial emergency vacancy.\n  I have yet to hear our Republican critics acknowledge any \nshortcomings among the practices they employed over the last six years.\n  When they have done that and we have established a common basis of \nunderstanding and comparison, we will have taken a significant step \nforward. That would help go a long way toward helping me change the \ntone here in Washington. It would make it easier to work together to \nget as much accomplished as we possibly can.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased that today the Senate \nconfirmed William Riley to be a judge on the Eighth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. This confirmation brings the total of judicial confirmations \nfor the year to four. Even if we include today's confirmation vote in \nthe total for the month of July, I want to note for the record that \nthis is significantly fewer judges than were confirmed during most of \nthe months of July during my tenure as Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, even though we had a Democratic President and a Republican \nSenate during those years. Here is the number of judges confirmed \nduring the months of July when I was chairman:\n  July 1995--11 judges confirmed.\n  July 1996--16 judges confirmed.\n  July 1997--3 judges confirmed.\n  July 1998--6 judges confirmed.\n  July 1999--4 judges confirmed.\n  July 2000--5 judges confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8692-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Madam President, for the past several months I have been \nwaiting patiently for the opportunity promised me to offer testimony on \nelection fraud before the Senate Rules Committee. The committee has \nheld days of hearings in Washington, and they have been on the road. My \nconcern was that perhaps the committee was not interested in vote \nfraud, was not interested in hearing the details of the criminal \nactivities that took place in Missouri in November of 2000. Certainly, \nit was not interested in what election law reforms are necessary to \nattack vote cheats.\n  Unfortunately, I can wait no longer. I am here in the Chamber rather \nthan the committee because, although I was assured I would have the \nopportunity to testify about the extraordinary circumstances that \noccurred around the election in St. Louis, and thus make the case for \nreal vote fraud reform, the committee has decided to move ahead without \ngiving me the opportunity to pursue a voting machinery bill before the \nrecess.\n  It is an understatement to say I am disappointed. But rather than \ndampening my enthusiasm, that disappointment makes me even more \ncommitted to the cause.\n  Simply put, it is imperative that we pass legislation this year that \nmakes it easier to vote but harder to cheat. One without the other will \nnot work and will not be acceptable.\n  Voting is the most important duty and responsibility of a citizen of \nour Republic. It should not and must not\n\n[[Page S8693]]\n\nbe diluted by fraud, by false filings and lawsuits, judges who don't \nfollow the law, and politicians to try to profit from confusion. At the \nsame time, voters should not be unduly confused by complicated ballots \nand voter rosters or confounded by inadequate phone lines or voting \nmachinery.\n  One simple point as we begin: Vote fraud is not about partisanship. \nIt is not about Democrats versus Republicans. It is not about the north \nside of St. Louis versus the south side. It is not about ethnic groups \nor religious groups or interest groups. It affects all citizens. It is \nabout justice, for vote fraud is a criminal, not a political, act.\n  Illegal votes dilute the value of votes cast legally. When people try \nto stuff the ballot box, what they are really doing is trying to steal \npolitical power from those who follow election laws. There can be no \ngraver example of disenfranchisement. The Missouri Court of Appeals \nwrote:\n\n       [E]qual vigilance is required to ensure that only those \n     entitled to vote are allowed to cast a ballot. Otherwise, the \n     rights of those lawfully entitled to vote are inevitably \n     diluted.\n\n  Let's discuss what is vote fraud; how does it work; how widespread is \nit; how can we stop it. Vote fraud is, at the core, the practice of \nillegally adding votes to a candidate's vote total or taking them away. \nIt can be done by simply stuffing the ballot box with extra ballots at \nthe end of the voting day. It can be done by voting in the names of \npeople who are dead or otherwise have not voted. It can be done by \ncreating lists of bogus names and addresses and then voting all those \nfake identities. It can be done in person. It can be done by absentee \nballot. It can be done with a judge, incompetent, inattentive or \nunlawful, who issues a court order.\n  However, it is done, its design and purpose is single-minded: cheat \nto win. Fortunately, most of the time it does not work. But \nunfortunately, there are those who argue that because it fails more \nthan it succeeds, it is not a real problem.\n\n  To those who make that argument, I recommend they take a few moments \nto review the comments of an old friend of mine with whom I served when \nI was Governor of Missouri. He is from the other party but is an active \nleader. State Representative Quincy Troupe stated this year, after news \nof the vote fraud came out in St. Louis: In this town, to win in a \nclose election ``you have to beat the cheat.'' That is the cry in St. \nLouis, people trying to cheat to win.\n  The impulse has been around since the dawn of civilization. Parents, \nteachers, and coaches tried mightily to instill in us that we should \nplay fair, abide by the rules, and 99 percent of the time their lessons \ntook root.\n  Unfortunately, not everybody has gotten the message. Every day we \nread stories of consumer fraud, the selling of test scores, point \nshaving scandals, stock swindles, real estate scams. I suppose we \nshould not be shocked that people also try to steal votes and, \nultimately, elections.\n  Because we are a nation of laws and we have basic faith that people \nwill play fair, we simply don't like it when people try to cheat to \nwin. That, of course, is what voter fraud is all about.\n  Unfortunately, we in Missouri saw it in this past election. No one \nwants his or her State to become a poster child for a problem, the \nhometown become a laughingstock. So it is with dismay that I come \nbefore my colleagues today to describe what has gone on in St. Louis, \nwhat is going on, what reforms I believe are vital.\n  Missouri's secretary of state has just completed a comprehensive \nreview of election 2000, centered around four basic voter fraud \nschemes, the question of felons voting, as well as reviewing the \nactions by local judges and the now infamous dead-man-claims-long-\nlines-keep-him-from-voting court case.\n  The four vote fraud schemes regularly practiced across the country \nare: Did individuals register and vote more than once; did any dead \nindividuals have votes cast in their names; were false names/addresses \nvoted; were drop sites used to give individuals multiple voting \nidentities.\n  Each of these are classic vote fraud schemes designed to allow a \nsmall number of people to cast numerous votes either by absentee \nballots or by moving from polling place to polling place and voting \nmultiple names from the voter list.\n  Each scheme relies on access to registered voter lists in order to \nknow what names to use, knowledge of the false names, or requires the \nindividuals to have control of the absentee ballots. In one common form \nof absentee ballot fraud, the drop site scam, the individuals used in \nthe scheme simply register, usually by mail, multiple names at one \naddress and then request absentee ballots for all their new roommates, \nphantom though they might be, and they vote all of the ballots coming \ninto those invisible roomies.\n  Sad to say, each of these schemes was in use on election day in \nMissouri. In reviewing only 2 of Missouri's 114 counties, the secretary \nof state found 14 probable drop sites where there were at least 8 \nregistered voters, 8 registered voters in one house, with another 200 \npossible sites requiring further review. We had 68 dual registered \npeople who voted twice. Good luck, folks. I think your day is coming. \nThere were 79 vacant lots used as addresses for voters, and 14 dead \npeople voted--certainly an inspiring theological effort, but one that \nis disappointing politically.\n\n  In addition, this investigation found that 114 felons voted and over \n1,200 people who were not registered at all voted--in direct \ncontravention of Missouri law. These people went before judges and \nsaid, ``I want to vote.'' The Missouri Constitution says you have to be \nregistered to vote. The judges said: You look like a nice guy or lady, \nso we are going to let you vote. That is illegal; that is fraud; that \nis criminal.\n  As I said, for each of the drop sites, the secretary of state used an \neight-person rule--meaning he only reviewed those sites that showed \neight or more registered voters at one address. And his staff only \nvisited 20 percent of the total sites identified. Only law enforcement \nwould be able to determine how many illegal votes were cast from these \nsites.\n  However, those responsible for voting twice, voting dead persons' \nnames, and creating false addresses were obviously violating the law. \nThere can be no question that criminal fraud occurred.\n  What can be done to protect us from this cheating in the future? In \nour review of the secretary of state's report, it is clear that a \nfundamental requirement for fraud is voter list manipulation. Bogus \nnames are added with the intent to vote them absentee. Voters who have \nmoved or died are left on the lists in order to create a pool of names \nto be voted, and the sheer confusion of clogged up voter rolls is used \nto further complicate efforts by election officials to keep the votes \nlegal.\n  My staff's review of the voter lists in St. Louis has found rolls so \nclogged with incorrect, fraudulent data it almost defies description.\n  The number of registered voters threatens to outnumber the voting age \npopulation. A total of 247,000-plus St. Louis residents, dead or alive, \nare listed as registered voters compared with the city's voting age \npopulation of 258,000. That is a whopping 96-percent registration rate.\n  The reason why: Almost 70,000 St. Louis residents, or 28 percent, are \non the inactive voter list. That means 1 in 4 eligible St. Louis voters \ncannot be located by the U.S. Postal Service as actually living where \nthe voter rolls say they are registered.\n  More than 23,000 people in St. Louis are also registered elsewhere in \nMissouri. That means 1 in 10 are at least dual registered. Over 17,000 \nvoters still are listed as registered in the city, even after moving \nout and registering at new addresses. Nearly 700 voters are registered \ntwice in St. Louis. No fewer than 400 are registered once in the city \nand twice more elsewhere in the State. And five Missouri voters are \nregistered at four different places across the State.\n  Though dead for 10 years, former St. Louis Alderman Albert ``Red'' \nVilla was actually registered to vote this spring in the city's mayoral \nprimary. Ritzy Meckler, a mixed-breed dog, was also registered to vote \nin St. Louis. We don't know her party preference, but I won't go into \nthe ``voting is going to the dogs'' line.\n  This spring, a city grand jury began an investigation of 3,800 voter \nregistration cards dumped on the election board on the last day to \nregister before the March 6 primary: Press reports initially noted that \nat least 1,000 were\n\n[[Page S8694]]\n\nbogus registrations for people already registered.\n  The U.S. attorney has now taken over the case, and a Federal grand \njury investigation is underway, as the FBI has recently issued a \nsubpoena to the St. Louis Election Board for records pertaining to any \nperson who registered to vote between October 1 of last year and March \n6 of this year. They also requested all records of anyone who cast \nabsentee ballots or regular ballots, as well as anyone who was turned \naway from voting.\n  It is obvious that there has been brazen fraud with these bogus voter \nregistrations. With dead people registering, fake names on voter lists, \nand phony addresses, it is painfully clear that the system is being \nabused.\n  The only conclusion: Reform is imperative.\n  There are three key weaknesses in the current system: the ease in \nwhich drop sites can be created; the ability of individuals to imposter \nothers and vote in their name; and dual registrations.\n  The drop sites are a direct result of allowing mail-in or drop-off \nregistration without also requiring some form of authentication that \nthe names being registered are of people actually existing. This \ncreates pools of false names on the voter rolls.\n  Because absentee voting after mail-in registration is allowed, it is \nvery easy for those bent on cheating to cast votes for people who never \nexisted. This clearly is in need of reform.\n  Second, the ability of individuals to pose as others is directly \ndependent upon what type of identification is required for people \nvoting. In the St. Louis mayoral primary this past March, as a result \nof the attention I and others brought to this situation, they required \nphoto IDs, and there were no complaints of voter impersonation or voter \nintimidation. Obviously, the ability to pose as another would be \nseverely restricted with a simple photo ID requirement. St. Louis may \nhave had an honest election. It should be celebrated in the history of \nMissouri. The March election was an honest one.\n  Third, the number of dual registrations creates a huge pool of names \nfor the unscrupulous to abuse. It also causes confusion for the \nlegitimate voters. A statewide database would clearly eliminate most \ndual registrations. That is certainly one of the recommendations of the \nCarter-Ford Commission that deserves support.\n  However, as simple as these reforms may be, the problems are deeper. \nFor example, motor voter actually blocks States from requiring \nnotarization or other forms of authentication on mail-in registration \ncards.\n  Given that nearly all of the fraudulent registrations were mail-in \nforms, it is obvious that we need to make real reforms in this area. At \na minimum, States need to be given the authority to require on mail \nregistration forms a place for notarization or other authentication. \nUnder current law, States are actually prohibited from including this \nsafeguard. This is one obvious place where the Federal law is clearly \nan impediment to antifraud efforts. Why do we so easily require a photo \nID to board a plane or to buy beer and cigarettes, while leaving the \nballot box undefended?\n  Motor voter has also built a system whereby once bogus names are \nregistered, it is impossible to get them off the lists. Current Federal \nlaw blocks a person's removal from the rolls unless he or she is \nreported dead, requests removal, or the U.S. Postal Service returns \ncertified election board mailings to the person as ``undeliverable'' \nand the person fails to vote in two successive Federal elections. When \nnames are added to vote lists for fraudulent purposes, they certainly \nare not going to request removal, or they certainly are not going to \nforget to vote. If you have gone to the trouble to register somebody \nfraudulently, you are going to vote them in every election. What \nprotections do we have? None.\n\n  We passed the motor voter bill with best intentions. Unfortunately, \nwe now have proof that the very mechanism designed to boost voter \nparticipation has turned the Nation's voter rolls into a tangled mess. \nIn Missouri, we saw how the motor voter flaws paralyzed the St. Louis \nElection Board last year. The board's inability to maintain its lists \ninvited brazen vote fraud, now the subject of a Federal criminal probe.\n  In Florida, St. Louis, and elsewhere, sloppy maintenance of voter \nrolls fueled charges of minority disenfranchisement. The legacy of the \nmotor voter bill is that while it tried to boost voter participation, \nit may, in fact, now be responsible for reducing the integrity of and \nconfidence in our elections. The best election ``reform'' Congress can \nundertake this year is to go back and fix the flaws in the law we \npassed 7 years ago.\n  We need to get a handle on the voter lists. People who register and \nfollow the rules should not be frustrated by inadequate polling places \nand phone lines, or confused by out-of-date lists. At the same time, we \nmust require the voter list to be scrubbed and reviewed in a much more \ntimely manner--so cheaters cannot use confusion as their friend.\n  It is time we got rid of St. Louis's lasting reputation, described my \nold friend Quincy Troop this way: The only way you can win a close \nelection in this town, you have to beat the cheat.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair and my colleagues. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8694-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RELEASING THE HOLD ON TWO NOMINEES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND \n                             HUMAN SERVICES\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I had written placing a hold on two \nnominees from the Department of Health and Human Services. I wrote that \nlast week on Janet Rehnquist, on July 27. She is up for inspector \ngeneral of the Department of Health and Human Services; and Alex \nMichael Azar, II, up for general counsel of the Department of Health \nand Human Services.\n  I placed a hold on them and had notified them on that day, last \nFriday. I had a meeting with them on Monday and I have written today \nreleasing the hold.\n  The hold was placed on them on a matter that is ongoing. That is \nbecause, when we had the Budget Appropriation hearings on the National \nInstitutes of Health, Senator Harkin and I had written--I was chairman \nat the time--to the Institutes asking questions about stem cell \nresearch. The replies we got were censored, and we finally laboriously \ngot the originals and found that information very favorable to stem \ncell research had been deleted. I asked Secretary Thompson about that \nand got an unsatisfactory answer, which I need not go into in any \ndetail about here. And then NIH had submitted a 200-page report to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and that report on the report \nwas published in the New York Times in mid-June.\n  Senator Harkin and I could not get it until less than 24 hours after \nwe had a hearing on stem cells on that report 2 weeks ago. I talked to \nthe inspector general nominee, Janet Rehnquist, about assurances that \nif she were confirmed that she would, as inspector general of HHS, \nconduct a thorough inquiry into why those reports were censored.\n  I received a letter in reply, and I need not go into detail now, and \nit is really not determinative for consideration because I am advised \nby the chairman of the Finance Committee they will not be reported out \nbefore recess with respect to Mr. Azar. I asked him about his standards \nas general counsel to render an opinion on stem cell research, which \nwould be an objective opinion. The general counsel, under the previous \nadministration, had rendered an opinion that the Federal statute barred \nextracting stem cells from the embryos, but did not ban research once \nthey had been extracted.\n  The President has taken a contrary position, and funding has been \nheld up. I wanted assurances from Mr. Azar that his determination would \nbe an objective determination. He has written to me. It is not ripe for \na final determination, but I wanted to comment because of the \nimportance of the subject and state publicly that the holds have been \nwithdrawn as far as this Senator is concerned.\n  I thank the Chair especially for her diligence in presiding.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8694-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8694-S8695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LOUIS ARMSTRONG DAY\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Madam President, I rise to express my deep concern \nabout the apparent lack of emphasis by the Department of Defense on the \ncounterdrug mission. This has been a year of continual discussion of \nincreased DoD funding for various military missions. However, all the \nindications I am hearing point to a decreased DoD interest in this \nmission, as well as decreased funding levels. I believe this would be a \npoor policy decision, and a poor indication of the nation's priorities.\n  In May 2001 testimony, before the Senate Caucus on International \nNarcotics Control, on which I served as Chairman, the heads of the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, the U.S. Customs Service, and the U.S. \nCoast Guard all testified that DoD reductions would be detrimental to \ntheir agencies' counterdrug efforts. The Office of National Drug \nControl Policy summarized that (quote) DoD's command and control system \nprovides the communications connectivity and information system \nbackbone . . . while the military services detection and monitoring \nassets provide a much need intelligence cueing capability (end quote).\n  The Commandant of the Coast Guard testified at length about DoD \ncounterdrug support, stating (quote) [w]e would go downhill very \nquickly (end quote) without DoD contributions. The Commandant also \nstated that 43 percent of Coast Guard seizures last year were from U.S. \nNavy vessels, using onboard Coast Guard law enforcement detachments. \nThe Coast Guard concluded that (quote) [s]hould there be any radical \nreduction of the assets provided through the Department of Defense . . \n. it would peril the potential for all the other agencies to make their \ncontributions as productive . . . mainly because of the synergy that is \ngenerated by the enormous capability that the 800-pound gorilla brings \nto the table . . . They are very, very good at what they do. They are \nthe best in the world . . . and when they share those capabilities . . \n. in terms of intelligence fusion and command and control, we do much \nbetter than we would ever otherwise have a chance to do (end quote). I \nunderstand that an internal review of DoD's drug role contemplated \nsevere reductions as a working assumption. After years of decline in \nDoD's role in this area, I believe this sends the wrong signal and \nflies in the face of DoD's statutory authority.\n  I have consistently supported an integrated national counterdrug \nstrategy. If we reduce the DoD role, we risk lessening the \neffectiveness of other agencies as well. We need to make these \ndecisions carefully, and with full Congressional involvement. I urge \nthe Department of Defense to keep in mind DoD's important role in, and \nnecessary contribution to, a serious national drug control strategy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8695-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8695-S8696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          AMERICAN INDIAN ENERGY AND NATIONAL ENERGY SECURITY\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, as Congress begins the August recess \nand Americans get in their cars, vans and trucks to take their deserved \nvacations, we should keep in mind that the U.S. dependency on foreign \nsources of energy is at an all-time high of more than 60 percent.\n  Both the House and Senate are considering various parts of what will \nbecome our national energy plan, but to date little attention has been \npaid to energy development and conservation on American Indian \nreservations.\n  Indian lands comprise about 5 percent of the total landmass of our \nNation and if consolidated, would be about the size of the State of \nMinnesota. In the last century, Indians were relegated to small \nremnants of their aboriginal lands, in areas most considered ill suited \nto agriculture or any other form of activity.\n  On and under these Indian-owned lands are huge reserves of oil, \nnatural gas, coal bed methane, uranium, and alternative sources of \nenergy such as wind and hydropower. There are many tribes that want to \ndevelop these energy resources and are looking to Congress for \nassistance to do just that.\n  We are not just talking about drilling in the Alaska National \nWildlife Refuge, ANWR. Indian resources span from the coal fields of \nMontana to the natural gas patch in Colorado and beyond.\n  The tribes are not only interested in research and development, and \nfinancial and tax incentives, though they are needed, but are looking \nfor changes and reforms to existing regulations that have kept energy \nand other projects from Indian lands.\n  Developing Indian energy is not only in the interest of the tribes \nand their members, but is largely consistent with the Bush \nadministration's emphasis on production, conservation, and ensuring \nlong-term supply is guaranteed.\n  It is Congress' obligation to ensure the Nation's supply of energy is \nsecure and also to assist Indian tribal development and job creation in \nthe process. To this end I am working to help ensure that tribes are \nbrought into the fold when Congress gets serious about energy policy \nthis fall.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of various recent news articles \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 29, 2001]\n\n             Falling Energy Prices Could Spark the Economy\n\n                              (By Greg Ip)\n\n       Washington.--Energy prices, which helped drive the economy \n     to the brink of recession, are declining and could be crucial \n     to reviving growth.\n       Rising production, moderate weather and weakening demand \n     have helped reduce prices of natural gas, gasoline and \n     Western wholesale electricity to below year-ago levels and \n     return inventories to a comfortable range. If sustained, the \n     drop in prices, combined with a tax cut and lower interest \n     rates, helps increase the likelihood of an economic recovery \n     in coming months.\n       But here is the catch: Prices have dropped in part because \n     slowing economies in the U.S. and abroad have lessened \n     demand. A sharp rebound in growth could tighten supplies and \n     cause prices to rise.\n       ``It looks that the worse of the energy stocks may be \n     behind us, in part because of growing supply and, even more \n     important, the effects of the economic downturn are really \n     starting to show up on the demand side,'' said Tom Robinson, \n     senior director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. \n     ``The market looks much better supplied heading into the \n     summer and next winter than most people would have thought \n     six months ago.''\n       Higher energy prices, by some estimates, reduced economic \n     growth about a percentage point in the past year by sapping \n     consumer incomes. Spending isn't likely to fully rebound \n     because the prices haven't returned to previous levels and \n     because retail electric bills have yet to fully reflect the \n     jump in wholesale costs earlier this year.\n       Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan yesterday blamed \n     rising energy costs for hurting profit margins and investment \n     as they drove up business costs between the spring of 2000 \n     and last winter, little of which was passed on in higher \n     prices.\n       The subsequent decline suggests ``some easing in pressures \n     on profit margins from energy this quarter,'' he told the \n     Economic Club of Chicago. While the Fed couldn't be certain \n     the spike in gasoline prices ``is behind us . . . it is \n     encouraging that in market economies well-publicized \n     forecasts of crises, such as earlier concerns-about gasoline \n     price surges this summer, more often than not fail to \n     develop.''\n       Crude-oil prices have slipped to about $25 a barrel from an \n     average of $28.63 in May and more than $30 a year ago. But \n     drops in other energy prices have been more striking. \n     Consider:\n       Spot natural-gas prices, which rose from $4.40 per million \n     British thermal units a year ago to above $10 in the winter, \n     have since slipped to about $3.25. Mr. Robinson estimates \n     robust drilling activity has lifted North American production \n     as much as 3% from a year ago, while demand has fallen as \n     some power plants substituted cheaper fuels for gas. Combined \n     that has dramatically boosted gas in storage from far below \n     seasonal norms to well above.\n\n[[Page S8696]]\n\n       Regular gasoline average $1.54 a gallon across the country \n     Monday, down from $1.71 in the late May and 12 cents below \n     year ago levels, according to the Energy Department. Larry \n     Goldstein, president of P * * * Energy Group, an industry \n     research organization, said that consumption instead of \n     rising the expected 1% to 1.5% this summer is now expected to \n     fall 2%. Gasoline inventories, bolstered by surging imports \n     are near a five-year high.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Reno Gazette Journal, July 31, 2001]\n\n          Teamsters Back Oil Exploration in Alaska Wilderness\n\n       Washington.--The Teamsters will start airing radio ads this \n     week in favor of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge in Alaska.

Madam President, each year the American Immigration Law \nFoundation and the American Immigration Lawyers Association sponsor a \nnational writing contest on immigration. Thousands of fifth grade \nstudents across the country participate in the competition, answering \nthe question, ``Why I'm Glad America is a Nation of Immigrants.''\n  In fact, ``A Nation of Immigrants'' was the title of a book that \nPresident Kennedy wrote in 1958, when he was a Senator. In this book, \nand throughout his life, he honored America's heritage and history of \nimmigration as a principal source of the Nation's progress and \nachievements.\n  I had the privilege of serving as one of the judges for this year's \ncontest, and was very impressed by the young writers. In their essays, \nthey showed great pride in the Nation's diversity and its immigrant \nheritage, and many students told the story of their own family's \nimmigration.\n  The winner of this year's contest is Crystal D. Armstead, a fifth \ngrader from Philadelphia. In her essay, she reminds us of America's \nimmigrant foundation and the importance of honoring our diversity. She \ndescribes how immigration has affected her family and how it enriches \nher life today. Other students honored for their creative essays were \nRobert Banovic of Pittsburgh, PA, Megan Imrie of Orland Park, IL, \nCarter Jones of Huntington Beach, CA, and Amanda Tabata of Honolulu, \nHI.\n  I believe that these award-winning essays in the ``Celebrate \nAmerica'' contest will be of interest to all of us in the Senate, and I \nask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Grand Prize Winner, Crystal D. Armstead, Philadelphia, PA\n\n\n        Reasons Why I'm Glad America is a Nation of Immigrants:\n\n       The United States has the largest immigration population in \n     the world. There are two types of immigrants today. Those who \n     are running from something, and those who are running to \n     something. In the early 1600's there was a third reason. \n     Africans were brought to America against their will as \n     slaves. Africans had no choice but to become part of American \n     culture. Today, African Americans have freedom to leave, but \n     are so much a part of the American society that we remain a \n     part of this country. I'm part of the American melting pot.\n       My school is an example of America in 2001. There are at \n     least thirty countries represented in my school.\n       Some of the children in my school don't speak English, or \n     speak very little English. In the classroom, they sometimes \n     have a translator. In the lunchroom and in the school yard, \n     language is not a problem. We play tag, jump rope, and run \n     around the school yard. We need no translators. It is a \n     privilege to go to school with so many cultures.\n       In the fourth grade, everyone researched their culture and \n     country of origin. My ancestors came from Africa. They \n     weren't treated well, but today I'm able to attend one of the \n     best schools in Philadelphia. I was proud when my grandmother \n     shared stories from Africa.\n       We finished the project with an international lunch. We \n     enjoyed dishes and wore clothes from our country of origin.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                Finalist, Robert Banovic, Pittsburgh, PA\n\n\n                           My Road to America\n\n       When the war started, I was four years old. I lived with my \n     mom, dad, grandmother, and grandfather. One day my dad went \n     to the war. My mom said that he would come back soon but he \n     never did.\n       As we sat down to eat one day, the shaking and screaming \n     began. There was dust all over. They threw a grenade in my \n     house and killed my grandfather who I loved a lot. The door \n     and bricks fell on me. Everywhere around me were dead \n     people--men, women, and children. The war didn't choose.\n       My uncle took my mom, grandmother, and me to another city. \n     From there we moved on again but my mom didn't come because \n     she was trapped in the city we came from.

It is to show why I am glad America \n     is a nation of immigrants.\n       My great-grandfather was an immigrant from Italy. In the \n     1930s people did not get paid much and had to work very long \n     hours. His name was Liberio. When people became tired with \n     the way their bosses treated them, they picketed for unions. \n     Liberio and his co-workers were among these workers. Liberio \n     was their leader. One day during a picket, the police \n     arrested him and his co-workers. When it was Liberio's turn \n     to be questioned, the police asked why they were picketing, \n     since this is America. Then Liberio said: ``I know all about \n     America. My name is Liberio and it means liberty. I have \n     three sons. My first son is named Salvatore, which means \n     salvation. America gives salvation to people who are poor, \n     hungry, persecuted or even in danger. My next son's name is \n     Victory, which means victory. Victory stands for America \n     because we are victorious over depression and hardships and \n     other countries that are against our way of life. My last \n     son's name is Frank which means freedom. Freedom is America. \n     Its people can believe, can live and dream however they \n     choose. Do not tell me I do not know what America is.'' When \n     the police heard this, they let my great-grandfather and his \n     companions go. I feel that this is very important because it \n     made many understand what America is.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              Finalist, Carter Jones, Huntington Beach, CA\n\n\n                           America as a Quilt\n\n       I like to think of America As a huge quilt, Each person \n     acting as A small thread, Each person's character Describes \n     the color Of each thread. Each person's appearance Determines \n     the texture Of each thread. Each family acts as A group of \n     threads. Each family's love For each other Determines how the \n     Threads are placed.

Madam President, I rise to commend the students of \nSunnyside and Tecumseh Middle Schools of Lafayette, IN, for their \nefforts to honor the Japanese American veterans of World War II.\n  On June 29, 2001, I was honored to help dedicate the long-awaited \nNational Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism. Located just a \nstone's throw from this chamber, at the corner of New Jersey and \nLouisiana Avenues, the memorial is a beautiful evocation of Japanese \nAmerican contributions to life of this great Nation.\n  Though small in numbers, Americans of Japanese ancestry have had a \ntremendous impact on our Nation in countless ways, in fields and \nfactories, in boardrooms and classrooms, in State houses and court \nhouses. Of course, when their Nation called, they answered, performing \nmagnificently on the battlefield. Their success, achieved in the face \nof discrimination and cultural misunderstanding, is a testament to \ntheir values of hard work, self-sacrifice, and love of family, \ncommunity, and country, values that have helped make our Nation strong \nand prosperous.\n  The National Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism is a fitting \ntribute to the ``patriotism, perseverance, and posterity\" of this small \nbut vigorous minority in our country. I hope that all our colleagues, \nand indeed Americans everywhere, will have a chance to visit this \nremarkable shrine and reflect on the lesson that it teaches us, that \nAmerica is great because it embraces its diversity, and that freedom \nand opportunity can be realized only when they are available to all.\n  Today I would like to share with you another tribute, one less grand, \nperhaps, and constructed of cloth and paper rather than steel and \nstone, but no less meaningful. I am referring to a remarkable work of \nart and remembrance, a quilt that comes from the heartland of America. \nCrafted by the young people in Lafayette, IN, the quilt honors the \nthousands of Japanese Americans who answered the call of duty during \nthe Second World War.\n  Through the good offices of the Japanese American Veterans \nAssociation, the larger-than-life quilt to which I refer had its \ninaugural unveiling at the dedication dinner celebrating the June 29, \n2001 opening of the National Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism. \nIt captured the hearts and imaginations of all who saw it that evening, \nand in so doing, appropriately highlighted the memorial's primary \nmission, to educate Americans about the heritage of Japanese Americans \nand their special place in the fabric of our Nation.\n  I would like to commend the 8th grade students of Sunnyside and \nTecumseh Middle Schools of Lafayette, IN, who joined together to create \nthis unique work, and to thank their teacher, Ms. Leila Meyerratken, \nfor her inspirational support for this initiative. Five hundred \nstudents, often working after school and on weekends, contributed their \ntime, energy, and inspiration to the school project. Mrs. Meyerratken \nherself gave up holidays and leave to see the project through.\n\n[[Page S8698]]\n\n  The quilt is a marvelously conceived and meticulously constructed \nwork. The structure and detail were crafted with an eye for historical \naccuracy, and every opportunity was taken to imbue the quilt with \nappropriate symbolism. For example, 120,000 tassels edge the red-white-\nand blue tapestry, to represent the number of Japanese Americans \nincarcerated in the wartime relocation camps. And the quilt's \ndimensions are carefully framed at 19 x 41 feet, to recall the fateful \nyear America entered the war.\n  The main body of the red, white, and blue cloth quilt is interspersed \nwith memorabilia, including dog tags and parts of uniforms, that were \nselected from Nisei veterans themselves. Other sections contain \nheartfelt poems written by some of the junior high students. The names \nof more than 20,000 Nisei soldiers, from the 100th Battalion, the famed \n442nd Infantry Regiment, the 522nd Artillery Battalion, 1399th Engineer \nConstruction Battalion, and the Military Intelligence Service, are \npainstakingly attached to the rest of the quilt's panels.\n  Its creators intended the quilt to honor Americans of Japanese \nancestry who volunteered to fight for their country in order to prove \ntheir loyalty, in spite of the detention of their family members in \ninternment camps. The students expressed hope that the tapestry will \nteach others how Japanese Americans, by making sacrifices on the field \nof battle, rose above the indignities they suffered. These youths felt \nstrongly that the World War II history of the Japanese Americans \nsoldiers, which is not generally covered in history books, was a story \nworth telling.\n  Mrs. Meyerratken, the leader of the project, says that the quilt ``is \nmeant to promote social justice by teaching others in simple ways what \nthese veterans did and how they overcame racism.''\n  I hope that the quilt will tour the Nation and convey to all citizens \nthe message of tolerance and understanding that these young people from \nIndiana have so beautifully and inspirationally captured in this \nmarvelous quilt. If this quilt accurately represents the sentiments of \nAmerica's heartland, then I think the future is in good hands \nindeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8698-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WALKER JOHNSON\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, today I rise to pay tribute to \na fine man and a great Kentuckian, Mr. Walker Johnson. On July 24, \n2001, Walker celebrated his 90th birthday. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in wishing him the very best.\n  Walker Johnson is a loving family man and a great friend. Born to \nRobert and Sanny Johnson, he enjoys small-town living and is a life-\nlong resident of Adair County, KY. Walker is the father of four \nchildren, Billy, Doris, James, and Delois. In fact, it is through \nDelois and her husband, Rich, that I have heard so many wonderful \nstories about Walker. He is a special friend to many, and is always \nwilling to help others.\n  Walker is a unique individual who is known for his wit and sense of \nhumor. Throughout his life, Walker has pursued a wide range of \nactivities including music, horse shoeing, and dog trading. He is a \ntalented musician and spent much time in his early years traveling and \nplaying the fiddle with performers such as String Bean and Uncle \nHenry's Mountaineers. In the 1940s, he put the fiddle aside and began \nshoeing horses and trading dogs. Walker was one of the most skilled and \nhardest working farrier's in the business. In fact, at the age of 68, \nhe managed to shoe 18 horses in one day. What a feat!\n  Walker has also stayed busy trading dogs, which he's done for more \nthan 50 years. He has sold dogs all over Kentucky as well as in several \nother States. Today, at the age of 90, he still enjoys trading and \nsitting down with friends for good conversation.\n  On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the U.S. Senate, I want to \npay tribute to Walker Johnson and sincerely wish him and his family the \nvery best. I ask that an article which ran in the Adair Progress on \nSunday August 24, 2000, appear in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Adair Progress, Aug. 24, 2000]\n\n         An Old-Time Fiddler Now an Honorable Kentucky Colonel\n\n                           (By Paul B. Hayes)\n\n       For around three-quarters of a century, Walker Johnson has \n     traveled around the countryside--playing a fiddle, shoeing \n     horses or trading dogs and various other items.\n       Johnson, a life-long resident of the county who has resided \n     in the Millerfield community for the past 50-plus years, is \n     known far and wide for his activities throughout the years, \n     along with wit and humor.\n       A few weeks ago, the 89-year-old Johnson began having some \n     health problems, but doctors installed a pacemaker in his \n     heart about a month ago, and he appears to be on the mend. \n     Last week, his spirits got a little boost when State Senator \n     Vernie McGaha paid him a visit, and made him a Kentucky \n     Colonel on behalf of Gov. Paul Patton.\n       While visiting with Sen. McGaha, his son Bobby, and another \n     friend, Johnson took a little while to reminisce about his \n     years as a musician, farrier and trader--and even play a tune \n     or two on his fiddle.\n       ``I've been playing a fiddle over 80 years,'' Johnson said \n     while sitting on the porch of his home, ``When I was six \n     years old, Daddy made me a little cigar box fiddle.\n       ``I started playing it, and that's all I wanted to do,'' he \n     continued, ``I got so where I wouldn't help Momma pack in the \n     water or wood, and she got mad and threw it out the window.\n       ``Eight days later, Daddy went to town and bought me a \n     three-quarter size fiddle. He brought it home, give it to \n     me, and told Momma ``This don't go out the window.' ''\n       Johnson kept playing his fiddle and before too many years \n     had passed, was traveling quite a bit to play music (In an \n     article about Johnson that appeared a few years ago in the \n     Russell Register, he was quoted as saying ``I found out it \n     was a lot easier to earn money by playing a fiddle at night \n     than it was to hoe in the fields all day long.'')\n       He played for a long time with String Bean, who later went \n     on to the Grand Ole Opry and also made many appearances on \n     Hee Haw.\n       He also played for a good while with Uncle Henry's Kentucky \n     Mountaineers. The group played weekly on a Lexington radio \n     station for three years, then got a chance to audition for \n     the Grand Ole Opry.\n       ``We went down there and played, and they offered to hire \n     us,'' he recalled. ``But, we decided not to go because it was \n     too far.\n       Uncle Henry's group also went to Chicago to perform for a \n     while, Johnson didn't go. ``Casey Jones took my place when \n     the band went to Chicago,'' he said.\n       Johnson also played at a weekly square dance that was held \n     in Columbia for two years, but in the 1940s, he gave up \n     playing his fiddle on a regular basis, and took up his other \n     two professions--shoeing horses and trading dogs.\n       Johnson shoed horses for many years--including many race \n     horses that raced at the country fairs in Russell and Adair \n     counties. He shoed so many Russell County Derby winners \n     (along with several Adair County Derby winners) that he was \n     given special recognition at the Russell County Fair one \n     year.\n       He kept on shoeing horses way past the time most people \n     would have retired, even shoeing 18 horses in one day when he \n     was 68 years old.\n       ``They always said it took a strong back and a weak mind to \n     shoe horses,'' he said, ``and I guess I was well qualified, \n     for I had them both.''\n       While he's played music and shoed horses for years, \n     Johnson's main reputation has been gained as a dog trader. In \n     dog trading circles, he's known all over Kentucky and several \n     other states.\n       ``I've been trading dogs for 55 years,'' he said ``I've \n     sold a many a load of dogs in North Carolina, Virginia, \n     Georgia and other states. I've owned a many a good dog, and a \n     lot that weren't no count at all.''\n       Johnson said that he traded fox hounds for 43 years, then \n     12 years ago switched to beagles. A few weeks ago, when he \n     was sick, he sold all the beagles he had.\n       ``I had six, and sold them all,'' he said. ``This is the \n     first time in 35 years that I haven't had a dog, but I'm \n     going to get me some more when I get able.''\n       On his being made a Kentucky Colonel at the age of 89, \n     Johnson admitted he was quite pleased to receive the \n     commission.\n       ``I'm proud to be a Kentucky Colonel, it's about the only \n     thing I've got now that I ain't got no dogs,'' he said. And, \n     referring to the Kentucky Colonel certificate, which lists \n     him as the Honorable Walker Johnson, he added, ``I've been a \n     long time finding out I was honorable--I was always called \n     something else.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8698-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8698-S8699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING FOSTER PARENTS\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN.

I \ncommend Missouri's foster parents for their dedication to helping the \nlives of children. Every day, caring people open up their homes for \nchildren who are in need of help. Currently, Missouri is home to \napproximately 4,416 foster families.\n  Being a foster parent takes tremendous skill and dedication. Foster \nparents have to go through a training and assessment program in order \nto have a better understanding of the challenges that they will face \nraising foster children. Foster parents work as a team\n\n[[Page S8699]]\n\nwith experts from state agencies to provide care that is in the best \ninterest of the child.\n  Of special note are two extraordinary Missourians. Mr. and Mrs. Isaac \nGarner of Lexington, MO, have unselfishly been foster parents to 236 \nkids. Their dedication throughout the years stems from a life-long \ncommitment to serving their community and children who are in need of a \nloving home.\n  I commend the Garners and all of the foster parents in Missouri for \ntheir efforts on behalf of Missouri's children. Thank you for making me \nproud to be a Missourian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8699-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF BILL ASHWORTH\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, earlier this week the Senate \nlost one of its finest and most respected professional staff members. \nGeorge William Ashworth, known to all of us as Bill, passed away \nsuddenly on Monday, leaving not only his loving family and a multitude \nof friends, but a 25-year record of extraordinary public service.\n  I first came to know Bill when I joined the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee in 1977. He had been serving on the staff, which was then \nnonpartisan, since 1972, after having served two years in the U.S. Army \nand then covering the Pentagon and national security issues for the \nChristian Science Monitor. He came to the Committee as a specialist on \narms control matters, and provided expert advice to all of us as we \nconsidered landmark treaties such as the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, \nthe Threshhold Test Ban Treaty, the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty, \nand the Interim Agreement on Strategic Offensive Arms SALT I. Bill not \nonly understood the details and implications of complex treaty \nprovisions, but could explain them in a way that made clear the vital \ninterests at stake. He had a passion for helping to build an \ninstitutional framework for peace and stability, at a time when the \nthreat of mutual assured destruction shaped nearly every aspect of U.S. \nforeign policy.\n  After 7 years with the committee, Bill was appointed to important \npositions at the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, one of which \nrequired Senate confirmation. In 1981, he returned to the Committee \nstaff, this time under the leadership of Senator Claiborne Pell, where \nagain he brought his vast experience to bear on the establishment of \nsensible and verifiable controls on nuclear arms. Over the next 16 \nyears, until his retirement in 1997, Bill Ashworth became one of the \nmost knowledgeable and influential staff members on national security \nquestions, ranging from conventional weapons sales and military \nassistance to multilateral arms control treaties. He served as a key \nstaffer for the bipartisan Arms Control Observer Group, briefing \nMembers and planning missions to increase our familiarity with salient \nissues under negotiations. Many of us relied on his insights and \nguidance as the Foreign Relations Committee considered amendments to \nthe Arms Export Control Act, controversial arms sales, foreign policy \nimplications of the annual defense authorization and appropriation \nbills, and resolutions of ratification for the START I and II Treaties, \nthe Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces INF Treaty, the Treaty on \nConventional Forces in Europe, CFE, and the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, among others.\n  In all these endeavors, Bill developed cooperative working \nrelationships with colleagues on both sides of the aisle while \nremaining true to his high ideals and strongly-held convictions. He was \nknown as a hard bargainer, who took seriously his role in conducting \noversight of the administration and protecting the interests of \nCommittee members. Many an ill-conceived policy was dropped or amended \nbecause of Bill's close eye and sharp mind. He served as an example and \nmentor to my own staff, selflessly providing advice and encouragement \nat every turn.\n  Bill Ashworth's influence will long be felt in the field to which he \ndevoted his career, but his presence will be sorely missed by all who \nhad the privilege of knowing him. I want to extend my deepest \ncondolences to his wife, Linda, and his daughters, Anne and Jennifer. \nIt was clear to all of us how much Bill adored his family, and I want \nto thank them for all the late hours and stressful moments they must \nhave endured while he was diligently working to make the world a safer \nplace for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8699-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IN RECOGNITION OF DR. JAMES BIANCO AND ANTHONY BIANCO\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Madam Presdent, I rise today to recognize a very \ndistinguished father and son duo from the State of Washington, Dr. \nJames Bianco and his father, Anthony Bianco.\n  Jim Bianco is the CEO of Cell Therapeutics Inc., a Seattle-based \ncompany that develops cancer therapies. Recently, Jim was honored by \nthe National Organization of Rare Diseases, NORD, for his distinguished \nwork.\n  Jim's father, Anthony Bianco, also just received some long-overdue \nrecognition for his military service to our Nation. During World War \nII, Tony Bianco was a pilot with the 32nd bomb squadron. Our Christmas \nDay, 1944, Tony was not required to fly. But he choose to fly that day \nin service to his country. On that mission over Czechoslovakia, his \nsquadron was attacked. Shrapnel came through the floor of his B-17, \nentered his lower leg, and exited through his knee. It was a serious \ninjury, yet Tony managed to land his plane safety. He spent the next \nnine months in a hospital in Italy before being sent back to the United \nStates.\n  Because of the recovery time for his injury and the coinciding of the \nend of the War, Tony was never given his 2nd Lieutenant bars. Tony's \nson Jim just recently discovered this oversight, and has worked \ndiligently to get his father the recognition he deserves.\n  Recently, Jim was able to present his father Tony with his 2nd \nLieutenant bars in recognition of his correct status after his bravery \nin World War II. I, too, would like to recognize Anthony Bianco and \nthank him for his brave service to our country. Congratulations should \ngo to both of these men, and a heartfelt thanks to both of them for \nserving our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8699-3", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8699-S8700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING REAL LIFE WITH MARY AMOROSO\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I rise today to bring to your \nattention a noteworthy television program as we in Government continue \nto encourage broadcasters to produce more ``family entertainment'' \nprogramming. It is a program that reflects a commitment to family \nprogramming by a cable television network and an individual, Mary \nAmoroso.\n  The program is called ``Real Life with Mary Amoroso,'' and appears on \nthe Comcast Cable Network's CN8 Channel. It can be seen in about four \nmillion households from the Washington DC to New York City mid-Atlantic \nregion.\n  Completing its fifth season, the program is a multiple Emmy Award \nnominee. With criticism around the country about a lack of quality \nfamily programming, Real Life with Mary Amoroso has stood as proud \nproof that family entertainment can be accomplished.\n  Real Life with Mary Amoroso has tackled issues ranging from grieving \nfor the loss of a child to finding a job after you've been laid off to \nInternet dating. The show has focused on government's involvement in \npersonal lives, in topics ranging from the human impacts of Federal \napproval of stem-cell research to the effect of divorce on today's \nfamilies.\n  In fact, comedian/philosopher, Steve Allen, father of the talk-show \nformat, told the show's producers that he'd never had a better \ninterview after he appeared on the program to talk about ``Dumbth''--\nhis book about the ``dumbing-down'' of American discourse.\n  ``We talk about birth, death, dating, child development and parenting \nissues, addictions and abuse, public range and school yard shootings, \nmid-life crises, and aging,'' said show host Mary Amoroso. ``If our \nviewers are living it and worrying about it, we want to talk about it \nand offer them resources and connections.''\n  I would like to recognize Ms. Amoroso, who is also a columnist on \nfamily issues for the Bergen Record newspaper in New Jersey, for her \nexcellent work and dedication to these family-friendly formats. The \nComcast cable television network and the Roberts family owners also \ndeserve a great\n\n[[Page S8700]]\n\ndeal of credit for its commitment to this initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8700-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN MEMORY OF SARAH MAE SHOEMAKER CALHOON\n\n Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the \npassing of a wonderful woman, mother, and American, Sarah Mae Shoemaker \nCalhoon died on July 7, 2001 outside of Columbus, OH after a courageous \nbattle with cancer. Mrs. Calhoun was 75 years old.\n  Mrs. Calhoon was born on August 31, 1925 in Philadelphia, PA to the \nlate Samuel and Sarah Mae Shoemaker. She spent her childhood in \nPhiladelphia, where she would graduate from Cheltenham High School. On \nAugust 29, 1947, just two days before her 22nd birthday, Sarah Mae \nShoemaker was married to Tom Calhoon, a Marine from nearby Grandview \nHeights.\n  The new Mr. and Mrs. Calhoon had their first child, Tom, Jr. or \n``little'' Tom as they often called him, early in their marriage. In \nSeptember of 1948, Tom, Sarah, and ``little'' Tom moved to Columbus, \nOH, where, over the next 4 years would become the proud parents of \nthree more sons, Sam, Don, and Bob. Their only daughter, Susie, would \nbe born in April of 1961.\n  Although I did not know Sarah Mae Calhoon personally, I have known \nher son Tom for more than half of my life. We met as undergraduates at \nOhio State University in the 1960s and have been fraternity brothers \nfor more than three decades. Despite living so far from each other, Tom \nand I have managed to keep in touch over the years. It is often said \nthat all children are a reflection of their parents. If Tom is even a \nfaint reflection of his mother, it is a great tribute to the values she \ncarried throughout her life and instilled in her children.\n  Since her recent passing, I have heard and read many wonderful things \nabut Sarah Mae Calhoon. I have learned about her strong commitment to \nthe community of Columbus, whether it be through her active membership \nin a variety of organizations like the PTA, 4-H, the Lions Auxiliary or \nin her unofficial role as the ``zoning watchdog'' of the Calhoon's \nneighborhood on Old Cemetery Road. I have read about her great success \nas a multi-million dollar producer in the real estate industry. I have \nheard, from both former customers and competitors alike, about the \ndedication, loyalty, and integrity that she brought to her job every \nday.\n  Most importantly, however, I have learned about her unfailing \ncommitment to being a mother and wife. Nothing was more precious to \nSarah Calhoon than her family, and she did all she could to ensure that \nall of her children grew up in a loving and nurturing environment that \nwould enable them to go on to lead valuable and fulfilling lives. She \nconsistently put the needs, concerns, and feelings of her family and \nothers before her own wishes, never asking for much but always giving a \ngreat deal. Her life served as an example, providing inspiration to \nwomen everywhere struggling to maintain the careful balance between \ncareer and family, a task that she carried out with admirable grace and \nskill.\n  Everything that I have learned about Sarah Mae Calhoon since her \ndeath has only confirmed what I had always pictured my good friend \nTom's mother would be like: the epitome of an exemplary wife, mother, \nbusiness woman, and citizen.\n  In closing, I would like to extend my greatest condolences to her \nhusband, their five children, seven grandchildren, and countless others \nwhose lives were touched by this wonderful woman. As we celebrate her \nremarkable life, let it be known that Sarah Mae Calhoon will be dearly \nmissed, yet never forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8700-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO CINDY REESMAN FOR HER SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON, Madam President, I rise today to honor and pay \ntribute to Cindy Reesman, who grew up on a farm near Colton, SD, and \nattended school in Chester. Cindy has been a highly-valued member of my \nstaff for 10 years, and I wanted to take this opportunity to publicly \nthank her for years of hard work and dedication to the people of South \nDakota and to me. Cindy will no longer be working on my staff after \nnext week, as she will be moving back to South Dakota with her husband, \nEd Reesman and their two year old daughter, Margaret. My wife Barbara \nand I, along with my entire staff, will miss her greatly.\n  Cindy is truly a public servant, as demonstrated by her efforts in my \noffice since 1991, when she joined my staff in the House of \nRepresentatives as office manager and scheduler. Cindy quickly earned \nmy trust and confidence, and she soon brought stability and her \nconsiderable organizational skills to my office. As every member of \nCongress knows, a scheduler and office manager are an integral part of \na congressional office and our daily life. Cindy's efforts over the \nyears have certainly made my time in Congress more organized, as well \nas more enjoyable.\n  Cindy's efforts over the years as a member of my staff have included \nfive and a half years as my office manager and scheduler in the House \nof Representatives, as well as four and a half years working for me in \nthe Senate, both as my scheduler and in her current role as a part time \nemployee managing my official Senate website. I have had the \nopportunity to see Cindy progress through an important part of her \nlife, from when she started on my staff as Cindy Coomes, a graduate of \nNorthern State University in Aberdeen, SD, to when she was married in \nSeptember of 1994 to Ed Reesman and to when Cindy and Ed became proud \nparents of Margaret ``Mattie'' Reesman in May of 1999.\n  Cindy has been an instrumental part of my staff for the past 10 \nyears, and it is hard to imagine her not being here. However, I know \nthat when she returns to South Dakota to live in Sioux Falls, she will \nbe an active member of the community who will continue to serve the \npublic with her many talents.\n  I know Cindy's parents, Eddie and Lois Coomes, the rest of her \nfamily, friends and colleagues are all very proud of Cindy and wish her \nall the best on her move back to South Dakota. She has a wonderful \ncareer and life in front of her, and I know she will continue to \nsucceed at whatever she chooses to do. On behalf of my wife Barbara and \nI, and my entire staff, I want to thank Cindy Reesman for her \ndedication and years of hard work for the people of South \nDakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8700-3", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8700-4", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8700-5", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:05 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4.

Sec. 7401 et seq.) to modify the \n     provisions regarding the oxygen content of reformulated \n     gasoline and to improve the regulation of the fuel additive, \n     methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE): Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the 141st \n     General Assembly of the State of Delaware, the Senate thereof \n     concurring therein, memorializes the Congress of the United \n     States to enact H.R. 20, that was introduced on January 3, \n     2001, and that modifies provisions of the Clean Air Act, \n     regarding the oxygen content of reformulated gasoline and \n     improves the regulation of the fuel additive methyl tertiary \n     butyl ether (MTBE).\n                                  ____\n\n       POW-176.

A bill to authorize the payment of a gratuity to members of \nthe Armed Forces and civilian employees of the United States who \nperformed slave labor for Japan during World War II, or the surviving \nspouses of such members, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, during the last Congress, I introduced \nthe Bataan-Corregidor Veterans Compensation Act to recognize American \nveterans who served at Bataan and Corregidor during World War II and \nwere captured, held as prisoners of war, and forced to perform slave \nlabor to support the Japanese war effort. That bill helped bring \nattention to the plight of Americans captured and enslaved in the \nPacific theater at a time when our Government undertook important \nefforts on behalf of enslaved victims of Nazi oppression in Europe. I \nbelieve that our government should also take action on behalf of those \nwho were enslaved in the Pacific theater. Since the waning days of \nthose heroes are quickly passing, the time to take action on this \nimportant matter is now.\n  Today I am introducing an updated version of last year's bill, now \nentitled the World War II Pacific Theater Veterans Compensation Act, to \nacknowledge the contributions of all ex-prisoners of war in the Pacific \nwho were forced into slave labor by the Japanese. The bill would award \na gratuity of $20,000 to each surviving veteran, government, or \ngovernment contractor employee who was imprisoned by the Japanese \nduring World War II and forced to perform slave labor to support \nJapan's war effort. The bill would also extend that gratuity to \nsurviving spouses of such veterans or employees.\n  I believe that this bill is both necessary and appropriate, \nparticularly as those Americans who sacrificed so much approach their \nfinal years. Why is it necessary? First, because Americans who were \nenslaved by Japan have never been adequately compensated for the \nexcruciating sacrifices they made while in Japanese military and \ncompany prisons and labor camps. In the War Claims Acts of 1948 and \n1952, our Government paid former U.S. prisoners of war $1.00 per day \nfor ``missed meals'' during their captivity, and later, $1.50 per day \nfor ``forced labor, pain, and suffering.'' Even those paltry \ncompensations were not widely known about or received by all veterans \nwho qualified for them. Second, this bill is necessary since ongoing \nefforts to obtain appropriate compensation from the government of \nJapan, or from Japanese companies through litigation, have been \nunsuccessful and are not likely to succeed in a timely enough manner to \ncompensate surviving veterans or others who would be eligible.\n  My colleagues might ask, ``Why is this bill appropriate?'' If enacted \ninto law, it would have our own government recognize the vital military \ncontributions made by members of the Armed Forces and civilians \nemployed by the government in the Pacific theater, and would compensate \nthose heroes for the many sacrifices they were forced to make at the \nhands of their Japanese captors. From December 1941 to April 1942, for \nexample, American military forces stationed in the Philippines fought \nvaliantly for almost six months against overwhelming Japanese military \nforces on the Bataan peninsula. As a result of that prolonged conflict, \nU.S. forces prevented Japan from achieving its strategic objective of \ncapturing Australia and thereby dooming Allied hopes in the Pacific \ntheater from the outset of the war.\n  Once captured by the Japanese, American prisoners of war in the \nPhilippines endured the infamous ``Death March'' during which \napproximately 730 Americans died to the notorious Japanese prison camp \nnorth of Manila. Of the survivors of the March, more than 5,000 more \nAmericans perished during the first six months of captivity. The \nJapanese forced many of those who survived captivity to embark on \n``hell ships''--unmarked merchant ships--to be transported to Japan to \nwork as slave laborers in company-owned mines, shipyards, and \nfactories. How tragic and cruel it was that many of our own men \nperished in those unmarked vessels, victims of attacks by American \nmilitary aircraft and submarines who unknowingly caused their demise! \nThe stories of other American military and civilian employees captured \nby the Japanese at Wake Island, Java, Manchuria, Taiwan, and other \nlocations in the Pacific and enslaved to support the war effort are \nequally compelling.\n  This bill is also appropriate because it reflects international \nprecedents by Allied nations to honor their enslaved veterans in the \nway which I propose in this bill. Allied governments, including Canada, \nNew Zealand, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom have authorized \ncompensation gratuities. In 1998, the Canadian Government authorized \nthe payment of $15,600 (Canadian dollars) to veterans who were captured \nin Hong Kong and enslaved by the Japanese. Last October, Prime Minister \nTony Blair announced a multi-million pound compensation fund for former \nenslaved Japanese prisoners of war in recognition of their heroic \nexperiences. Given those important precedents by our Allies, is it no \nless appropriate for our own nation to compensate those who gave so \nmuch to defend and preserve our freedom? Surely, the denial of personal \nfreedom; the severe physical punishment; the lifetime of health \nproblems many suffered as a result of prolonged malnutrition and \nphysical beatings--as well as the impact of those experiences on family \nand loved ones--merit the recognition that I propose in this \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\n  I believe the Congress should act as soon as possible to enact this \nlegislation into law. These brave heroes are leaving us at an \nincreasing rate each year while the court system struggles to resolve \nthe compensation claims of worthy American heroes. The time to act is \nnow, else justice and honor may not ever be served. I thank Senator \nHatch for agreeing to cosponsor this legislation, and I urge my fellow \nSenators to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1303. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for payment under the medicare program for more frequent \nhemodialysis treatments; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nimprove the quality of life for the more than 250,000 Americans with \nEnd Stage Renal Disease, ESRD. The Kidney Patient Daily Dialysis \nQuality Act of 2001 will update the Medicare program to reflect the \ncurrent state of medical science on the efficacy of hemodialysis by \neliminating the limitation on the number of sessions now covered by \nMedicare. Specifically, this bill move Medicare beyond its conventional \ncoverage of three hemodialysis sessions per week to provide coverage of \nmore frequent hemodialysis, as defined by at least five times a week at \na dialysis facility or in the home, if determined appropriate by a \npatient's physician.\n  ESRD is irreversible kidney failure. Without treatment or \ntransplantation, death invariably results. Unfortunately, the number of \nAmericans with ESRD is growing at a rate of 6 percent to 7 percent per \nyear, and this population is projected to double over the next ten \nyears. Due to the shortage of organs available for transplantation, \nalmost 90 percent of patients with ESRD received hemodialysis \ntreatments three times per week. This has been standard policy since \n1972, when Congress created the Medicare End Stage Renal Disease \nProgram. This program has been enormously successful in saving hundreds \nof thousands of lives, and increasing the life expectancy for hundreds \nof thousands of others with this terrible disease. However, the program \nnow needs to be modernized.\n  Today, scientific and medical evidence shows that more frequent \nhemodialysis enhances the health of patients with ESRD by improving \ntoleration of dialysis, high blood pressure and anemia control, \ncardiovascular status, nutrition, quality of sleep, mental clarity, and \nincreasing energy and strength. In addition to these improvements in \npatient health, and subsequent reductions in required medications and \nhospitalizations, daily hemodialysis can significantly reduce costs to \nthe Medicare program. According to a Project Hope study, more frequent \nhemodialysis could save the Medicare program between $120 million and \n$260 million per year.\n  The Kidney Patient Daily Dialysis Quality Act of 2001 stands to \nimprove the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of Americans \nsuffering from kidney failure. Scientific evidence supports the promise \nof this legislation and modern technology exists to provide it, it is \ntime to deliver.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1304. A bill to amend title XVII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage under the medicare program of oral drugs to reduce \nserum phosphate levels in dialysis patients with end-stage renal \ndisease; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nimprove the quality of life for the more than 250,000 Americans with \nEnd Stage Renal Disease, ESRD. My legislation will update the Medicare \nprogram to provide patients with better treatment for ESRD by providing \ncoverage of oral prescription medications that reduce the serum \nphosphate levels in dialysis patients.\n  Patients with ESRD cannot eliminate dietary phosphorus and, without \nundergoing a kidney transplant, risk developing a condition known as \nhyperphosphatemia. This condition, and the hospitalization that \naccompanies it, can be prevented through the use of phosphate binding \ndrugs, which are taken orally with meals and bind to dietary \nphosphorus, thereby reducing absorption in the body. Making phosphate \nbinders available to Medicare-eligible ESRD patients makes both medical \nand economical sense. Not only do these medications improve the quality \nof life for patients with kidney failure, but they stand to reduce \noverall Medicare costs associated with treating patients who develop \nhyperphosphatemia. A recent scientific study by the U.S. Renal Data \nSystem found that the use of one such drug could save Medicare, on \naverage, $17,328 per patient on an annual basis.\n  Under current law, ESRD patients are prohibited from enrolling in \nMedicare+Choice plans. Many ESRD patients are also ineligible for \n``Medigap'' coverage as 63 percent of the patients are under the age of \n65. Thus, ESRD patients are denied access to the only existing \nmechanisms under which Medicare enrollees can obtain prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  ESRD patients are among the sickest, poorest, most likely to be \ndisabled, and most frequently hospitalized of all Medicare \nbeneficiaries. In light of the shortage of organs available for \ntransplant, it is imperative that we do all we can to supplement \ntraditional hemodialysis treatment and improve the quality of life for \nthose patients with kidney disease. Scientific evidence supports the \npromise of phosphate binding drugs to enhance the health of Americans \nwith ESRD, and it is time that every patient realize that promise.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1305. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe status of professional employer organizations and to promote and \nprotect the interests of professional employer organizations, their \ncustomers, and workers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, today, together with my Finance \nCommittee colleague, Senator Grassley, I am introducing the \nProfessional Employer Organization Workers Benefits Act of 2001. \nCompanion legislation is being introduced in the House by \nRepresentatives Cardin and Portman. This legislation expands retirement \nand health benefits for workers at small and medium-sized businesses in \nthis country.\n  This bill is a narrower version of a bill that I sponsored in the \nlast Congress, S. 2979, the Graham-Mack bill. Our new bill incorporates \nseveral improvements recommended by interested parties over the course \nof the past several years. Most significantly, the scope of this bill \nhas been limited to address technical issues that were raised by the \nTreasury Department, Internal Revenue Service, and the Labor \nDepartment. I think it is fair to say that a much improved version of \nthis proposal has emerged, one that ensures that the legislation's \nobjective of expanding retirement and health coverage is achieved, \nwhile also ensuring that other important Federal policies are not \naffected. I am very pleased that, the Commissioner of the IRS, in a \nletter sent to one of the House companion bill sponsors recently, has \nindicated his interest in seeing this legislation enacted in a timely \nfashion.\n  In brief, this bill would permit certified professional employer \norganizations, PEOs, to assist small and medium-sized businesses in \ncomplying with the multiple responsibilities of being an employer. It \ndoes this by permitting the PEOs to accept responsibility for \nemployment taxes and provide employee benefits to workers in small \nbusinesses. For many of these workers, the PEO's pension, health and \nother benefits represent benefits that the worker would not have \nreceived otherwise because they are too costly for the small business \nto provide on its own. PEOs provide the expertise and the economies of \nscale necessary to provide health and retirement benefits in an \naffordable and efficient manner.\n  Congress must take every opportunity to encourage businesses to \nprovide retirement and health benefits to their employees. PEOs offer \none creative way to bridge the gap between what workers need and what \nsmall businesses can afford to provide them. This legislation clarifies \nthe tax law to make it clear that PEOs meeting certain standards will \nbe able to offer those needed employee benefits and collect Federal \nemployment taxes for their business customers.\n  In addition, I would like to make clear what this bill does not do. \nUnlike certain other bills, this bill applies only to PEOs, i.e., \narrangements where\n\n[[Page S8711]]\n\nthe PEO accepts responsibility for all or almost all of the workers at \na worksite. It does not have anything to do with temporary staffing \nagencies or similar arrangements. Further, this bill by its terms \napplies only to the two areas of the tax law I have mentioned, \nemployment tax and employee benefit laws. It does not affect any other \nlaw, nor does it affect the determination of who is the employer for \ntax law or any other purpose. The bill specifically states that it \ncreates no inferences with respect to those issues.\n  I am hopeful that, with this narrower focus, this legislation can be \nconsidered quickly on its own merits, without getting bogged down in \nthe disputes over the so-called contingent workforce and independent \ncontractor issues, issues that are not addressed in this bill. While \nthose are important issues that Congress may want to examine, we should \nnot allow those complex issues to delay resolution of the unrelated PEO \nissues addressed by this bill. We believe that the changes made by our \nlegislation will help expand retirement and health plan coverage both \nin the short-term and the longer run.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Grassley and my other \ncolleagues on the Finance Committee and the Administration in moving \nthis bill during this Congress so that we can begin to address the \ndifficulties faced by small businesses and their workers in obtaining \nbenefits and meeting the other challenges of operating in an \nincreasingly globalized economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 1305\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Professional Employer \n     Organization Workers Benefits Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NO INFERENCE.\n\n       Nothing contained in this Act or the amendments made by \n     this Act shall be construed to create any inference with \n     respect to the determination of who is an employee or \n     employer--\n       (1) for Federal tax purposes (other than the purposes set \n     forth in the amendments made by section 3), or\n       (2) for purposes of any other provision of law.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \ntransfer all excise taxes imposed on alcohol fuels to the Highway Trust \nFund, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that will help ensure that the Trust is restored to the \nHighway Trust Fund.\n  The Highway Trust Fund Recovery Act, HTFRA, of 2001 will direct 2.5 \ncents from the sale of gasohol into the Highway Trust Fund beginning in \nFiscal Year 2004.\n  This bill is important for several reasons. First, the bill \nreconfirms the landmark 1998 highway bill--TEA 21, which is so \nimportant to economic development in Montana and throughout the \ncountry. Second, the bill will ensure that much needed highway \nimprovements are made throughout the country. Third, this bill means \nmore jobs for Montanans and others throughout the country.\n  It is, in short, the right thing to do.\n  By way of background, the gas tax was established for one simply \nreason: to finance the construction of the national highway system.\n  In 1993, there was a departure. The tax was increased, by 4.3 cents a \ngallon. And, for the first time, the tax was\n\n[[Page S8715]]\n\nused not for the highway program, but instead for deficit reduction.\n  I supported the increase, reluctantly, as part of an overall \ncompromise that was a key step towards balancing the budget.\n  Even so, many of us were determined to restore the principle that the \ngas tax should only be used to fund our highway and related \ntransportation programs. We worked, as we said, to ``put the trust back \nin the trust fund.''\n  It was a long, difficult fight. We faced tough opposition, from the \nAdministration, the budget committees, and elsewhere. But, in the end, \nwe prevailed. During the Senate's consideration of the 1998 highway \nbill, we provided that the entire gas tax, including the 4.3 cents, \nwould go into the Highway Trust Fund and be used exclusively for \nhighway construction and other transportation needs. When an amendment \nwas offered to repeal the 4.3 cents tax, it was defeated.\n  Don't get me wrong. Nobody likes taxes. But, since its inception, the \ngas tax is how we get money to pay for our highways. As these things \ngo, the gas tax has worked well.\n  Ensuring necessary and affordable energy supplies, including ethanol-\nblended motor fuels and other initiatives, is important to the quality \nof life and economic prosperity of all Americans. Policies to achieve \nthese objectives, however, should not come at the expense of \ntransportation infrastructure improvements.\n  Under current law, ethanol enjoys an exemption from current excise \ntax rates. This exemption allows the price of gasohol, ethanol mixed \nwith gasoline, to be lower than the price of gasoline. Two and one half \ncents from the sale of this lower priced fuel is still sent to the \nGeneral Fund of the U.S. Treasury. It should be going to the Highway \nTrust Fund.\n  Let me explain what the Highway Trust Fund Recovery Act of 2001 would \nmean for our nation's highway program. At least $400 million a year \nwould now go where it belongs, toward the maintenance of our Nation's \nhighways.\n  I'll get right to the point. Most of my colleagues were here for the \nhighway bill debate. You know how difficult it was. You know how hard \nwe fought to make sure that each of our states would get enough funding \nto support our transportation needs.\n  We still need more. As was made clear in the debate over TEA-21 in \n1998, America still has a significant shortfall in funding when it \ncomes to maintaining a serviceable highway system. The Department of \nTransportation estimates that the Nations requires $56.6 billion \nannually just to maintain existing road and bridge conditions on our \nFederal highway system. Yet TEA-21 meets only 56 percent of that need.\n  This 2.5 cent transfer means that thousands of hard-working folks who \nshow up every day, in good weather and bad, to build our roads and \nimprove our communities will have jobs to go to. These are people who \ndepend on their jobs to support themselves and their families.\n  Pulling this all together, the Congress needs to find a way to \nenhancing our energy independence without undermining our highway \nprograms. The Highway Trust Fund Recovery Act of 2001 is a step in the \nright direction.\n  There's one final point.\n  For the past few years, Congress has been criticized for putting \npartisan politics ahead of the public interest. In short, of not \ngetting much done.\n  There have been some notable exceptions. Balancing the budget. \nReforming the welfare system.\n  And, yes, reaching a bipartisan compromise on the 1998 highway bill, \nTEA-21. That bill did not just reauthorize the highway program. It \nrenewed and revitalized the highway program. We passed it \noverwhelmingly, by a vote of 88-5. It was a great accomplishment.\n  We can confirm that accomplishment by passing the Highway Trust Fund \nRecovery Act of 2001.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1306\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Highway Trust Fund Recovery \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Madam President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Max Baucus, in introducing The Highway Trust Fund Recovery Act \nof 2001. The tax treatment of ethanol-blended fuels is an issue that is \ndisproportionately reducing the amount of Federal highway funding \nStates receive, serving as a disincentive to ethanol use, and impacting \nour ability to address fully our highway improvement needs. The \nlegislation we are introducing today addresses this problem by ensuring \nthat the portion of the per gallon Federal tax on ethanol-blended fuels \nwhich is currently deposited into the General Fund is deposited into \nthe Highway Trust Fund instead.\n  As my colleagues may be aware, the Federal tax on gasoline that does \nnot contain ethanol is 18.4 cents per gallon, whereas the Federal tax \non gasohol, a blend of gasoline and ethanol, is 13.0 cents per gallon. \nThe 5.4 cents per gallon tax difference is meant to keep the price of \nethanol down, and serve as an incentive to help promote ethanol's use \nas a renewable and alternative fuel.\n  The 18.4 cents per gallon tax on gasoline is the major source of \nincome to the Highway Trust Fund. The money that accumulates in the \nHighway Trust Fund is used for highway, highway safety, transit, and \nother surface transportation programs.\n  However, of the 13.0 cents per gallon Federal tax on gasohol, only \n10.4 cents are sent to the Highway Trust Fund, .1 cent goes to the \nLeaking Underground Storage Tank Fund, while the remaining 2.5 cents \nare deposited into the General Fund of the Treasury. Although 2.5 cents \ndoes not sound like a lot of money, it actually adds up to hundreds of \nmillions of dollars per year that are not being used for the purpose of \nimproving our Nation's roadways, the reason they were collected in the \nfirst place.\n  The bill we are introducing today, the Highway Trust Fund Recovery \nAct, would ensure that the remaining 2.5 cent tax paid by highway users \non ethanol-blended fuels is deposited into the Highway Trust Fund. \nUnder the bill, annual deposits to the Highway Account would increase \nby some $400 million per year based on current gasohol sales.\n  Ohio has the Nation's 10th largest highway network, the 5th highest \nvolume of traffic, the 4th largest interstate highway network, and the \n2nd largest inventory of bridges in the country. While Ohio's traffic \nand congestion have risen, its Federal receipts have not risen \ncommensurately because of the different tax treatment of ethanol-\nblended fuels.\n  The reason for this disproportion is because Ohio's uses of gasohol \nis among the highest in the Nation, 40 percent of the state's gasoline \nconsumption in 2000 compared to a national average of around 10 \npercent. Since Ohio's Federal appropriation under the Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, is determined by its \ncontribution to the Highway Trust Fund, and gasohol is taxed \ndifferently than conventional gasoline, gasohol consumption has \nsignificantly decreased the amount of revenue credited to Ohio in the \nHighway Trust Fund.\n  It's simple: less money in means less money out.\n  According to the Ohio Department of Transportation, ODOT, Ohio is \nlosing more than $160 million per year due to gasohol consumption. To \nput that number in perspective, it equals 17 percent of Ohio's total \nobligation ceiling; over one half of the State's major new construction \nprogram budget; and it nearly equals the amount the State budgets for \nroutine bridge repair and replacement for an entire year. Of that $160 \nmillion figure, the state is losing more than $50 million simply \nbecause 2.5 cents of the Federal tax on gasohol\n\n[[Page S8716]]\n\nare deposited into the General Fund. This amount is 5 percent of the \nOhio's total obligation ceiling; one-sixth of Ohio's major new \nconstruction program; and equal to the amount ODOT budgets for safety \nimprovement projects for a two-year period.\n  The 11 States that make up the Mississippi Valley Conference of the \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, \nAASHTO, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, \nMissouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Wisconsin, account for 70 percent of the \nNation's ethanol consumption. The Federal fuel tax rate for ethanol \nimpacts this region more than any other region of the country. If the \nlegislation we are introducing were enacted today, this region alone \nwould receive over $225 million more in additional highway funding.\n  My State of Ohio has made the environmentally sound decision to \nutilize ethanol in order to keep the air clean; we should not be \npenalized with fewer highway dollars for doing the right thing.\n  Our legislation would not affect the highway formulas or distribution \nof funds under TEA-21, and it does not take effect until fiscal year \n2004, after the expiration of TEA-21. It is important that Congress \nknow what estimated Highway Trust Fund revenues will be prior to the \nnext highway authorization process.\n  The current tax treatment of gasohol is a disincentive to use \nethanol, a clean, renewable fuel source. The bill we are introducing \ntoday is good environmental policy, good agricultural policy, good \nenergy policy, and good transportation policy. States should not be \npenalized for using ethanol. It does not make sense for taxes paid on \nethanol-blended fuels to be deposited in the General Fund when we need \nmore than $50 billion per year over the next 20 years just to maintain \nthe current physical condition of our Nation's highways.\n  Taxes on ethanol are paid by motorists whose vehicles are causing the \nsame wear and tear on our roads and bridges that non-ethanol-fueled \nvehicles cause. While we may have policy reasons for taxing ethanol at \na lower rate or establishing a market for ethanol-blended fuels, surely \nwe ought to insist that the taxes paid by ethanol users are deposited \ninto the Highway Trust Fund where they can be used to make our highways \nsafer and less congested.\n  This bill would help ensure that we have reliable alternative sources \nof energy, while we meet our clean air goals, but not at the expense of \nStates' highway funding. I urge my colleagues to join me in \ncosponsoring this legislation, and I urge its speedy consideration by \nthe Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 1309. a bill to amend the Water Desalination Act of 1996 to \nreauthorize that Act and to authorize the construction of a \ndesalination research and development facility at the Tularosa Basin, \nNew Mexico, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise today to introduce ``The Water \nSupply Security Act of 2001.'' Access to fresh water is an increasingly \ncritical national and international issue. As the world's population \ngrows and stores of fresh water are depleted, finding additional \nsources of fresh water is key to ensuring world peace and security.\n  In the Middle East, a major component of almost every peace agreement \nis water. President Khatami of Iran said last month that peace in the \nregion will be largely determined by mechanisms to solve the problem of \nwater. Shortly after being elected, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon \nstated that one of the first things he was going to do was to build two \nwater desalting plants in Israel to meet that country's water needs.\n  Providing fresh water to the people of Africa is a key component in \nfighting the AIDS epidemic plaguing that continent. AIDS researchers \nhave determined that a principal reason that mothers with AIDS and HIV \nare spreading the virus to their children is because there is not \nenough clean water to mix infant formula.\n  Here in the United States, arid states such as New Mexico are facing \nserious water shortages. City planners in my home town of Albuquerque \nhave speculated that the city will not be able to grow much more \nbecause the aquifer located beneath the city is quickly drying up. \nNevada, Arizona, Texas, California and Florida are facing similar \nproblems. A study by the Hudson Institute found that by the year 2025, \n45 percent of the U.S. population growth will occur in California, \nTexas, and Florida, States already facing severe water shortages. This \npopulation explosion will undoubtedly result in a scarcity of fresh \nwater.\n  Although all these States have diminishing stores of fresh water, \nthey all have large deposits of brackish and sea water. Because \nbrackish and sea water account for over 97 percent of the water on \nearth, being able to cheaply convert this water into fresh water is \nimportant to ensuring an adequate supply of fresh water.\n  President Kennedy, a strong proponent of the government funding for \ndesalting technology, stated ``if we could ever competitively, at a \ncheap rate, get fresh water from salt water . . . (this) would be in \nthe long-range interests of humanity which would really dwarf any other \nscientific accomplishments.''\n  The R funded by the federal government between 1952 and the early \n1980s resulted in the two desalting technologies that are most widely \nused today. The development of these widely used technologies would not \nhave been possible had it not been for federally sponsored research and \ndevelopment. Just as these endeavors resulted in significant \ntechnological breakthroughs, I believe that a renewed investment by the \nfederal government would lead to further advancements in the \ntechnology.\n  Although desalting technology has become significantly cheaper in \nrecent years, the cost of desalting brackish and seawater is still \nsubstantially more expensive than treatment and delivery of other \nmunicipal water supplies. In 1996, Congress passed the Water \nDesalination Act of 1996. This created a small desalting R & D and \ndemonstration program within the Bureau of Reclamation that was tasked \nwith determining the most technologically efficient and cost-effective \nmeans by which useable water can be produced from saline water.\n  This program has been very successful despite receiving limited \nfunding. However, their authorization is set to expire in 2002. The \nlegislation I introduce today would re-authorize the desalting R & D \nand demonstration program run by the Bureau of Reclamation for an \nadditional six years so that they can continue their work on ensuring \nthat we are able to produce fresh water at a reduced cost.\n  In addition to renewing this program, the federal government needs to \npursue next-generation technologies that would significantly drive down \nthe cost of converting large volumes of readily available saline and \nbrackish waters. Although desalting technology cost and performance \nhave been significantly improved over the past thirty years, overall \ncost needs to be reduced by a factor of 5 to 10 to make desalted water \naffordable. While the currently available technologies may be meeting \nthe needs of certain coastal communities with adequate resources to \nfinance such technology, there is a real need for technologies that can \ntackle a broader range of applications and reduce costs significantly. \nSuch revolutionary desalting technologies would provide significant \nrelief to communities throughout the world, be they rich or poor, \ncoastal or inland.\n  Our national laboratories have long been known for being at the \nforefront of science. The laboratories have extensive expertise in \nvirtually all of the key science and technology areas necessary for \ndeveloping next-generation desalting technology. Furthermore, the labs \nare already engaged in research and development in several non-\ntraditional desalination technologies. As such, I believe our national \nlaboratories should play a significant role in the development of this \nvital technology. Drawing from the technological expertise that the \nlabs can provide should ensure that this endeavor will be a successful \none.\n  The bill that I introduce today would direct a collaboration between \nthe Bureau of Reclamation and the Department of Energy in evaluating \ncurrent technology, advising on how to proceed\n\n[[Page S8717]]\n\nwith additional research, authorizing the building of a facility where \nthese advances in technology could be tested, and confirming project \nand operation costs in a real-world application. This bill would also \nemploy the extensive knowledge in desalination technology that the \nBureau of Reclamation has accumulated over the past 30 years by \nallowing that agency to conduct internal research.\n  I have no doubt that this legislation would help to push the state of \nthe art forward to ensure that the world has access to this life \nsustaining resource for years to come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1309\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the sale of certain real property in \nthe Newlands Project, Nevada, to the city of Fallon, Nevada; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprovide the City of Fallon, NV, the exclusive right to purchase \napproximately 6.3 acres of public land located in the downtown area of \nthe City. My bill, the Fallon Rail Freight Loading Facility Transfer \nAct, will enable the City of Fallon to make the necessary long-term \ninvestments to ensure the future viability of this important municipal \nasset.\n  Fallon is a rural agricultural community of 8700 residents located in \nnorthern Nevada approximately 70 miles east of Reno. Since 1984 the \nCity has leased approximately 6.3 acres of property from the U.S. \nBureau of Reclamation that it utilizes as a rail freight yard and \nloading facility. The City, the State of Nevada, the U.S. Department of \nTransportation and the Southern Pacific Railroad have collectively \ninvested a significant amount of money in this facility that is \ndirectly responsible for over 400 jobs in the community.\n  On January 1, 2000, the long-term lease agreement between the City of \nFallon and the Bureau of Reclamation expired. As negotiations began for \na new long-term lease the City and the Bureau came to the conclusion \nthat it would be in both party's best interests to have ownership of \nthis property transferred to the City.\n  The City would be able to make long term investments in a facility \nthat it owned without having to worry about renegotiating new leases \nand the possibility of losing access to the property which is critical \nto the economic well being of the community. The Bureau of Reclamation \nwould be able to divest itself from an asset that no longer serves a \npurpose to its core mission allowing more of its scarce resources to be \nfocused on the traditional roles of the Bureau. Of course this transfer \nwill be contingent on the satisfactory conclusion of all necessary \nenvironmental reviews and will be purchased by the City at fair market \nvalue.\n  The Fallon Rail Freight Loading Facility Transfer Act is a win-win \nsituation for all affected parties. I look forward to prompt \nconsideration of this important piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1310\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fallon Rail Freight Loading \n     Facility Transfer Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE TO THE CITY OF FALLON, NEVADA.\n\n       (a) Conveyance.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to subsections (b) and (c), the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall convey to the city of Fallon, \n     Nevada, all right, title, and interest of the United States \n     in and to approximately 6.3 acres of real property in the \n     Newlands Reclamation Project, Nevada, generally known as \n     ``380 North Taylor Street, Fallon, Nevada'', and identified \n     for disposition on the map entitled ``Fallon Rail Freight \n     Loading Facility''.\n       (2) Map.--The map referred to in paragraph (1) shall be on \n     file and available for public inspection in--\n       (A) the office of the Commissioner of Reclamation; and\n       (B) the office of the Area Manager of the Bureau of \n     Reclamation, Carson City, Nevada.\n       (b) Consideration.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall require that, as \n     consideration for the conveyance under subsection (a), the \n     city of Fallon, Nevada, shall pay to the United States an \n     amount equal to the fair market value of the real property, \n     as determined--\n       (A) by an appraisal of the real property conducted not \n     later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act by \n     an independent appraiser approved by the Commissioner of \n     Reclamation; and\n       (B) without taking into consideration the value of any \n     structure or other improvement on the property.\n       (2) Credit of proceeds.--The amount paid to the United \n     States under paragraph (1) shall be credited, in accordance \n     with section 204(c) of the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 485(c)), to \n     the appropriate fund in the Treasury relating to the Newlands \n     Reclamation Project, Nevada.\n       (c) Liability.--The conveyance under subsection (a) shall \n     not occur until such date as the Commissioner of Reclamation \n     certifies that all liability issues relating to the property \n     (including issues of environmental liability) have been \n     resolved.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Kennedy, Ms.\n\n[[Page S8719]]\n\n        Collins, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 1311. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nreaffirm the United States historic commitment to protecting refugees \nwho are fleeing persecution or torture; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am proud to introduce the Refugee \nProtection Act, a bipartisan bill that would sharply reduce the use of \nexpedited removal at our borders while also reducing the number of \nasylum seekers whom we detain. This is a bipartisan bill, I am joined \ntoday by Senators Brownback, Kennedy, Collins, Durbin, Jeffords, and \nGraham. I am grateful for the support of the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the immigration subcommittee.\n  In 1996, I introduced an amendment to the Illegal Immigration Reform \nand Immigrant Responsibility Act, ``IIRIRA'', that would have \nauthorized the use of expedited removal only at times of immigration \nemergencies. The bill we introduce today is modeled on that proposal. \nThat amendment passed the Senate with bipartisan support, but was \nomitted from the bill that was reported out of a partisan, closed \nconference. As a result, expedited removal took effect on April 1, \n1997. America's historic reputation as a beacon for refugees has \nsuffered as a consequence, and it is long past time to restore it.\n  Expedited removal allows INS inspections officers summarily to remove \naliens who arrive in the United States without travel documents, or \neven with facially valid travel documents that the officers merely \nsuspect are fraudulent, unless the aliens utter the magic words \n`political asylum' upon their first meeting with American immigration \nauthorities. This policy is fundamentally unwise and unfair, both in \ntheory and in practice, and its efficacy and fairness has come under \nincreasing criticism.\n  First, expedited removal ignores the fact that many deserving asylum \napplicants are forced to travel without papers. For example, victims of \nrepressive governments often find themselves forced to flee their \nhomelands at a moment's notice, without time or means to acquire proper \ndocumentation. Or a government may systematically strip refugees of \ntheir documentation, as the Serbian government did in Kosovo in 1999.\n  Second, expedited removal places an undue burden on refugees, and \nplaces too much authority in the hands of low-level INS officers. \nRefugees typically arrive at our borders ragged and tired from their \nordeals, and often with little or no knowledge of English. Our policy \nforces them to undergo a secondary inspection interview with an INS \nofficer without expertise in asylum and with the power to deport them \non the spot, subject only to a supervisor's approval. By law, anyone \nwho indicates a fear of persecution or requests asylum during this \ninterview is to be referred for an interview with an asylum officer. \nBut no safeguards exist to guarantee that this happens, and the \nsecondary inspection interviews generally take place behind closed \ndoors with no witnesses. Indeed, this interview often becomes unduly \nconfrontational and intimidating. As the Lawyers Committee for Human \nRights has documented, refugees are detained for as long as 36 hours, \nare deprived of food and water, and are often shackled. If they are \nlucky, they will be provided with a competent interpreter. If they are \nunlucky, they will receive no interpreter at all, an interpreter with \nextraordinarily limited knowledge of their language, or even an \ninterpreter who works for the airline owned by the government that they \nclaim is persecuting them. Such a system is a betrayal of our ideals, \nand we need to reform it.\n  I was heartened to hear James Ziglar, the President's choice to head \nthe INS, criticize expedited removal at his confirmation hearing. He \nsaid: ``I definitely think we need to change the process where asylum-\nseekers come here, to make sure that we know who these people are and \nwhat their claims are and whether they're legitimate before we turn \naround and put them on a plane back to an uncertain future.'' I could \nnot agree more with Mr. Ziglar, and I look forward to working with him \non this issue.\n  I was also moved by the recent words of Theodore McCarrick, the new \nArchbishop of Washington, in a July 22 op-ed in the Washington Post. \nArchbishop McCarrick described how expedited removal forces potential \nasylum seekers arriving on our shores ``to immediately articulate their \nfear of return'' or be ``subject to immediate deportation without any \nrecourse to the legal system.'' He wrote: ``Those who come to our \nshores and request asylum should be given a chance to make their case \nbefore a qualified asylum officer and immigration judge. The Refugee \nProtection Act to be considered by Congress would reform the U.S. \nasylum system appropriately and should be enacted.''\n  The Archbishop described the case of Ditron, an ethnic Albanian from \nKosovo who fled from the Milosevic government in early 1998 and made it \nall the way to Newark International Airport, where he tried to gain \nasylum. But the language barrier prevented him from communicating his \nfear of returning to Kosovo to the INS inspector, and he was put on a \nplane and deported under expedited removal. We only know about his \nstory because he was somehow able to make it back to the United States \na second time, and his application for asylum is now pending. But such \na 50 percent success ratio is simply unacceptable for this Nation.\n  I became aware of another very disturbing case last summer. A \ndomestic violence victim from the Dominican Republic fled to the United \nStates. The INS believed that she had been a victim and that her life \nwould be endangered if she were returned to her native country. \nNonetheless, she was ordered deported under expedited removal because \nthe INS officers who interviewed her took it upon themselves to make a \nlegal determination that victims of domestic violence were ineligible \nfor asylum on that ground. It is bad enough that these officers decided \ntheir responsibilities in implementing expedited removal went so far as \ninterpreting U.S. asylum law. Even worse, they got the law wrong. \nAlthough a recent Board of Immigration Appeals decision had indicated \nthat domestic violence victims could not gain asylum here, that \ndecision was under review at the time and was later vacated by then-\nAttorney General Janet Reno. Luckily, a number of Members of Congress \nintervened in the case and the INS did not deport this woman, who has \nsince been granted asylum. But had her case not been brought to our \nattention by the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, she would likely \nhave become a silent victim of the expedited removal process.\n  Another expedited removal horror story came to our attention just \nlast week. Libardo Yepes Holguin fled Colombia last November after his \nlife was threatened by the paramilitary forces involved in the civil \nwar there. When he arrived at Miami International Airport, he told the \nINS inspectors that he feared being returned to Colombia and that he \nwanted to seek asylum. He was nonetheless put on a plane back to \nColombia, where his life was again threatened. He managed to escape \nagain, and this time entered the United States by crossing a river from \nMexico. He was seized by INS officers and has been detained in Texas \nsince May. The INS is currently attempting to remove Mr. Yepes Holguin \nbased on the prior removal order entered against him in Miami last \nfall, despite his sworn testimony that his repeated requests to apply \nfor asylum were ignored.\n  Finally, and most shockingly, expedited removal has even been used \nagainst U.S. citizens. Sharon McKnight, a 35-year old U.S. citizen with \nthe mental capacity of a 5-year old, returned to the United States last \nJune from a trip to visit her grandfather in Jamaica. INS inspectors \ndid not believe she was a citizen, wrongly questioning the authenticity \nof her U.S. passport and dismissing as fake the birth certificate \npresented by her waiting relatives that showed she was born on Long \nIsland. She was held overnight in a room at the airport, handcuffed and \nwith her legs shackled to a chair. During the entire time she was at \nthe airport she was given nothing to eat and was not allowed to use the \nrestroom. Ms. McKnight was put on a plane back to Jamaica, denied \nentrance to her own country because of expedited removal. Although \nimmigration officials realized their mistake eventually and allowed her \nto return, any system that permits such ``mistakes'' is sorely in need \nof reform. For\n\n[[Page S8720]]\n\nher part, Ms. McKnight has said: ``They treated me like an animal--I \nwill have nightmares all my life.''\n  These stories, just four of the many stories demonstrating the human \ncost of expedited removal, go a long way toward showing the inhumanity \nof the new immigration regime that Congress imposed in 1996. But \nrefugees and U.S. citizens are not the only people affected by \nexpedited removal. Human rights groups have also documented numerous \ncases where people traveling to the United States on business, with \nproper travel documents, have been removed based on the so-called \n``sixth sense'' of a low-level INS officer who suspected that their \nfacially valid documents were fraudulent. In other words, the damage \ndone by expedited removal also threatens the increasingly international \nAmerican economy, if businesspeople from around the world are treated \ndisrespectfully at our ports of entry, they are likely to take their \nbusiness elsewhere.\n  But perhaps the most distressing part of expedited removal is that \nthere is no way for us to know how many deserving refugees have been \nexcluded. Because secondary inspection interviews are conducted in \nsecret, we typically only learn about mistakes when refugees manage to \nmake it back to the U.S. a second time, like Ditron, or when they are \ndeported to a third country they passed through on their way to the \nU.S., like Mr. Thevakumar. This uncertainty should lead us to be \nespecially wary of continuing this failed experiment.\n  As I said, my bill would limit the use of expedited removal to times \nof immigration emergencies, defined as the arrival or imminent arrival \nof aliens that would substantially exceed the INS' ability to control \nour borders. The bill gives the Attorney General the discretion to \ndeclare an emergency migration situation, and the declaration is good \nfor 90 days. During those 90 days, the INS would be authorized to use \nexpedited removal against people coming from a nation whose crisis has \ngiven rise to the emergency migration situation. The Attorney General \ncan extend the declaration for further periods of 90 days, in \nconsultation with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.\n  This framework allows the government to take extraordinary steps when \na true immigration emergency threatens our ability to patrol our \nborders. At the same time, it recognizes that expedited removal is an \nextraordinary step, and is not an appropriate measure under ordinary \ncircumstances.\n  This bill also provides safeguards that will guarantee refugees some \ndue process rights, even during immigration emergencies. First, aliens \nwould be given the right to have an immigration judge review a removal \norder, and would have the opportunity both to speak before the \nimmigration judge on their own behalf and to be represented at the \nhearing at their own expense. To make these rights meaningful, \nimmigration officers would be required to inform aliens of their rights \nbefore they are removed or withdraw their application to enter the \ncountry. This provision takes away from INS inspectors the unilateral, \nand prior to 1997, unprecedented, power to remove an alien from the \nUnited States.\n  Second, this bill reforms the procedures used to determine whether an \napplicant who seeks asylum has a credible fear of persecution. If an \nasylum officer determines that an applicant does not have a credible \nfear of persecution, the applicant will now have a right to a prompt \nreview by an immigration judge. The applicant will have the right to \nappear at that review hearing and to be represented, at the applicant's \nexpense.\n  Even those asylum seekers who are found to have a credible fear of \npersecution and thus escape expedited removal move on to another \ntroubled system. Under current law and practice, they are often \ndetained in INS detention facilities or in local jails where the INS \nrents space. In other words, these men and women who have fled \npersecution in their native lands are all too often treated like common \ncriminals. We need to do something to solve this problem as well, and \nthe Refugee Protection Act attempts to do so.\n  As a young girl in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo, \nAdolphine Mwanza lived in a convent and was studying to be a nun. Her \nfamily was known to be opposed to the corruption of the ruling Mobutu \nregime. Her brother was killed, and she was kidnapped, tortured, and \nraped. She escaped from the country and fled to the United States in \nNovember 1999 on a Zambian passport. She was sent to an INS detention \nfacility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where she was found to have a \ncredible fear of persecution. But despite the fact that she had \nvolunteer attorneys from the New York University Law School clinic, and \na Roman Catholic convent had agreed to house and support her, her \nrequest for parole from detention was denied by the INS. She was held \nin a detention facility for eight months, until she was granted aslyum.\n\n  This is senseless. We should not detain people whom our own \ngovernment has found to be likely candidates for asylum as if they were \nawaiting a criminal trial. Moreover, the cost to the government to \ndetain someone like Adolphine Mwanza for eight months cannot be \njustified. And she is not alone. Many asylum seekers are detained for \nmore than a year even though there are family members or \nnongovernmental organizations that are willing to house them and ensure \nthat they appear for their asylum hearing.\n  The Refugee Protection Act would clarify that the Attorney General \nhas the option to parole asylum seekers, and would add language to \nexisting law to say that it is the policy of the United States not to \ndetain asylum seekers who have been found to have a credible fear of \npersecution. It also instructs the Attorney General to promulgate \nregulations to authorize and promote the use of alternatives to the \ndetention of asylum seekers, such as paroling them to private nonprofit \nvoluntary agencies. For those who would still be detained, the bill \nwould guarantee access to legal and religious services. It would also \nensure that they are only detained in INS facilities or in contract \nfacilities that contain only immigration detainees asylum seekers would \nno longer be housed alongside criminals in county jails. In addition, \nasylum seekers would have the right to have an asylum officer make a \ndetermination about whether they should be paroled from detention, and \nto have an immigration judge review that determination.\n  These changes will reduce the use of detention against asylum \nseekers, offer them fundamental due process rights, and improve the \nconditions of their confinement in those cases where detention is \nappropriate. These are crucial steps, and we should act on them as \nquickly as possible.\n  Finally, this bill includes three additional provisions. First, it \nwould eliminate the one-year deadline for asylum applicants that was \nimposed in 1996. By definition, worthy asylum applicants have arrived \nin the United States following traumatic experiences abroad. They often \nmust spend their first months here learning the language and adjusting \nto a culture that in many cases is extraordinarily different from the \none they know. Therefore, although I can understand the desire to have \nasylum seekers submit timely applications, the existing one-year rule \ndoes not make sense.\n  Second, the bill would eliminate the existing annual limit on the \nnumber of people who have been granted asylum who can become legal \npermanent residents. Once we have decided that someone is worthy of \nasylum, we should not delay their adjustment into American society. \nThese are people who have chosen the United States because of its \nideals and its freedoms, in other words, they are exactly the sort of \npeople we would want to become citizens. We need to eliminate the \nbacklogs that prevent them from starting that process by getting their \ngreen cards. This bill will do that.\n  Third, the bill eliminates the annual limit on the number of refugees \nwho may be admitted or granted asylum because they are subject to \npersecution for resistance to coercive population control methods. \nUnder current law, only 1000 people can be accepted to the United \nStates in any year for that reason. Americans are united in their \nopposition to forced sterilization and abortion, and we should not \nplace an artificial limit on the number of people fleeing from such \npolicies that we will accept.\n  This bill has received the support of a wide variety of civil rights \nand religious groups, with a coalition of over\n\n[[Page S8721]]\n\n50 groups, from the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights to the Hebrew \nImmigrant Aid Society to the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, \nendorsing it. And even before it has been introduced it has been the \nsubject of favorable editorials or op-eds in the Washington Post, \nPittsburgh Post-Gazette, San Francisco Chronicle, San Diego Union-\nTribune, Newark, Star-Ledger, Arizona Republic, Baltimore Sun, \nMinneapolis Star-Tribune, San Antonio Express-News, South Florida Sun-\nSentinel, Oakland Tribune, Buffalo News, Bangor, ME., Daily News, and \nHarrisburg, PA., Patriot-News. Meanwhile, the immigration subcommittee \nof the Judiciary Committee has already heard testimony this year about \nthe inherent unfairness of our current expedited removal and detention \npolicies from people who went through those systems before being \ngranted asylum. I hope that the momentum this bill already has will \nlead to prompt consideration by the Senate.\n  Even in 1996, a year in which immigration was as unpopular in this \nCapitol as I can remember, this body agreed that expedited removal was \ninappropriate for a country of our ideals and our historic commitment \nto human rights. And that agreement cut across party lines, as many of \nmy Republican colleagues voted to implement expedited removal only in \ntimes of immigration emergencies. I urge them, as well as my fellow \nDemocrats, to support this legislation and to work for its prompt \npassage.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Leahy, Collins, and Kennedy, among others to \nintroduce the Refugee Protection Act of 2001. The Refugee Protection \nAct will restore fairness to our treatment of refugees who arrive at \nour shores seeking freedom from persecution and oppression. It will \nreduce the number of asylum seekers placed in prison-like detention \nfacilities.\n  On July 10, standing on Ellis Island, President Bush said, ``America \nat its best is a welcoming society.'' From our very beginnings almost \n400 years ago when the refugee Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock seeking \nreligious freedom, our Nation has welcomed refugees. When we give \nrefuge to desperate people fleeing extraordinary persecution, we are a \nbetter Nation. Moreover, asylees, by definition, represent the best of \nAmerican values. Often they are people who have stood alone, at great \npersonal cost, against hostile governments for principles that are \nfundamental to us such as political and religious liberty. Therefore, \nas Americans with a noble legacy, we must continue to examine our \nasylum policies with an eagle-eyed vigilance for fairness and justice.\n  On May 3, I chaired an Immigration Subcommittee hearing on asylum \npolicy. We heard testimony that genuine refugees are, from time to \ntime, mistakenly deported by INS inspectors, treated abusively during \nairport inspections, and that many asylum seekers are detained in \nprison-like conditions well beyond the time needed to determine their \nidentity and establish that they have a credible fear of persecution.\n  First of all, it must be stated that the men and women who serve the \nINS are dedicated public servants, with a difficult job and in no \nfashion do I want to indict them. They often work under extremely \ndemanding conditions, sometimes with insufficient resources, yet they \ncomplete their difficult tasks with fairness and good judgment. \nHowever, we must examine various incidents of abuse which have come to \nour attention regarding the treatment of asylee applicants while their \nclaim is pending. Clearly, these incidents are not official INS policy \nand most officers would abhor such mistreatment, yet they do occur, \nnonetheless, and therefore must be addressed.\n  At that hearing, former asylum seekers presented moving testimony \nabout such mistreatment. For example, Mekabou Fofana, a Liberian \nteenager, testified that he arrived at JFK airport nine days before his \n16th birthday. Despite his request, he was not provided with a Mandingo \ninterpreter. When INS officials twisted his arm and attempted to \nforcibly fingerprint him, Mekabou fell to the floor, hitting his head \nand bleeding so profusely that he had to be taken to the hospital. \nAfter a year and a half in detention in adult facilities, Mekabou was \ngranted asylum and is now attending high school in New York City.\n  An Albanian asylum seeker who arrived at O'Hare International Airport \nin Chicago last year also submitted testimony to the subcommittee. This \ntestifier who wishes to remain anonymous was dragged by his clothing \nafter he explained that he wished to apply for asylum. Despite his \nrequests, he was not provided with an Albanian interpreter whom he \ncould understand, and officers yelled at him when he refused to sign \ndocuments written in English that he could not comprehend.\n  Faheem Danishmandi, a refugee from Afghanistan, arrived in America at \nage nineteen, traumatized by the recent killing of his father and \nseparation from his mother. When he told an INS officer that he did not \nhave a passport, the officer roughly searched him, apparently looking \nfor documents then he was chained to a bench for 25 hours. After five \nmonths in detention, he was granted asylum.\n\n  Amin Al-Torfi, a torture survivor from Iraq, fled to America after he \nand his family were persecuted by Saddam Hussein's regime because of \ntheir political opinions and religious beliefs. At the airport, he was \ntold that he would have to wait three days to get an Arabic \ninterpreter. He was shackled by the leg to a bench for eight hours, \nstrip-searched, and led handcuffed with another asylum seeker through \nthe airport in front of other passengers. After five months of \ndetention, Amin was granted asylum.\n  A change in our law is desperately needed. I believe in the \nenforcement of our nation's immigration laws. I also believe that \npeople who find themselves under INSA jurisdiction deserve humane \ntreatment. We are a Nation of immigrants, of refugees, of the \ncourageous who resisted governmental persecution and fled to America in \nsearch of freedom. Given this proud tradition, we have a higher \nresponsibility to asylum seekers. We have a responsibility to afford \nthem a fair opportunity to present their asylum claims, a \nresponsibility to not unnecessarily detain them for extended periods, \nand a responsibility not to turn them away to suffer further \npersecution.\n  At the May 3 hearing, Leonard Glickman, President of the Hebrew \nImmigrant Aid Society testified on behalf of his own agency and five \nother Jewish organizations. Mr. Glickman discussed the tragic history \nof 900 Jews on the ship, the St. Louis, who, in 1939, were fleeing Nazi \npersecution. American immigration officials turned them away from the \nPort of Miami and they were forced to return to Europe where most \nperished. He concluded that, ``The Jewish community is greatly \nconcerned about the major changes that were instituted in the U.S. \nasylum system in 1996, changes that we believe threaten to undermine \nrefugee protection and US global leadership in this area.''\n  Dr. Don Hammond, a Senior Vice President for World Relief also \ntestified. World Relief is the relief, development, and refugee \nassistance arm of the National Association of Evangelicals which has \ncalled for passage of the Refugee Protection Act. Dr. Hammond stated \nthat there has been a significant increase in religious persecution in \na number of countries around the world. A University of California \nstudy of expedited removal listed the 101 countries with the highest \nnumber of people being turned away from the United States and sent back \nto their countries of origin. According to Dr. Hammond, of those 101 \ncountries, almost 40 percent are listed on the Open Doors World Watch \nlist of countries that severely restrict religious freedom. ``In other \nwords,'' Dr. Hammond concluded, ``over a third of those who were \nsubjected to expedited removal from the U.S. were being sent back to \ncountries which are known to persecute Christians'' and other religious \nminorities.\n  I believe that the future of American immigration policy towards \nasylees is promising. In his July 18 confirmation hearing to serve as \nINS Commissioner, James Ziglar committed to changing INS policy \nregarding asylum seekers. He said, ``I definitely think that we need to \nchange the process where asylum-seekers come here, to make sure that we \nknow who these people are and what their claims are and whether they're \nlegitimate before we turn around and put them on a plan back to\n\n[[Page S8722]]\n\nan uncertain future.'' Mr. Ziglar continued that, ``I am not one who \nparticularly likes the idea in general of people being detained, unless \nthey have been convicted of a crime, or unless they create some kind of \ndanger to the community. So, my inclination in general is not to detain \npeople unless there is some kind of valid reason, subject to all the \ndue process requirements.'' Passage of the Refugee Protection Act, \ncombined with fair and humane enforcement by an INS committed to the \nprotection of refugees, will ensure that our Nation once again fully \nlives up to the dreams of the immigrants who built this great nation as \na refuge of freedom and justice.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I am honored to join Senator Leahy, \nSenator Brownback, and other colleagues, in introducing the ``Refugee \nProtection Act of 2001.'' Our goal is to protect courageous persons who \narrive on our shores seeking asylum, provide alternatives to detention \nfor asylum seekers, and improve detention conditions for all persons \ndetained by the INS. The bill also eliminates the arbitrary one-year \ndeadline on filing for asylum, and eliminates the cap on the number of \npersons granted asylum who can adjust their status to lawful permanent \nresident.\n  Every day people are forced to leave their native lands in \ndesperation, fearing for their lives and for the lives of their loved \nones. Many of them arrive in the United States seeking asylum, and we \nhave a responsibility to ensure they are able to request it in a fair \nand efficient manner.\n  In 1996, Congress enacted harsh immigration laws that included an \nexpedited removal process granting INS inspection officers broad \nauthority to summarily remove potential asylum seekers if they arrive \nwithout proper papers. This process also requires persons seeking \nasylum to specifically state their fear of persecution or their intent \nto apply for asylum immediately upon arriving in the U.S. But asylum \nseekers are often traumatized, and are unable to speak to a stranger \nabout their harrowing experience. This is particularly true when they \nfirst arrive in the U.S., often after a long and difficult journey.\n  Many asylum seekers are unable to articulate their fears, especially \nto government officials whom they may view with distrust because of \npast experience in their home countries. Many of them speak very \nlittle, if any, English, and adequate translators are often not \navailable to assist them in making their asylum claims.\n  Legal representation is not permitted at the initial and most \ncritical phase of the expedited removal process, thereby increasing the \nlikelihood that individuals actually eligible for asylum will be turned \naway and sent back to their native lands to face additional \npersecution. The law contains no opportunity for judicial appeal of \ndecisions on summary removal. Instead, low-level INS employees have \nbroad, unchecked authority to issue final and binding deportation \norders.\n  Some argue that the expedited removal process is appropriate. Their \nview is based on the false assumption that the process, in practice, \nfollows the procedures in the regulations. In particular, the \nregulations require a careful interview and the taking of a systematic \nsworn statement, a process that should take several hours. The officer \nconducting the interview must begin by reading a set of specific \nadvisories, including an express notice that persons who fear \npersecution in their native lands may claim asylum in the U.S.\n  The interviewing officer must also ask specific questions about \nwhether the person has ``any fear or concern'' about return to their \nhomeland. And if the person faces charges, the charges must be \nexplained orally, in a language the individual understands. The \nregulations also require review of the file and approval of any removal \nor deportation order by a high-level supervisor before an expedited \nremoval order is considered final.\n  It is clear that these regulations are not adequately followed in \npractice. Members of my staff have observed first-hand the unfair \nprocess. During a visit to JFK International Airport, my staff toured \nthe area where inspection interviews were held and spoke with INS \nemployees. The interviews were conducted side-by-side in a large, open \nroom, affording no privacy to persons who had to share very personal \nand painful information with government officials.\n  My staff met with an inspector, who was informed that he would be \nmeeting with congressional staff. The inspector told the staff about \nthe ``cockamamie stories people make up'' and the phony documents they \npresent. Upon hearing these stories, he said that he puts people back \non a plane and sends them ``out of here.''\n  The inspector admitted that he did not read anyone any advisories to \ndetermine whether they were fearful. The inspector said that anyone who \nwants to apply for asylum would tell him about that immediately, and \nthose were the only people he referred to asylum officers for \ninterviews. He made this statement in spite of the fact that many \nasylum seekers do not ask for asylum. Our staff members, including the \nstaff from other members' offices, were appalled by these remarks and \nbehavior.\n  When a supervisor was asked whether the inspectors received training \nin asylum and interviewing techniques, the supervisor dismissed \ntraining as ``warm fuzzy stuff,'' even though many asylum seekers have \nfled persecution by people in uniforms and are reluctant to speak to \nuniformed INS officers.\n  Many immigration groups representing asylum seekers have shared \nsimilarly shocking stories. The expedited removal process has caused \ngreat hardships for many vulnerable individuals.\n  Recently, the Immigration Subcommittee held a hearing on asylum \npolicy. At the hearing, a young man from the Democratic Republic of \nCongo recounted the tragic circumstances that led to his escape. He \ndescribed being severely beaten and tortured by security forces, and \nthen witnessing his father's death at the hands of these forces. His \nmother and sisters fled the family home and he has not seen them since.\n  Upon his arrival in the U.S., he was placed in chains and taken to a \ndetention facility. Neither an interpreter nor a lawyer was present to \nassist him. Yet, the INS officer decided he did not have a credible \nfear of persecution and ordered his deportation. An immigration judge \nreviewed the case, but again the young man did not have an interpreter \nor lawyer to help him. When he was taken to the airport for \ndeportation, he pleaded with INS officials not to deport him. His pleas \nwere ignored and three detention guards carried him onto the plane. The \nairline employees subsequently asked the guards to take him off the \nplane and he was returned to the detention facility. Finally, the INS \nreversed its decision and decided his fear was credible, but only after \nthis young man begged not to be sent home for fear he would be killed. \nHis case vividly demonstrates the failure of some INS officials to \nfollow the procedures set forth in the regulations.\n  Congress must act to end these abuses. Our bill is intended to \naccomplish this goal. It limits expedited removal to immigration \nemergencies. It offers protection to persons arriving without proper \ndocuments, who will now be referred to an immigration judge to have \ntheir case reviewed, rather than have their fate determined by a low-\nlevel INS employee who has not been trained in asylum issues.\n  If an individual indicates an intention to apply for asylum or a \ncredible fear of persecution, the immigration officer must refer the \nindividual to an asylum officer for an interview. The bill limits the \nexisting broad authority of immigration officers and permits persons to \nseek review of their case by an asylum officer who is trained in \ndetermining whether a person's expression of fear is credible. The \nindividual must be given written information, in a language the \nindividual understands, about the consequences of his decisions, the \navailability of review of his case and his ability to have counsel. \nAfter the interview with the asylum officer, the individual may have \nthe case reviewed by an immigration judge. During this review, the \nindividual will have the opportunity to be heard and represented by \ncounsel, at no expense to the government.\n  Currently, asylum seekers who request asylum are often subject to \nmandatory detention. They are held in INS detention centers or state \nand county jails, often with criminal inmates, and\n\n[[Page S8723]]\n\noften for weeks, months or even years. They have little access to legal \nrepresentation, health care, or contact with family, friends or clergy \nwho can assist them. Such conditions are extremely traumatizing for \nthose who have already suffered so much.\n  Under our proposal, the general policy will be to parole asylum \nseekers who establish a credible fear of persecution, not place them in \nmandatory detention. Asylum seekers could be released to family, \nfriends or community groups who are ready to assist them. These \nalternatives to detention have been tested at various sites, and they \nare cost-effective and have been successful in achieving the goal of \nproviding a safe, compassionate residence, offering services, and \nincreasing compliance with INS procedures and court proceedings.\n  In addition, those persons who remain in INS detention must be kept \nsafe and treated humanely. I commend the INS for issuing detention \nstandards to accomplish this goal, but the guidelines are not binding. \nOur proposal would codify the most important guidelines to ensure that \nall persons in detention are safe and treated with dignity. The bill \nrequires that persons in detention have access to legal services, \nvisits by persons who are able to lend assistance in the preparation of \ntheir cases, and access to legal resources, telephones and religious \nservices. Other protections would be guaranteed by the legislation as \nwell.\n  Our bill also authorizes the establishment of group legal orientation \nprograms, to identify persons with meritorious claims for relief and \nrefer them to counsel at no cost to the government. These programs save \nthe government money by improving the efficiency of the judicial \nprocess and by reducing the need for prolonged detention. They educate \npersons about their rights, options and likelihood of success. The bill \nalso creates a national center to provide training for nonprofit \nagencies that offer such programs, to consult with nonprofit groups on \nprogram development and substantive legal issues, and to develop \nstandards for such programs.\n  Finally, our proposal deals with two other important concerns. In \n1996, Congress enacted a law requiring, for the first time, that \npersons seeking asylum must apply within a year of their arrival in the \nU.S. Since the enactment of this deadline, more than 10,000 asylum \nseekers have had their claims rejected by the INS. Many of these \nindividuals did not file their claims, because they were unfamiliar \nwith our legal system and did not know they are required to file a \ntimely application.\n  Asylum seekers should be able to apply for protection, regardless of \nwhen they file their claims. Our bill will eliminate the one-year \ndeadline, thereby preserving the ability of persons seeking refuge to \nbe granted safe haven without regard to the timing of their \napplication. This provision will offer much-needed protection to \npersons who have fled their home countries out of fear and terror.\n  Immigration law also currently places a cap of 10,000 on the number \nof persons granted asylum whose status can be adjusted to lawful \npermanent resident each fiscal year, regardless of the number of \npersons granted asylum in that year. Because the number of persons \ngranted asylum each year exceeds 10,000, the cap has created a large \nbacklog. The INS estimates that a backlog of 57,000 asylees is awaiting \nadjustment. This delay causes significant hardship to deserving \nindividuals and their families. Our bill will eliminate the arbitrary \ncap of 10,000 and permit eligible persons to adjust their status \nwithout waiting up to six years, as may occur under current law.\n  Clearly, we need to improve the treatment of those who arrive on our \nshores seeking asylum and awaiting adjudication of their claims and \nadjustment of their status. I urge my colleagues to support the Refugee \nProtection Act of 2001. It is a vital piece of legislation that is long \noverdue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 1312. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study of Virginia Key Beach, Florida, for possible \ninclusion in the National Park System; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I am proud to introduce the \nVirginia Key Beach Resource Study Bill. Congresswoman Carrie Meek has \nintroduced the companion to this legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives. This bill authorizes the Secretary of Interior to \nconduct a special resource study of Virginia Key Beach, FL, for \ninclusion in the National Park System.\n  Based solely on its natural attributes, Virginia Key is worthy of \ninclusion. Situated just off the mainland of the City of Miami, between \nKey Biscayne to the south and Fisher Island to the north, Virginia Key \nis a 1,000-acre barrier island, characterized by a unique and sensitive \nnatural environment. The island is non-residential and includes ponds \nand waterways, a tropical hardwood hammock and a large wildlife \nconservation area.\n  Virginia Key Beach deserves national distinction for another reason. \nIts unique history teaches us about our Nation's progress toward \nachieving racial justice. For decades in South Florida, beaches were \nsegregated by race. As the only beach in Miami that permitted blacks \nfrom the 1940s to the 1960s, Virginia Key was a source of seaside \nrecreation for countless African- American families. Virginia Key also \nwas the site for many baptisms and religious services. Thus, Virginia \nKey's value to our Nation, and to Florida, should be recognized both \nfor its natural beauty and its role in the Nation's ongoing struggle \nfor equality and social justice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1313. A bill to provide for the adjustment of status of certain \nforeign agricultural workers, to amend the Immigration and Nationality \nAct to reform the H-2A worker program under that Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin introducing the ``H-2A Reform and Agricultural Worker Adjustment Act \nof 2001.''\n  The Nation needs and deserves an agricultural policy that protects \nfarm workers, provides hard-working foreign-born workers with the \nopportunity to become legal permanent residents, and provides the \ngrowers of fruits, vegetables and other commodities with an adequate \nand legal labor supply. Our bill works toward achieving this goal. It \nestablishes a legalization program for foreign-born farm workers, \nguarantees certain labor protections for all farm workers, and improves \nwages and working conditions.\n  We cannot continue to ignore the fact that large numbers of the \npersons employed in agriculture today are undocumented. Illegal workers \nare at the mercy of unscrupulous employers, who can get away with \npaying them very low wages, exposing them to dangerous working \nconditions, lowering the wages for all farm workers.\n  Agricultural workers are indispensable members of the workforce. We \nneed an agricultural policy that recognizes their contributions and \nrewards their work. Under our bill, 500,000 farm workers currently \nworking in the United States, without employment authorization, would \nbe able to adjust their status to legal permanent resident. Persons who \nwork in agriculture for at least 90 days would be able to obtain \ntemporary residency status and would be able to adjust their status to \nlegal permanent residency after working 90 days in three out of the \nnext four years in agriculture. Because agricultural work is seasonal \nand varies throughout the United States, workers would be permitted to \nchange employers and accept non-agricultural work to supplement their \nincomes during this period.\n  These changes will benefit both workers and growers. It will benefit \nall farm workers by improving wages and working conditions. It will \nprovide a means for foreign-born workers to become permanent residents. \nBy obtaining legal status, workers will no longer be forced to endure \nsubstandard wages and working conditions for fear of being deported.\n  Agriculture is a time-sensitive industry. Growers must have an \nimmediate, reliable and legal workforce at harvest time. Everyone is \nharmed when crops rot in the field for lack of a labor force. By these \nchanges, growers will have access to dependable, hard-working employees \nand a workforce that will not be suddenly reduced by INS raids.\n\n[[Page S8724]]\n\n  Our bill also keeps families together. Immediate family members would \nbe granted legal status at the beginning, and they would be eligible \nfor adjustment to permanent resident status after the worker completes \nthe work requirement. This change will keep hard-working persons and \ntheir families together.\n  Our proposal also offers labor protections to agricultural workers \nthat are long overdue. For example, farm workers could not be fired \nfrom agricultural employment except for just cause, and they would \nreceive credit for any day lost because of on-the-job injuries.\n  Agriculture is a thriving industry, generating billions of dollars in \nrevenue each year. Yet farm workers are among the lowest-paid members \nof the workforce. Three-quarters of all farm workers earn less than \n$10,000 a year. Over three-fifths of farm worker households live in \npoverty. Only half of farm workers own a car, and even fewer own a home \nor even a trailer. To improve the wages and working conditions of all \nagricultural workers, we must give them the basic labor rights \navailable to other U.S. workers.\n  Central to our bill is the belief that collective bargaining provides \nthe best way to improve wages and working conditions, and stabilize the \nagricultural labor market. The bill creates a Federal right for farm \nworkers to organize, provides incentives for H-2A employers to accept \ncollective bargaining, establishes a streamlined application process \nfor employers with collective bargaining agreements, and exempts H-2A \nemployers with such agreements from increased H-2A user fees. The bill \nalso prohibits the use of H-2A workers as strikebreakers. These \nprocedures will secure improved wages and working conditions for all \nagricultural workers, and protect workers from unfair wages by \nmaintaining wage standards.\n  The bill ends discrimination against H-2A workers by giving them, for \nthe first time, the same labor protections as U.S. workers. It gives \nguest workers the same labor rights as U.S. workers, by ending the \nunfair exclusion of H-2A workers from coverage under the Migrant and \nSeasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act. Coverage under that Act \nmeans that H-2A workers will have the right to bring a private action \nto enforce working arrangements with their employers, rather than \ndepend on the Department of Labor to protect their rights.\n  The bill also protects U.S. workers by removing the incentive to \ndiscriminate against them by requiring the employers of H-2A workers to \npay the equivalent FICA and FUTA taxes to a new fund. The money from \nthe fund will be used to improve labor management practices to enhance \nthe productivity of the existing labor force and to support \ndemonstration projects to improve farm labor management, including \nprojects on recruitment, workplace literacy and training, health and \nsafety, and the development of labor-saving technology.\n  Last year, bipartisan negotiations between the House and Senate \nresulted in an agreement on migrant agricultural workers that both the \nagricultural employers and the farm workers supported. The compromise \ncreated an earned adjustment program for undocumented farm workers and \na reformed H-2A temporary worker program. This compromise represented a \npositive step toward much needed reform. Unfortunately, efforts to \nenact this agreement failed but I hope we will succeed in this \nCongress.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the H-2A Reform and Agricultural \nWorker Adjustment Act of 2001. These reforms are long overdue, and will \nimprove the lives and working conditions of dedicated, hard-working \nfarm workers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1315. A bill to make improvements in title 18, United States Code, \nand safeguard the integrity of the criminal justice system; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce today, with my \ngood friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, the Judicial Improvement and \nIntegrity Act of 2001. I would like to thank Senator Hatch for his co-\nsponsorship of this measure. This effort builds on other legislation \nthat Senator Hatch and I have worked on together to improve the \ncriminal justice system, including, in this Congress alone, the Drug \nAbuse Education, Prevention and Treatment Act, S. 304, and the \nChildren's Confinement Conditions Improvement Act, S. 1174.\n  This bill would improve the criminal code and safeguard the integrity \nof the judicial system. It would protect witnesses who come forward to \nprovide information on criminal activity to law enforcement officials; \neliminate a loophole in the criminal contempt statute that allows some \ndefendants to avoid serving prison sentences imposed by the Court; \neliminate a loophole in the statute of limitations that makes some \ndefendants immune from further prosecution if they get their plea \nagreements vacated; grant the government the clear right to appeal the \ndismissal of a part of a count of an indictment, such as a predicate \nact in a RICO count; insure that courts may impose appropriate terms of \nsupervised release in drug cases; give the District Courts greater \nflexibility in fashioning appropriate conditions of release for certain \nelderly prisoners; and clarify the District Court's authority to revoke \nor modify a term of supervised release when the defendant willfully \nviolates the obligation to pay restitution to the victims of the \ndefendant's crime.\n  Section two of the bill would amend title 18, United States Code, \nSection 1512, which prohibits attempts to tamper with witnesses, \nvictims and informants. The statute currently provides that, if the \noffense involves murder or attempted murder, the maximum sentence is 20 \nyears. If the defendant uses intimidation, physical force, threats or \ncorrupt persuasion, the maximum is 10 years. The bill would increase \nthe statutory maximum sentence for offenses involving the use or \nattempted use of physical force to 20 years. This change recognizes \nthat the use or attempted use of physical force to tamper with a \nwitness is closely related to attempted murder and that this fact \nshould be reflected in the applicable penalty. For example, if the \ndefendant severely beats the witness, causing serious bodily injury, \nthe offense is arguably as serious as attempted murder, even if the \ngovernment cannot prove that the defendant intended to kill the \nwitness. It is therefore appropriate that the defendant face a \npotential 20-year sentence. The bill would also add a conspiracy \nprovision that would make the maximum penalty for conspiring to tamper \nwith a witness in violation of section 1512 or to retaliate against a \nwitness in violation of title 18, United States Code, Section 1513 the \nsame as that for the underlying substantive offense that was the object \nof the conspiracy. A similar provision was part of the Hatch-Leahy \nJuvenile Justice legislation, S. 254, which passed the Senate in 1999 \nbut did not emerge from Conference.\n  The third section of the bill would close a loophole in title 18, \nUnited States Code, section 401, which contains penalties for criminal \ncontempt of court. This statute provides that a court may punish \ncontempt by a fine ``or'' imprisonment. Courts have held that this \nlanguage permits the imposition of either a fine or a term of \nimprisonment, but not both. This limitation on sentencing is highly \nunusual, since virtually all criminal statutes permit both a fine and \nimprisonment. More importantly, it creates the potential for an \nenormous, unjust windfall for defendants in cases where the court fails \nto notice the peculiar language of the statute and mistakenly imposes \nboth a fine and imprisonment. In such cases, the defendant can simply \npay the fine and then appeal the prison sentence as illegal. \nSurprisingly, courts have held that, once the fine is paid, the case \ncan no longer be remanded to the district court to have the sentence \ncorrected because the defendant has served the sentence. Thus, the only \noption is to vacate the prison term and set defendant free. See In re \nBradley, 318 U.S. 50 (1943). Courts have continued to follow this rule \neven after the passage of title 18, United States Code, section 3551(b) \nas part of the Sentencing Reform Act, which generally permits a court \nto impose a fine in addition to any other sentence. See United States \nv. Versaglio, 85 F.3d 943, 946-47 (2d Cir. 1996); United States v. \nHolloway, 991 F.2d 370, 373 (7th Cir. 1993).\n\n  It is time for Congress to correct this recurring problem. It is \nunjust to permit a defendant to go free without any\n\n[[Page S8725]]\n\nserving time in prison simply because the judge made an obvious and \neasily-correctable mistake in imposing sentence. Moreover, there is no \ngood reason to limit courts to only one sentencing option in criminal \ncontempt cases. Allowing the imposition of both a fine and imprisonment \nshould not result in harsher sentences; if anything, defendants may \nbenefit because courts may choose to impose a fine and a shorter prison \nsentence instead of a longer prison sentence. The second section of our \nbill would therefore amend section 401 to allow the court to impose \nboth a fine and imprisonment for criminal contempt. It would make \nsimilar changes on a handful of other statutes that contain language \nsimilar to section 401: sections 1705, 1916, 2234, and 2235, of title \n18 and in section 636 of title 28 of the United States Code.\n  The fourth section of the bill would add a new provision extending \nthe statute of limitations for counts that are dismissed pursuant to a \nplea bargain. This would also close a loophole that exists under \ncurrent law, which is illustrated by United States v. Podde, 105 F.3d \n813 (2d Cir. 1995). In that case, a defendant who was charged with \nfraud pled guilty to a lesser offense pursuant to a plea agreement, and \nthe fraud charges were dismissed. Later, however, the defendant was \nable to get his guilty plea set aside based upon a new Supreme Court \ndecision. The district court then granted the government's motion to \nreinstate the original fraud charges, and the defendant went to trial \nand was convicted. On appeal, however, the court of appeals vacated the \ndefendant's conviction based upon the statute of limitations. The court \nruled that the fraud indictment could not be reinstated because the \nstatute of limitations for the fraud charges had expired before the \ndefendant's guilty plea was vacated. The Third Circuit reached the same \nresult on similar facts in United States v. Midgley, 142 F.3d 174, 178-\n80 (3d Cir. 1998). Under these decisions, the defendants could no \nlonger be prosecuted for any offense, even though the government had \nbrought the case within the limitations period and pursued it \ndiligently. Our provision would prevent such unjust results in the \nfuture by allowing the government 60 days to move to reinstate the \ndismissed counts after the order vacating the defendant's guilty plea \nbecomes final. This approach is similar to that of 18 U.S.C. Sec.  \n3288, which gives the government a grace period to obtain a new \nindictment where counts are dismissed after the statute of limitations \nhas expired.\n  The fifth section of the bill would amend title 18, United States \nCode, section 3731, which permits the United States to appeal certain \norders of the District Court to the appropriate Court of Appeals. It \nwould clarify that the government is allowed to appeal the dismissal of \na part of a count, such as an overt act in a conspiracy count or a \npredicate act in a RICO count. This approach is consistent with the \nSupreme Court's observation that section 3731 permits ``an appeal from \nan order dismissing only a portion of a count.'' Sanabria v. United \nStates, 437 U.S. 54, 69 n.23 (1978). The majority of Federal circuits \nalready interpret section 3731 to permit this where the portion of the \ncount that is dismissed could itself constitute a ``discrete basis of \nliability.'' See United States v. Mobley, 193 F.3d 492, 495, 7th Cir. \n1999; United States v. Levasseur, 846 F.2d 786, 1st Cir. 1988. However, \none federal circuit has held that section 3731 does not permit any \ngovernment appeal from the dismissal of only part of a count. See \nUnited States v. Louisiana Pacific Corporation, 106 F.3d 345, 10th Cir. \n1997. In other cases, appellate review of orders dismissing predicate \nacts or overt acts has been denied where the dismissed acts could not \nthemselves have been charged in separate counts. See United States v. \nTerry, 5 F.3d 874, 5th Cir. 1993; United States v. Tom, 787 F.2d 65, 2d \nCir. 1986. It is time to resolve these conflicting results \ndefinitively. The reach of section 3731 should clearly be extended to \norders dismissing portions of counts. In some cases, the dismissal of \nan overt act or a predicate act may significantly impair the \ngovernment's ability to prove its case. Defendants, of course, may get \nappellate review of the denial of a motion to dismiss part of a count \nafter the trial if they are convicted. The government should also be \nable to appeal when such motions are granted, and it has no way of \ndoing so other than through section 3731.\n  Section six of the bill would resolve a conflict in the circuits as \nto the permissible length of supervised release in controlled \nsubstances cases. Under 18 U.S.C. 3583(b), ``[e]xcept as otherwise \nprovided,'' the maximum authorized terms of supervised release are 5 \nyears for Class A and B felonies, 3 years for Class C and D felonies, \nand 1 year for Class E felonies and certain misdemeanors. The drug \ntrafficking offenses in 21 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  841 and 960 prescribe \nspecial supervised release terms, however, that are longer than those \napplicable generally under section 3583(b). Those longer terms, which \nmay include lifetime supervised release, were enacted in 1986 in the \nsame Act that inserted the introductory phrase ``Except as otherwise \nprovided'' in section 3583(b). Because of this clear legislative \nhistory and intent, three courts of appeals have held that section \n3583(b) does not limit the length of supervised release that may be \nimposed for a violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  841 or 960 when a \ngreater term is there provided. United States v. LeMay, 952 F.2d 995, \n998 (8th Cir. 1991); United States v. Eng, 14 F.3d 165, 172-3 (2d Cir. \n1994); United States v. Garcia, 112 F.3d 395 (9th Cir. 1997). Two \ncourts of appeals, however, have reached the opposite result, holding \nthat the length of a supervised release term that can be imposed for \ncontrolled substance cases is limited by 18 U.S.C. 3583(b). United \nStates v. Gracia, 983 F.2d 625, 630 (5th Cir. 1993); United States v. \nKelly, 974 F.2d 22, 24-5 (5th Cir. 1992); United States v. Good, 25 \nF.3d 218 (4th Cir. 1994). Although the issue has not arisen with \nfrequency, the conflict is entrenched and should be dealt with \ndefinitively. Accordingly, the amendment would add the words \n``Notwithstanding section 3583 of title 18'' to the title 21 controlled \nsubstance offenses in the parts of those statutes dealing with \nsupervised release to make clear that the longer terms there prescribed \ncontrol over the general provision in section 3583.\n\n  Section seven of the bill would confer express authority on District \nCourts under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3582(c)(1)(A), when exercising the power \nto reduce a term of imprisonment for extraordinary and compelling \nreasons, to impose a sentence of probation or supervised release with \nor without conditions. Such added flexibility is consistent with the \npurposes for which this statute was designed and will likely facilitate \nits use in appropriate cases. Under section 3582(c)(l)(A), a court is \nauthorized, on motion of the Bureau of Prisons and consistent with the \npurposes of sentencing in 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3553, to ``reduce the term of \nimprisonment'' upon a finding that ``extraordinary and compelling \nreasons'' warrant such a reduction. This limited authority has been \ngenerally utilized when a defendant sentenced to imprisonment becomes \nterminally ill or develops a permanently incapacitating illness not \npresent at the time of sentencing. In such circumstances, the situation \nof a prisoner (e.g., one suffering from a contagious debilitating \ndisease), may make a court reluctant simply to release the prisoner \nback into society unless another sentencing option such as home \nconfinement as a condition of supervised release or probation can be \nimposed. Presently, however, it is doubtful whether a court can order \nsuch a sentence since section 3582(c)(1)(A) speaks only in terms of \nreducing ``the term of imprisonment,'' not imposing in its stead a \nlesser type of sentence. Compare Fed. R. Crim. P 35(b), which gives a \ncourt the power to ``reduce a sentence'' to reflect substantial \nassistance.\n  Finally, section eight would remedy a statutory ambiguity relating to \nrestitution as a condition of supervised release. Under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  \n3583(c) and (e), the court is authorized to consider various sentencing \nfactors set forth in 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3553 as a basis for imposing \nrestitution as a condition of supervised release or for revoking or \nmodifying the conditions of supervised release. Supervised release is \namong the purposes of sentencing enumerated in section 3553, in \nparagraph (a)(7), but is not among the factors enumerated in section \n3583(c) and (e). However, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3583(c) also authorizes the \ncourt to impose any condition of supervised release that is an \nauthorized condition of probation under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3563(b), and \nmaking restitution is among those conditions (see section 3564(b)(2)). \nThus, it\n\n[[Page S8726]]\n\nappears clear that a court has authority to impose a restitution \ncondition upon a term of supervised release. See, e.g., United States \nv. Payan, 992 F.2d 1387, 1395-96 (5th Cir. 1993). But the absence of a \nreference to section 3553(a)(7) in the revocation subsection of section \n3583 raises a question whether, even though it is an authorized \ncondition of supervised release, a court has authority to revoke or \nmodify the term for the willful failure to make restitution. This \namendment would provide a reference to section 3553(a)(7) in the \nsupervised release statute and remove any ambiguity in this regard. Of \ncourse, even under the amended statute, a court could not revoke or \nmodify the defendant's supervised release for failure to pay \nrestitution unless the defendant had the resources to pay and willfully \nrefused to do so. See Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983); Payan, \n992 F.2d at 1396-97.\n  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce this legislation \nalong with Senator Hatch, and I urge its swift enactment into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1318. A bill to provide Coastal Impact Assistance to State and \nlocal governments, to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act \nAmendments of 1978, the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, \nthe Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act, and the Federal Aid in \nWildlife Restoration Act (commonly referred to as the Pittman-Robertson \nAct) to establish a fund to meet the outdoor conservation and \nrecreation needs of the American people, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise today, to introduce the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act of 2001. The bill is identical to a \nbill I introduced at the start of the 106th Congress. This important \nlegislation remedies a tremendous inequity in the distribution of \nrevenues generated by offshore oil and gas production. It allocates a \nportion of those moneys to the coastal States and communities who \nshoulder the responsibility for energy development activity off their \ncoastlines. It also provides a secure funding source for state \nrecreation and wildlife conservation programs.\n  By reinvesting revenues from offshore oil and gas production into a \nvariety of important conservation, recreation and environmental \nprograms, this bill will rededicate the Federal Government to a \npartnership with state and local governments to meet the demands of all \nAmericans for outdoor experiences. In addition, it reaffirms the \noriginal promise of the Land Water Conservation Fund that a portion of \nthe revenues obtained by the Federal Government from the development of \nour natural resources would be reinvested into the outdoor recreation \nand natural resource estate of the Nation.\n  Like last Congress, this bill is the start of a process. As many of \nus in this chamber remember, consideration of OCS revenue sharing \nlegislation during the 106th Congress resulted in an outcome none of us \ncould have anticipated, the creation of a 6 year budget category that \ndedicates appropriated funds for a variety of conservation programs. \nEnactment of the Conservation Spending Category was one of the great \nbipartisan achievements of the 106th Congress and was an important step \nin providing annual funding for a number of programs that protect our \nnation's natural and cultural legacy.\n  However, coastal impact assistance was not included. While the \ncoastal States that support offshore oil and gas activities received \nsome funding last year, they were specifically excluded from the \nConservation Spending Category and no money has been appropriated this \nCongress.\n  This bill directs that 27 percent of the revenues generated from oil \nand natural gas production on the Outer Continental Shelf, or OCS, be \nreturned to coastal States and communities. Offshore oil and gas \nproduction generates over $4 billion in revenues annually for the U.S. \nTreasury. Yet, unlike mineral receipts from onshore Federal lands, OCS \noil and gas revenues are not directly returned to the States in which \nproduction occurs and which bear the burdens of such activity.\n  This legislation remedies this disparity. States and communities that \nbear the responsibilities for and costs associated with offshore oil \nand gas production will finally receive some assistance from the \nrevenues generated by this federal activity. This legislation would \nshare revenues generated by OCS oil and gas activities with counties, \nparishes and boroughs, the local government entities most directly \naffected, and State governments.\n  The bill also acknowledges that all coastal States, including those \nStates bordering the Great Lakes, have unique needs. It directs that a \nportion of OCS revenues be shared with these States, even if no OCS \nproduction occurs off their coasts. Coastal States and communities can \nuse OCS Impact Assistance funds on everything from environmental \nprograms, to coastal and marine conservation efforts, to new \ninfrastructure requirements.\n  This is a true investment in the future. This money will be used, \nday-in and day-out, to improve the quality of life of coastal State \nresidents.\n  Let me also remind everyone that OCS production only occurs off the \ncoasts of 6 States, yet the bill shares OCS revenues with 34 States. \nThere are 28 coastal States that will get a share of OCS revenues which \nhave no OCS production. In fact, in all areas except the Gulf of Mexico \nand Alaska there is a moratorium prohibiting any new OCS production.\n  The OCS accounts for 24 percent of this Nation's natural gas \nproduction and 14 percent of its oil production. We need to ensure that \nthe OCS continues to meet our future domestic energy needs. I firmly \nbelieve that the Federal Government needs to do all it can to pursue \nand encourage further technological advances in OCS exploration and \nproduction. These technological achievements will continue to result in \nnew OCS production having an unparalleled record of excellence on \nenvironmental and safety issues. Additional technological advances will \nfurther improve resource recovery and will increase revenues to the \nTreasury for the benefit of all Americans who enjoy programs funded by \nOCS money.\n  I will do all I can to ensure a healthy OCS program, including new \nOCS development in the Arctic. A number of challenges face new \ndevelopments in this area, I am confident that we can work through them \nall. History has shown us that in the Arctic, and in other OCS areas, \ndevelopment and the environmental protection are compatible.\n  This bill also takes a portion of the revenues received by the \nFederal Government from OCS development and invests it in conservation \nand wildlife programs. Thus, Titles II and III of the bill share OCS \nrevenues will ALL States for these purposes. Title II of this bill \nprovides a secure source of funding for the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, LWCF. The LWCF was established over three decades ago to provide \nFederal money for State and Federal land acquisition and help meet \nrecreation needs. Title III of this bill provides funding for State \nfish and wildlife conservation programs. The money would be distributed \nthrough the Pittman-Robertson program administered by the United States \nFish and Wildlife Service. This money could be used for both game and \nnon-game wildlife. With the inclusion of OCS revenues, the amount of \nmoney available for state fish and game programs would nearly double. \nStates will be able to use these moneys to increase fish and wildlife \npopulations and improve fish and wildlife habitat.\n  This bill is not perfect but it is a step to ensuring not only that \nCoastal States have money to address the effects of OCS-activities but \nthat all States have funds necessary to provide outdoor recreation and \nconservation resources for all of us to enjoy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1319. A bill to authorize appropriations for the Department of \nJustice for fiscal year 2002, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce the 21st \nCentury Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act. I thank \nSenator Hatch, the Ranking Republican Member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, for his hard work and support of this legislation.\n  The last time Congress properly authorized spending for the entire \nDepartment of Justice, ``DOJ'' or the\n\n[[Page S8727]]\n\n``Department'', was in 1979. Congress extended that authorization in \n1980 and 1981. Since then, Congress has not passed nor has the \nPresident signed an authorization bill for the Department. In fact, \nthere are a number of years where Congress failed to consider any \nDepartment authorization bill. This 21-year failure to properly \nreauthorize the Department has forced the appropriations committees in \nboth houses to reauthorize and appropriate money.\n  We have ceded the authorization power to the appropriators for too \nlong. Our bipartisan legislation is an attempt to reaffirm the \nauthorizing authority and responsibility of the House and Senate \nJudiciary Committees. I commend Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking \nMember Conyers of the House Judiciary Committee for working in a \nbipartisan manner to pass similar legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The ``21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization \nAct,'' is a comprehensive authorization of the Department based on H.R. \n2215 as passed by the House of Representatives on July 23, 2001. Our \nbipartisan legislation contains four titles which authorize \nappropriations for the Department for fiscal year 2002, provide \npermanent enabling authorities which will allow the Department to \nefficiently carry out its mission, clarify and harmonize existing \nstatutory authority, and repeal obsolete statutory authorities. The \nbill establishes certain reporting requirements and other mechanisms, \nsuch as DOJ Inspector General authority to investigate allegations of \nmisconduct by employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), \nintended to better enable the Congress and the Department to oversee \nthe operations of the Department. Finally, the bill creates a separate \nViolence Against Women Office to combat domestic violence.\n  Title I authorizes appropriations for the major components of the \nDepartment for fiscal year 2002. The authorization mirrors the \nPresident's request regarding the Department except in two areas. \nFirst, the bill increased the President's request for the DOJ Inspector \nGeneral by $10 million. This is necessary because the Committee is \nconcerned about the severe downsizing of that office and the need for \noversight, particularly of the FBI, at the Department. Second, the bill \nauthorizes at least $10 million for the investigation and prosecution \nof intellectual property crimes, including software counterfeiting \ncrimes and crimes identified in the No Electronic Theft, NET, Act, \nPublic Law 105-147. The American copyright industry is the largest \nexporter of goods from the United States, employing more than 7 million \nAmericans, and these additional funds are needed to strengthen the \nresources available to DOJ and the FBI to investigate and prosecute \ncyberpiracy.\n\n  The bill does not contain an authorization for appropriations for \nseveral unauthorized grant programs. Senator Hatch and I have decided \nto review each of these expired programs and authorize them as needed.\n  In addition, Title I authorizes $9 million in FY 2002 to add an \nadditional Assistant United States Attorney in each of the 94 U.S. \nAttorney Offices to implement part of the Administration's Project Safe \nNeighborhoods proposal to reduce school gun violence across the nation. \nThese prosecutors will assist in targeting juveniles who obtain weapons \nand commit violent crimes, as well as the adults who place firearms in \nthe hands of juveniles.\n  Title II permanently establishes a clear set of authorities that the \nDepartment may rely on to use appropriated funds, including \nestablishing permitted uses of appropriated funds by the Attorney \nGeneral for Fees and Expenses of Witnesses, the FBI, the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service, the Federal Prison System, and the \nDetention Trustee. Title II also establishes new reporting requirements \nwhich are intended to enhance Congressional oversight of the \nDepartment, including new reporting requirements for information about \nthe enforcement of existing laws, for information regarding the Office \nof Justice Programs, OJP, and the submission of other reports, required \nby existing law, to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Section \n206(e) expands an existing reporting requirement regarding copyright \ninfringement cases. Title II also establishes a counterterrorism fund \nand provides the Attorney General with additional authority to \nstrengthen law enforcement operations.\n  Title III repeals outdated and open-ended statutes, requires the \nsubmission of an annual authorization bill to the House and Senate \nJudiciary Committees, and provides states with flexibility to use \nexisting Truth-In-Sentencing and Violent Offender Incarceration Grants \nto account for juveniles being housed in adult prison facilities. Title \nIII requires the Department to submit to Congress studies on untested \nrape examination kits, and the allocation of funds, personnel, and \nworkloads for each office of U.S. Attorney and each division of the \nDepartment.\n  Section 305 requires the Attorney General and Director of the FBI to \nprovide the House and Senate Judiciary Committees with a detailed \nreport on the use of DCS 1000, also known as Carnivore, and other \nsimilar Internet surveillance systems. Many have raised legitimate \nprivacy concerns with Carnivore. Congress needs to know the facts about \nCarnivore to find a way to balance the needs of law enforcement \ninvestigators with the privacy interests of all Americans.\n  In addition, Title III provides new oversight and reporting \nrequirements for the FBI and other activities conducted by the Justice \nDepartment. Specifically, section 308 codifies the Attorney General's \norder of July 11, 2001, which revised Department of Justice's \nregulations concerning the Inspector General. The section insures that \nthe Inspector General for the Department of Justice has the authority \nto decide whether a particular allegation of misconduct by Department \nof Justice personnel, including employees of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration, should be \ninvestigated by the Inspector General or by the internal affairs unit \nof the appropriate component of the Department of Justice.\n  Section 309 requires the Attorney General to submit a report and \nrecommendation to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary not \nlater than 90 days after enactment of this Act on whether there should \nbe established an office of Inspector General for the FBI or an office \nof Deputy Inspector General for the FBI that would be responsible for \nsupervising independent oversight of programs and operations of the \nFBI.\n  Title IV establishes a Violence Against Women Office (VAWO) within \nthe Justice Department. The VAWO is headed by a Director, who is \nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In addition, \nTitle IV enumerates duties and responsibilities of the Director, \nrequires the Attorney General to ensure VAWO is adequately staffed and \nauthorizes appropriations for the VAWO.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Hatch, Congressman \nSensenbrenner and Congressman Conyers to bring the important business \nof re-authorizing the Department back before the Senate and House \nJudiciary Committees. Clearly, regular reauthorization of the \nDepartment should be part and parcel of the Committees' traditional \nrole in overseeing the Department's activities. Swift passage into law \nof the ``21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations \nAuthorization Act'' will be a significant step toward restoring our \noversight role.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-\nsection analysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 1319\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Specific sums authorized to be appropriated\n       Section 101 authorizes appropriations to carry out the work \n     of the various components of the Department of Justice for \n     fiscal year 2002. The structure of Title I mirrors the \n     organization of the annual Commerce-Justice-State, CJS, \n     appropriations bill and the President's budget request. The \n     bill authorizes the appropriations of amounts requested by \n     the President in most accounts. The accounts, and the \n     activities and components that each would fund, are as \n     follows:\n       General Administration--$93,433,000--For the leadership \n     offices of the Department, including the offices of the \n     Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General, and the Justice \n     Management Division, Executive Support program, Intelligence \n     Policy, Office of Professional Responsibility, and General \n     Administration.\n       Administrative Review and Appeals--$178,499,000--For the \n     Executive Office for Immigration Review and the Office of the \n     Pardon Attorney.\n       Office of Inspector General--$55,000,000--For the \n     investigation of allegations of violations of criminal and \n     civil statutes, regulations, and ethical standards by \n     Department employees, and for the new position of Deputy \n     Inspector General to oversee the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation.

Oversight is a priority and \n     this level of funding should get the IG back on the path of \n     meeting the audit and oversight needs of the Department. The \n     Committee expects that the OIG will substantially increase \n     its oversight of the FBI, INS, and the Department's grant \n     programs.\n       General Legal Activities--$566,822,000--For the conduct of \n     the legal activities of the Department.

The transfer \n     authorization is discretionary to prevent ongoing litigation \n     from being adversely effected.\n     Section 103. Authorization of additional Assistant United \n         States Attorneys for Project Safe Neighborhoods\n       This section authorizes an additional Assistant United \n     States Attorney in each of the 94 U.S. Attorney Offices to \n     implement part of the Administration's Project Safe \n     Neighborhoods proposal to reduce school gun violence across \n     the nation. These prosecutors will assist in targeting \n     juveniles who obtain weapons and commit violent crimes, as \n     well as the adults who place firearms in the hands of \n     juveniles.\n\n                Title II--Permanent Enabling Provisions\n\n     Section 201. Permanent authority\n       Section 201 amends Chapter 31 of Title 28, United States \n     Code, by creating a new section, ``530C''. This section \n     details permitted uses of available funds by the Attorney \n     General to carry out the activities of the Justice \n     Department.

And reimbursement payments to \n     governmental units of the Department of Justice, other \n     Federal entities, or State or local governments are limited \n     to uses permitted by the authority permitting such \n     reimbursement payment.\n     Section 202. Permanent authority relating to the enforcement \n         of laws\n       Section 202 amends Chapter 31 of Title 28, United States \n     Code, by creating a new section, ``530D'' relating to \n     reporting on the enforcement of laws.

This section also makes several \n     clerical and technical amendments to title 28, United States \n     Code. In addition, this section adds authority to ensure that \n     no inference is created that the government is liable for \n     interest on certain retroactive payments made by the \n     Department of Justice and to improve financial systems and \n     debt-collection activities.\n     Section 206. Oversight; waste, fraud, and abuse of \n         appropriations\n       Section 206 amends Section 529 of Title 28, United States \n     Code, to require the Attorney General to submit an annual \n     report to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary \n     detailing: every grant, cooperative agreement, or \n     programmatic services contract that was made, entered into, \n     awarded, or extended in the immediately preceding fiscal year \n     by or on behalf of the Office of Justice Programs; and a \n     report on every grant, cooperative agreement, or programmatic \n     services contract made, entered into, awarded, or extended by \n     or on behalf of the Office of Justice Programs that was \n     terminated or that otherwise ended in the immediately \n     preceding fiscal year.\n       In addition, Section 206 amends the Anti-Lobbying Act to \n     expand its coverage to all legislative activity at the \n     federal and state level and establishes a new reporting \n     requirement on the enforcement and prosecution of copyright \n     infringements, along with a number of conforming amendments.\n     Section 207. Enforcement of the federal criminal laws by \n         Attorney General\n       Section 207 provides clarifying amendments to title 28, \n     United States Code, relating to the enforcement of federal \n     criminal law.\n     Section 208. Counterterrorism fund\n       Section 208 establishes a counterterrorism fund in the \n     Treasury of the United States, without effecting prior \n     appropriations, to reimburse Justice Department components \n     for any costs incurred in connection with:\n       1. reestablishing the operational capability of an office \n     or facility that has been damaged as the result of any \n     domestic or international terrorism incident;\n       2. providing support to counter, investigate, or prosecute \n     domestic or international terrorism, including paying rewards \n     in connection with these activities;\n       3. conducting terrorism threat assessments of Federal \n     agencies; and\n       4. for costs incurred in connection with detaining \n     individuals in foreign countries who are accused of acts of \n     terrorism in violation of United States law.\n     Section 209. Strengthening law enforcement in United States \n         Territories, Commonwealths, and Possessions.\n       Section 209 allows the payment of a retention bonus and \n     other extended assignment incentives to retain law \n     enforcement personnel in U.S. Territories, Commonwealths and \n     Possessions. This new authority is needed to continue the \n     fight against drug and crime problems in these areas.\n     Section 210. Additional authorities of the Attorney General.\n       Section 210 provides special ``danger pay'' allowances for \n     FBI agents in hazardous duty locations outside the United \n     States, as is provided for agents of the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration. The section also permits the FBI to enter \n     into cooperative projects with foreign countries to improve \n     law enforcement or intelligence operations and to charge a \n     fee for training of railroad police officers. In addition, \n     the section authorizes the Attorney General to seek \n     reimbursement of warranty work performed at Department of \n     Justice facilities. The Administration requested these \n     provisions in its budget submission for FY 2002.\n\n                        Title III--Miscellaneous\n\n     Section 301.

Authority of the Department of Justice Inspector \n         General.\n       Section 308 codifies the Attorney General's order of July \n     11, 2001, which revised Department of Justice's regulations \n     concerning the Inspector General. The section insures that \n     the Inspector General for the Department of Justice has the \n     authority to decide whether a particular allegation of \n     misconduct by Department of Justice personnel, including \n     employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration, should be investigated by the \n     Inspector General or by the internal affairs unit of the \n     appropriate component of the Department of Justice. \n     Consistent with the Attorney General's order, the one \n     exception is that allegations of misconduct that relate to \n     the exercise of an attorney's authority to investigate, \n     litigate, or provide legal advice should be referred to the \n     Office of Professional Responsibility of the Department of \n     Justice.\n     Section 309.

Short title.\n       Section 401 establishes the ``Violence Against Women Office \n     Act'' as the short title.\n     Section 402. Establishment of Violence Against Women Office.\n       Section 402 establishes a Violence Against Women Office, \n     VAWO, within the Department of Justice, headed by a \n     presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed Director. The \n     Director is vested with authority for all grants, cooperative \n     agreements, and contracts awarded by the VAWO. In addition, \n     the Director is prohibited from other employment during \n     service as Director or affiliation with organizations the may \n     create a conflict of interest.\n       This section enumerates the following duties of the \n     Director: 1. serving as special counsel to the Attorney \n     General on violence against women; 2. maintaining a liaison \n     with the judicial branches of Federal and State Governments; \n     3. providing information to the President, the Congress, the \n     judiciary, State and local government, and to the general \n     public; 4. serving as a representative of the Justice \n     Department on domestic task forces, committees, or \n     commissions; 5. serving as a representative of the United \n     States Government on human rights and economic justice \n     matters at international forums; 6. carrying out the \n     functions of the Justice Department under the Violence \n     Against Women Act of 1994 and other matters relating to \n     violence against women, including developing policy, the \n     development and management of grant and other programs, and \n     the award and termination of grants; 7. providing technical \n     assistance, coordination, support to other elements of the \n     Justice Department, other Federal, State, and Tribal \n     agencies, and to grantees; exercising other powers delegated \n     by the Attorney General or Assistant Attorney General; 8. and \n     establishing rules, regulations, guidelines and necessary \n     procedures to carry out the functions of VAWO.\n       This section requires the Attorney General to ensure that \n     VAWO receives adequate staff to support the Director in \n     carrying out the responsibilities of the VAWO Act.\n       This section also authorizes such sums as are necessary to \n     carry out the VAWO Act.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise in support of the 21st Century \nDepartment of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, which Senator \nLeahy and I have introduced today. Senator Leahy and I have been \nworking for several years to pass a Department of Justice \nreauthorization bill, and I can say that it is once again a major \npriority of the Judiciary Committee this session. I want to emphasize \nto my colleagues how important it is that the Senate consider and pass \nthis legislation to reauthorize the Department of Justice this year.\n  It is simply inexcusable that over two decades have lapsed since \nCongress has passed a general authorization bill for the Department of \nJustice. It is in my view a matter of significant concern when any \nmajor cabinet department goes for such a long period of time without \ncongressional reauthorization. Absence of reauthorization encourages \nadministrative drift and permits important policy decisions to be made \nad hoc through the adoption of appropriations bills or special purpose \nlegislation. Moreover, our failure to reauthorize has also placed the \nundue burden on the appropriations committees in both houses to act as \nboth authorizers and appropriators. This legislation will end the \npiecemeal funding of important programs and responsibilities which \naffect the day-to-day lives of all Americans.\n  The Department of Justice's main duty is to provide justice to all \nAmericans, certainly of central importance to our national life. It has \nthe primary responsibility for the enforcement of our Nation's laws. \nThrough its divisions and agencies including the FBI and DEA, it \ninvestigates and prosecutes violations of Federal criminal laws, \nprotects the civil rights of our citizens, enforces the antitrust laws, \nand represents every department and agency of the United States \ngovernment in litigation. Increasingly, its mission is international as \nwell, protecting the interests of the United States and its people from \ngrowing threats of trans-national crime and international terrorism. \nAdditionally, among the Department's key duties is providing much \nneeded assistance and advice to State and local law enforcement.\n  The vast importance of the Department's role is demonstrated by the \ngrowth of its budget in the last two decades. In FY 1979, the \nDepartment of Justice's budget was just $2.538 billion. In contrast, \nthe Department of Justice's budget now exceeds $24 billion and it \nemploys more than 125,000 people. Such a vast department requires \nCongress' full attention. Yet, it is fair to say that Congress has been \nless than vigilant in its job of overseeing the Department of Justice. \nLet me be clear that I am not advocating that we micro-manage the \nDepartment of Justice. I have full confidence in Attorney General \nAshcroft and the thousands of employees who competently manage the \nDepartment daily. However, we cannot continue to neglect our \nresponsibility to oversee closely this Department that so profoundly \naffects the lives of all Americans.\n  The authorizations contained in the 1979 reauthorization act, the \nlast Justice Department authorization bill that Congress passed, are \nhopelessly out of date and have been amended, patched, and tweaked by \nCongress every year since. The lack of a comprehensive authorization \nhas needlessly increased the administrative burden on the Department of \nJustice by causing them to perform operations inefficiently or to delay \nimplementation of programs until specific authorization is legislated. \nThis bill authorizes and consolidates a host of appropriations \nauthorities and makes them permanent. These authorities are essential \nto the administration of the Department of Justice and accomplishment \nof its mission.\n  I want to take a moment to highlight some of the more important \nprovisions of this bill. Title I of the bill authorizes appropriations \nfor the major components of the Department for FY 2002. Among these \nauthorizations are funding for the Drug Enforcement Administration to \ncombat the trafficking of illegal drugs, the Immigration and \nNationalization Service to enforce our country's immigration laws, and \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation to protect against cybercrime and \nterrorism. The authorization levels reflect the President's budget in \nall but two areas. First, the bill increases the President's request \nfor the Department's Inspector General by $10 million. This increase is \nwarranted because the IG's office has been cut severely over the last \nseveral years and the need for effective oversight, particularly over \nthe FBI, is essential. Second, the bill increases by $10 million the \nrequest for the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section within \nthe Department. With the number and severity of computer\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\ncrimes growing dramatically each year, this increase will enhance the \nDepartment's ability to investigate and prosecute computer related \ncrimes, such as software counterfeiting crimes and denial of service \nattacks.\n  Additionally, this bill codifies the Attorney General's recent order \nthat extended the authority of the Inspector General's Office to \noversee the programs and operations of the FBI and to investigate \nallegations of wrongdoing within the Bureau. The bill also directs the \nAttorney General to submit a report and recommendation to Congress to \ndetermine whether to establish an Office of Inspector General for the \nFBI or an office of Deputy Inspector General for the FBI, which would \nbe responsible for supervising independent oversight of the programs \nand operations of the FBI. While I am confident that the FBI's new \nDirector, Robert Mueller, has the knowledge and ability to correct some \nof the bureaucratic and managerial problems the FBI has experienced, I \nagree with the Attorney General that FBI should be subject to the \noversight of the IG. I look forward to the Attorney General's report, \nand I am sure it will provide guidance as to whether additional \nmeasures are warranted to ensure the effective operation of the Bureau.\n  Finally, the bill establishes a Violence Against Women Office, VAWO, \nwithin the Justice Department, which will be headed by a presidentially \nappointed and Senate confirmed Director. The bill enumerates the duties \nand responsibilities of the Director and requires the Attorney General \nto ensure that the Office is staffed adequately. The Director, in part, \nwill serve as a special counsel to the Attorney General on issues \nrelated to violence against women, provide information to the \nPresident, the Congress, State and local governments, and the general \npublic, and maintain a liaison with the judicial branches of federal \nand State governments. Establishing this office bespeaks our commitment \nto reducing violent crimes against women.\n  This bill is a step in the right direction. It will undoubtedly \nrevive Congress's role and interest in overseeing the Department of \nJustice. The Judiciary Committee has redoubled its efforts and plans to \nvote the Department of Justice reauthorization bill out of Committee \nsoon after we return from the August recess. It is a highly important \nand overdue piece of legislation that deserves our immediate attention, \nand I am confident that it will receive the support of my colleagues \nand be enacted this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 1320. a bill to change the date for regularly scheduled Federal \nelections and establish polling place hours; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, today I am introducing the Weekend Voting \nAct of 2001. This legislation will change the day for congressional and \npresidential elections from the first Tuesday in November to the first \nweekend in November. This legislation is virtually identical to \nlegislation that I first proposed in 1997 in the 105th Congress.\n  Earlier this week, the National Commission on Federal Election Reform \npresented its recommendations to the President on how to improve the \nadministration of elections in our country. These recommendations, \ncoming on the heels of the contested Presidential election of last \nyear, lay out some strong ideas for how we can strengthen our election \nsystem at a time when Congress may very well take action in this area. \nAs a cosponsor of election reform legislation, I am hopeful that we can \npass real election reform this year.\n  One of the recommendations the National Commission made to the \nPresident is that we move Election Day to a national holiday, in \nparticular Veterans Day. As might have been expected, this proposal has \nnot been well received by veterans groups who rightly consider this a \ndiminishment of their service and the day that historically has been \ndesignated to honor that service. While I agree with the Commission's \ngoal of moving election day to a non-working day, I believe we can \nachieve all the benefits of holiday voting without offending our \nveterans by moving our elections to the weekend.\n  My proposal for weekend voting would call for the polls to be open \nthe same hours across the continental United States, addressing the \nchallenge of keeping results on one side of the country, or even a \nState, from influencing voting in places where polls are still open. \nMoving elections to the weekend will expand the pool of buildings \navailable for poling stations and people available to work at the \npolls, addressing the critical shortage of poll workers. Weekend voting \nalso has the potential to increase voter turnout by giving all voters \nample opportunity to get to the polls without creating a national \nholiday.\n  Under this bill, polls would be open nationwide for a uniform period \nof time from Saturday, 6 p.m. eastern time to Sunday, 6 p.m. eastern \ntime. Polls in other time zones would also open and close at this time. \nElection officials would be permitted to close polls during the \novernight hours if they determine it would be inefficient to keep them \nopen. Because the polls are open from Saturday to Sunday, they also \nwould not interfere with religious observances.\n  Amidst all the discussion about election reform, there is growing \nsupport for uniform polling hours. The free-wheeling atmosphere \nsurrounding election night last November, with the networks calling the \noutcome of elections in states when polling places were still open in \nmany places, and in some cases even in the very states being called, \ncannot be repeated. While it is difficut to determine the impact this \ninformation has on voter turnout, there is no question that it \ncontributes to the popular sentiment that voting doesn't matter. At the \nend of the day, as we assess how to make our elections better, we are \nnot only seeking to make voting more equitable, we are also looking for \nways to engage Americans in our democracy.\n\n  I come from the business world, where you had a perfect gauge of what \nthe public thought of you and your products. If you turned a profit, \nyou knew the public liked your product--if you didn't, you knew you \nneeded to make changes. If customers weren't showing up when your store \nwas open, you knew you had to change your store hours.\n  In essence, it's time for the American democracy to change its store \nhours. Since the mid-19th century, election day has been on the first \nTuesday of November. Ironically, this date was selected because it was \nconvenient for voters. Tuesdays were traditionally court day, and land-\nowning voters were often coming to town anyway.\n  Just as the original selection of our national voting day was done \nfor voter convenience, we must adapt to the changes in our society to \nmake voting easier for the regular family. Sixty percent of all \nhouseholds have two working adults. Since most polls in the United \nStates are open only 12 hours, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., voters often have \nonly one or two hours to vote. As we saw in this last election, even \nwith our relatively low voter turnout, long lines in many polling \nplaces kept some waiting even longer than one or two hours. If voters \nhave children, and are dropping them off at day care, or if they have a \nlong work commute, there is just not enough time in a workday to vote.\n  We can do better by offering more flexible voting hours for all \nAmericans, especially working families.\n  Since I introduced my weekend voting legislation in 1997, a number of \nStates have been experimenting with novel ways to increase voter \nturnout and satisfaction. Oregon conducted the first presidential \nelections completely by mail, resulting in impressive increases in \nvoter turnout. Texas has implemented an early voting plan which also \nresulted in increased turnout. And California has relaxed restrictions \non absentee voting, and even had weekend voting in some localities. \nAlthough there are security concerns that need to be ironed out, \nInternet voting has tremendous potential to transform the way we vote. \nIn Arizona's Democratic primary 46 percent of all votes came via the \nInternet. The Defense Department coordinated a pilot program with \nseveral U.S. counties and the Federal Voting Assistance Program to have \noverseas voters, primarily military voters, cast their votes via the \nInternet. It is becoming increasingly clear that these new models can \nincrease\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\nvoter turnout, and voters are much more pleased with the additional \nconvenience and ease with voting.\n  For decades we've seen a gradual decline in voter turnout. In 1952, \nabout 63 percent of eligible voters came out to vote--that number \ndropped to 49 percent in the 1996 election. We saw a minor increase in \nthis past election with voter turnout at 51 percent of eligible voters, \nhowever, not a significant increase given the closeness of the \nelection. Non-Presidential year voter turnout is even more abysmal.\n  Analysts point to a variety of reasons for this drop off. Certainly, \ncommon sense suggests that the general decline in voter confidence in \ngovernment institutions is one logical reason. However, I'd like to \npoint out, one survey of voters and nonvoters suggested that both \ngroups are equally disgruntled with government.\n  Thus, we must explore ways to make our electoral process more user \nfriendly. We must adjust our institutions to the needs of the American \npublic of the 21st century. Our democracy has always had the amazing \ncapacity to adapt to the challenges thrown before it, and we must \ncontinue to do so if our country is to grow and thrive.\n  Of 44 democracies surveyed, 29 of them allow their citizens to vote \non holidays or the weekends. And in nearly every one of these nations, \nvoter turnout surpasses our country's poor performance. We can do \nbetter. That is why I am proposing that we consider weekend voting.\n  I recognize a change of this magnitude may take some time. But the \nmany questions raised by our last election have given us a unique \nopportunity to reassess all aspects of voting in America. We finally \nhave the momentum to accomplish real reform. How much lower should our \ncitizens' confidence plummet before we adapt and create a more \n`consumer-friendly' polling system? How much more should voting turnout \ndecline before we realize we need a change?\n  The Weekend Voting Act will not solve all of this democracy's \nproblems, but it is a commonsense approach for adapting this grand \ndemocratic experiment of the 18th century to the American family's \nlifestyle of the 21st century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Nickles):\n  S. 1321. A bill to authorize the construction of a Native American \nCultural Center and Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; to the Committee \non Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, as many people may be aware, my state of \nOklahoma has well over a quarter of a million American Indians. Even \nOklahoma derives its name from the Choctaw words, ``okla'' meaning \npeople and ``humma'' meaning red. Today, I am pleased to introduce, \nalong with my colleague, Senator Nickles, a bill that will provide a \ngrant to help fund the construction and development of the Native \nAmerican Cultural Center and Museum, which will be centrally located \nalong the North Canadian River at the southeast corner of Interstate 35 \nand Interstate 40, in Oklahoma City. This project marks the culmination \nof years of dreaming and planning by many people, including state \nSenator Kelly Haney, who is recognized world-wide for his Indian art.\n  The Native American Cultural Center will provide people from all over \nthe world with an extensive picture of American Indians from the \nearliest civilization in North America, to their current role in \ntoday's society. Through art, music and dance, visitors will be able to \nsee the wide array of lifestyles, customs and language of American \nIndians come alive as they walk through the various displays. The \nCenter will include a 300-seat theater, a museum store, a 40,000 \nsquare-foot amphitheater, a festival market place, and artist and dance \nexhibits. As an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, it will share \nand showcase artifacts from one of the world's most renowned museums. \nAn internationally acclaimed team of architects, planners, engineers, \nand technical consultants, who have participated in projects from the \nNational Holocaust Museum to films such as Jurassic Park, have come \ntogether to create a complex that features the distinct characteristics \nof all of Oklahoma's tribes.\n  By bringing economic development and cultural diversity to Oklahoma, \nthe Native American Cultural Center and Museum will not only benefit \nthe people of Oklahoma, but the nation as a whole. This important \nproject will serve as a reminder of the rich heritage of the first \nAmericans as well as a symbol of hope and progress for the future.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation with Senator Inhofe that will bring a long-overdue Native \nAmerican Cultural Center to Oklahoma.\n  For many years there has been a desire among Oklahomans to develop a \nfacility to chronicle the history of the 39 tribes that currently \nreside in Oklahoma. Oklahoma is fortunate to have the second largest \nNative American population in the country.\n  Senator Inhofe and I are introducing legislation today that will do \njust that. The Cultural Center will celebrate the influential role that \nNative Americans played in our country's history. The Center will also \nprovide a common ground to meet and discuss the issues and concerns \nthat continue to plague our Indian communities. The Cultural Center is \na partnership with the Oklahoma Historical Society to become a member \nof the Smithsonian Affiliations Program.\n  It is important to note that the Center will assist in communicating \nthe history and culture of all Native Americans, not just Oklahomans.\n  This project is strongly supported in Oklahoma. In fact, two-thirds \nof the funds for the Center will come from the State of Oklahoma and \nprivate donations, a maximum of one-third coming from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I look forward to the opening of a state-of-the-art Native American \nCultural Center and Museum in Oklahoma.\n  I want to thank Senator Inhofe for his hard work and I ask the \nsupport of my colleagues for this important project.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1323. A bill entitled the ``SBIR and STTR Foreign Patent \nProtection Act of 2001''; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, today I am introducing a bill to \nestablish a five-year pilot program at the Small Business \nAdministration to help protect the intellectual property of companies \nthat are trying to export promising technology they have developed \nthrough the Small Business Administration's Small Business Innovation \nResearch, SBIR, and Small Business Technology Transfer, STTR, programs. \nThis week is a particularly appropriate time to introduce this \nlegislation because 211 years ago, in 1790, the very first U.S. patent \nwas issued. It was issued to Mr. Samuel Hopkins of Pennsylvania and \nsigned by President George Washington himself.\n  A lot has changed in the past two centuries, but the need to protect \nintellectual property remains as important as ever. Our forefathers had \nthe wisdom to guarantee ``inventors the exclusive right to their \nrespective . . . discoveries'' in the United States. Today, the need \nfor foreign patent protection is equally critical for international \nsales.\n  These small businesses need help because protecting the intellectual \nproperty of the technology they export requires them to file for \nforeign patents, and the costs associated with filing such patents are \noften prohibitively expensive. We know this because it has been \ndocumented through outside research and testimony before the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. For example, Mr. \nClifford Hoyt, who is vice president and chief technology officer of \nCambridge Research and Instrumentation, testified on June 21st, as part \nof the Committee's hearing on reauthorization of the STTR program, that \n``patent protection in Europe is $20,000.'' Information from the \nAmerican Intellectual Property Law Association's, AIPLA, spring meeting \nshows that the costs of foreign patents range from $7,200 in Canada to \n$27,200 in Japan. Those costs include fees for filing, examination, \ntranslation and attorneys.\n  Interestingly enough, foreign patent protection costs are not just an \nobstacle for small businesses; they also affect our universities. Let \nme quote Dr. Anthony Pirri, who is director of technology transfer for \nNortheastern University in Boston and also testified at the STTR \nhearing: ``For universities\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\nlike Northeastern with limited resources, the patent expense burden is \nlarge. It is especially large because many of our technologies have \ninternational significance and require us to patent, do foreign \nfilings. Therefore, anything you can do to help in that world would be \nvery desirable.''\n  This problem was first identified in 1996 through a research study \nfinanced by the SBA's Office of Advocacy entitled ``Foreign Patenting \nBehavior in Small and Large Firms.'' That study found that \n``technology-based small businesses were filing fewer patents overseas \nthan large businesses for similar innovative products primarily due to \na lack of funds to obtain foreign patents.''\n  Foreign patent protection is important to eventual commercialization. \nHowever, if technologies of small businesses aren't protected, large \nforeign-owned firms can replicate the product and benefit directly from \na U.S. Federally funded research effort.\n  I am obviously concerned about this. To help small innovative \ncompanies overcome such barriers, and to maximize our investment in the \nSBIR and STTR technologies, the Small Business Administration, SBA, \nshould be authorized to provide grants to underwrite the costs of \ninitial foreign patent applications filed by SBIR and STTR companies. \nUltimately, the goal is for the grant fund to be self-sustaining, \ngenerating revenue from a percentage of the relevant technology's \nexport sales and/or licensing fees.\n  Here's how the grants would work: The SBA would be authorized to \naward grants of up to $25,000 to companies seeking foreign patent \nprotection for their technology or product developed under the SBIR and \nSTTR programs. Each company would be limited to one grant and, in order \nto be eligible for the grant, it must have already filed for patent \nprotection in the United States. Both of these provisions are designed \nto ensure, to the extent possible, that companies apply for their most \npromising technology and therefore return money to the grant fund. By \ngiving the companies only one shot at a grant to protect and make money \nfrom their SBIR or STTR technologies, it forces them to select the one \nmost likely to succeed and have sales. At the same time, requiring \ncompanies to have already filed for patent protection in the United \nStates prior to seeking a foreign patent grant is a gauge of the \ncompany's confidence in the commercial potential of its technology. It \nalso demonstrates the company's commitment to protecting that \ntechnology.\n  The bill establishes the program at $2.5 million in the first year \nand increases that amount gradually over four years to $10 million \nannually.\n  In FY2003, the bill authorizes $2.5 million, in order to fund 100 \ngrants of $25,000.\n  In FY2004, the bill authorizes $5 million, in order to fund 200 \ngrants of $25,000.\n  In FY2005, the bill authorizes $7.5 million, in order to fund 300 \ngrants of $25,000.\n  In FY2006 and FY2007, the bill authorizes $10 million a year, in \norder to fund 400 grants of $25,000.\n  As I said earlier, ultimately the goal is for this to be a self-\nsustaining grant fund. To realize that money, in return for the grants, \neach recipient would be obligated to pay between three percent and five \npercent of its related export sales or licensing fees to the fund, to \nbe known as the ``SBIR and STTR Foreign Patent Protection Grant Fund.'' \nTo maintain a reasonable incentive for the small businesses, the total \namount would be capped at four times the amount of the grant, which for \na $25,000 grant would be $100,000.\n  I have talked about many of the needs and merits of this legislation, \nbut in closing I would like to add that increased, successful exports \nby our innovative small businesses could mean a lot to the U.S. economy \noverall. We have seen the balance of trade deficits rise steadily for \nmany years. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's Foreign Trade \nDivision, in last year alone our country's trade balance deficit was \n$436 billion. The first four months of 2001 are slightly worse. We \nshould be doing everything that we can to improve upon our exports, and \nsmall businesses can play an important role in that arena.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in sponsoring this bill. This \npilot, if enacted and implemented properly, has the potential to \ngreatly benefit small businesses, protect their innovations and promote \ntheir exports.\n  I thank the President and ask that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1323\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``SBIR and STTR Foreign Patent \n     Protection Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) small business concerns represent approximately 96 \n     percent of all exporters of goods;\n       (2) there has been dynamic growth in the number of small \n     business concerns exporting goods, and the dollar value of \n     their exports;\n       (3) despite such growth, small business concerns encounter \n     problems in obtaining financing for exports;\n       (4) growth in United States exports will depend primarily \n     on technology innovation, making the protection of \n     intellectual property in the global market of special \n     national interest;\n       (5) the costs of filing for initial patent protection in \n     foreign markets can be prohibitive for small business \n     concerns involved in the Small Business Innovation Research \n     Program (referred to in this section as ``SBIR'') and the \n     Small Business Technology Transfer Program (referred to in \n     this section as ``STTR''), representing an insurmountable \n     barrier to obtaining the protection needed to pursue the \n     international markets;\n       (6) to overcome such barriers and to maximize the Federal \n     investment in the SBIR and STTR programs, the Small Business \n     Administration should be authorized to provide grants to be \n     used to underwrite the costs of initial foreign patent \n     applications by SBIR and STTR awardees; and\n       (7) a program established to provide such grants should, \n     over time, become self funding.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide relief from the alternative minimum tax \nwith respect to incentive stock options exercised during 2000; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, today I am introducing a second \nproposal with regard to the perverse impact of the Alternative Minimum \nTax, AMT, on Incentive Stock Options, ISOs. I previously introduced a \nbill, S. 1142, addressing this issue going forward and today I am \nintroducing a bill to provide relief to the victims of this perverse \ntax who filed returns and paid taxes this past April. As I will \nexplain, they were hit by the tax equivalent of the perfect storm.\n  The argument for reform of the AMT as applied to ISOs is \noverwhelming. An employee who receives ISOs is taxed on the phantom \npaper gains the tax code deems to exist when he or she exercises an \noption, and is required to pay the AMT tax on these ``gains'' even if \nthe ``gains'' do not, in fact, exist. This means the taxpayer may have \nno gains, no profits or assets, with which to pay the AMT and might \neven have to borrow funds to pay the tax, go into default on his or her \nAMT liability, or even declare bankruptcy.\n  This Kafkaesque situation is unfair. It is not fair to impose tax on \n``income'' or ``gains'' unless the income or gains exist. With the AMT \ntax on ISOs, it is not relevant if the ``gains'' exist in a financial \nsense. That they exist on paper is sufficient to trigger the tax.\n  In terms of providing relief to taxpayers hit with the AMT on ISOs in \ntheir filing for 2000 taxes, let me make a series of points.\n  First, there have been victims of the AMT/ISO tax going back before \n2000. But, there were an unprecedented number of victims this last year \ndue to a convergence of events.\n  Over the last decade, more and more companies have adopted broad-\nbased stock option plans where all or almost all employees are granted \nISOs, rather than only senior management.\n  In addition, the internet and telecommunications boom spawned an \nunprecedented number of start-up companies over the last few years.\n  These start-ups overwhelmingly favor the use of ISOs as a means of \nattracting and motivating employees, and many of these companies grant \noptions to most, if not all of their employees.\n  Then, as we all know, the stock market, especially the technology-\ndriven NASDAQ, posted record highs in the spring of 2000, and then \ncollapsed over the next 12 months, astounding even seasoned \nprofessionals. Many of the high-flying technology companies saw their \nstock value drop 80 percent to 90 percent during this period.\n  As a result, the relatively unknown AMT caught many employees by \nsurprise. Other employees were aware of the AMT but thought they could \nclaim a full credit for the AMT once they sold the stock acquired by \nexercise of ISOs. Some were unable to sell before year-end, in order to \neliminate the AMT hit, by trading restrictions. Others were naive in \nthinking that the value of the shares they held would rebound in 2001, \nin time to sell the stock and pay their AMT liability for 2000.\n  In short, in tax year 2000 we saw the tax equivalent of the perfect \nstorm.\n  Second, the imposition of AMT on individuals discourages the very \nbehavior that Congress wanted to encourage with the creation of ISOs. \nIn 1984, the Senate Finance Committee noted the goal of ISOs to \n``encourage employee ownership of the stock on an employer's business'' \nby allowing for ``the deferral of tax until an employee disposes of the \nstock received through the exercise of an employee stock option''. To \nencourage individuals to hold shares with the promise of capital gains \ntax rates is the goal, but it is a goal that is defeated when the AMT \nis imposed at the time they exercise an option even if the ``gains'' \nare never realized. The taxpayers who held their shares and realized \ngain are the ones who deserve relief. They fell into a trap which the \ntax code created through its perverse and confusing structure.\n  Third, the trap was one that many of these employees did not \nunderstand. They rightly assumed that the AMT was directed at taxing \nthe wealthy and could not possibly affect them. This is a case where \nthe complexity of the tax and the contradictory incentives it provides \nfor ISOs lured the victims into the trap.\n  Fourth, we are likely to see a major debate on AMT reform, but this \nis a broader debate about the fundamentals of the tax code, not a tax \ntrap like we have with ISOs. An increasing number of taxpayers find \nthemselves paying the AMT because they have large state tax deductions \nor large numbers of personal exemptions. The AMT is likely to snare 1.5 \nmillion taxpayers this year and nearly 36 million by 2010. The AMT they \nmay pay may be infuriating, but it would normally not substantially \nincrease their overall tax liability. The AMT paid because of ISOs can \nbe hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars and can be \ndevastating. It can cause a tax liability that is many times the \ntaxpayer's total income. This is a problem that needs to be addressed \nnot, now when we finally take up broad-based AMT reform.\n  Let me be clear about the cost and budget implications of my bill. \nThe Joint Tax Committee on Taxation has found that my proposal would \nreduce government tax revenues by $1.3 billion over ten years. This is \nsubstantially less expensive than the cost of my earlier bill, which \nwas estimated to cost $12.412 billion over ten years. I will not \npropose to enact my bill unless this sum is financed and will have no \nimpact on the Federal budget.\n  The budget situation we face will not make it easy to enact these \nreforms. The massive tax cut of $1.3 trillion was financed from the \nsurpluses. We are now finding that it was, as I and others feared, way \ntoo large and leaves us no room to take up additional tax measures. In \nfact, just last week we saw reports of a memo leaked where Republicans \npredicting that the Congressional Budget Office deficit/budget updates \nin August would find that we have zero available surplus beyond the \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds in fiscal year 2002 and that \nCongress may have to dip into those trust funds by nearly $41 billion \nin fiscal year 2003. If this is true, it would leave no additional non-\ntrust fund surplus dollars available for other uses, such as growth tax \nincentives, fixing the ISO/AMT problem, education, energy or defense, \nin fiscal year 2002. The fiscal year 2002 budget resolution bars \nCongress from spending any money in either the Social Security or \nMedicare Part A trust funds for any purpose other than Medicare or \nSocial Security.\n\n[[Page S8741]]\n\n  I recount this here because it means that we must find a revenue or \nspending offset to finance our ISO/AMT proposal, or any other growth \ntax incentive. We cannot use the surplus. This raises a substantial \nbarrier to enactment of this proposal and it is a barrier that we could \nhave easily avoided had we enacted a tax cut we could afford.\n  I am pleased that today Rep. Richard Neal, Tom Davis, Zoe Lofgren, \nand Jerry Weller are introducing the same bill in the other body. \nEarlier, Representative Lofgren introduced H.R. 1487, a bipartisan bill \nthat has given a great deal of visibility to this issue. I look forward \nto working with my distinguished House colleagues to remedy this \ninequity in the tax code, both for victims in 2000 and going forward.\n  Finally, let me note that I have proposed in S. 1134 to provide a \nspecial capital gains tax rate, in fact to set a zero tax rate, for \nstock purchased by employees in stock option plans, by investors in \nInitial Public Offerings, and similar purchases of company treasury \nstock. This zero rate would be effective, however, only if the shares \nare held for at least three years, so the AMT gamble with ISOs would be \neven more dramatic. During the first year of that holding period, the \nAMT would have to be paid and during the remaining period the value of \nthe stock could well dive from the exercise price creating an even more \ninvidious trap.\n  We need to fix the ISO/AMT problem so that capital gains incentives \nfor entrepreneurs will work as intended and provide the boost to \neconomic growth.\n  We need also to focus on the victims of the 2000 perfect storm.\n  I ask that two documents be printed at this point in the Record, an \nexplanation of my bill and a comparison of incentive and nonstatutory \nstock options. Both have been prepared by professionals with accounting \nfirms.\n\nIncentive Stock Options and the Alternative Minimum Tax--An Explanation \n          of the Lieberman-Neal-Davis-Lofgren-Weller Proposal\n\n       Issue: The difference between the exercise price and the \n     fair market value at the time of exercise, the ``spread'', of \n     stock obtained with an incentive stock option, ``ISO'', is a \n     tax preference for purposes of the individual alternative \n     minimum tax, ``AMT''. If the ISO preference causes a taxpayer \n     to pay the AMT for the year of exercise, there may be a tax \n     credit carryforward that is available to offset regular tax \n     in a future year. However, if the stock declines \n     significantly in value between the date of exercise and the \n     date of its sale, there may not be sufficient regular income \n     in any future year to utilize the AMT credit. As a result, a \n     taxpayer may pay significant permanent AMT for what was \n     intended to be only a ``timing'' preference. This problem is \n     particularly acute for individuals who exercised incentive \n     stock options in 2000, prior to the significant decline in \n     the stock values of many companies.\n       Example: In January, 2000, a sales manager for Silicon \n     Valley Company exercises options for 15,000 shares of stock \n     with an exercise price of $5 per share, the fair market of \n     the stock when the options were granted in 1997. At the date \n     of exercise, the stock is trading at $125 per share. The \n     spread gives rise to an AMT tax preference of $1.8 million \n     and generates a net AMT liability for 2000 of approximately \n     $500,000.00, over and above the manager's tax liability on \n     her $60,000 annual salary. Since ISO stock retained for at \n     least a year from the date of exercise is eligible for \n     capital gains treatment, manager does not immediately sell \n     her ISO shares. In April 2001, the company and the stock \n     market have setbacks and the stock again trades at $5 per \n     share.\n       Under current law, the amount of AMT credit that the \n     manager can use annually is limited to approximately $5,000, \n     her expected regular tax over her AMT tax. As a result, it \n     would take roughly 100 years for the AMT credits to be fully \n     utilized.\n       Lieberman/Neal/Davis/Lofgren/Weller Proposal: Limits the \n     amount of the AMT preference resulting from the exercise of \n     an incentive stock option in 2000 to an amount based on the \n     fair market value of the stock as of April 15, 2001, or, if \n     such stock is sold or exchanged on or before that date, to \n     the amount realized on such sale or exchange.\n       Example: Under the same facts as above, a sales manager who \n     acquired stock through the exercise of an incentive stock \n     option would use the $5 per share April 15, 2001 fair market \n     value of the stock to calculate the AMT preference amount. If \n     the manager has already filed her 2000 tax return, she would \n     file an amended return for the 2000 tax year to reflect the \n     revised AMT preference amount of $0.00, the revised April 15, \n     2001 fair market value of $5.00 per share equals the original \n     $5.00 per share exercise price.\n\n\n         Comparison of Incentive and Nonstatutory Stock Options\n\n       The following is a broad overview of the basic tax concepts \n     that apply to U.S. taxpayers who receive stock options \n     granted by U.S. companies, for services rendered. It does not \n     address the tax consequences for non-U.S. taxpayers or the \n     company issuing the options. This outline assumes that the \n     stock received upon exercise is not restricted within the \n     meaning of IRC section 83. If there are restrictions on \n     the stock received upon exercise, the tax consequences \n     will differ significantly from that described in this \n     outline.\n\n\n                                 Terms\n\n       Grant Date--This is the date the stock options are granted \n     to you by the company. This date generally is reset if the \n     terms of the stock option are changed; e.g. exercise price is \n     lowered.\n       Exercise Price--This is the price you have to pay to \n     purchase a share of stock under the terms of the option \n     agreement.\n       Vesting Date--This is the date that you earn the right to \n     exercise your options. For example, your shares may vest over \n     four years, starting after one year. In this case, on each \n     anniversary of the grant date you earn the right to exercise \n     one fourth of your options.\n       Exercise Date--This is the day you exercise your stock \n     options by paying the exercise price to purchase the shares \n     in which you are vested.\n       Fair Market Value--This is the true value of the stock at \n     any given date, usually determined by the price at which the \n     stock is trading for on an established exchange. For a \n     private company, the fair market value should be determined \n     by an independent third party appraisal. If the company does \n     not have an outside appraisal performed, the Board should \n     establish the value using appropriate methods and current \n     information.\n       Spread on Exercise Date--This is the difference between the \n     exercise price (what you pay for the stock) and the fair \n     market value (what the stock is worth) at the time you \n     exercise your stock options. This is often referred to as the \n     bargain element.\n       Sale Date--This is the day you sell the shares of stock you \n     had previously purchased on the exercise date.\n       Spread on Sale Date--This is the difference between the \n     exercise price (what you paid for the stock) and the fair \n     market value (what the stock is worth) on the day you sell \n     your shares.\n       Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)--These are stock options \n     that qualify for special tax treatment by meeting a number of \n     special rules, the details of which are not included in this \n     memo. One of the key requirements is that the exercise price \n     is at least equal to the fair market value at the date of \n     grant. ISOs are contrasted with Nonstatutory Stock Options in \n     the following table.\n       Nonstatutory Stock Options (NSOs; also referred to as NQOs, \n     as in nonqualified)--These are stock options that do not meet \n     all the rules for ISOs. They are less tax favored, but \n     generally more flexible.\n\n COMPARISON OF TAX CONSEQUENCES--INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION VS.

A bill to ratify an agreement between the Aleut Corporation \nand the United States of America to exchange land rights received under \nthe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act for certain land interests on \nAdak Island, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will facilitate and promote the successful commercial reuse of \nthe former Naval Air Facility on Adak Island, AK . At the same time, \nthis legislation will allow the Aleut people of Alaska to reclaim the \nisland and to make use of its modern infrastructure and important \nlocation.\n  The legislation I introduce today is very similar to a bill I \nintroduced nearly four years ago in the 105th Congress. It ratifies an \nagreement between the Aleut Corporation, an Alaska Native Regional \nCorporation, the Department of the Interior and the Department of the \nNavy. In 1997, The Aleut Corporation, the U.S. Navy and the Interior \nDepartment were still in the process of negotiating and structuring the \nAgreement to provide for the fair and responsible transfer of the \nformer military facility. I am pleased to tell you that ``The Agreement \nConcerning the Conveyance of Property at the Adak Naval Complex, Adak \nAK'' was signed last September. Thus, the time is now appropriate for \nCongress to consider the Agreement and ratify its provisions to allow \nfor final transfer.\n  The bill and the Agreement also further the conservation of important \nwildlife habitat within the Aleutian Islands region of Alaska. A \nportion of Adak is within the Aleutian Islands subunit of the Alaska \nMaritime National Wildlife Refuge. The Agreement facilitates the \nDepartment of the Inferior's continued management and protection of the \nRefuge lands on Adak and even adds some of the Navy lands to the \nRefuge. More importantly, in exchange for the developed Navy lands, \nwhich are not suitable for the Refuge but are commercially useful, the \nAleut Corporation will convey environmentally sensitive lands it holds \nelsewhere in the Refuge to the Department of the Interior. Thus, not \nonly are the former military lands put to productive use, but the \nRefuge gains valuable new habitat.\n  For many years the Navy has played an important role in Alaska's \nAleutian Chain. Its presence was first established during World War II \nwith the selection and development of the island because of Adak's \nability to support a major airfield and its natural and protected deep \nwater port. The Navy's presence contributed greatly to the defense of \nour Pacific coast during World War II and throughout the Cold War. \nThrough the Navy's presence, Adak became the largest development in the \nAleutians as well as Alaska's sixth largest community. With the end of \nthe Cold War our defense needs changed, however, and Adak was selected \nfor closure during the last base closure round.\n  Those very same features that made Adak strategically important for \ndefense purposes also make it important for commercial purposes. Adak \nis a natural stepping stone to Asia and is at the crossroads of air and \nsea trade between North America, Europe and Asia. With the ability to \nuse Adak commercially, the Aleut people, through The Aleut Corporation, \ncan establish it as an important intercontinental location with \nsufficient enterprise to provide year round jobs for the Aleut people. \nThese goals are consistent with the promises and the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act, the legislation that created the corporation.\n  This rebirth of Adak is already well underway. The local Aleut \nresidents assumed responsibility for the operation of the Island from \nthe Navy last October and there are a number of new commercial \nenterprises and endeavors. At the same time a new community has begun \nto take shape. Just last month the new City of Adak was established as \na result of a public referendum and it is now in the process of taking \nover responsibility for the docks, utilities, roads and other public \nfacilities.\n  The Agreement resolves a number of important issues related to the \ntransfer of this former military base and the establishment of the new \ncommunity on Adak, including responsibility for environmental \nremediation, institutional controls, indemnification, required public \naccess and reservation of lands for government use. The environmental \nremediation work of the Navy is still ongoing and will continue to an \nextent for several more years. However, all the interested parties \nagree that a final transfer can occur within the next twelve months. \nHence the need for this legislation.\n  This bill furthers our Nation's objective of conversion of closed \ndefense facilities into successful commercial reuse, it benefits the \nAleut people and restores them to their ancestral lands and it benefits \nthe National Wildlife Refuge System. I believe everyone will agree that \nsuch legislation is important and worthy of our support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 1326. a bill to extend and improve working lands and other \nconservation programs administered by the Secretary of Agriculture; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Working \nLands Conservation Act. The bill is intended to achieve two major \ngoals: first, to assist our farmers and ranchers in meeting short-term \nenvironmental challenges, such as water and air quality concerns and \nthe regulation of animal feeding operations; and, secondly, to enhance \nthe long-term quality of our environment and sustainability of our \nnatural resources.\n  As some of my colleagues may recall, the Senate Agriculture Committee \nhas a long history of bipartisan cooperation on conservation. From the \nConservation Reserve, to the Wetlands Reserve, to the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program, we have conscientiously sought to do what \nis best for our Nation's environment. We have laid aside partisan \ndifferences when it has come to conservation and our natural resources \nare better because of our joint efforts.\n  In that spirit, my bill joins those of several of my colleagues and \nrepresents a foundation for our work on the conservation title of the \nfarm bill. Senator Harkin has introduced the Conservation Security \nAct--an innovative idea that would reward good conservation farmers for \ntheir environmental efforts and thus foster conservation and \nenvironmental improvements.\n  Senators Craig, Feinstein, and Thomas have introduced a Grasslands \nReserve Act that would protect and restore one million acres of our \nfragile grasslands while allowing the owners to maintain economic use \nof the land. Senators Hutchinson and Lincoln have a bill that \nreauthorizes and expands the Wetlands Reserve Program.\n  Senator Crapo has introduced a bill, of which I am a cosponsor, that \ncovers many of the items in the conservation title of the current farm \nbill. I know he has put much thought into his bill and I look forward \nto working with him and my other colleagues as we fashion the \nconservation title of the new farm bill.\n  While there are many valid approaches on how we should foster \nimprovements in our environment, this bill invests in our working \nlands--the land we use to grow our food, our fiber; the land we depend \nupon for sustenance. This working land cropland, pasture, rengeland, \nand private forests, makes up some 70 percent of the land areas of the \ncontiguous 48 States. How this land is managed has profound effects on \nour economy and environment. The farm bill we are cross developing is \none of the most important pieces of environmental and natural resource \nlegislation this Congress will address. It is essential that the \nconservation title be a major component of the legislation we develop \ntogether.\n  Since 1985, the last time Congress made a major investment in \nconservation as part of a farm bill, we have spent most of our \nconservation dollars through programs that set aside productive \ncropland as a primary means of achieving our environmental goals. These \nefforts are certainly worthwhile and I support continuing them. Indeed \nthe preeminent land-idling program we have, the Conservation Reserve, \nwas introduced on my farm in Indiana and I continue to support it.\n\n  But we cannot land-idle our way to environment performance. The folly \nof this, solely from a resource conservation standpoint--is evident \nfrom the situation we now see after fifteen years\n\n[[Page S8743]]\n\nof extensive land idling through the Conservation Reserve. After having \nset aside up to 36.4 million acres at one point, State water quality \nreports today will name nonpoint source pollution as the Nation's \nbiggest water quality challenge and agriculture as the biggest culprit, \nprimarily due to sediment, nutrient loadings, and pathogens. While the \nConservation Reserve has many benefits, particularly wildlife habitat \nin the Great Plains, it is obvious that large-scale land-idling schemes \nwill not solve all of the problems associated with water and air \nquality. Yet these are the environmental challenges that confront most \nfarmers today, and the ones most likely to result in costly new \nregulation for our farmers and ranchers. How we deal with these \nenvironmental challenges will affect the commercial viability of \nfarming and ranching over the next decade.\n  A quick review of how we are spending our voluntary conservation \ndollars will show just how much ground we have to make up. In 1985, 97 \ncents of every financial assistance dollar from the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture went to working lands; three cents went to land retirement. \nToday, the situation is nearly reversed with some 85 cents going toward \nland retirement, primarily through the Conservation Reserve, and only \n15 cents going toward working lands. This over-reliance on removing \nland from production comes at the expense of caring for working lands, \nand, given the contemporary environmental issues facing landowners, \nthis imbalance must be addressed during our reauthorization of the farm \nbill.\n  For our working lands to continue to be productive, and to ensure \nthat agriculture can tend to its environmental concerns, I believe that \nthe overarching goal of the new conservation title should be to \nemphasize conservation on working agricultural lands. Much as President \nTheodore Roosevelt championed public land conservation early in the \nlast century, today we must champion the care of our working lands.\n  Bringing conservation programs up to levels needed to address \npriority issues will require new funding. If you exclude the short-term \nemergency funding, the budget resolution provides an additional $66.15 \nbillion for agriculture above the baseline. I believe that a \nsignificant portion of this new spending should be devoted to \nconservation. My bill increases mandatory conservation spending by \napproximately $2 billion per year. This amount would effectively double \nour investment in voluntary, incentive-based conservation programs. \nAnd, because of the funding provided by the budget resolution, we can \nenhance our working lands programs without cutting or diminishing our \nexisting land retirement programs.\n  To focus on working lands, our first order of business is to \nstrengthen the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. EQIP, as it is \ncalled, offers financial, technical and educational assistance to \nfarmers and ranchers and is generally seen as the workhorse \nconservation program for working lands. Congress created EQIP in 1996 \nby merging four other conservation programs and provided $200 million a \nyear in mandatory spending. Today, requests for EQIP assistance far \noutstrip available funds and analyses show there is a demonstrated need \nfor an additional $1.2 billion per year to address the anticipated \nneeds of the livestock industry alone. My bill established national \npriorities for EQIP, makes several needed reforms to the program such \nas shortening the length of the contract and removing discriminatory \nsize restrictions, and provides $1.5 billion a year to be phased-in \nover a three year period.\n\n  In addition, my bill provides more flexibility and financial \nincentives within EQIP to create partnerships at the state and local \nlevel, partnerships that are essential to meeting the environmental \nchallenges agriculture faces. My bill establishes a grants section \nwithin EQIP to leverage federal funds with funding from non-federal \nentities and encourages states to develop plans that bring together \nmultiple Federal, State, and local programs to create coordinated \nconservation initiatives to address critical environmental challenges. \nThere is already good experience on this score through the Conservation \nReserve Enhancement Program and the continuous signup program for \nbuffer practices.\n  My bill expands this concept by making private and other non-federal \nentities eligible for a special $100 million matching grant program \nwithin EQIP. The grant program would create cooperative federal/non-\nfederal ventures that would spur conservation on private lands through \nmarket-based initiatives. Under my proposal, non-federal entities would \nbid to have their projects approved and then combine their funds with \nfederal money to stimulate more use of market-based solutions in areas \nsuch as water quality or carbon credit trading. For example, drinking \nwater suppliers facing the necessity, and cost, of building new \ntreatment facilities might find it less expensive to pay upstream \nfarmers and ranchers to voluntarily make reductions in pollutant \ndischarges, thereby obviating the need for new treatment facilities. \nTaken together, these provisions will spark creative and innovative \napproaches to conservation that work better for farmers, ranchers, \ncommunities, and the environment.\n  Reforming, adequately funding, and focusing the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program on national environmental issues will dramatically \naccelerate the amount of conservation on our landscape. But it will \nalso require that we resolve one of the key problems we face today--the \nlack of qualified technical assistance to help our farmers and ranchers \nplan, design, install, and maintain conservation practices. \nInsufficient annual appropriations for USDA's Natural Resources \nConservation Service over the past decade have caused a steady decline \nin real terms in the number of field staff available to give landowners \ntechnical advice. At the same time, demand for technical assistance has \nballooned as producers grapple with conservation challenges.\n  My bill ensures that technical assistance will be available to \nimplement conservation by reforming the so-called section 11 Cap in the \nCommodity Credit Corporation Charter Act. The Commodity Credit \nCorporation is allowed to reimburse agencies for work they do for the \nvarious programs under the Corporation, but the section 11 cap limits \ntotal reimbursements to no more than $36.2 million annually. The cap \nwas put on by Congress to control computer purchases by the Department \nof Agriculture, but is has also had the unintended side effect of \nlimiting technical assistance reimbursement for conservation programs. \nTo resolve the problem, my bill exempts conservation technical \nassistance reimbursements from the cap.\n\n  Reforming the section 11 Cap will help solve part of the problem, but \nmy bill also looks to the private and nonprofit sector to help fill the \ntechnical assistance gap. Crop advisors, farm managers, private \nagronomists and engineers, conservation district professionals, and \nother qualified individuals could help fill the technical assistance \ngap for many landowners who are willing to pay for their services. My \nbill creates a fee-based certification program within USDA to increase \nthe number of technical assistance providers and provides for the use \nof incentive payments to help farmers and ranchers pay for qualified \ntechnical assistance for nutrient management plans. In all cases, work \ndone by third parties would have to meet the technical standards of the \nNatural Resources Conservation Service.\n  Maintaining the confidentiality of producer information contained in \nUSDA files is vital to voluntary private lands conservation. Farmers \nand ranchers must be confident that their private business information \nwill not be compromised if they participate in a conservation program. \nFarmers and ranchers are increasingly concerned about this issue as \nboth government agencies and non-governmental entities have attempted \nto secure USDA data for regulatory purposes. In order to maintain the \ntrust that exists between producers and USDA, my bill includes \nprovisions to protect the confidentiality of the information farmers \nand ranchers disclose when developing and implementing conservation \nplans without affecting current Freedom of Information Act procedures.\n  Strengthening EQIP and our technical assistance capabilities are the \ntwo most important priorities my bill\n\n[[Page S8744]]\n\naddresses. But there are other programs that add important features to \na comprehensive conservation program that my bill reauthorizes and \nfunds.\n  My bill reauthorizes and increase funding for the Wildlife Habitat \nIncentives program. Created in the 1996 farm bill, this program \nprovides technical and financial assistance to landowners that agree to \ndevelop wildlife habitat. The program was originally funded at $50 \nmillion over the seven year life of the 1996 farm bill. My bill \nincreases the funding level to $50 million per year, devoting an \naggregate of one-half billion dollars to wildlife habitat over the life \nof the bill.\n  Similarly, my bill reauthorizes, amends, and increase funding for the \nFarmland Protection Program. This voluntary program, also created in \nthe 1996 farm bill, assist state and local programs purchase \ndevelopment rights on farms and helps farmers on the urban-rural \ninterface stay in farming. The program has been lauded for its \nassistance to communities wishing to preserve agriculture, open space, \nwildlife habitat and other environmental benefits. My bill expands \nparticipation in the program to non-profit organizations, allows \ngrassland easements, and increases funding to $65 million per year.\n  My bill preserves the Conservation Reserve Program at its current \nlevel of 36.4 million acres. This leaves room for enrolling more than 2 \nmillion acres of additional land right now, as well as the acres that \nbecome available as existing contracts expire. The bill amends the \nprogram to create an incentive to increase the amount of hardwood trees \nentering the program and statutorily reserves 4 million acres for the \ncontinuous signup and for the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. \nBoth the continuous signup and the Conservation Reserve Enhancement \nProgram target high priority environmental concerns such as water \nquality.\n  My bill also makes a major new commitment to wetland restoration \nthrough the Wetlands Reserve Program by reauthorizing the program and \nadding 2.5 million acres to the enrollment authorization, more than \ndoubling the rate of wetland restoration we have achieved since 1990. \nOf the new acreage, the bill targets 50,000 acres of wetland \nrestoration a year to cooperative agreements with States for high \npriority environmental needs such as hypoxia, eutrophication, wildlife \nhabitat, flooding, and groundwater recharge.\n  In the area of reform, within existing USDA conservation programs \nthere are numerous overlaps and redundancies. My bill requires the \nSecretary of Agriculture to aggressively look at the entire range of \nUSDA conservation programs to identify program overlaps, explore \npotential consolidations, develop ways to simplify and streamline \nprogram administration, and then report her recommendations to \nCongress.\n  As we continue the process of reauthorizing the farm bill, several \nfundamental choices lie before us and will require us to make decisions \nthat will set the course of voluntary private lands conservation \nefforts for the next decade. The choices we make will determine the \noverall health of our environment. The Working Lands Conservation Act \nprovides a solid basis for making those conservation decisions. The \nbill helps restore balance between working lands programs and land-\nidling programs without cutting popular programs such as the \nConservation Reserve. The focus of my conservation reforms is to assist \nfarmers and ranchers to not only meet regulatory requirements, but to \nproactively resolve them before they enter a regulatory context. It \nincreases the coherence of conservation policy, protects producer \nconfidentiality, and assures that more technical assistance will be \navailable to our farmers and ranchers.\n  As a Nation, we entrust the care of over 50 percent of our land to \njust two percent of our citizens--the farmers and ranchers who work the \nland and produce the food and fiber we demand. This bill recognizes \nthat farmers and ranchers are much more than food and fiber producers. \nThey are the most important natural resource managers in this Nation. \nMy bill will give them the technical and financial tools they need to \ncare for the land--and our environment, as they make a living from it. \nIt recognizes that conservation is a shared responsibility; a \npartnership between farmers, ranchers, and the public. This bill \nstrengthens those partnerships and ensures conservation will be a \nfundamental part of the mission of this Committee, Congress, and the \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1326\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code to provide \nemergency Secretarial authority to resolve airline labor disputes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Airline Labor Dispute \nResolution Act. This bill would give the Secretary of Transportation \nthe authority to send airline labor disputes to binding arbitration in \norder to prevent labor actions that might cripple the national air \ntransportation system. The intent of this bill is to fix a collective \nbargaining process that is not serving the unions, the airlines, or the \ntraveling public. Senators Lott and Burns are joining me as original \nco-sponsors of this legislation.\n  The Commerce Committee held a hearing in April on the status of labor \nissues in the airline industry. The hearing made it clear to most \neveryone that the current process for resolving airline labor disputes \nis not working. While labor negotiations in the airline industry have \nbeen ongoing for years, things have begun to worsen. The trend towards \nlarger airlines has given unions greater leverage, which appears to \nhave contributed to a mind set that views any work stoppage as \nlegitimate. Normally, even acrimonious labor negotiations are a part of \nthe negotiating process with both sides using what leverage is \navailable to them to reach the best deal. However, times have changed, \nand these acrimonious negotiations now adversely affect the American \npeople.\n  As I have said before, I have no problems with the labor \norganizations exercising their legal rights. At the moment, strikes are \na permitted action under applicable labor statutes, provided that \nspecific steps have been taken to resolve the dispute. Increasingly, \nhowever, courts have found that airline labor unions have illegally \nresorted to self-help measures. In the past, United, American, \nNorthwest and Delta have obtained court ordered relief from these \nalleged illegal job actions. In American's case, the court fined \nAmerican's pilots over $45 million for not adhering to an injunction.\n  These actions have affected millions of consumers. Middle America has \ntoo often been stranded as a result of this illegal union activity. \nAccording to published reports, United canceled over 23,000 flights \nlast year as a result of its pilots' refusal to fly overtime, \ndestroying carefully planned vacations and business trips. Northwest \nand Delta cancelled thousands of flights preemptively over the holiday \nseasons to combat alleged slowdowns by mechanics and failures to fly \novertime by pilots, respectively. The pilots' sickout at American in \n1999 left thousands of people stranded, some of whom have banded \ntogether to sue the pilots for damages.\n  The unions are not the only ones to blame for the current situation--\nairline management must also shoulder some of the responsibility. \nAirlines have skillfully used the existing process to draw out \nnegotiations and leave employees bound for years to the terms of old \nagreements. As one witness at our hearing testified, airlines use the \ncurrent procedures to prolong negotiations and avoid accountability at \nthe bargaining table. Employees can become quite frustrated and have \nreportedly lost faith in the existing system. That is no excuse for \nillegal job actions, but it is another indication that the current \nprocess is broken. These matters should be resolved more quickly and \nwith more certainty.\n  Those who seek to maintain the status quo will undoubtedly say that \nthe current collective bargaining process is not perfect but works well \nenough. They will point out that several significant agreements were \nreached in the industry this year without any disruption to commercial \nair transportation. It is true that several unions and major airlines \nwere able to avoid strikes this year. But that does not mean the \nprocess cannot or should not be improved. Air transportation has become \nan integral part of our economy and society, and each year our \ndependence upon it grows. If we do not act now to address the flaws in \nthe system, we will pay a very high price in the future when the very \nthreat of a disruption in air service may be devastating.\n  Because airlines are so important to the well being of the country, \nthe traveling public can be held hostage by both sides in these \ndisputes. With few large air carriers, a job action at a major airline \ncan have a catastrophic effect on the aviation system and the consumer. \nThe rest of the airlines would have a difficult time absorbing the \nexcess passengers in the event of a strike, and the system could come \nto a standstill. While management and labor are affected by this, both \nparties have contingencies planned in the event of work stoppages. The \nconsumer is the one most affected by a job action.\n  The dispute resolution process in this bill is modeled on the process \nused by Major League Baseball to resolve contract disputes between \nindividual players and teams. If binding arbitration is ordered by the \nSecretary, each side must make its last, best offer. A panel of five \narbitrators would be chosen: three neutral persons and one each \nselected by the two sides. That panel would then choose one proposal or \nthe other--it could not, for example, split the difference between the \ntwo proposals. This would naturally force each side to be as reasonable \nas possible, otherwise it would risk having to live by terms proposed \nby the other side. This system has worked well for baseball and can be \nadapted for the airline industry.\n  This bill would give much greater certainty to the public, the \nunions, and the airlines that contract disputes will get resolved \nwithout disruption to the nation. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this effort to improve the system for resolving labor-\nmanagement disputes in the airline industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 1328. A bill entitled the ``Conservation and Reinvestment Act''; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, today I rise to introduce perhaps the \nmost significant conservation effort ever considered by the Congress.\n  The Conservation and Reinvestment Act, CARA, is bipartisan landmark \nlegislation that makes a multi-year commitment to conservation programs \nbenefitting all 50 States. It reinvests revenues earned from the \ndepletion of a nonrenewable asset, oil and gas reserves on the Outer \nContinent Shelf, for the protection and enhancement of our natural and \ncultural heritage, threatened coastal areas and wildlife. It also \nreinvests in our local communities and our children through enhanced \noutdoor recreational opportunities. By enacting CARA, we can ensure \nthat this century begins with the most significant commitment of \nresources to conservation ever.\n  During the 106th Congress the House of Representatives passed almost \nidentical legislation by an overwhelming vote of 315 to 102 and the \nSenate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported a version \nwith the support of the Chairman and Ranking Member. In addition, a \nbipartisan group of 63 Senators sent a letter to Majority Leader Lott \nand Minority Leader Daschle on September 19, 2000 requesting that CARA \nbe brought to the floor of the Senate for consideration before the \nadjournment of the 106th Congress. Just last week the\n\n[[Page S8750]]\n\nHouse Committee on Resources reported the bill by a vote of 29 to 12 \nand it currently has two-hundred and thirty nine co-sponsors. CARA is \nsupported by Governors, Mayors and a coalition of over 5,000 \norganizations from throughout the country.\n  This legislation provides $3.125 billion for eight distinct \nreinvestment programs including: Impact Assistance and Coastal \nConservation for all coastal states and eligible local governments and \nto mitigate the various impacts of producing states that serve as the \n``platform'' for the crucial development of federal offshore energy \nresources from the Outer Continental Shelf, restoring Congressional \nintent with respect to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, LWCF, by \nproviding stable and annual funding for the state and federal side of \nthe LWCF at its authorized $900 million level while protecting the \nrights of private property rights owners; establishing a Wildlife \nConservation and Restoration Fund at $350 million through the \nsuccessful program of Pittman-Robertson by reinvesting the development \nof nonrenewable resources into a renewable resource of wildlife \nconservation and education; providing funding for the Urban Parks and \nRecreation Recovery program through matching grants to local \ngovernments to rehabilitate and develop recreation programs, sites and \nfacilities enabling cities and towns to focus on the needs of its \npopulations within our more densely inhabited areas with fewer \ngreenspaces, playgrounds and soccer fields for our youth; providing \nfunding for the Historic Preservation Fund through the programs of the \nHistoric Preservation Act, including grants to the States, maintaining \nthe National Register of Historic Places and administering numerous \nhistoric preservation programs and fully funding the Payment In-Lieu of \nTaxes (PILT) program.\n  The time has come to take the proceeds from a non-renewable resource \nfor the purpose of reinvesting a portion of these revenues in the \nconservation and enhancement of our renewable resources. To continue to \ndo otherwise, as we have over the last fifty years, is fiscally \nirresponsible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 1329. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax incentive for land sales for conservation purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, together with Senators Bingaman, \nHatch, Grassley, Daschle, Durbin, Bond, and Chafee, I am today \nintroducing the Conservation Tax Incentives Act of 2001. As an \nincentive for voluntary conservation of environmentally significant \nland, this bill allows landowners to exclude from income fifty percent \nof the gain they realize on sales, for conservation purposes, of land \nor easements in land. This proposal, included in President Bush's \nBudget Blueprint, was a central element in his environmental platform \nduring the campaign. It is a sensible, modest tax proposal to help the \nenvironment and is supported by a wide range of groups, including the \nAmerican Farm Bureau, the Association of State Foresters, Defenders of \nWildlife, and the Nature Conservancy.\n  Landowners have a stake in the quality of life of their communities' \nenvironment. They also have a right to reap the economic benefits of \ntheir investments in land. Landowners able to make charitable \ncontributions of land for conservation purposes can realize tax \nbenefits that make it possible to achieve both their financial and \nconservation goals. For many taxpayers, however, in Vermont and \nelsewhere throughout the country, holdings in land represent a major \nfinancial asset they cannot afford to donate. Others may not have \nsufficient income to be able to take full advantage of the tax benefit \nof a charitable donation. For these landowners, a sale of the land for \ndevelopment may be the only viable way to realize the full economic \nreturn on their investment in land. We need new federal tax incentives \nto help these ``land-rich, cash-poor'' landowners protect their \ninvestments and at the same time achieve permanent conservation \ninterests. This bill provides a market-based, voluntary land \nconservation incentive to help those who own and want to conserve \nenvironmentally sensitive land but cannot afford to give it away.\n  The need for this bill has never been more pressing. We are consuming \nland at an alarming pace. The pace of land development exceeds by far \nboth the rate of population growth and the rate of open space \nconservation. In the United States, two acres of farmland per minute, \nabout a million acres per year, are lost to development. Almost one-\nthird of the species in the United States are extinct or under threat \nof extinction. Loss of open space not only threatens biodiversity, but \nalso quality of life. It increases traffic congestion, and air and \nwater pollution; it decreases opportunities for recreation; and it \nthreatens productive agricultural land. Healthy communities are made up \nto complex systems of forests, productive soils, rivers, and other \ninterdependent resources. Deforestation, the paving over of \nagricultural land, the filling-in of wetlands, and urban sprawl are \nconsuming the landscape and straining the balance of wild and human \nhabitat. The sustainability of a healthy quality of life is \nincreasingly in jeopardy.\n  My bill's approach to these problems creates no new regulatory \nauthority; it requires no appropriations; and it has no new attempts to \ndefine conservation. It creates a simple, voluntary incentive for \nprivate, market-rate sales of land, or interests in land, to government \nagencies or qualified non-profit organizations. \nIncorporating definitions and concepts that already exist in the tax \ncode, this bill provides substantial conservation benefits at a minimal \ncost--about $66 million per year, as estimated by the Joint Committee \non Taxation. Projections show that every year the bill could protect \nland valued at up to $150 million.\n\n  In drafting the bill, we were careful to ensure that land acquired \nwith this new tax incentive would truly serve conservation purposes. \nThe only qualified purchasers are publicly supported conservation \ncharitable organizations and governmental natural resource and \nenvironmental agencies; these entities have long and respected records \nof serving the public interest in acquiring and managing land for \nconservation purposes. The bill builds on that record of trust and \nresponsible stewardship without imposing new and cumbersome \nrequirements to ensure that the public interest is served.\n  In addition, the bill requires a statement by the conservation \npurchasers memorializing their intent to serve the specified \nconservation purposes. This language was crafted to protect the \npublic's conservation investment and does not create a tax-driven land \nuse restriction. In essence, we want to make sure that the intention to \nconserve land does not rob the land of the commercial value for which \nthe landowner must be compensated. The required statement of the \npurchaser's intent should not be construed to impose restrictions on \nthe property or covenants running with the land, which might result in \nan appraisal that could deny sellers the full value of their land. \nProperty should be appraised at its unencumbered, full fair market \nvalue. Furthermore, the value of property in the hands of the \npurchasing conservation entity should be its full fair market value, \nregardless of the purchaser's intent of conservation and regardless of \nthe required statement of intent. This principle is important, because \nit means that a land trust could serve as the original conservation \npurchaser and subsequently transfer the property to another cooperating \nconservation purchaser, such as a governmental agency, receiving the \nfull fair market value on the subsequent transfer.\n  This bill has broad bipartisan support. In the 106th Congress, a \nmajority of the Members of the Senate Finance Committee supported it as \nan element of the Community Renewal and New Markets Act. It is a \nmodest, bipartisan, innovative proposal that should be a part of this \nyear's environment and tax agenda, and I urge my colleagues to join me \nin support.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenators Jeffords and Hatch, as an original co-sponsor of the \nConservation Tax Incentives Act of 2001. The great conservationist Aldo \nLeopold once stated. ``That land is a community is the basic\n\n[[Page S8751]]\n\nconcept of ecology, but that land is to be loved and respected is an \nextension of ethics'' This legislation is in keeping with the \nconservation ethic so eloquently articulated by Mr. Leopold decades \nago.\n  The bill that we are introducing today will greatly expand the \nbenefits of our existing conservation land easement laws which will \nhave an enormous impact on the preservation of our nation's forests, \nprairies, deserts and open space. This legislation will save millions \nof acres of our nation's land for future generations by reducing by 50 \npercent the tax on capital gains that would normally be owned on a sale \nprovided the land or easements are sold to public or private \nconservation entities for conservation purposes. These types of sales \nof conservation and preservation organizations will enhance \nopportunities for recreation, maintain open space, help to retain lands \nin agricultural production, and preserve important habitat.\n  Whether it is riparian habitat in New Mexico, mixed grass prairie in \nthe Midwest, open space in California and the foothills of the Rocky \nMountains, or woodlands of the Southeast, this legislation would \nprovide enhanced conservation through the voluntary actions of \ncitizens. It would help to address the dramatic loss of farmland \nacreage to development. It would ensure that important habitat for \nwildlife is conserved. It would eliminate tax disincentive that keeps \nlandowners who wish to see their land preserved from reaching their \ngoal.\n  This bill will have positive impacts in New Mexico. The legislation \nwill help landowners who wish to ensure that their lands remain in \nranching in future decades or who want to preserve other open lands for \nfuture generations. The bill would provide a boost to the efforts of \nstate and local government to stretch limited conservation dollars. And \nit will enhance the ability of local land conservation organizations to \ncraft voluntary agreements with landowners to conserve lands.\n  I believe enactment of this legislation would have significant \nconsequences for our nation's landscape for generations to come. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to secure its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1330. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat amounts paid for foods for special dietary use, dietary \nsupplements, or medical foods shall be treated as medical expenses; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation, the \nDietary Supplement Tax Fairness Act, on behalf of myself and my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Hatch. This legislation will make the \ncost of dietary supplements, medical foods, and foods for special \ndietary when offered as a health insurance plan tax deductible for \nemployers and excluded from taxable income for employees. \nUnfortunately, today the tax code provides this sensible tax treatment \nfor these products only if they are prescribed drugs.\n  Our current policy is unfair and is failing to take full advantage of \nthe potential to improve health and hold down health care costs through \npreventive health care practices available to consumers. Many Americans \nare using these healthcare products to improve their health and to stay \nhealthy and would like to be able to have access to these products in \nthe form of an insurance benefit. Insurance companies and employers \nresponding to this consumer demand have been frustrated by being unable \nto offer a benefit like this in a manner consistent with other health \ncare practices which receive favorable consideration in the Internal \nRevenue Code. The White House Commission on Complementary and \nAlternative Health Care Policy has consistently heard in testimony of \nthe need for greater insurance coverage of products like the ones in my \nlegislation. Bringing the code up to date to recognize and allow for \nthis important need for wellness and health promotion is an important \nstep forward to overall sound healthcare policy.\n  I want to emphasize the importance our legislation places on quality. \nConsumers need and deserve to know that the products they are buying \nare of a high quality and consistency. With that in mind, the Dietary \nSupplement Health and Education Act of 1994 called on the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, to develop and implement Good Manufacturing \nPractice Standards, GMPs, for dietary supplements. Senator Hatch and I \nhave repeatedly pushed the FDA to produce and implement these important \nconsumer protections. After seven years, draft GMPs were published in \nthe Federal Register but have not been finalized. I am hopeful that \nthese final standards will be put in place without further delay. The \nlegislation we are introducing requires that dietary supplement and \nother products meet good manufacturing practice standards in order to \nreceive the improved tax treatment. This will offer a strong incentive \nto maintain and improve quality.\n  I urge my colleagues to review this legislation and I hope they will \njoin us in support and join us in our effort to win its passage. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1330\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act shall be known as the ``Dietary Supplement Tax \n     Fairness Act of 2001.''\n\n     SECTION 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the inclusion of foods for special dietary use, dietary \n     supplements, and medical foods in the deduction for medical \n     expenses does not subject such items to regulation as drugs,\n       (2) the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 treats such items as \n     allowable for the medical expense deduction, but only if such \n     items are prescribed drugs,\n       (3) such items have been shown through research and \n     historical use to be a valuable benefit to human health, in \n     particular disease prevention and overall good health, and\n       (4) children with inborn errors of metabolism, metabolic \n     disorders, and autism, and all individuals with diabetes, \n     autoimmune disorders, and chronic inflammatory conditions, \n     frequently require daily dietary interventions as well as \n     medical interventions to manage their conditions and such \n     dietary interventions often become a significant economic \n     burden on such individuals.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMOUNTS PAID FOR FOODS FOR SPECIAL DIETARY USE, \n                   DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS, OR MEDICAL FOODS TREATED \n                   AS MEDICAL EXPENSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 213(d) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to medical, dental, \n     etc., expenses) is amended by redesignating subparagraphs (C) \n     and (D) as subparagraphs (D) and (E), respectively, and by \n     inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(C) for foods for special dietary use, dietary \n     supplements (as defined in section 201 of the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act), and medical foods,''.\n       (b) Special Rule for Insurance Covering Foods for Special \n     Dietary Use, Dietary Supplements, and Medical Foods.--\n     Subsection (d) of section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (relating to medical, dental, etc., expenses) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(12) Special rule for insurance covering foods for \n     special dietary use, dietary supplements, and medical \n     foods.--Amounts paid for insurance covering foods and \n     supplements referred to in paragraph (1)(C) shall be treated \n     as described in paragraph (1)(E) only if such foods and \n     supplements comply with applicable good manufacturing \n     practices prescribed by the Food and Drug Administration or \n     with other comparable standards.''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Subparagraph (E) of section 213(d)(1) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986, as redesignated by subsection (a), is \n     amended by striking ``subparagraphs (A) and (B)'' and \n     inserting ``subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C)''.\n       (2) The last sentence of section 213(d)(1) of such Code is \n     amended by striking ``subparagraph (D)'' and inserting \n     ``subparagraph (E)''.\n       (3) Paragraph (6) of section 213(d) of such Code is \n     amended--\n       (A) by striking ``and (C)'' and inserting ``(C), and (D)'', \n     and\n       (B) by striking ``paragraph (1)(D)'' in subparagraph (A) \n     and inserting ``paragraph (1)(E)''.\n       (4) Paragraph (7) of section 213(d) of such Code is amended \n     by striking ``and (C)'' and inserting ``(C), and (D)''.\n       (5) Sections 72(t)(2)(D)(i)(III) and 7702B(a)(4) of such \n     Code are each amended by striking ``section 213(d)(1)(D)'' \n     and inserting ``section 213(d)(1)(E)''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 1332. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \ncertain\n\n[[Page S8752]]\n\nseverance payment amounts from income; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I rise to introduce a bill that is \nintended to provide tax relief for people who have lost their jobs due \nto the current economic slowdown and the fact that many corporations \nare now forced to downsize their workforces. The number of layoffs this \ncalendar year is approaching an all-time high. There were over 770,000 \njob cuts during the first six (6) months of the year. U.S. employers \ncut 124,852 jobs during the month of June. The June figure increased 56 \npercent from May, 80,140, and marked the sixth time in seven months \nthat job cuts exceeded 100,000. Last month the number was actually 624 \npercent, over June, 2000 when job cuts totaled just 17,241 which was a \nthree (3) year record low.\n  I am introducing a bill which will provide tax relief to these \ndisplaced workers. This legislation will exclude the first $5,000 of \nseverance pay received by people who may be adjusting to an extended \nperiod of unemployment in an economy that is no longer bustling. This \nexclusion is available for any displaced worker whose overall severance \npayment does not exceed $125,000.\n  Under present tax law, severance payments are included in gross \nincome. However, severance pay is not intended to be included as part \nof a worker's wage. Rather, it is intended to be a supplement to assist \nthem during unemployment. Displaced workers often lose nearly a third \nof their severance packages to taxes. The lump sums they receive in \nseverance pay drives them up into a higher tax bracket that is not \nrepresentative of their true income or standard of living.\n  Corporations are already allowed to write-off the severance packages \nthey provide to laid off employees, yet the workers are often adversely \neffected. For good reasons this body has devoted much time and \nattention this session to determining how to return to American tax \npayers that which is rightfully theirs. Clearly, these displaced \nworkers deserve what is truly fair tax treatment at a time when they \ncould truly benefit from it.\n  The economic prosperity of the last decade benefitted most Americans. \nUnfortunately, many of the industries most adversely effected by the \ncurrent economic cycle contributed greatly to our unprecedented growth. \nTherefore, it is inexcusable for our government to disregard the needs \nof these displaced workers. It is important that our government take \nsteps to help these workers by removing the unfair tax burden that is \nplaced upon them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1333. A bill to enhance the benefits of the national electric \nsystem by encouraging and supporting State programs for renewable \nenergy sources, universal electric service, affordable electric \nservice, and energy conservation and efficiency, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nestablish renewable energy targets for electricity sales, an electric \nsystems benefit fund, and net metering programs to ensure a clean, \nsustainable energy future. I am pleased to be joined by Mr. Lieberman, \nMs. Snowe, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Kerry in introducing the ``Renewable \nEnergy and Energy Efficiency Investment Act of 2001''.\n  This bill will help bring renewable energy sources and energy \nefficiency technologies from the minds of the American entrepreneur to \nthe fields of the American farmer, to the hills where strong winds \nblow, and to the roofs of our homes. Investing in and utilizing these \ntechnologies offers tremendous benefits for the health of our citizens, \nenvironment and economy. It is time for our Nation to transition from \nsmokestacks, coal power and smog to a future with windmills, solar \npower and blue skies.\n  Our Nation has vast, untapped resources than can power our homes and \nbusinesses using the heat of the earth, the brilliance of the sun and \nthe strength of the wind. Unlike the limited fossil fuel resources, \nthese sources of energy are forever replacing themselves. All we have \nto do is harness them.\n  Today, renewables are beginning to take hold. Wind power, for \nexample, is the fastest growing form of energy in the world. Worldwide \nalmost 4,000 megawatts of new wind energy capacity were added in the \nyear 2000. Other forms of renewable energy, such as solar, biomass and \ngeothermal, offer the same potential and the same benefits. These \ntechnologies provide high-tech jobs for U.S. workers. They help reduce \nacid rain and other forms of air pollution, including greenhouse gas \nemissions. They are not subject to supply changes that lead to large \nfluctuations in the price of fossil fuels and they help us reduce our \ndependence on foreign sources of fossil fuels.\n  There is perhaps no better time to push these technologies forward. \nOur Nation is focused on energy issues make it was in the last decade. \nWe are at crossroads where we can begin to see the end of the path \ntoward a clean, sustainable energy future. Renewable energy is the most \nimportant landmark on that path. Let me describe how this bill will \nmake this happen.\n  First, our bill will put in place a Nation-wide wires charge to \ncreate an electric system benefit fund. This will help develop \nrenewable energy sources, promote energy efficiency and assist low-\nincome residents meet their energy needs.\n  Second, our legislation will make it cheaper and easier for consumers \nto install renewable energy sources in their homes, farms, and small \nbusiness by simplifying the metering process.\n  Third, our bill has a comprehensive disclosure provision, giving \nconsumers honest and verifiable information regarding their energy \nchoices.\n  Finally, our bill will require the suppliers of electricity to \ninclude a minimum amount of renewable energy in the products that they \nsell. We start with 2.5 percent in the first year and work up to 20 \npercent by the year 2020. The Union of Concerned Scientists found that \nthis program is achievable and will lead to tremendous reductions in \nair, water and other pollutants that turn our blue skies to grey. \nEnergy Information Administration also found that this program would \nlead to an 18 percent decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide we \nrelease compared to the status quo and ease supply pressures on and \nprices of natural gas. All these benefits come at the same time that we \nestablish our nation as a leader in developing and manufacturing the \ncutting edge technologies that will not only power our economy, but the \neconomies of countries all over the world.\n  Our nation's future depends on having clean, reliable, and \nsustainable sources of energy. With this bill we can ensure that future \nbecomes a reality. At the same time, we can capture the global market \nfor renewable energy and we can increase our energy security. Most \nimportantly, we can know that our children and grandchildren will thank \nus for giving them a clean, sustainable energy supply.\n  I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1333\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Renewable Energy and Energy \n     Efficiency Investment Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the generation of electricity is unique in its combined \n     influence on the security, environmental quality, and \n     economic efficiency of the United States;\n       (2) the generation and sale of electricity has a direct and \n     profound impact on interstate commerce;\n       (3) the Federal Government and the States have a joint \n     responsibility for the maintenance of public purpose programs \n     affected by the national electric system;\n       (4) notwithstanding the public's interest in and enthusiasm \n     for programs that enhance the environment, encourage the \n     efficient use of resources, and provide for affordable and \n     universal service, the investments in those public purposes \n     by existing means continues to decline;\n       (5) the dependence of the United States on foreign sources \n     of fossil fuels is contrary to our national security;\n       (6) alternative, sustainable energy sources must be \n     pursued;\n       (7) consumers have a right to certain information in order \n     to make objective choices on their electric service \n     providers; and\n\n[[Page S8753]]\n\n       (8) net metering of small systems for self-generation of \n     electricity is in the public interest in order to encourage \n     private investment in renewable energy resources, stimulate \n     economic growth, and enhance the continued diversification of \n     the energy resources used in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Madam President, today Senator Jeffords, Senator \nSnowe, and I are introducing the Renewable Energy Act of 2001. This is \na landmark bill as it sets a national goal of fueling 20 percent of our \nelectricity generation with renewable energy sources by the year 2020. \nFor our long-term energy policy, setting such a goal is important. In \naddition to supporting traditional hydrocarbon fuel sources, we must \nalso invest in those sources, like solar, wind, geothermal, and \nbiomass, that will not eventually run dry. Such investments will also \nsignificantly lessen our vulnerability to our foreign energy suppliers. \nFurthermore, nations such as Japan and Denmark have already made great \nstrides in advancing renewable technologies and it is in our economic \ninterest to be able to compete on the international market. While some \nof the details of the bill need ongoing evaluation and tuning, we \nshould view this bill as stating a goal, not as the detailed road map \non how to get there. For example, the definition of renewables needs \nfurther attention and expansion. But I believe the Renewable Energy Act \nsets laudable goals to aspire to and makes a useful statement about our \nnational priorities as we approach the energy debate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER.\n  S. 1334. A bill to require increases in the strengths of the full-\ntime support personnel for the Army National Guard of the United States \nthrough fiscal year 2001 to support the readiness and training of the \nArmy National Guard of the United States to meet increasing mission \nrequirements, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nfulfill an urgent need of the Army National Guard.\n  I recently visited the Headquarters of the Virginia National Guard \nand the Maneuver Training Center at Fort Pickett. I conferred with \nMajor General Claude A. Williams, the Adjutant General, of the Virginia \nNational Guard. Major General Williams heads a superb organization \ncomposed of outstanding units, including the 29th Infantry Division, \nLight, the 91st Troop Command, the 28th Engineer Brigade, the 54th \nField Artillery Brigade, and the 192nd Fighter Wing. The Maneuver \nTraining Center at Fort Picket and its personnel perform a vital \ntraining mission for units of the active Army, Army Guard, and Reserve.\n  I was astonished to learn during my visit last month that the Army \nhas funded only 59 percent of the validated operational billets for \nActive Guard and Reserve, ``AGRs'', and military technicians within the \nArmy National Guard units. The ``full rate'' in Virginia is even lower \nthan this national\n\n[[Page S8756]]\n\naverage, only 51 percent. I raised a question about this and expressed \nmy concern to the Secretary of the Army and Chief of Staff of the Army \nat a recent Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.\n  The legislation I am introducing today requires annual increases in \nthe numbers of full time active-duty officers and military technicians \nin the Army National Guard--724 AGRs and 487 military technicians each \nyear for the next 11 years. The legislation is based on a plan drawn \nup, cooperatively, by the Active Army and the Army National Guard. When \nfully implemented, the increases contained in the legislation will \nraise the Guard's ``fill rate'' from its present level of 59 percent of \nvalid personnel requirements, to a level of 71 percent--an acceptable \nlevel within current force structure and readiness planning parameters.\n  AGRs and Military Technicians are critically important force \nmultipliers for Army National Guard units. They directly impact \ntraining, command and control, technical, functional, and military \nexpertise required to effectively train, administer, and prepare ready \nunits and equipment for transition from peacetime to a wartime posture. \nAGRs and Military Technicians perform functions vital for meeting \nsupply, training, and maintenance requirements of the Army National \nGuard units.\n  The increases in authorized end strengths set forth in this \nlegislation are essential because of the increased reliance on Guard \nunits to carry out Army missions. Each Army National Guard division has \nbeen assigned rotational duty in Bosnia-Herzegovina with the \nStabilization Force, SFOR, missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 29th \nInfantry Division, Light, of the Virginia National Guard is now fully \nengaged in executing its phased deployment to Bosnia and will be in \nplace in October of this year. I applaud the Army for its ongoing \nefforts to integrate the National Guard in its operational planning. \nThe Guard needs these soldiers in place in their full time support \nroles to ensure its success.\n  I know that Army leaders must make difficult decisions each year \nbased on changing priorities and requirements and that the President \nmust do the same in his annual budget submission. I am convinced, \nhowever, that the increases in end strength prescribed in this \nlegislation are necessary and must be assigned the highest priority.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Daschle, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Corzine, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. \n        Conrad):\n  S. 1335. A bill to support business incubation in academic settings; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin introducing the LEADERS Act--the Linking Educators And Developing \nEntrepreneurs for Reaching Success Act. Our bipartisan goal is to bring \ntogether entrepreneurs and academic institutions to encourage small \nbusinesses. These innovative centers can have a significant role in the \nmodern economy, and provide needed cutting-edge educational and \nentrepreneurial opportunities for college students.\n  I commend Senator DeWine for his leadership in developing this \nbipartisan legislation, and for his continuing leadership on economic \nand education issues. We agree that college-affiliated business \nincubators can be effective tools in improving education and the \neconomy, and this legislation is designed to encourage them.\n  A business incubator facilitates economic development by providing \nspecific resources and services to entrepreneurial, start-up companies. \nThis assistance often includes office space at discounted rent, access \nto telephone and Internet services, consulting opportunities, and other \nappropriate technical assistance. The goal of such business incubators \nis to produce successful firms that will be successful in the long run \nthrough modest and timely start-up assistance.\n  Business incubators can have an important role in strengthening and \nsustaining local economies. Several studies have shown that incubated \nbusinesses tend to survive longer, create more jobs, remain in their \ncommunities, and provide worthwhile benefits to their employees.\n  One of the best ways to encourage entrepreneurship is to enhance the \nrole of colleges and universities in developing new ideas into \nsustainable businesses that prosper, remain in their communities, and \nprovide good jobs and good benefits to local workers in the cities and \ntowns that need them most. Business incubators will benefit colleges \nand universities as well, because they can provide students with real-\nlife examples of emerging businesses and case studies to enhance their \neducational experience.\n  Our legislation creates a program in the Department of Education to \nsupport academic-affiliated business incubators. A $20 million fund \nwill offer competitive grants to acquire or renovate space, develop \ncurricula and training for incubator businesses or managers, and \nconduct feasibility studies for developing and locating incubators.\n  Eligible applicants will include non-profit organizations that have \nan affiliation with a college or university and that manage an \nincubator. Priority is given to incubators in economically distressed \nareas, to applications which provide strong educational opportunities \nin entrepreneurship, and to applications that emphasize cooperation by \nbusinesses, academic institutions, local economic leaders, and local \ngovernment officials.\n  Small business entrepreneurs have an outstanding track record of \nproducts that improve and often save lives. Today these entrepreneurs \ntake advantage of innovative ideas and turn them into job and economic \ngrowth. Entrepreneurs can benefit immensely from contacts with academic \ninstitutions, and Congress should encourage those contacts.\n\n  Colleges and universities often have well-equipped laboratories, good \ncomputer systems, and extensive libraries. They can be a source of \nideas that spur business creation. Colleges and universities can also \nprovide the skills and experience of a dedicated faculty, and the \nenthusiasm and potential of today's students.\n  Current studies show that nearly seven out of ten teenagers want to \ncontrol their own destinies by becoming entrepreneurs. Six in ten young \nwomen, seven in ten Hispanic youth, and nearly eight in ten African-\nAmerican youth are interested in starting a business of their own. But \ntoo many of these young men and women say they know little about how to \nstart their own business. A large majority are taught little about how \nbusiness or the economy works.\n  Students who benefit from such instruction start more new business, \ndevelop more new products, and are more likely to be involved in high-\ntechnology initiatives than their peers. Most entrepreneurs say that \nthey ``learned by doing''--through hands-on access to mentors and \nsimilar opportunities. Our legislation will provide access to real-\nworld examples of entrepreneurship and business development, and help \nlay a stronger foundation for growing and thriving firms.\n  More and more, academic institutions across the country recognize \nthis opportunity by establishing successful business incubators. In \nMassachusetts, Salem State College and the University of Massachusetts \nat Lowell have created successful incubators on their campuses.\n  Other incubators are reaching out to colleges and universities. The \nCommonwealth Corporation, a leader in workforce training in \nMassachusetts, has established an incubator and is actively pursuing \nties in Boston with The University of Massachusetts.\n  Increasingly today, business leaders are recognizing the advantages \nof affiliations with institutions of higher learning, and academic \nleaders are welcoming the idea of including entrepreneurial projects in \ntheir curricula. In many cases, faculty members themselves are \nlaunching incubators.\n  It makes sense for Congress to support these constructive \npartnerships. The LEADERS Act can make a worthwhile contribution to \nthis growing movement, and I look forward to early action by the Senate \nto approve it.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I rise today, along with my good friend, \nSenator Kennedy, to introduce the ``Linking Educators And Developing \nEntrepreneurs for Reaching Success\n\n[[Page S8757]]\n\nAct of 2001'' (LEADERS Act). This bipartisan measure will help foster \nbusiness development by strengthening academic affiliated business \nincubators.\n  Our Nation's ability to expand economically hinges on new business \ngrowth. Small businesses provide 75 percent of the new jobs in this \ncountry, and in 1999, the number of new employer firms outnumbered the \namount of business closures. Though our American entrepreneurial spirit \nis alive and well, as most businessmen and women can attest, starting \nand maintaining a business is very difficult. In the first two years, \nmore than half of all new businesses fail and, after four years, the \nfailure rate climbs to more than 60 percent.\n  That's why business incubation is so important. These incubators are \ncenters designed to accelerate the successful development of new \ncompanies. They offer an array of business support resources. Most of \nthe incubators provide their clients with access to appropriate rental \nspace and flexible leases, shared services and equipment, technology \nsupport services, and assistance in obtaining financing for growth. \nThey also provide a range of services like management guidance, \ntechnical assistance, and consulting. Such support an incubation \nincreases the chance of small business survival to about 86 percent.\n  Our LEADERS Act authorizes the Secretary of Education to provide \ncompetitive grants to nonprofit organizations that manage incubators \nand are affiliated with academic institutions. These grants can be used \nto acquire or renovate space for an incubator or to support curriculums \ndeveloped by businesses, faculty, entrepreneurs, and local leaders. The \nSecretary also can award a grant to help fund feasibility studies to \nhelp colleges or local development officials determine the viability of \nan incubator in their respective communities.\n  The Act would authorize $20 million for grants in each of the next \nthree fiscal years. The nonprofit organizations that receive funding \nunder the bill would be required to match federal contributions dollar \nfor dollar, and their proposals must have the support of local \ncommunity leaders.\n  Many of the non-profit incubators include universities, which are an \nintegral part of the business incubation process. Academic affiliated \nincubators provide unique educational opportunities for students and \nentrepreneurs. This is accomplished with enhanced access to a skilled \nworkforce and a wealth of resources. Ohio is the home of one of the \noldest university-based business incubators, the Ohio University \nInnovation Center, which was established in 1982. Since it's inception, \nthe Center has created 625 jobs, including 125 for students. A number \nof other important institutions in Ohio, such as The Ohio State \nUniversity, Bowling Green State University, Case Western Reserve \nUniversity, Franklin University, John Carroll University, University of \nCincinnati, and University of Dayton operate business incubators.\n  The goal of the incubator is simple: to produce successful, \nfinancially viable firms. And, studies show that business incubation \nworks. Almost 87 percent of incubated companies remain in operation, \nwith roughly 84 percent of them remaining in their home communities. It \nis vital that we give small businesses the necessary tools to stay \nafloat and to prosper. This legislation will help to foster the next \ngeneration of successful entrepreneurs and ultimately further bolster \nthe stability of our economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and our efforts to \nhelp America's entrepreneurs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL:\n  S. 1337. A bill to provide for national digital school districts; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the National \nDigital School District Act, a bill that embraces the powerful role \ntechnology can have as a tool in educating our nation's children.\n  Just as technology has brought innovation and efficiency to our daily \nlives and our businesses, technology has already demonstrated its \nenormous potential to enhance the ways that we can prepare our children \nto meet the educational demands of the changing economy.\n  Across the country, we have seen how proper uses of technology can \ntransform a conventional curriculum into a multi-media, interactive \nexperience that not only helps children learn more effectively, but \ndoes so in a way that is enjoyable and fosters a student's passion for \nlearning.\n  In numerous recent studies, including those done by the Department of \nEducation, the White House Office on Science and Technology and the \nRAND Corporation, researchers have found that technology has a very \npositive impact on serving the goals of education in important ways, \nincluding:\n  1. Supporting student performance--technology provides opportunities \nfor acquiring problem-solving skills and methods for learning in \ninnovative and interactive ways.\n  2. Increased motivation and self-esteem--studies have found that one \nof the most common effects of technology on students was an increase in \nthe motivation of students who experience education in new and \nenjoyable ways.\n  3. Preparing students for the future--as both higher education and \nthe workplace are increasingly becoming infused with technology, \ntechnology is a crucial component of student preparation, and;\n  The potential impact of technology on education is no secret. In \nfact, schools have dramatically increased their focus on putting \ntechnology in the classroom. Both the public and private sector have \nbeen diligently wiring school buildings and putting computers in many \nclassrooms, making access to computers and the Internet increasingly \ncommonplace.\n  But as the old saying goes, you can lead a horse to water, but you \ncan't make it drink. The same is true for children, just putting \ntechnology into a school does not ensure that teachers know how to use \nit or children are able to learn from it.\n  Unless technology is properly integrated into curriculum, the \nstudents will not realize the benefits of having the access. Without \nteachers who know how to use computers to teach the kids, the kids will \nnot benefit.\n  In addition to computers and access, we need to assure teacher \ntraining and curriculum development. This legislation is a good first \nstep toward fixing this problem, in effect, bridging the technology and \nteaching divide.\n  To accomplish this goal, our bill takes two tracks, first, the \nlegislation establishes a grant program in which the state and federal \ngovernment share the responsibility to create model programs to team \ntechnology with curriculum and teacher training--to develop \ncomprehensive approaches to using technology in education.\n  Second, to help identify best practices, the legislation will also \nrequire a study to evaluate and highlight which of these strategies \nwork and which do not work in bringing technology to the classroom.\n  Schools across the country are being given the tool of technology. \nIndeed, the total annual investment in education technology is \ncurrently almost $5 billion per year.\n  According to a recently released study by NetDay, although 97 percent \nof teachers have some type of access to computers in their schools, \nonly 32 percent of teachers say that computers are well integrated into \ntheir classrooms and curricula.\n  We can do better.\n  Teachers around the country are finding ways to enhance the classroom \nexperience by teaching conventional topics with technological tools. \nSchools and businesses in my home State of Washington are leaders in \nthese areas.\n  For example, in rural, agricultural Eastern Washington, Diane \nPeterson wanted to improve her Waterville Elementary 4th and 5th \ngraders' success with math, science, reading, and writing. She found \nthat University of Washington scientists needed data gathered on local \nvegetation and weather--she put those facts together and came up with a \nplan. Students were able to use 3-mail and shared web-sites to write, \norganize and present a useful study to the Western Washington \nscientists. The students are learning math and science skills through \nreal-world experience, possible only through the use of the Internet. \nAnd helping science to boot.\n  Also, administrators in districts around the countries are \nincreasingly\n\n[[Page S8758]]\n\nfinding particular methods and strategies that are crucial to realizing \nthe value of technology. The Seattle Public School District, for \nexample, has undertaken an effort to employ at every school a person \nwho, with expertise in both education and technology, trains and \nadvises teachers in how to use technology to teach different subjects. \nTeachers now have a resource to guide them as they bring technology \ninto the classroom. The district has found that having a person who can \neducate teachers and help them make the most of the technology \navailable to them can make the difference between technology as an \neducational tool or as a waste of money.\n\n  The Bill and Melinda Gates foundations have been leaders in improving \neducation through the use of technology. For example, in Washington \nState, the Foundation had created the $45 million ``Teacher Leadership \nProject,'' a grant program to provide leadership development for 1,000 \nK-12 teachers a year, over three years. Participants receive in-depth \ntraining, as well as hardware and software to create a technology-rich \nlearning environment. Teachers attend workshops and seminars, \nparticipate in e-mail discussions, keep records of the experiences, and \nassist with assessment and evaluation. Clearly, assessment and \nevaluation are critical to the future application for this program. \nThis program is an excellent model to bring technology into the \nclassroom.\n  These programs show that when used effectively, technology can \nenhance learning.\n  But to fully employ technology as an educational tool across the \ncountry we must develop programs that take into account the real needs \nfor education and that can be scaled for implementation by any school \nor district.\n  Successful strategies are those that not only install computers, but \nalso integrate these resources in three crucial ways, through:\n  1. Teacher Training and professional development--We must teach the \nteachers so they can use technology to teach the children.\n  2. Curriculum development--Technology isn't helpful unless it is \nincorporated into lesson plans.\n  3. Resource allocation--In order to be successful, a program should \nmatch the technology needs to the goals of the program.\n  The National Digital School District Act addresses these important \nelements of technology in education by requiring that local and state \nagencies incorporate these criteria into their education plans.\n  Through these requirements, the National Digital School District Act \nwill encourage the development of best practices for the use of \ntechnology in schools; practices that can be scaled up in states and \nlocal districts around the country.\n  Additionally, this legislation will ensure that the Department of \nEducation leads the way in identifying best practices for the use of \ntechnology by assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of these \nstrategies.\n  Teachers, administrators, private sector organizations, and non-\nprofit groups are developing innovative approaches in countless \nclassrooms, schools and districts.\n  Too often, however, the programs and strategies are springing up in \nisolation--without any mechanisms to facilitate the evaluation and \nsharing of the results of these efforts.\n  My bill will bridge this information gap. Not only will this \nlegislation help provide assistance to schools, districts and states as \nthey begin using technology in the classroom, but this will help ensure \nthat federal monies are spent prudently and effectively.\n  The National Digital School District Act directs the Secretary of \nEducation to complete a comprehensive report after three years to \ndescribe what works and what doesn't work--providing guidance to \neducators and policymakers at the federal, state and local levels. This \nreport will describe the strategies being implemented around the \ncountry that best achieve their intended goals.\n  Using this report we will be able to identify which programs work \nwell and could be adapted successfully for use in other school \ndistricts. The report need not be exhaustive, but it must be \ncomprehensive--if a program works, we should know about it. We need a \nclear inventory of successful programs to identify the best practices \neducators can implement.\n  The National Digital School District Act will succeed in identifying \nthese practices and helping to bridge the gap between the vast \npotential for technology as an educational tool, and the challenges \nfacing teachers who uses it in the classroom.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1338. A bill to expand and enhance the Little Bighorn Battlefield \nNational Monument; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, the ultimate test of patriotism has \nalways been the willingness to die for one's country. To step in harm's \nway, to face shots fired in anger for the sake of defending those \nthings one holds sacred, these are acts of courage that people admire \nalmost instinctively. So much so that we even admire the courage \ndisplayed by our enemies.\n  Those of us who witness such bravery, either up close or from \naccounts written years ago, often feel compelled to make some gesture \nthat acknowledges the heroism and sacrifice of those who were willing \nto endure the horror of war.\n  For this reason, our Nation has a long tradition of setting aside and \npreserving the sites where important battles have occurred, believing \nthat such ground is hallowed by those who gave their lives in conflict, \nand in the hope that understanding the events of our past helps us to \nunderstand the kind of people we are. A necessary part of this honoring \nis attempting to preserve the appearance of the places where these \nbattles occurred as the combatants would have experienced them and to \nfreeze these locations in time as much as possible.\n  Today, I am proud to offer a bill that will continue to protect the \nsanctity of one such place: the Little Bighorn Battlefield National \nMonument in southern Montana, the site where Gen. George Armstrong \nCuster and the U.S. Seventh Cavalry were defeated by a united force of \nNorthern Cheyenne, Arapaho and Lakota Indians, in 1876.\n  Anyone who has stood, looking down past the grave markers to the \ntrees along the Little Bighorn River, can tell you that it is a \nhaunting place to visit. As you walk along Battle Ridge where soldiers \nof the U.S. Seventh Cavalry and Indian warriors struggled furiously, it \nis easy to imagine exactly how it looked on that hot June day when so \nmany men died.\n  But anyone who has stood on that same hill recently can also tell you \nthat beyond the trees are the telltale signs of commercial development \ncreeping up on the borders of the Monument. For years the site was \nprotected by its sheer isolation. That is no longer the case. The \nactual battle occurred across a wide area, and only a very small part \nof that area is protected by inclusion in the Monument. Other \nhistorically important sites nearby have already been overrun by \ndevelopment. Hills have been graded and geographical features have been \naltered. Action must be taken quickly if we are to preserve the \nMonument looking as it did over a century ago.\n\n  The bill I am introducing proposes a way for additional lands to be \nprotected by the Monument. This bill does this by establishing a \nCommittee composed of all interested parties, both those with current \ninterests and those with historical interests in this piece of land, \nwhich will keep a registry of important sites that might be taken into \nthe Monument. It is my belief that through a consultative process and \ncooperation, all interests can be accommodated. I have used this \ninclusionary process before with the research and protection of the \nSand Creek National Historic Site in Colorado.\n  In the 102nd Congress, while serving as a member of the House, I \nintroduced the bill that changed the name of this monument from the \nCuster Battlefield National Monument to the Little Bighorn National \nMonument, to recognize that there were heroes on both sides of this \nconflict: not only Custer, but also Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse and \nthousands of other warriors.\n  I wanted to reclaim the memory of that day for Indian people, and to \nmake clear that the tragedy of June 26, 1876, was just one small part \nof a much larger tragedy: the near destruction of a people and the \nending of a way of life.\n\n[[Page S8759]]\n\nThe Indian victory at the Little Bighorn that day was only a brief \npause in the march of history, it was the beginning of the end. One \nweek later the Untied States marked its first centennial, only one \nhundred years of existence.\n  This country needs places like the Little Bighorn Battlefield, just \nas we need places like Bunker Hill and Gettsburg and Omaha Beach, \nlocations made special by the extraordinary events that occurred there. \nWe need to keep them separate and sacred and dedicated to the belief \nthat some things are worthy of laying down your life. They are, in the \nfullest sense of the word, monuments: reminders of what is important.\n  The Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument is such a place. I \nask this Congress to join me in ensuring that this Monument remain a \nspecial place for generations to come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1338\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Little Bighorn Battlefield \n     National Monument Enhancement Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The following events were key in the creation of the \n     Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument:\n       (A) On June 25 and 26, 1876, a historic battle between the \n     United States Seventh Cavalry, led by General George \n     Armstrong Custer, and an opposing force of Arapaho, Northern \n     Cheyenne, and Lakota Indians, was fought near the Little \n     Bighorn River in southern Montana.\n       (B) On August 1, 1879, the battlefield was officially \n     recognized and designated as a national cemetery under \n     General Order No. 78, Headquarters of the Army.\n       (C) On December 7, 1886, Executive Order No. 337443 \n     established the boundary, approximately one mile square, for \n     the National Cemetery of Custer's Battlefield Reservation.\n       (D) On April 14, 1926, the Reno-Benteen Battlefield was \n     acquired by an Act of Congress (44 Stat. 168), and the Army \n     was ordered to take charge of the site.\n       (E) On April 15, 1930, by an Act of Congress (46 Stat. \n     168), all rights, titles and privileges of the Crow tribe, \n     from whose reservation the battlefield site was carved, were \n     granted to the United States.\n       (F) On August 10, 1939, a public historical museum was \n     authorized (53 Stat. 1337).\n       (G) On June 3, 1940, Executive Order No. 8428 transferred \n     management of the area to the National Park Service, \n     Department of the Interior.\n       (H) On March 22, 1946, by an Act of Congress (Public Law \n     79-332) the area was redesignated, Custer Battlefield \n     National Monument.\n       (I) On January 3, 1991, by an Act of Congress (Public Law \n     102-201), Custer Battlefield National Monument was \n     redesignated as Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Monument''), and an Indian \n     memorial was authorized.\n       (2) The current total size of the Monument is 765.34 acres. \n     This includes the areas immediately surrounding the cemetery \n     and a separate area, the Reno-Benteen Battlefield, a few \n     miles from the cemetery. There are additional sites of \n     historical interest related to the 1876 battle that are not \n     contained within the boundaries of the Monument as it is \n     presently constituted.\n       (3) The United States has a tradition of preserving the \n     sites of historic battles, in the conviction that such ground \n     is hallowed by the sacrifices of those who gave their lives \n     in conflict, and in the hope that understanding the events of \n     our past, especially tragic events, helps us to understand \n     the people we have become. A necessary part of this \n     preserving and honoring is attempting, as much as is \n     possible, to maintain the appearance of the places where \n     these struggles occurred as the participants would have \n     experienced them.\n       (4) The area surrounding the Monument has seen markedly \n     increased commercial development in recent years. Such \n     development not only threatens to intrude on the experience \n     of visitors to the Monument, but in many instances the \n     development has actually taken place directly on sites of \n     historical importance, irrevocably altering physical features \n     of the landscape that are crucial for understanding what took \n     place at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.\n       (5) It is in the interest of the United States to preserve \n     the integrity of the site of the Battle of the Little \n     Bighorn, an event of lasting significance for the United \n     States and for the sovereign Indian nations. In order to \n     preserve this historical treasure, it is imperative that \n     additional lands surrounding the Monument be set aside and \n     given protected status or be made part of the Monument \n     itself.\n       (6) All areas of the Monument, as well as the other areas \n     of historical interest, are completely contained within the \n     external boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation.\n       (7) There is every indication that additional land and \n     facilities are available for inclusion in the Monument \n     through either voluntary conveyance or by gift or donation \n     from private individuals and entities.\n       (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n       (1) to establish a cooperative and collaborative process \n     for expanding and enhancing the Monument;\n       (2) to ensure that the process established by this Act \n     reflects the social, historical and cultural concerns of the \n     Indian tribes participating in such processes in a manner \n     consistent with the long-standing Federal policy to encourage \n     tribal self-determination; and\n       (3) to ensure that the resources within the Monument are \n     protected and enhanced by--\n       (A) providing for partnerships between the Crow Tribe, the \n     National Park Service, and the Native American Tribes who \n     participated in the Battle of Little Bighorn; and\n       (B) encouraging private individuals and entities to donate \n     land and facilities to the Monument.\n\n     SEC. 3. LITTLE BIGHORN BATTLEFIELD NATIONAL MONUMENT \n                   ENHANCEMENT COMMITTEE.\n\n       (a) In General.--There is established a committee to be \n     known as the ``Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument \n     Enhancement Committee'' (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Committee'').\n       (b) Composition.--The Committee shall be composed of--\n       (1) 1 member appointed by the Secretary of Interior to \n     represent the Department of Interior;\n       (2) 3 members appointed by the Secretary of Interior to \n     represent the Native American tribes who participated in the \n     Battle of Little Bighorn; and\n       (3) 1 member appointed by the Crow Indian tribe.\n       (c) Administrative Provisions.--\n       (1) Quorum; meetings.--Three members of the Committee shall \n     constitute a quorum. The Committee shall act and provide \n     advise by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members \n     voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present. The \n     Committee shall meet on a regular basis.

Committee meetings shall be held at \n     locations and in such a manner as to ensure adequate public \n     involvement.\n       (2) Advisory functions.--The Committee shall advise the \n     Secretary to ensure that the Monument, its resources and \n     landscape, is sensitive to the history being portrayed and \n     artistically commendable.\n       (3) Technical staff.--In order to provide staff support and \n     technical services to assist the Committee in carrying out \n     its duties under this Act, upon the request of the Committee, \n     the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to detail any \n     personnel of the National Park Service to the Committee.\n       (4) Compensation.--Members of the Committee shall serve \n     without compensation but shall be entitled to travel \n     expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, in the \n     same manner as persons employed intermittently in Government \n     service under section 5703 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (5) Charter.--The provisions of section 14(b) of the \n     Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. Appendix; 86 Stat. \n     776), are hereby waived with respect to the Committee.\n       (d) Duties.--The Committee shall--\n       (1) maintain a registry of facilities and land that may be \n     offered by private individuals and entities by gift, sale, \n     transfer, or other voluntary conveyance for inclusion in the \n     Monument;\n       (2) by a majority vote determined whether some or all of a \n     parcel of land or facility listed on the registry under \n     paragraph (1) is appropriate for inclusion as a part of the \n     Monument; and\n       (3) in the case of a positive recommendation under \n     subparagraph (A), provide advise to the Secretary on--\n       (A) whether the land or facility involved may be available \n     for no or nominal consideration or under what terms and \n     conditions the owner of such land or facility would be \n     willing to transfer such land or facility for inclusion in \n     the Monument for no or nominal consideration; or\n       (B) whether the Committee recommends the use of the Fund \n     established under section 5 to acquire such land or facility.\n\n     SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this act shall be construed to limit or impair \n     the jurisdiction or authority of the Crow Indian tribe.\n\n     SEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF FUND.\n\n       There is established in the Treasury of the United States a \n     fund to be known as the ``Little Bighorn Battlefield National \n     Monument Enhancement Fund''. The Fund shall be used as \n     provided for in section 3(d)(3)(B) and shall include--\n       (1) all amounts appropriated to the Fund; and\n       (2) all amounts donated to the Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1339. A bill to amend the Bring Them Home Alive Act of 2000 to \nprovide an asylum program with regard to American Persian Gulf War POW/\nMIAs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S8760]]\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce the \n``Persian Gulf War POW/MIA Accountability Act of 2001.'' This bill will \nhelp persuade foreign Nations and their inhabitants to take necessary \nand sometimes risky steps needed to return any surviving American POW/\nMIAs from the Persian Gulf War by providing asylum to those foreign \nnationals who cooperate.\n  This bill builds on S. 484, the Bring Them Home Alive Act of 2000, \nwhich I introduced in the 106th Congress. This legislation was signed \ninto law last November. As many of you know, this law provides for the \ngranting of refugee status in the United States to nations of certain \nforeign countries in which American Vietnam War POW/MIAs or American \nKorean War POW/MIAs may be present.\n  On January 17, 1991, Lieutenant Commander Michael Speicher's F-18 was \nshot down over Western Iraq during the first hours of the Persian Gulf \nWar. Based on the accounts of other pilots flying in the mission and 12 \nhours of radio silence, Lieutenant Commander Speicher was declared \nMissing in Action, MIA, the next day. On May 22, 1991, his status was \nchanged to Killed in Action/Body Not Recovered, KIA/BNR.\n  In December 1995, investigators from the Army and Navy found the \ncrash site of Lieutenant Commander Speicher's F-18. Located at the \ncrash site were used flares and parts of a survival kit. Near the site, \nthe canopy of the plane was found which would indicate that Lieutenant \nCommander Speicher ejected from his plane before it crashed. Based on \nthis and other information, the Navy came to the conclusion that they \ncould no longer assume that Lieutenant Commander Speicher was indeed \nKIA. On January 11, of this year, the Navy changed his official status \nfrom KIA/BNR back to MIA.\n  News reports indicated one of the major breaks in this case was \nprovided by an Iraqi defector. According to his information, during the \nfirst days of the war, he drove a downed American pilot to Baghdad. The \npilot was alive and alert. This defector was able to pass two lie \ndetector tests and pointed to Lieutenant Commander Speicher in a photo \nlineup.\n  Under this legislation, if Lieutenant Commander Speicher were found \nalive and returned home, this defector and his family would be granted \nrefugee status in the United States. As a veteran and a proud American, \nI will not rest until we have exhausted every avenue available to \nrepatriate the brave men and women who have sacrificed so much for the \nfreedom we enjoy. This legislation provides the kinds of incentives we \nneed to help bring American POW/MIAs home alive.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1339\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Indian Land Consolidation Act to provide \nfor probate reform with respect to trust or restricted lands; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, today, I am pleased to introduce the \nIndian Probate Reform Act of 2001 which builds on the solid foundations \nof the Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000, P.L. 106-462, \nwhich I also sponsored.\n  The Land Consolidation Act Amendments were necessary for two reasons. \nFirst, it rewrote the parts of the existing law that were held \nunconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court.\n  Second, many of the laws dealing with Indian probate and the use of \nIndian land had been in place for more than a century. Through P.L. \n106-462, Congress was able to revisit those laws to remove provisions \nthat were based on out-dated, misguided, and discredited federal \npolicies.\n  As my colleagues know Federal Indian policy is sometimes out-dated, \nand counter-productive Federal laws impede tribal efforts to achieve \neconomic self determination and sufficiency.\n  As Congress worked on the Land Consolidation Act Amendments, it \nbecame clear that other laws also needed to be updated but could not be \naddressed until we enacted P.L. 106-462. With that work completed, we \nnow have an opportunity to remove a number of complications concerning \nthe probate of Indian estates and lands.\n  Presently about 20 different State laws of interstate succession \napply to the inheritance of Indian allotments. This makes it almost \nimpossible for the Federal Government to provide general probate \nplanning advice to allotment owners.\n  Also, administrative law judges must monitor developments and changes \nin the probate laws of every State where allotments are located. This \nis simply an unnecessary waste of their time and tax dollars. The \naverage Indian estate takes more than a year to probate, and in some \ncases a decedent's heirs will have died before the decedent's probate \nis completed. We can do better.\n  I am pleased that Interior Secretary Norton is making trust fund \nreform such a high priority. But we in Congress have to do our part to \nsupport these efforts. I trust that my colleagues share my commitment \nto ensure that adequate resources are available to support real trust \nreform efforts. We must also be willing to roll up our sleeves and take \na good hard look at the laws that provide the framework for the use and \nprobate of Indian trust lands, especially trust lands that are in \nindividual Indian ownership.\n\n[[Page S8761]]\n\n  This bill is the next step in completing the work we began last \nCongress by establishing uniform federal Indian probate rules.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1340\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AMENDMENTS TO THE INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION ACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 \n     U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n                  ``Subtitle B--Indian Probate Reform\n\n     ``SEC. 231. FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) The General Allotment Act of 1887 (commonly known as \n     the ``Dawes Act''), which authorized the allotment of Indian \n     reservations, did not allow Indian allotment owners to \n     provide for the testamentary disposition of the land that was \n     allotted to such owners.\n       ``(2) The Dawes Act provided that allotments would descend \n     according to State law of intestate succession based on the \n     location of the allotment.\n       ``(3) The Federal Government's reliance on the State law of \n     intestate succession with respect to the descendency of \n     allotments has resulted in numerous problems to Indian \n     tribes, their members, and the Federal Government. These \n     problems include--\n       ``(A) the increasing fractionated ownership of trust and \n     restricted land as these lands are inherited by successive \n     generations of owners as tenants in common;\n       ``(B) the application of different rules of intestate \n     succession to each of a decedent's interests in trust and \n     restricted land if such land is located within the boundaries \n     of different States which makes probate planning \n     unnecessarily difficult and impedes efforts to provide \n     probate planning assistance or advice;\n       ``(C) the absence of a uniform general probate code for \n     trust and restricted land which makes it difficult for Indian \n     tribes to work cooperatively to develop tribal probate codes; \n     and\n       ``(D) the failure of Federal law to address or provide for \n     many of the essential elements of general probate law, either \n     directly or by reference, which is unfair to the owners of \n     trust and restricted land and their heirs and devisees and \n     which makes probate planning more difficult.\n       ``(4) Based on the problems identified in paragraph (3), a \n     uniform Federal probate code would likely--\n       ``(A) reduce the number of unnecessary fractionated \n     interests in trust or restricted land;\n       ``(B) facilitate efforts to provide probate planning \n     assistance and advice;\n       ``(C) facilitate inter-tribal efforts to produce tribal \n     probate codes pursuant to section 206; and\n       ``(D) provide essential elements of general probate law \n     that are not applicable on the date of enactment of this \n     subtitle to interests in trust or restricted land.\n\n     ``SEC. 232.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nhuman clinical trials qualifying for the orphan drug credit, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nclarify and expand the expenses qualifying for the orphan drug tax \ncredit. I am pleased to be joined in this legislation by Senators \nKennedy and Jeffords.\n  As the original sponsor of the legislation authorizing the orphan \ndrug program, and a leader in the Senate in our successful effort in \n1996 to make the tax credit permanent, I am here today to ask my \ncolleagues to support a needed improvement to the Orphan Drug Tax \nCredit. This improvement would make the tax credit even more effective \nin advancing the development of treatments for life-threatening rare \ndiseases and conditions.\n  The Orphan Drug Tax Credit provides tax incentives to companies that \ndevelop treatments for diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people, a \npopulation typically too small to provide a natural impetus for the \nprivate sector to take the necessary risks to develop a remedy that may \nnever be profitable. The diseases covered under the credit include: \nALS, Lou Gehrig's disease;\n\n[[Page S8763]]\n\ncerebral palsy; cystic fibrosis; epilepsy; Gaucher's disease; Hunington \ndisease; sickle cell disease; and system lupus erythematosus, Lupus. \nMore than 20 million Americans suffer from these rare diseases.\n  The Orphan Drug Tax Credit has been very successful. For example, in \nthe case of multiple sclerosis, 6 years ago there was no treatment for \nany type of the disease, only for its symptoms. Thanks in large part to \nthis law, there are now three products on the market to treat the \ndisease.\n  Unfortunately, the design of the credit includes a flaw that limits \nits effectiveness. The bill we are introducing today would correct this \nproblem. Under the current Orphan Drug Tax Credit, a 50 percent is \navailable for expenses related to human clinical testing of drugs that \nare designated as meeting the statutory definition of an ``orphan'' by \nthe Food and Drug Administration, FDA. Qualifying expenses are those \npaid or incurred after the date on which the drug is designated as a \npotential treatment for a rare disease or disorder.\n  The problem is that qualified expenses incurred during the time it \ntakes the FDA to officially designate the drug as an ``orphan'' are not \neligible for the credit. Unfortunately, the FDA approval process can \ntake from two months to more than a year. In some cases, companies \ndeveloping these potentially life-saving drugs are left with a \ndifficult decision, delay the start of the clinical trials until the \ndesignation is received, or go ahead and start the trials without the \ndesignation, but forego the benefits of tax credit that is so crucial \nto offsetting the high cost of developing these drugs. Neither choice \nis in the best interest of the 20 million Americans who are waiting and \nhoping for a cure for their disorder.\n  The bill we are introducing today would solve this problem by simply \nproviding that qualifying expenses include those incurred after the \ndate on which the company files an application with the FDA for \ndesignation of the drug as a potential treatment for a rare disease or \ndisorder. The credit's availability for these pre-designation expenses, \nhowever, is conditioned upon the FDA actually making the designation. \nThus, under this change, the designation must still first be granted \nbefore the credit could be claimed. But, once the designation is \ngranted, the credit could be claimed for both the clinical testing \nexpenses incurred between the filing of the application and the \ndesignation date, as well as for those incurred after the designation \ndate.\n  It is important to note that this change will also simplify the \ncurrent law. In fact, this change was recommended earlier this year by \nthe staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation in its study of \nrecommendations to simplify the Federal tax system.\n  The bill would also make one other change designed to help Americans \nsuffering from rare diseases. It would provide that the FDA publish on \na monthly basis a list of applications for orphan drug designations. \nThis provision will allow rare disease patients early access to \ninformation about proposed clinical trials and will help the industry \nlocate research subjects for their studies.\n  The Orphan Drug Tax Credit enjoys wide bipartisan support, and \nrightly so. It is a tax incentive that works. Now, we have a chance to \nmake it work even better. The tax clarification in this bill was passed \nin both the Senate twice in the 106th Congress, once in H.R. 2488, the \nFinancial Freedom Act of 1999, which was vetoed by President Clinton \nfor unrelated reasons, and again in H.R. 4577, the Department of Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2001, which passed on July 10, 2000.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1341\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to allocate H-1B visas for demonstration projects in \nrural America; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I'm pleased to be joined by Senator \nStevens in introducing legislation that we believe will develop high-\ntech employment opportunities in small towns and rural communities by \nusing the H-1B visa program in a meaningful way for rural States.\n  Over the past several decades, hundreds of communities in rural \nAmerica have seen their populations shrink by more than a third. \nDevastated by the overwhelming loss of people and businesses, or \noutmigration, these rural communities have been stymied in their \nefforts to grow their economies and create jobs for their people. Most \nof these areas have also not benefited from the recent technology-\ndriven growth in the economy. The combined effects of this economic \nstagnation and isolation have made it extremely difficult for these \nsmall rural towns to attract high-tech companies and recruit the \nskilled technology workers that they need to participate in the new \neconomy.\n  The proposal we are introducing today builds upon legislation signed \ninto law by President Clinton last fall that provided the Nation's \nhigh-technology companies with the stopgap measure they needed to \nsecure skilled workers for unfilled positions by increasing the annual \nnumber of foreign workers that can receive H-1B status to 195,000 over \nthe next three years. That legislation, which I supported, was an \nappropriate short-term response to the problems caused by a scarcity of \nqualified labor that threatened the nation's continued economic growth.\n  The bill that Senator Stevens and I are now introducing is called the \n``21st Century Homesteading Act.'' It would establish up to six H-1B \nvisa demonstration projects in qualifying rural areas, including those \ndevastated by population loss. This legislation is designed to \nencourage high-technology firms to grow their businesses and increase \nemployment in those distressed rural areas that need them the most. It \nwould do this by both awarding grant funds and targeting a small \nportion of the total annual H-1B visa allocations to economic \ndevelopment planning districts in eligible areas.\n  The major provisions of the 21st Century Homesteading Act are as \nfollows:\n\n       Six demonstration programs. The bill authorizes and \n     requires the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct up to six \n     demonstration H-1B visa projects to be implemented through \n     the award of grant funding to qualifying economic development \n     planning districts in rural areas.\n  Application process. To apply for grant funds, economic development \nplanning districts would be required, among other things, to submit an \napplication to the Secretary, sign a resolution of support to bring \nhigh-tech development opportunities into that district, and execute a \ndeclaration of need confirming that the area has experienced \nsubstantial outmigration, has\n\n[[Page S8764]]\n\nhigh unemployment or poverty rates, or has a population that is 10 \npercent or more Native American.\n  Local transfer of visa fees. The amount of each grant awarded to \neligible districts would be equal to the H-1B visa fees paid by \npetitioning employers. Grants can be used only to provide education, \ntraining, equipment, and infrastructure in connection with the \nemployment of H-1B workers within that district.\n  Total of 12,000 H-1B visas. Up to 12,000 H-1B visas could be issued \nto eligible aliens for employment through these demonstration \nprojects--and no one planning district could issue more than 2,000 H-1B \nvisas.\n  New account for program funds. A separate ``Twenty-first Century \nHomesteading Account'' would be established in the Treasury general \nfund. The H-1B visa fees paid for foreign workers in approved \ndemonstration projects would be deposited into that account and remain \navailable to the Agriculture Secretary until expended to carry out such \nprojects.\n  Let me be clear on three points. First, we do not intend with this \nlegislation to replace skilled American workers with their foreign \ncounterparts. Under current law, H-1B visas are temporary and firms \nthat significantly rely on them must have attempted to hire U.S. \nworkers and attest that a U.S. worker is not laid off during a \nsignificant period of time before and after an H-1B worker is hired. \nOur legislation would not change these and other restrictions. \nFurthermore, the 21st Century Homesteading Act also requires designated \neconomic development planning districts to establish training programs \nfor other workers who live in that district.\n  Second, this legislation permits an allocation of no more than 2,000 \nH-1B visas for each of the six demonstration projects that are \nauthorized. Thus, even if all 12,000 H-1B visas were ultimately \nallocated to the full six demonstration projects, that number would \nstill represent less than one-tenth of the total H-1B visas permitted \nin the first year. This small allocation of H-1B visas should have \nlittle or no impact on the overall efforts of companies seeking H-1B \nworkers in other parts of the country. In fact, to date, only 117,000 \nof the 195,000 H-1B visas available for this year have been approved, \nso allocating a small portion for these demonstration programs should \nnot present a problem.\n  And third, this legislation in no way increases or decreases the \noverall levels of immigration into the country. It simply targets a \nvery small number of existing employment visas to those communities \nthat have not benefited from the recent technology boom, and which are \nlikely to benefit the most from the addition of new residents with the \nnecessary skills to help attract and retain high-tech employers.\n  Finally, I would note that the prospect for these demonstration \nprojects is not merely a theoretical exercise. This approach was raised \nwith me by economic development officials in North Dakota who stand \nready, willing, and able to apply for economic development planning \ndistrict status. In my judgment, this group has already demonstrated \nthe kind and level of commitment that is needed to make this initiative \nsuccessful.\n  There is great need in rural America, especially in states like mine. \nBut often this need is not properly addressed here in Washington \nbecause of what I think is a fundamental misunderstanding of the \nproblem of outmigration and the economic maladies associated with it. \nThe 21st Century Homesteading Act is an effort to fine tune one of our \nfederal policies in order to address the shortage of skilled labor and \nlack of job growth in many rural communities. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important demonstration initiative for rural America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFFEE (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n        Schumer, Ms. Collins, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Specter, Mrs. Clinton, \n        Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Graham, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 1343. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide States with options for providing family planning services and \nsupplies to individuals eligible for medical assistance under the \nMedicaid program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CHAFEE, Madam President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Feinstein, Snowe, Bingaman, Collins, Schumer, Specter, Graham, \nClinton, Corzine, Harkin, and Jeffords in introducing the Family \nPlanning State Empowerment Act of 2001. This legislation would provide \nStates with a mechanism to improve the health of low-income women and \nfamilies by allowing States to expand family planning services to \nadditional women under the Medicaid program.\n  The Federal Government currently reimburses States for 90 percent of \ntheir expenditures for family planning services under Medicaid, due to \nthe importance of these for low-income women. This reimbursement rate \nis higher than for most other health care services.\n  Generally, women may qualify for Medicaid services, including family \nplanning, in one of two ways: they have children and an income level \nbelow a threshold set by the State (ranging from 15-86 percent of the \nFederal poverty level; or they are pregnant and have incomes up to 133 \npercent of the poverty level, federal law allows states to raise this \nincome eligibility level to 185 percent, if they desire. If a woman \nqualifies because of pregnancy, she is automatically eligible for \nfamily planning services for sixty days following delivery. After those \nsixty days, the women's Medicaid eligibility expires.\n  If States want to provide Medicaid family planning services to \nadditional populations of low-income women, they must apply to the \nfederal government for a so-called ``1115'' waiver. These waivers allow \nStates to establish demonstration projects in order to test new \napproaches to health care delivery in a manner that is budget-neutral \nto the Federal Government.\n  To date, these waivers have enabled fourteen States to expand access \nto family planning services. Most of these waivers allow states to \nextend family planning to women beyond the sixty-day post-partum \nperiod. This allows many women to increase the length of time between \nbirths, which was significant health benefits for women and their \nchildren. For this reason, an Institute of Medicine report recommended \nthat Medicaid should cover family planning services for two years \nfollowing a delivery.\n  Some of the waivers allow States to provide family planning to women \nbased solely on income, regardless of whether they qualify for Medicaid \ndue to pregnancy or children. In general, States have used the same \nincome eligibility levels that apply to pregnant women (133 percent or \n185 percent of the poverty level, creating continuity for both family \nplanning and prenatal care services. These expanded services also help \nstates reduce rates of unintended pregnancy and the need for abortion.\n  My State of Rhode Island was one of the first states to obtain one of \nthese waivers, and has had great success with it in terms of preventing \nunintended pregnancies and improving public health in general. Rhode \nIsland's waiver has averted 1,443 pregnancies from August 1994 \nthrough 1997, resulting in a savings to the state of $14.3 million. In \naddition, Rhode Island's waiver has assisted low-income women with \nspacing-out their births. The number of low-income women in Rhode \nIsland with short inter-birth intervals, becoming pregnant within 18 \nmonths of having given birth dropped from 41 percent in 1993 to 29 \npercent in 1999. The gap between Medicaid recipients and privately \ninsured women was 11 percent in 1993, compared with only 1 percent--\nalmost negligible, in 1999. As these statistics show, these waivers are \nextremely valuable and serve as a huge asset to the women's health, not \nonly to my constituents but to constituents in the thirteen other \nStates who currently benefit from these waivers.\n\n  Unfortunately, the waiver process is extremely cubersome and time \nconsuming, often taking up to three years for States to receive \napproval from the Federal Government. This may discourage States from \napplying for family planning waivers, or at the very least, delay them \nfrom providing important services to women.\n  Our bill would rectify this problem by allowing States to extend \nfamily planning services through Medicaid without going through the \nwaiver process. Eliminating the waiver requirement will facilitate \nState innovation\n\n[[Page S8765]]\n\nand provide assistance to more low-income women.\n  This bill will allow States to provide family planning services to \nwomen with incomes up to 185 percent of the Federal poverty level. For \nlow-income, post-partum women, States will no longer be limited to \nproviding them with only sixty days of family planning assistance. \nStates may also provide family planning for up to one year to women who \nlose Medicaid-eligibility because of income.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation, and ask for unanimous consent that the legislation and the \naccompanying findings section be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1343\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I am pleased to be joined by a \nbipartisan group of my colleagues in introducing this important \nlegislation. I rise today with Senators Chafee, Snowe, Schumer, \nCollins, Bingaman, Specter, Clinton, Jeffords, Graham, Harkin, and \nCorzine to introduce the Family Planning State Empowerment Act of 2001.\n  The Family Planning State Empowerment Act of 2001 would give States \nthe option to provide family planning services to low-income women who \ndo not qualify for Medicaid.\n  Each year, approximately 3 million pregnancies, or about half of all \npregnancies, are unintended. Increasing access to family planning \nservices could help avert these 3 million unintended pregnancies and \nall the decisions and costs associated with either continuing or \nterminating a pregnancy.\n  Family planning services give women the necessary tools to space the \nbirths of their children, which improves women's health and reduces \nrates of infant mortality.\n  Medicaid family planning is also cost effective. For every $1 \ninvested in family planning, $3 are saved in pregnancy and health care-\nrelated costs.\n  The Federal Government currently reimburses States for 90 percent of \ntheir expenditures for family planning services under Medicaid.\n  If States want to provide Medicaid family planning services to \npopulations of low-income women, other than low-income pregnant women \nor low-income women with children, they must apply to the Federal \nGovernment for a waiver.\n  Presently, 14 States, including California, have obtained Medicaid \nwaivers from the Federal Government to provide family planning services \nto over 1.3 million women annually. Another eight States have applied \nfor waivers.\n  The waiver process is extremely cumbersome and time consuming, often \ntaking up to three years to receive approval from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This is legislation is timely because once again the door is being \nclosed by the Administration on women's reproductive health. This time, \nthe losers will be low-income women.\n  Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson announced last \nmonth that he will not approve any new waiver requests nor grant any \nrenewals for single service waivers, which includes this Medicaid \nfamily planning waiver.\n  And if the Administration gets its way, California will lose $100 \nmillion a year, and over 900,000 low-income Californians will have to \nlook elsewhere for family planning and reproductive health services.\n  Family planning and reproductive health services are much more than \njust accessing contraceptives. Services provided include screening and \ntreatment for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV, basic infertility \nservices and pregnancy testing and counseling. Women can receive pap \nsmears and breast exams, which are crucial to detecting cervical and \nbreast cancer.\n  It is estimated that this waiver will save California $900 million \nover the 5-year waiver period in public expenditures for medical care \nand social services.\n  It is ironic that an Administration that is seeking to reduce the \nnumber of abortions would try to halt the very family planning services \nthat could avoid unintended pregnancies.\n  In effect, the Administration is asking the clinics in our States, \nwhich provide services to some of our Nation's sickest and most \nvulnerable populations, to either turn away low-income women that need \nfamily planning services at the door or to provide them with services \nwithout the necessary funds.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in saying enough is enough. Low \nincome women deserve access to family planning and reproductive health \nservices. And States should not have to ask the federal government for \npermission to use Medicaid funds to provide these essential services.\n  It is time that this Administration walk-the-walk and talk-the-talk. \nWe cannot afford to shut the door on those who cannot otherwise afford \nfamily planning and reproductive health services.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, the Family Planning State Empower\n\n\n[[Page S8766]]\n\nment Act is our long-term shield against the ideological whims of those \nwho threaten to cut cost-effective family planning services for low \nincome women across the country. Why do we need such a protective \nmeasure? In the past two weeks, it became clear that the Federal \nGovernment would not renew these programs nor would they approve any \npending application requests. That is why I, along with 21 of my \ncolleagues including Mr. Chafee, sent a letter asking the government to \nreconsider their decision which would seriously impinge upon the \nability of states to expand coverage of family planning services.\n  The Family Planning State Empowerment Act would allow State \ngovernments and agency experts to practice what they know best, \nimplementing these cost-effective family planning service programs that \nreduce the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions. In New York \nalone, 13,440 women would be served under its pending family planning \nservice program proposal. As the years go by, States are offering more \nservices to more women all at a minimal cost to the Federal Government.\n  There are 1.2 million women aged 13 to 44 in New York who are in need \nof publicly supported contraceptive services, 16.5 million in the \nUnited States. Thousands of women have already benefitted from \nprenatal, delivery, and postpartum family planning services in states \nsuch as New York, Georgia, Colorado, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Kentucky, \nto name a few. These programs successfully help low-income women to \navoid closely spaced births that are linked to low birth weight, infant \nmortality, and maternal morbidity. It would be a shame to curtail the \nprogress of these family planning service programs when there are so \nmany more women to serve.\n  As part of their applications for federal approval, States are \nrequired to demonstrate that expanding Medicaid coverage of family \nplanning services would come at no additional cost to the Federal \nGovernment. Every dollar spent for contraceptive services saves $3 in \npublic funds that would have been needed to provide prenatal and \nnewborn medical care alone. New York's pending family planning service \nprogram would save the Federal Government $3.2 billion. Instead of \nallowing these programs to be used as decoys in the ideological battle \nover choice issues, let us preserve their effectiveness and put them \nout of the way of federal reach and under full state authority.\n  Though the Federal Government can play an important oversight role in \nthe welfare of publicly financed programs--it has overstepped its \nboundaries in using these programs as sacrificial lambs to further its \nideological agenda. We cannot stand idly by and let the Federal \nGovernment determine the fate of such programs that have proven \nthemselves since 1993 not only economically sound but essential to the \nprovision of vital health services to individuals who could not receive \nthem otherwise. That is why I am a proud original co-sponsor of the \nFamily Planning State Empowerment Act of 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1344. A bill to provide training and technical assistance to \nNative Americans who are interested in commercial vehicle driving \ncareers; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill \nthat promotes job creation and economic opportunity for Native \nAmericans. The Native American Commercial Driving Training and \nTechnical Assistance Act will encourage and promote tribally-controlled \ncommunity colleges to offer commercial vehicle training programs.\n  Economic development is the key to many of the social and economic \nills that plague Indian and Alaska Native communities. In 1999, the \nBureau of Indian Affairs labor statistics for Indian and Alaska Native \ncommunities determined that the unemployment rate for Indians living \nnear or in Indian communities was 43 percent. This figure is \nastonishing when compared to the overall unemployment rate in the \nUnited States which is only 4.5 percent.\n  As former Chairman and now Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Indian \nAffairs, I have focused on building tribal capacity and good governance \nso that Indian and Alaska Native communities can create business-\nfriendly environments. Human capital and skill development is also \nimportant, and with training and certificate programs tribally-\ncontrolled community colleges are fostering skilled workers who are \nready to enter into the marketplace.\n  The bill that I am introducing today will enable tribally-controlled \ncommunity colleges to have more resources to develop commercial vehicle \ntraining programs. There are already two tribally-controlled community \ncolleges, D-Q University in the state of California and Fort Peck \nCommunity College in the state of Montana, that offer commercial \nvehicle driving programs. The grant program authorized in this bill \nwill encourage other tribal colleges to develop commercial truck \ndriving training programs.\n  The trucking industry is a thriving industry. According to the \nDepartment of Transportation, there are currently about 3 million truck \ndrivers in the United States. However, the American Trucking \nAssociation estimates that between 10 percent and 20 percent of the \nNation's trucks sit idle due to a lack of qualified drivers. In fact, \nestimates range from 200,000 to 500,000 as to the shortage of new \nqualified drivers that are needed this year and in the coming years.\n  I am the only Member of the Senate who is a licensed and certified \ncommercial truck driver and who once earned his living as an over-the-\nroad driver.\n  Based on my personal experience the truck driving industry has \nsomething unique to offer Indian communities; a well-paying profession. \nThis is a win-win situation because the trucking industry needs more \nqualified drivers, and Indian communities need more job opportunities. \nWith this bill,more American Indians will have the opportunity to \nundertake the training necessary to obtain a Commercial Truck Driver's \nLicense, and join a rewarding and well-paying profession.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1344\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Commercial \n     Driving Training and Technical Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Despite the availability of abundant natural resources \n     on Indian lands and a rich cultural legacy that accords great \n     value to self-determination, self-reliance, and independence, \n     Native Americans suffer higher rates of unemployment, \n     poverty, poor health, substandard housing, and associated \n     social ills than those of any other group in the United \n     States.\n       (2) The United States has an obligation to assist Indian \n     tribes with the creation of appropriate economic and \n     political conditions.\n       (3) The economic success and material well-being of Native \n     American communities depends on the combined efforts of the \n     Federal Government, tribal governments, the private sector, \n     and individuals.\n       (4) Two tribally controlled community colleges, D-Q \n     University in the State of California and Fort Peck Community \n     College in the State of Montana, currently offer commercial \n     vehicle driving programs.\n       (5) The American Trucking Association reports that at least \n     until the year 2005, the trucking industry will need to hire \n     403,000 truck drivers each year to fill empty positions.\n       (6) According to the Federal Government Occupational \n     Handbook the commercial driving industry is expected to \n     increase about as fast as the average for all occupations \n     through the year 2008 as the economy grows and the amount of \n     freight carried by trucks increases.\n       (7) A career in commercial vehicle driving offers a \n     competitive salary, employment benefits, job security, and a \n     profession.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n       (1) to foster and promote job creation and economic \n     opportunities for Native Americans; and\n       (2) to provide education, technical, and training \n     assistance to Native Americans who are interested in a \n     commercial vehicle driving career.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Commercial vehicle driving.--The term ``commercial \n     vehicle driving'' means the driving of a vehicle which is a \n     tractor-trailer truck.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Labor.\n\n[[Page S8767]]\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Transportation to \nestablish a commercial truck safety pilot program in the State of \nMaine, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation the \nCommercial Truck Safety Pilot Program Act to create a safety pilot \nprogram for commercial trucks.\n  The Commercial Truck Safety Pilot Program Act would authorize a \nsafety demonstration program in my home state of Maine that could be a \nmodel for other states. I have been working closely with the Maine \nDepartment of Transportation, communities in my State, and others to \naddress statewide concerns about the existing Federal Interstate truck \nweight limit of 80,000 pounds.\n  I believe that safety must be the number one priority on our roads \nand highways, and I am very concerned that the existing Interstate \nweight limit has the perverse impact of forcing commercial trucks onto \nState and local secondary roads that were never designed to handle \nheavy commercial trucks safely. We are talking about narrow roads, \nlanes, and rotaries, with frequent pedestrian crossings and school \nzones.\n  I have been working to address this concern for many years. During \nthe 105th Congress, for example, I authored a provision providing a \nwaiver from federal weight limits on the Maine Turnpike the 100-mile \nsection of Maine's Interstate in the southern portion of the State and \nit was signed into law as part of TEA-21. I have also corresponded with \nthe Department of Transportation and the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee to make them aware of my serious concerns and to urge \nthem to work with me in an effort to address this challenge.\n\n  In addition, the Maine Department of Transportation is in the process \nof conducting a study of the truck weight limit waiver on the Maine \nTurnpike, and I have been working closely with the State in the hopes \nof expanding this study, which will focus on the safety impact of \nhigher limits, infrastructure issues, air quality issues and economic \nissues as well, in order to secure the data necessary to ensure that \ncommercial trucks are required to operate in the safest possible \nmanner.\n  Federal law attempts to provide uniform truck weight limits, 80,000 \npounds, on the Interstate system, but the fact is there are a myriad of \nexemptions and grandfathering provisions. The legislation I am \nsubmitting today would simply direct the Secretary of Transportation to \nestablish a three-year pilot program to improve commercial motor \nvehicle safety in the State of Maine.\n  Specifically, the measure would direct the Secretary, during this \nperiod, to waive federal vehicle weight limitations on certain \ncommercial vehicles weighing over 80,000 pounds using the Interstate \nSystem within Maine, permitting the State to set the limit. In \naddition, it would provide for the waiver to become permanent unless \nthe Secretary determines it has resulted in an adverse impact on \nhighway safety.\n  I believe this is a measured, responsible approach to a very serious \npublic safety issue. I hope to work with all of those with a stake in \nthis issue, safety advocates, truckers, states, and communities, to \naddress this matter in the most effective possible way, and I hope that \nmy colleagues will join me in this effort.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to join with my colleague from \nMaine in sponsoring the Commercial Truck Safety Pilot Program Act, an \nimportant piece of legislation that addresses a significant safety \nproblem in our State.\n  Under current law, trucks weighing as much as 100,000 pounds are \nallowed to travel on Interstate 95 from Maine's border with New \nHampshire to Augusta, our capital city located. At Augusta, trucks \nweighing more than 80,000 pounds are forced off Interstate 95, which \nproceeds for another 200 miles through the northern half of the State, \nand on to smaller roads that pass through cities, towns, and villages.\n  Trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds are permitted on interstate \nhighways in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York as well as the \nCanadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec. The weight limit \ndisparity on various segments of Maine's Interstate Highway System \nforces trucks traveling to and from destinations in these States and \nprovinces to use Maine's State and local roads. Consequently, many \nMaine communities along the Interstate see substantially more truck \ntraffic than would otherwise be the case if the weight limit were \n100,000 pounds for all of Maine's Interstate highways.\n  The problem Maine faces because of the disparity in truck weight \nlimits is perhaps most pronounced in our State capital. Augusta is the \nMaine Turnpike's northern terminus where heavy trucks that are \nprohibited from traveling along the northern segment of Interstate 95 \nenter and exit the turnpike. The high number of trucks that must \ntraverse Augusta's local roads creates a severe hazard for those who \nlive and work in as well as visit the city.\n  It is estimated that the truck weight disparity sends 310 vehicles in \nexcess of 80,000 pounds through Augusta everyday. These vehicles, which \nare often carrying hazardous materials, must pass through the Cony \nCircle, one of the State's most dangerous traffic circles and the scene \nof 130 accidents per year. The fact that the circle is named for the \ntwelve hundred student high school that it abuts adds to the severity \nof the problem.\n  A uniform truck weight limit of 100,000 pounds on Maine's interstate \nhighways would reduce the highway miles and travel times necessary to \ntransport freight through Maine, resulting in economic and \nenvironmental benefits. Moreover, Maine's extensive network of State \nand local roads will be better preserved without the wear and tear of \nheavy truck traffic. Most importantly, however, a uniform truck weight \nlimit will keep trucks on the interstate where they belong rather than \non roads and highways that pass through Maine's cities, towns, and \nneighborhoods.\n  The legislation that Senator Snowe and I are introducing addresses \nthe safety issues we face in Maine because of the disparities in truck \nweight limits. The legislation directs the Secretary of Transportation \nto establish a commercial truck safety pilot program in Maine. Under \nthe pilot program, the truck weight limit on all Maine highways that \nare part of the interstate highway system would be set at 100,000 \npounds for three years. During the waiver period, the Secretary would \nstudy the impacts of the pilot program on safety, and would receive the \ninput of a panel that would include State officials, safety \norganizations, municipalities, and the commercial trucking industry. \nThe waiver would become permanent if the panel determined that \nmotorists were safer as a result of a uniform truck weight limit on \nMaine's Interstate highway system.\n  Maine's citizens and motorists are needlessly at risk because too \nmany heavy trucks are forced off the interstate and on to local roads. \nThe legislation Senator Snowe and I are introducing is not an attempt \nto roll back\n\n[[Page S8768]]\n\nweight standards but rather a commonsense approach to a severe safety \nproblem in my State. I hope my colleagues will support passage of this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Allard, and Ms. \n        Collins):\n  S. 1346. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith regard to new animal drugs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we do a lot of things here that are \ncontroversial and get headlines. But oftentimes we do things that are \nbipartisan, that are complex and technical. Working together, we \naccomplish things that are good for the country.\n  The legislation I have introduced tonight, along with Senator Jeff \nBingaman from New Mexico, is that kind of legislation. It is supported \nby 27 different farm and veterinary medicine groups. It is called the \nMinor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act. It deals with a problem \nthat, unfortunately, goes largely unnoticed, except by those who are \ndirectly affected. Livestock and food animal producers, pet owners, zoo \nand wildlife biologists, and animals themselves face a severe shortage \nof approved animal drugs for use in minor species.\n  Minor species include thousands of animal species, including all \nfish, birds, and sheep. By definition, minor species are any animals \nother than the major species, which are cattle, horses, chickens, \nturkeys, dogs, and cats. A similar shortage of drugs and medicines for \nmajor animal species exists for diseases that occur infrequently or \nwhich occur in limited geographical areas.\n  Due to the lack of availability for these minor use drugs, millions \nof animals go untreated or treatment is delayed. Without access to \nthese necessary minor use drugs, farmers and ranchers also suffer. An \nunhealthy animal that is left untreated can spread disease throughout \nan entire herd. For example, sheep ranchers lost nearly $45 million \nworth of livestock in 1999 alone. The sheep industry estimates if it \nhad access to effective and necessary drugs to treat diseases, growers' \nreproduction costs for their animals would be cut by up to 15 percent. \nIn addition, feedlot deaths would be reduced by 1 to 2 percent, adding \napproximately $8 million of revenue to the industry.\n  Alabama's catfish industry ranks second in the Nation. Though it is \nnot the State's only aquacultural commodity, catfish is by far its \nlargest. Indeed, catfish make up 68 percent of the Nation's \naquacultural industry. That industry generates enormous opportunities \nin the poorest part of Alabama, and it is necessary that it be a strong \nindustry.\n  The catfish industry estimates its losses at $60 million per year \nattributable to diseases for which drugs are not available. Indeed, it \nis not uncommon for a catfish producer to lose half his stock to \ndisease.\n  The U.S. aquacultural industry overall, including food fish and \nornamental fish, produces and raises over 800 different species. \nUnfortunately, this industry has only five drugs approved for use in \ntreating aquacultural diseases. This results in economic hardship.\n  The problem is simply this: A drug company must go through a long \nresearch program to develop a drug. Then the company has to seek \napproval for the drug. The company simply is financially unable to do \nso because there are not many animals for which the product will be \nused. It makes it difficult for them to do the investment.\n  I, along with Senators Bingaman, Allard, and Collins, resolve to \nimprove this situation by introducing the Minor Use and Minor Species \nAnimal Health Act. The legislation will allow animal drug manufacturers \nthe opportunity to develop and obtain approval for minor use drugs \nwhich are vitally needed by a wide variety of animal industries.\n  Our legislation incorporates the major proposals of the Food and Drug \nAdministration's Center for Veterinary Medicine to increase the \navailability of drugs for minor animal species and rare diseases in all \nanimals. The act creates incentives for animal drug manufacturers to \ninvest in product development and obtain FDA approval.\n  The legislation creates a program very similar to the human orphan \ndrug program that has dramatically increased the availability of drugs \nto treat rare human diseases over the past 20 years.\n  The Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act will not alter, \nhowever, the FDA drug approval responsibilities that ensure the safety \nof animal drugs to the public. The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine \ncurrently evaluates new animal products prior to approval and use. This \nrigorous testing and review process provides consumers with the \nconfidence that animal drugs are safe for animals and consumers of \nproducts derived from treated animals.\n  Current FDA requirements include guidelines to prevent harmful \nresidues and evaluations to examine the potential for the selection of \nresistant pathogens. Any food animal medicine or drug considered for \napproval under this bill would be subject to the same assessments.\n  The Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act is supported by 25 \norganizations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, the \nAnimal Health Institute, the American Veterinary Medical Association, \nand the National Aquaculture Association. This is vital, important \nlegislation.\n  The act will reduce the economic risks and hardships which fall upon \nranchers and farmers as a result of livestock diseases. It will benefit \npets and their owners and benefit various endangered species and \naquatic animals. It will promote the health of all animal species while \nprotecting human health as well, and will alleviate unnecessary animal \nsuffering.\n  This is commonsense legislation which would benefit millions of \nAmerican pet owners, farmers, and ranchers. I believe it represents a \nconsensus effort on which we worked hard.\n  Mary Alice Tyson, on my staff, and other staff members have worked \nhard on it. I believe it is an act that will gain universal support in \nthe Senate, will be a step forward, and something good we can do to \nhelp animals and the producers of animals in America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Byrd):\n  S. 1347. A bill to establish a Congressional Trade Office; to the \nCommittee on Government Affairs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, on behalf of myself and Senator Byrd, I \nam introducing a bill to create a Congressional Trade Office. This is \ndesigned to help the Senate get ahead of the curve and better \nunderstand and deal with globalization, trade, and economic commercial \nactions around the world, to help us understand what we are doing.\n  The Congressional Trade Office, the CTO, will have the expertise we \nneed in Congress to get independent and nonpartisan information about \ntrade. This new entity will help us meet our constitutional \nresponsibility for trade policy.\n  The importance of trade in our economy continues to grow. Trade is \nequivalent to 27 percent of our economy today, compared with only 11 \npercent in 1970, just 30 years ago.\n  Article I, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution provides:\n\n       Congress shall have the power . . . to regulate commerce \n     with foreign nations.\n\n  Our responsibility as Members of Congress is to set the direction of \ntrade policy. It is true that under article II of the Constitution, the \nPresident, the Chief Executive, has the primary responsibility with \nrespect to foreign policy. With respect to trade, the Constitution is \nclear, and it provides that Congress shall have the power to regulate \ncommerce with foreign nations. Our responsibility is effective and \nactive oversight of our Nation's trade policy.\n\n[[Page S8769]]\n\n  I have served in the Congress for 25 years and I have watched the \ncontinuing transfer of responsibility for trade policy from the \nCongress to the executive branch.\n  I believe this must stop. We must reassert Congress' constitutionally \ndefined responsibility. The CTO will provide the means to meet our \nresponsibilities.\n  Congress needs to be much better prepared to deal with trade issues \nresponsibly and authoritatively: consideration of fast track; FTAs--so-\ncalled free trade agreements--with Jordan, Chile, Singapore, and \nperhaps Australia, and others; Chinese accession to the WTO; a possible \nnew round launch; compliance with existing agreements.\n  To manage trade policy, we need access to more and better \ninformation, independently arrived at, from people whose commitment is \nto the Congress, and only to the Congress.\n  The first task of the CTO is to monitor compliance with major trade \nagreements. It will evaluate success based on real world business \nresults. It will recommend actions needed to ensure that commitments \nare fully implemented. It will also provide annual assessments of the \nextent to which agreements comply with labor and environmental goals.\n  The CTO's second task will be to observe trade negotiations \nfirsthand. CTO staff will participate in selected negotiations as \nobservers and report back to the Congress. Congress needs this \ninformation to provide meaningful oversight of trade policy. And it is \nespecially vital for Congress to monitor trade negotiations under fast \ntrack.\n  The third task relates to dispute settlement. The CTO will evaluate \neach WTO decision where the U.S. is a participant, explain why cases \nare lost, and measure the anticipated commercial results from wins. CTO \nstaff will participate as observers on the U.S. delegation.\n  Frankly, I don't think we know whether the WTO dispute settlement \nprocess has been successful or not, from the perspective of U.S. \ncommercial interests. A count of wins versus losses doesn't tell us \nvery much. The CTO will give us the facts we need to evaluate the \nprocess properly.\n  The final task will be analytical. The CTO will analyze major \noutstanding trade barriers based on a cost to the U.S. economy. It will \nalso provide an analysis of the administration's--Republican or \nDemocrat--trade policy agenda, and it will analyze the trade accounts \nevery quarter.\n\n  The Congressional Trade Office is designed to serve the Congress. Its \nDirector will report to the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways \nand Means Committee, but will also advise other committees on the \nimpact of trade negotiations on those committees' areas of \njurisdiction.\n  Trade rules increasingly affect domestic regulations. The CTO can \nadvise on the implications of trade policy for domestic regulatory \nissues.\n  The CTO will have a professional staff with a mix of expertise in \neconomics and trade law in various industries and geographic regions. I \nbelieve this will give Congress long-term institutional memory on \ntrade, something that is very much needed, particularly when other \ncountries have much more expertise, much more time in their governments \ndevoted to trade and how their countries can benefit from trade \nbasically at the expense of others.\n  I am very grateful for the support of my good friend, Senator Byrd, \nand I encourage my colleagues to join with us in creating the \nCongressional Trade Office. I believe this will help the Congress get a \nlittle bit further ahead of the curve, better understand the \nimplications of globalization, and pull us a little bit out of our day-\nto-day reactive mode around here, thinking more long term in a better \nsense of what is happening in the world--more information, better \ninformation on which we can make decisions in this body and, therefore, \nserve our people better.\n  I very much thank my good friend, Senator Byrd. He has been helpful \nto us. I yield the floor, and I, again, thank him for his help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from Montana on \nhis longtime leadership in the trade field and for his services on the \nFinance Committee which has jurisdiction in very great measure over \nthis subject matter. I thank him for his leadership. I thank him for \nsponsoring the legislation that he has just discussed and for allowing \nme to be a cosponsor with him. I value his leadership in this area.\n  I have been long concerned about the U.S. trade policy. It extends \nover these 49 years in which I have been a Member of the Congress. I am \nfor free trade, and I am for fair trade. I have in recent years voted \nagainst the North American Free Trade Agreement. I voted against the \nGATT/WTO agreements. I voted against the permanent normal trading \nrelations with China. It is my belief that American interests, \nparticularly the interests of American workers, have not been properly \nrepresented in these developments. I believe that Congress has allowed \nitself to take a backseat to the intent of Presidents on making \ninternational trade negotiations an executive-to-executive preserve.\n  Congress should vigorously defend the authority it has been granted \nunder the Constitution, whether the issue is a legislative enactment \nthat strips away the authority of Congress to debate and, if necessary, \nto amend trade agreements or a constitutional amendment that--in the \nname of balanced budgets--strips away our power over the purse. The \nbalanced budget amendment is an issue for another occasion. The need \nfor Congress to restore its role with respect to foreign trade, \nhowever, is something that Senator Baucus and I wish to highlight. We \nnote that article I, section 8, of the Constitution gives Congress the \nexclusive authority to ``regulate commerce with foreign nations.'' \nCongress, not the President, has this authority and responsibility.\n  Unfortunately, over the past few decades, Congress has been less than \nzealous in safeguarding its prerogatives with respect to foreign trade. \nThe result is that the American people have less input into our trade \nagreements than they should have. Is there any doubt that the process \nis less democratic than was intended by the Framers of the \nConstitution?\n  U.S. trade negotiators need our input at each and every stage of the \nprocess. Enhanced congressional participation will help them in their \nefforts to reinforce the framework of fair trade. It will give the \nresults of trade negotiations greater legitimacy and increase public \nunderstanding of the costs and benefits of globalization. The \nConstitution demands that we make this effort, and the people we \nrepresent expect us to make that effort.\n  Madam President, now is the time for the House and the Senate to \ncreate a Congressional Trade Office modeled after the Congressional \nBudget Office. Regardless of how each of us may feel about the great \ntrade issues of the day, we should be able to agree that Congress needs \nbetter access to information about trade negotiations and the impact of \ntrade agreements on the U.S. economy. It is indisputable that we live \nin an increasingly interdependent world, and it is our duty under the \nConstitution to make sure that American interests are properly \nreflected as the architecture of that world is established.\n  Senator Baucus and I agree on the urgency of this task. Our \nlegislation would establish a nonpartisan Congressional Trade Office \nthe purposes of which would be to first, provide Congress with trade \ndata and analysis; second, participate in all future trade \nnegotiations; third, observe and evaluate international trade dispute \nresolution processes; and fourth, monitor compliance with major \nbilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements.\n  The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee \ncannot possibly address the full panoply of issues that arise in this \nday and age in connection with trade legislation. Consequently, trade \nbills can be--and are--referred to multiple committees in both Houses \nof Congress. Our bill recognizes this trend and provides that the \nresources of the Congressional Trade Office will be available to all \nHouse and Senate committees of relevant jurisdiction.\n\n[[Page S8770]]\n\n  I join with Senator Baucus in urging our colleagues to seize this \nopportunity to move toward the restoration of our constitutional role \nin trade policy. Let us resolve to put ourselves, the Congress, back in \nthe center of the great game of formulating and implementing mutually \nbeneficial international trade agreements.\n  Madam President, I thank my colleague, Mr. Baucus, again, for his \nleadership, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8770-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8770-S8771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 147--TO DESIGNATE THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER OF 2001, AS \n         ``NATIONAL ALCOHOL AND DRUG ADDICTION RECOVERY MONTH''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 147\n\n       Whereas alcohol and drug addiction is a devastating disease \n     that can destroy lives, families, and communities;\n       Whereas alcohol and drug addiction carry direct and \n     indirect costs for the United States of more than \n     $246,000,000,000 each year;\n       Whereas scientific evidence demonstrates the crucial role \n     that treatment plays in restoring those suffering from \n     alcohol and drug addiction to more productive lives;\n       Whereas in 1999, research at the National Institute on Drug \n     Abuse at the National Institutes of Health showed that about \n     14,800,000 Americans were users of illicit drugs, and about \n     3,500,000 were dependent on illicit drugs; an additional \n     8,200,000 were dependent on alcohol;\n       Whereas the 1999 National Household Survey of Drug Abuse, a \n     project of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration, showed that drug use varies substantially \n     among States, ranging from a low of 4.7 percent to a high of \n     10.7 percent for the overall population, and from 8.0 percent \n     to 18.3 percent for youths age 12-17;\n       Whereas the Office of National Drug Control Policy's 2001 \n     National Drug Control Strategy includes the reduction of the \n     treatment gap for individuals who are addicted to drugs as \n     one of the top 3 goals for reducing the health and social \n     costs to the public;\n       Whereas the lives of children, families, and communities \n     are severely affected by alcohol and drug addiction, through \n     the effects of the disease, and through the neglect, broken \n     relationships, and violence that are so often a part of the \n     disease of addiction;\n       Whereas a National Institute on Drug Abuse 4-city study of \n     1,200 adolescents found that community-based treatment \n     programs can reduce drug and alcohol use, improve school \n     performance, and lower involvement with the criminal justice \n     system;\n       Whereas a number of organizations and individuals dedicated \n     to fighting addiction and promoting treatment and recovery \n     will recognize the month of September of 2001 as National \n     Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month;\n       Whereas the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, in \n     conjunction with its national planning partner organizations \n     and treatment providers, have taken a Federal leadership role \n     in promoting Recovery Month 2001;\n       Whereas National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month \n     aims to promote the societal benefits of substance abuse \n     treatment, laud the contributions of treatment providers, and \n     promote the message that recovery from substance abuse in all \n     its forms is possible;\n       Whereas the 2001 national campaign embraces the theme of \n     ``We Recover Together: Family, Friends and Community'', and \n     highlights the societal benefits, importance, and \n     effectiveness of drug and treatment as a public health \n     service in our country; and\n       Whereas the countless numbers of those who have \n     successfully recovered from addiction are living proof that \n     people of all races, genders, and ages recover every day from \n     the disease of alcohol and drug addiction, and make positive \n     contributions to their families, workplaces, communities, \n     States, and the Nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of September of 2001 as ``National \n     Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation urging \n     the people of the United States to carry out appropriate \n     programs and activities to demonstrate support for those \n     individuals recovering from alcohol and drug addiction.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nto proclaim September, 2001 as ``National Alcohol and Drug Addiction \nRecovery Month''. The purpose is to recognize the societal benefits, \nimportance and effectiveness of drug treatment as a public health \nservice. The Year 2001 Recovery Month theme is ``We Recover Together: \nFamily, Friends, and Community'', with a clear message that we need to \nwork together to promote treatment for alcohol and drug addiction \nthroughout our country.\n  Addiction to alcohol and drugs is a disease that many individuals \nface as a painful, private struggle, often without access to treatment \nor medical care. But this disease also has staggering public costs. A \n1998 report prepared by The Lewin Group for the National Institute on \nDrug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, \nestimated the total economic cost of alcohol and drug abuse to be \napproximately $246 billion for 1992. Of this cost, an estimated $98 \nbillion was due to addiction to illicit drugs and other drugs taken for \nnon-medical purposes. This estimate includes addiction treatment and \nprevention costs, as well as costs associated with related illnesses, \nreduced job productivity or lost earnings, and other costs to society \nsuch as crime and social welfare programs.\n  Adults and children who have the disease of addiction can be found \nthroughout our society. We know from the outstanding research done at \nthe National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of \nHealth that 14,800,000 Americans were users of illicit drugs, and about \n3,500,000 were dependent on illicit drugs. An additional 8 million were \ndependent on alcohol. The 1999 Household Survey of Drug Abuse, a \nproject of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, showed that drug use varies among States, ranges from a \nlow of 4.7 percent to a high of 10.7 percent of the overall population, \nand from 8.0 percent to 18.3 percent for youths age 12-17.\n  The 2001 National Drug Control Strategy of the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy, ONDCP, has recognized the importance of drug \ntreatment. The ONDCP Strategy includes the reduction of the treatment \ngap for individuals who are addicted to drugs as one of the top 3 goals \nfor reducing the health and social costs to the public. And yet, 80 \npercent of adolescents needing treatment are unable to access services \nbecause of the severe lack of coverage for addiction treatment or the \nunavailability of treatment programs or trained health care providers \nin their community. The 1998 Hay Group Report revealed that the overall \nvalue of substance abuse treatment benefits has decreased by 74.5 \npercent from 1988 through 1998, leaving our youth without sufficient \nmedical care for this disease when they are most vulnerable.\n  We know that addiction to alcohol and other drugs contribute to other \nproblems as well. Addictive substances have the potential for \ndestroying the person who is addicted, as well as his or her family. We \nknow, for example, that fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading known \ncause of mental retardation. If a woman who was addicted to alcohol \ncould receive proper treatment, fetal alcohol syndrome for her baby \nwould be 100 percent preventable, and more than 12,000 infants born in \nthe U.S. each year would not suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome, with \nits irreversible physical and mental damage.\n\n[[Page S8771]]\n\n  We know too of the devastation caused by addiction when violence \nbetween people is one of the consequences. A 1998 SAMHSA report \noutlined the links between domestic violence and substance abuse. We \nknow from clinical reports that 25-50 percent of men who commit acts of \ndomestic violence also have substance abuse problems. The report \nrecognized the link between the victim of abuse and use of alcohol and \ndrugs, and recommended that after the woman's safety has been \naddressed, the next step would be to help with providing treatment for \nher addiction as a step toward independence and health, and toward the \nprevention of the consequences for the children who suffer the same \nabuse either directly, or indirectly by witnessing spousal violence.\n  The physical, emotional, and social harm caused by this disease is \nboth preventable and treatable. We know from the excellent research \nconducted at NIH, through the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the \nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, that treatment for \ndrug and alcohol addiction can be effective. The effectiveness of \ntreatment is the major finding from a NIDA-sponsored 4-city study of \ndrug abuse treatment outcomes for 1,200 adolescents. The study showed \nthat community-based treatment programs can reduce drug and alcohol \nuse, improve school performance, and lower involvement with the \ncriminal justice system.\n  Addiction to alcohol and drugs is a disease that affects the brain, \nthe body, and the spirit. We must provide adequate opportunities for \nthe treatment of addiction in order to help those who are suffering and \nto prevent the health and social problems that it causes. We know that \nthe costs to do so are very low. A 1999 study by the Rand Corporation \nfound that the cost to managed care health plans is now only about $5 \nper person per year for unlimited substance abuse treatment benefits to \nemployees of big companies. A 1997 Milliman and Robertson study found \nthat complete substance abuse treatment parity would increase per \ncapita health insurance premiums by only one half of one percent, or \nless than $1 per member per month--without even considering any of the \nobvious savings that will result from treatment. Several studies have \nshown that for every $1 spent on treatment, more than $7 is saved in \nother health care expenses. These savings are in addition to the \nfinancial and other benefits of increased productivity, as well as \nparticipation in family and community life. Providing treatment for \naddiction also saves millions of dollars in the criminal justice \nsystem. But for treatment to be effective and helpful throughout our \nsociety all systems of care, including private insurance plans, must \nshare this responsibility.\n  The National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month in the year \n2001 celebrates the tremendous strides taken by individuals who have \nundergone successful treatment and recognizes those in the treatment \nfield who have dedicated their lives to helping our young people \nrecover from addiction. Many individuals, families, organizations, and \ncommunities give generously of their time and expertise to help those \nsuffering from addiction and to help them to achieve recovery and \nproductive, healthy lives. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, SAMHSA/\nCSAT, in conjunction with national planning partner organizations and \ntreatment providers, have taken a Federal leadership role in promoting \nRecovery Month 2001. The Recovery Month events being planned throughout \nour nation, including one on September 29, in St. Paul, Minnesota, will \nrecognize the countless numbers of those who have successfully \nrecovered from addiction and who are living proof that people of all \nraces, genders, and ages recover every day from the disease of alcohol \nand drug addiction, and now make positive contributions to their \nfamilies, workplaces, communities, state, and nation.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution designating the month of \nSeptember, 2001, as Recovery Month, and to take part in the many local \nand national activities and events recognizing this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8771-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8771-S8772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 148--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 30, 2001, AS ``NATIONAL \n                          WEATHERIZATION DAY''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 148\n\n  Whereas the average family in the United States spends more than \n$1,300 annually on utility bills.\n       Whereas that figure represents nearly 15 percent of a low-\n     income family's income and could approach 18 percent as fuel \n     costs steadily rise;\n       Whereas the Weatherization Assistance Program (referred to \n     in this resolution as the ``Program''), by using Federal, \n     State, local, and private dollars, benefits households and \n     communities across the Nation by providing cost-effective, \n     energy-efficient retrofits to homes occupied by low-income \n     families;\n       Whereas the average energy cost savings for each home that \n     is weatherized is more than $250 annually, allowing families \n     to spend the saved money on groceries, doctor bills, \n     prescriptions, and other needs, thereby making them more \n     self-sufficient;\n       Whereas carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by an average \n     of 1 ton per weatherized household, reducing pollution levels \n     in our air;\n       Whereas 52 jobs are created within the Nation's communities \n     for each $1,000,000 invested in weatherization;\n       Whereas for every $1 invested by the Department of Energy \n     in the Program, another $3.39 is leveraged from other \n     sources;\n       Whereas the Program works with public and private partners \n     to help reduce the energy burden of the Nation's low-income \n     families and promote the benefits of weatherization to all \n     people in the Nation;\n       Whereas people across the Nation should become more aware \n     of the importance of energy conservation, pollution \n     reduction, and safer homes; and\n       Whereas a concerted public information campaign will help \n     get the weatherization message to the people in our Nation: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. NATIONAL RESPONSE TO WEATHERIZATION.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The Senate--\n       (1) designates October 30, 2001, as ``National \n     Weatherization Day'';\n       (2) encourages families to learn about the benefits of \n     weatherizing their homes, including energy conservation, \n     money savings, and safer homes for their children; and\n       (3) encourages community action and service agencies, \n     Federal, State, and local government agencies, and private \n     sector partners to work together to promote the positive \n     aspects of weatherizing our Nation's housing stock.\n       (b) Proclamation.--The Senate requests that the President \n     issue a proclamation calling upon the Federal, State, local, \n     and private sector leaders of our Nation to observe and \n     promote National Weatherization Day with appropriate \n     partnerships, activities, and ceremonies.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, today I am proud to submit a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that October 30, 2001, be designated \nas ``National Weatherization Day.'' By doing so, we will anchor a \nnational effort by States, localities, and community groups to raise \nthe awareness of all Americans concerning the importance of \nweatherizing the Nation's housing stock to conserve energy, thereby \nreducing consumption of all forms of energy.\n  October is already designated as Energy Awareness Month and will \nserve as the ideal host month for this day. Why, then, do we need a day \nspecifically devoted to supporting weatherization efforts? Although \nsome people today know of the benefits of weatherizing a home, most \nunfortunately do not. Weatherization Day, then, will help bring \ntargeted recognition of these efforts, and specifically those of the \nU.S. Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program, which \nuses Federal, State, local, and private dollars to provide cost-\neffective, energy-efficient retrofits to homes occupied by low-income \nfamilies.\n  The average family in the United States spends more than $1,300 \nannually on utility bills. For low-income families, that can take away \nalmost 15 percent of their entire annual income, and 18 percent if fuel \ncosts rise as they have been for the past year. That is unacceptable \nand that is why the Weatherization Assistance Program exists today. The \naverage energy cost savings for each home that is weatherized is more \nthan $250 annually. This gives these families the ability to purchase \nessential items like groceries and prescription drugs, pay for medical \nbills, and make themselves more self-sufficient. At the same time, \nweatherizing a\n\n[[Page S8772]]\n\nhome also provides a substantial economic and environmental boon to \nlocal communities, by adding an average of 52 jobs for every $1,000,000 \ninvested and by reducing carbon dioxide emissions by an average of 1 \nton per weatherized household.\n  I think that we owe it to ourselves and, more importantly, to our \nfuture generations, to continue to improve the awareness of all \nAmericans of the importance of energy conservation, pollution \nreduction, and safer homes. By having a designated Weatherization Day, \nwe will provide much-needed attention to this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8772-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 149--ELECTING ALFONSO E.

ARSENIC IN PLAYGROUND EQUIPMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Health and Human Services has \n     determined that arsenic is a known carcinogen, and the \n     Environmental Protection Agency has classified chromated \n     copper arsenate (CCA), which is 22 percent arsenic, as a \n     ``restricted use chemical.''\n       (2) CCA is often used as a preservative in pressure-treated \n     wood, and CCA-treated wood is widely used in constructing \n     playground equipment frequented by children.\n       (3) In 2001, many communities in Florida and elsewhere have \n     temporarily or permanently closed playgrounds in response to \n     elevated levels of arsenic in soil surrounding CCA-treated \n     wood playground equipment.\n       (4) The State of Florida recently announced that its own \n     wood-treatment plant would cease using arsenic as a \n     preservative.\n       (5) PlayNation Play Systems, which manufactures playground \n     equipment, announced in June 2001 that it would no longer use \n     CCA as a preservative in its playground products.\n       (6) In May 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency \n     announced that it would expedite its ongoing review of the \n     health risks facing children playing near CCA-treated wood \n     playground equipment, and produce its findings in June 2001. \n     The EPA later postponed the release of its risk assessment \n     until the end of the summer of 2001, and announced that its \n     risk assessment would be reviewed by a Scientific Advisory \n     Panel in October 2001.\n       (7) The EPA also plans to expedite its risk assessment \n     regarding the re-registering of arsenic as a pesticide by \n     accelerating its release from 2002 to 2003.\n       (8) The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which has the \n     authority to ban hazardous and dangerous products, announced \n     in June 2001 that it would consider a petition seeking the \n     banning of CCA-treated wood from all playground equipment.\n       (9) Many viable alternatives to CCA-treated wood exist, \n     including cedar, plastic products, aluminum, and treated \n     would without CCA. These products, alone or in combination, \n     can fully replace CCA-treated wood in playground equipment.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the potential health and safety risks to children \n     playing on and around CCA-treated wood playground equipment \n     is a matter of the highest priority, which demands immediate \n     attention from the Congress, the Executive Branch, state and \n     local governments, affected industries, and parents.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, in consultation with the Consumer Product \n     Safety Commissions, shall submit a report to Congress which \n     shall include--\n       (1) the Environmental Protection Agency's most up-to-date \n     understanding of the potential health and safety risks to \n     children playing on and around CCA-treated wood playground \n     equipment;\n       (2) the Environmental Protection Agency's current \n     recommendations to state and local governments about the \n     continued use of CCA-treated wood playground equipment; and\n       (3) an assessment of whether consumers considering \n     purchases of CCA-treated wood playground equipment are \n     adequately informed concerning the health effects associated \n     with arsenic.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 1229.

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY\n\n     ``Sec. 1. Statement of purpose, findings and declaration of \n       policy\n\n       ``The purpose of this compact is to recognize the \n     interstate character of the southern dairy industry and the \n     prerogative of the states under the United States \n     Constitution to form an interstate commission for the \n     southern region. The mission of the commission is to take \n     such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability \n     of dairy farming in the south, and to assure consumers of an \n     adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.\n       ``The participating states find and declare that the dairy \n     industry is an essential agricultural activity of the south. \n     Dairy farms, and associated suppliers, marketers, processors \n     and retailers are an integral component of the region's \n     economy. Their ability to provide a stable, local supply of \n     pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the \n     health and welfare of the region.\n       ``The participating states further find that dairy farms \n     are essential and they are an integral part of the region's \n     rural communities. The farms preserve land for agricultural \n     purposes and provide needed economic stimuli for rural \n     communities.\n       ``In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority \n     over the region's fluid milk market by this compact, the \n     participating states declare their purpose that this compact \n     neither displace the federal order system nor encourage the \n     merging of federal orders. Specific provisions of the compact \n     itself set forth this basic principle.\n       ``Designed as a flexible mechanism able to adjust to \n     changes in a regulated marketplace, the compact also contains \n     a contingency provision should the federal order system be \n     discontinued. In that event, the interstate commission is \n     authorized to regulate the marketplace in replacement of the \n     order system. This contingent authority does not anticipate \n     such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is \n     only provided should developments in the market other than \n     establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the \n     order system.\n       ``By entering into this compact, the participating states \n     affirm that their ability to regulate the price which \n     southern dairy farmers receive for their product is essential \n     to the public interest. Assurance of a fair and equitable \n     price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk \n     to the market and the vitality of the southern dairy \n     industry, with all the associated benefits.\n       ``Recent, dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced \n     downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the \n     southern dairy region. Historically, individual state \n     regulatory action had been an effective emergency remedy \n     available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The \n     federal order system, implemented by the Agricultural \n     Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, establishes only minimum \n     prices paid to producers for raw milk, without preempting the \n     power of states to regulate milk prices above the minimum \n     levels so established.\n       ``In today's regional dairy marketplace, cooperative, \n     rather than individual state action is needed to more \n     effectively address the market disarray. Under our \n     constitutional system, properly authorized states acting \n     cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate interstate \n     commerce than they may assert individually without such \n     authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke \n     their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent \n     of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution.\n\n          ``ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION\n\n     ``Sec. 2.

In \n     accordance with this intent, the technical terms which are \n     associated with market order regulation and which have \n     acquired commonly understood general meanings are not defined \n     herein but the commission may further define the terms used \n     in this compact and develop additional concepts and define \n     additional terms as it may find appropriate to achieve its \n     purposes.\n\n                 ``ARTICLE III.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The condition of highway, railway, and waterway \n     infrastructure across the Nation varies widely and is in need \n     of improvement and investment.\n       (2) Thousands of tons of hazardous chemicals, and a very \n     small amount of high level radioactive material, is \n     transported along the Nation's highways, railways, and \n     waterways each year.\n       (3) The volume of hazardous chemical transport increased by \n     over one-third in the last 25 years and is expected to \n     continue to increase. Some propose significantly increasing \n     radioactive material transport.\n       (4) Approximately 261,000 people were evacuated across the \n     Nation because of rail-related accidental releases of \n     hazardous chemicals between 1978 and 1995, and during that \n     period industry reported 8 transportation accidents involving \n     the small volume of high level radioactive waste transported \n     during that period.\n       (5) The Federal Railroad Administration has significantly \n     decreased railroad inspections and has allocated few \n     resources since 1993 to assure the structural integrity of \n     railroad bridges. Train derailments have increased by 18 \n     percent over roughly the same period.\n       (6) The poor condition of highway, railway, and waterway \n     infrastructure, increases in the volume of hazardous chemical \n     transport, and proposed increases in radioactive material \n     transport increase the risk of accidents involving such \n     chemicals and materials.\n       (7) Measuring the risks of hazardous chemical or \n     radioactive material accidents and preventing such accidents \n     requires specific information concerning the condition and \n     suitability of specific transportation routes contemplated \n     for such transport to inform and enable investment in related \n     infrastructure.\n       (8) Mitigating the impact of hazardous chemical and \n     radioactive material transportation accidents requires \n     skilled, localized, and well-equipped emergency response \n     personnel along all specifically identified transportation \n     routes.\n       (9) Accidents involving hazardous chemical or radioactive \n     material transport pose threats to the public health and \n     safety, the environment, and the economy.\n       (b) Study.--The Secretary of Transportation shall, in \n     consultation with the Comptroller General of the United \n     States, conduct a study of the hazards and risks to public \n     health and safety, the environment, and the economy \n     associated with the transportation of hazardous chemicals and \n     radioactive material.\n       (c) Matters To Be Addressed.--The study under subsection \n     (b) shall address the following matters:\n       (1) Whether the Federal Government conducts individualized \n     and detailed evaluations and inspections of the condition and \n     suitability of specific transportation routes for the \n     current, and any anticipated or proposed, transport of \n     hazardous chemicals and radioactive material, including \n     whether resources and information are adequate to conduct \n     such evaluations and inspections.\n       (2) The costs and time required to ensure adequate \n     inspection of specific transportation routes and related \n     infrastructure and to complete the infrastructure \n     improvements necessary to ensure the safety of current, and \n     any anticipated or proposed, hazardous chemical and \n     radioactive material transport.\n\n[[Page S8844]]\n\n       (3) Whether Federal, State, and local emergency \n     preparedness personnel, emergency response personnel, and \n     medical personnel are adequately trained and equipped to \n     promptly respond to accidents along specific transportation \n     routes for current, anticipated, or proposed hazardous \n     chemical and radioactive material transport.\n       (4) The costs and time required to ensure that Federal, \n     State, and local emergency preparedness personnel, emergency \n     response personnel, and medical personnel are adequately \n     trained and equipped to promptly respond to accidents along \n     specific transportation routes for current, anticipated, or \n     proposed hazardous chemical and radioactive material \n     transport.\n       (5) The availability of, or requirements to establish, \n     information collection and dissemination systems adequate to \n     provide the public, in an accessible manner, with timely, \n     complete, specific, and accurate information (including \n     databases) concerning actual, proposed, or anticipated \n     shipments by highway, railway, or waterway of hazardous \n     chemicals and radioactive materials, including accidents \n     involving the transportation of such chemicals and materials \n     by those means.\n       (d) Deadline for Completion.--The study under subsection \n     (b) shall be completed not later than six months after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (e) Report.--Upon completion of the study under subsection \n     (b), the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the \n     study.\n       Sec. 351. (a) Of the funds appropriated by title I for the \n     Federal Railroad Administration under the heading ``Railroad \n     Research and Development'', up to $750,000 may be expended to \n     pay 25 percent of the total cost of a comprehensive study to \n     assess existing problems in the freight and passenger rail \n     infrastructure in the vicinity of Baltimore, Maryland, that \n     the Secretary of Transportation shall carry out through the \n     Federal Railroad Administration in cooperation with, and with \n     a total amount of equal funding contributed by, Norfolk-\n     Southern Corporation, CSX Corporation, and the State of \n     Maryland.\n       (b)(1) The study shall include an analysis of the \n     condition, track, and clearance limitations and efficiency of \n     the existing tunnels, bridges, and other railroad facilities \n     owned or operated by CSX Corporation, Amtrak, and Norfolk-\n     Southern Corporation in the Baltimore area.\n       (2) The study shall examine the benefits and costs of \n     various alternatives for reducing congestion and improving \n     safety and efficiency in the operations on the rail \n     infrastructure in the vicinity of Baltimore, including such \n     alternatives for improving operations as shared usage of \n     track, and such alternatives for improving the rail \n     infrastructure as possible improvements to existing tunnels, \n     bridges, and other railroad facilities, or construction of \n     new facilities.\n       (c) Not later than one year after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report on the \n     results of the study to Congress. The report shall include \n     recommendations on the matters described in subsection \n     (b)(2).\n       Sec. 352. Priority Highway Projects, Georgia. In selecting \n     projects to carry out using funds apportioned under section \n     110 of title 23, United States Code, the State of Georgia \n     shall give priority consideration to the following projects:\n       (1) Improving Johnson Ferry Road from the Chattahoochee \n     River to Abernathy Road, including the bridge over the \n     Chattahoochee River.\n       (2) Widening Abernathy Road from 2 to 4 lanes from Johnson \n     Ferry Road to Roswell Road.\n       Sec. 353. Safety Belt Use Law Requirements. Section 355(a) \n     of the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 (109 \n     Stat. 624) is amended by striking ``has achieved'' and all \n     that follows and inserting the following: ``has achieved a \n     safety belt use rate of not less than 50 percent.''.\n       Sec. 354. Study of Mississippi River Bridge in Memphis, \n     Tennessee. Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall \n     conduct a study and submit to Congress a report on the costs \n     and benefits of constructing a third bridge across the \n     Mississippi River in the Memphis, Tennessee, metropolitan \n     area.\n       Sec. 355. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 345 of the National Highway System Designation \n     Act of 1995 authorizes limited relief to drivers of certain \n     types of commercial motor vehicles from certain restrictions \n     on maximum driving time and on-duty time.\n       (2) Subsection (c) of that section requires the Secretary \n     of Transportation to determine by rulemaking proceedings that \n     the exemptions granted are not in the public interest and \n     adversely affect the safety of commercial motor vehicles.\n       (3) Subsection (d) of that section requires the Secretary \n     of Transportation to monitor the safety performance of \n     drivers of commercial motor vehicles who are subject to an \n     exemption under section 345 and report to Congress prior to \n     the rulemaking proceedings.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of \n     Transportation should not take any action that would diminish \n     or revoke any exemption in effect on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act for drivers of vehicles under section \n     345 of the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 \n     (Public Law 104-59; 109 Stat. 613; 49 U.S.C. 31136 note) \n     unless the requirements of subsections (c) and (d) of such \n     section are satisfied.\n       Sec. 356. Section 41703 of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Air Cargo Via Alaska.--For purposes of subsection (c) \n     of this section, cargo taken on or off any aircraft at a \n     place in Alaska in the course of transportation of that cargo \n     by one or more air carriers or foreign air carriers in either \n     direction between any place in the United States and a place \n     not in the United States shall not be deemed to have broken \n     its international journey, be taken on in, or be destined for \n     Alaska.''.\n       Sec. 357. Point Retreat Light Station, including all \n     property under lease as of June 1, 2000, is transferred to \n     the Alaska Lighthouse Association.\n       Sec. 358. Priority Highway Projects, Minnesota. In \n     selecting projects to carry out using funds apportioned under \n     section 110 of title 23, United States Code, the State of \n     Minnesota shall give priority consideration to the following \n     projects:\n       (1) The Southeast Main and Rail Relocation Project in \n     Moorhead, Minnesota.\n       (2) Improving access to and from I-35 W at Lake Street in \n     Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n       Sec. 359. Noise Barriers, Georgia. Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, the Secretary of Transportation shall \n     approve the use of funds apportioned under paragraphs (1) and \n     (3) of section 104(b) of title 23, United States Code, for \n     construction of Type II noise barriers--\n       (1) at the locations identified in section 358 of the \n     Department of Transportation and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 2000 (113 Stat. 1027); and\n       (2) on the west side of Interstate Route 285 from Henderson \n     Mill Road to Chamblee Tucker Road in DeKalb County, Georgia.\n       Sec. 360. The Secretary is directed to give priority \n     consideration to applications for airport improvement grants \n     for the Addison Airport in Addison, Texas, Pearson Airpark in \n     Vancouver, Washington, Mobile Regional Airport in Mobile, \n     Alabama, Marks Airport in Mississippi, Madison Airport in \n     Mississippi, and Birmingham International Airport in \n     Birmingham, Alabama.\n       Sec. 361. Section 5117(b)(3) of the Transportation Equity \n     Act for the 21st Century (Public Law 105-178; 112 Stat. 449; \n     23 U.S.C. 502 note) is amended --\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) as \n     subparagraphs (D), (F), and (G), respectively;\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new \n     subparagraph (C):\n       ``(C) Follow-on deployment.--(i) After an intelligent \n     transportation infrastructure system deployed in an initial \n     deployment area pursuant to a contract entered into under the \n     program under this paragraph has received system acceptance, \n     the original contract that was competitively awarded by the \n     Department of Transportation for the deployment of the system \n     in that area shall be extended to provide for the system to \n     be deployed in the follow-on deployment areas under the \n     contract, using the same asset ownership, maintenance, fixed \n     price contract, and revenue sharing model, and the same \n     competitively selected consortium leader, as were used for \n     the deployment in that initial deployment area under the \n     program.\n       ``(ii) If any one of the follow-on deployment areas does \n     not commit, by July 1, 2002, to participate in the deployment \n     of the system under the contract, then, upon application by \n     any of the other follow-on deployment areas that have \n     committed by that date to participate in the deployment of \n     the system, the Secretary shall supplement the funds made \n     available for any of the follow-on deployment areas \n     submitting the applications by using for that purpose the \n     funds not used for deployment of the system in the \n     nonparticipating area.

LENHARDT AS SERGEANT AT ARMS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 149) providing for the election of \n     Alfonso E. Lenhardt as Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the \n     Senate, effective September 4, 2001.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, it is my honor to welcome Alfonso E. \nLenhardt as Sergeant at Arms of the U.S. Senate.\n  In 1789, when the office was first established, the challenges of the \njob\n\n[[Page S8845]]\n\nwere quite different than they are today. The Sergeant at Arms was \ngiven the responsibility for keeping a majority of members together \nlong enough to organize and begin the business of government.\n  Today, the job has grown, and so has the office. The Sergeant at Arms \nis now the chief protocol and law enforcement officer of the Senate, as \nwell as the administrative manager for many Senate support services. \nThe Sergeant at Arms oversees the largest staff and budget in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  That expanded role demands expanded skills--in both law-enforcement \nand management.\n  In every position he has held, Al Lenhardt has demonstrated those \nskills as well as a solemn commitment to public service.\n  Al retired from the United States Army in 1997 as a Major General \nafter over 31 years of domestic and international experience in \nnational security and law enforcement programs. As Commanding General \nat the U.S. Army Recruiting Command in Ft. Knox, KY, he managed and \ndirected over 13,000 people in over 1,800 separate locations.\n  Before the recruiting command, Al served as the senior military \npolice officer in the Army, overseeing all Army police operations and \nsecurity matters worldwide and managing a budget of over $300 million.\n  For the past four years, he has served as Executive Vice President \nand Chief Operating Officer of the Council on Foundations, a non-profit \nmembership association of foundations and corporate philanthropic \norganizations.\n  Al Lenhardt is a versatile senior executive with the stature, the \nmanagement experience and the law enforcement portfolio to make an \noutstanding Senate Sergeant at Arms. While Al Lenhardt may not be \nreadily known to you because he has no prior connection to me or to the \nSenate, I think my colleagues will be impressed with the experience, \nthe ability and the character of the man.\n  In the 212 year history of the Senate, Al Lenhardt will become the \n35th person to serve as Sergeant at Arms, and the first African \nAmerican to hold this position.\n  But more importantly, Al is clearly of the highest caliber and \nqualifications. The Senate will benefit greatly from his service and \nleadership. We all look forward to working with him in the months and \nyears ahead.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, without \nintervening action for debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 149) was agreed to.\n  (The text of S. Res. 149 is printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8845-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1246\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Madam President, I am here on the floor out of a sense \nof frustration and I suppose a very deep sense of dedication, maybe \nbecause I am from a seventh-generation Arkansas farm family, maybe \nbecause I am a daughter of a farmer who I watched for many years \ntoiling to ensure that he could provide a good upbringing, a good \nheritage to his family, working on that family farm.\n  Maybe it is because I have watched neighbors and family members who \nhave had to give up a way of life and a profession, a piece of their \nheritage, because they were unsure of where their Government was going \nto be for them as family farmers. Or perhaps it is because they were \ninundated by so many things that were unpredictable, things they could \nnot predict or control such as the weather or the economy or the fact \nthat their Government could not make a decision as to whether the \nfamily farmer was important enough to support and to keep in business.\n  I am really here because, in the 11th hour, I still take my job very \nseriously. That job is to be here to fight hard, to do everything I can \nto support that American farmer and that farmer in Arkansas who has \nspent this entire year trying to put out a crop and wondering whether \nor not his or her Government was going to come through in the end with \nan emergency supplemental appropriation as we promised.\n  I am here to talk about agriculture and to talk about the rural \neconomic crisis that we are on the verge of making even worse. Six \nyears ago, Congress and the White House, the Republicans and the \nDemocrats, stood toe to toe and dared each other to blink. Of course no \none did, and all that happened is that the Federal Government shut \ndown. FSA offices and other important Government offices around the \ncountry closed. Farmers could not get access to the services they \nneeded. Seniors could not access the services they needed. People all \naround the country were knocking on Government doors that would not \nopen. But up here in Washington, instead of sitting down and figuring \nout how to get those doors open, politicians only pointed fingers at \neach other. They were more concerned about laying blame on each other \nthan finding a solution.\n  Here we are again. Now we find ourselves at another impasse, this \ntime on an emergency assistance package for farmers that is profoundly \ncrucial to the economic well-being of our farmers and our rural \neconomies, an emergency assistance package we have been talking about \nsince February. In February we started talking about the dire situation \nour farmers were in, that rural America was in dire straits because we \nhad not addressed their needs, whether it was in trade or whether it \nwas in how Government was going to provide them what they needed in \norder to be competitive and maintain themselves in a competitive way in \nthe global marketplace.\n  Whether we are talking about the delta region of Arkansas and \nMississippi or the prairies of the Dakotas or anywhere else for that \nmatter, our rural economies are in deep trouble.\n  I don't think there is a single person in this body who would dispute \nthat. Our farmers are hurting, and they are hurting badly. But, of \ncourse, they are not the only ones who are hurting. All of the small \ntown institutions, businesses, and local banks were up here to talk to \nus back in February about what we do in extending these loans to these \ncritical people in our communities. Do we give them a loan knowing \ntheir cost of production is going to be enormous because of energy and \nbecause of fertilizer input? Do we extend that loan knowing the prices \nare in the tank on commodities and have remained there and probably \nwill remain there?\n  It is also hurting the suppliers, the corner grocery stores on Main \nStreet, and the car dealers. They are all hurting because their \nviability depends on the health of the farm economy.\n  Colleagues, this crisis is real, and we are on the verge of making it \nmuch, much worse. If we don't get an emergency assistance package \npassed this week, these farmers and these small towns--very real \npeople, many of whom happen to be related to me and to you--and these \nrural economies will have run out of time.\n  I am frustrated. I am outraged that we have been sitting in this \nChamber all week without being able to come to agreement on an \nemergency package that we all agree our farmers need. The House passed \na $5.5 billion emergency package, and they are saying, oh, just do what \nwe did, and we can all go home. But that doesn't even meet the needs of \nthe AMTA assistance payments that our farmers need to survive. The fact \nis, it doesn't even give them what they had prior to 1999.\n  Because of the Freedom to Farm Act, we have ratcheted down the \npayments\n\n[[Page S8846]]\n\nevery year that the Government is willing to provide to help them \ncompete in that global marketplace. What happened? We are coming now \nand asking them to take even less in that emergency assistance.\n  I don't blame Republicans and I don't blame Democrats. I blame all of \nus because we are all responsible if we are unable to come together \nbecause we are ready to go home or because we are tired and we don't \nwant to do our job by coming together and getting a package approved \nand sending it out to rural America.\n  I plead with the President. He visited with Young Farmers of America \nthe other day and talked about how agriculture and farmers are the soul \nof America. Let me tell you, they need us right now. They need us a \nlot.\n  It is our duty at this point not to be tired, not to go home, but to \nsit down with one another and talk about how we can come together to \nprovide them what they need. It is no wonder that the citizens of this \ncountry are cynical about what goes on in Washington. Farmers have been \nout there toiling all year and for centuries--many centuries ago--to \nprovide us with the safest, most abundant and affordable food supply in \nthis world.\n  I think it certainly behooves us to stay a few extra hours to come up \nwith something that is going to be the best possible job and the best \npossible package for our American farmers. They look for farm support \nand all they see is another showdown at the OK Corral. Only it isn't \nCongress. It is our farmers, and our rural economy, and the people who \nlive in these communities who are in the line of fire. We need to put \nour guns back in our holsters, and we need to find some resolution to \nthis impasse.\n  I, for one, am ready to stay here and do the job that the people of \nArkansas sent me here to do; that is, to work out an agreement and come \nup with the solutions on behalf of those people who ensure that I and \nmy children, and you and your children, have a safe, abundant, and \naffordable food supply day in and day out.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nArkansas for the very poignant speech she just gave about the plight of \nagriculture in America. Senator Lincoln has said it succinctly and with \nmeaning and I think with a passion that she rightly has to fight for \nthe people who live in our small towns and communities--our farmers. \nShe is right. They are hurting. We have to pay attention.\n  We are operating under the failed Freedom to Farm bill that was \npassed back in 1996. Year after year we have had to come in and patch \nit up, fix it up, and put in supplemental payments to keep our farmers \nalive, to keep their heads above water.\n  It is another reason why in the new farm bill we have to make the \nchanges necessary to get off of the old failed Freedom to Farm bill and \nto have a farm bill where we don't have to rely on a yearly basis on a \nfickle Congress or a President who says no.\n  We have come up with a bill out of our Agriculture Committee that \nwould at least provide for our farmers the same payment they received \nlast year to help keep them going. But, even with those payments, it \nwon't make them whole because of the increased fuel prices and \nfertilizer prices and everything else.\n  I have heard from the administration that the reason they don't want \nthe bill we reported out of the Committee is because they have seen net \nfarm income go up this year. I am sorry. I don't know what figures they \nare looking at. I think what they are saying is last year our farm \nprices were at a 15-year low. Farm income is a little better than last \nyear, but really the increase comes almost entirely from increased \nlivestock prices--not grain prices. Prices are still in the basement. \nBut the bill before us provides money to the crop farmers. They are the \nones who are hurting. But the President said no, that he is going to \nveto the bill because he said farmers don't need that much money. Keep \nin mind that the bill is within our budget guidelines. We are doing \nexactly what the budget allows us to do, but the President says no, it \nis too much.\n  This is the difference. I have to point this out. In the fall of \n1998, Congress passed emergency relief for farmers. It went to the \nWhite House. President Clinton vetoed it because it wasn't enough to \nhelp our farmers. We came back and added more money to keep our farmers \nalive and well.\n  This year the Senate passed a bill to provide sufficient support for \nour farmers. This President says no, he will veto it because it is too \nmuch. What a difference.\n  What do we have here that is costing extra money? We have the full \nlevel of market loss and oilseed payments that were in a similar \npackage last year. We also have nutrition, rural economic development \nand conservation money. We have money for several conservation \nprograms, including the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Wildlife Habitat \nIncentives Program, the Farmland Protection Program, the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program.\n  Right now for the Wetlands Reserve Program we have a backlog of $568 \nmillion nationwide. Here are the top 10 States with the backlog: \nArkansas, Iowa, California, Louisiana, Missouri, Florida, Minnesota, \nIllinois, Michigan, and Mississippi.\n  Our bill provides $200 million to cut that backlog down by over a \nthird. It would enroll 150,000 acres in the Wetlands Reserve Program. \nThe President says no. That is too much.\n  For the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, the backlog is $14 \nmillion. We have put in $7 million to cut it down by half. Again, the \ntop 10 States are Oregon, Texas, Florida, West Virginia, Arkansas, \nColorado, Maine, Michigan, Arkansas, and South Dakota. We had $7 \nmillion, and the President says no. That is too much.\n  The Farmland Protection Program is a program that provides some money \nfor the state and local governments and non-profit groups so they can \nbuy development easements from farmers to stop the urban sprawl. There \nis a $255 million backlog for FPP. The top 10 States are: California, \nNew York, Maryland, Florida, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Kentucky, \nMichigan, New Jersey, and Massachusetts.\n\n  In that program, we put $40 million to help leverage money supplied \nby state and local governments, as well as non-profit groups--they are \nalready doing it--to help buy easements to keep the land from being \ndeveloped for non-agricultural purposes. The President says: No, that \nis too much money.\n  Finally, we have the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. The \nbacklog is over $1.3 billion. We have $250 million in the bill, plus \n$200 million already in the law, which would help cut that down by \nabout a third. Again, the top 10 States are: Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia, \nArkansas, Kansas, Montana, Kentucky, Nebraska, Tennessee, and Virginia. \nWe put $250 million in the bill. The President says: No, it is too much \nmoney.\n  It is not too much, in any case, to help save our soil and our water, \nto provide conservation money to farmers and ranchers in America who \nneed the help and who need the support.\n  The Lugar substitute, that I guess we will be voting on, takes out \nall this conservation money. It provides zero dollars for conservation. \nIt is rather sad that we are in this situation. We are trying to help \nfarmers be good stewards and the President stands in the way.\n  As Senator Lincoln said: Our farmers are good stewards of their land. \nThey try to take good care of it. In many cases, these farmers are \nspending their own money, using their own equipment, spending their \ntime--and all we are trying to do is give them some help and support. \nAnd the President has said: No, that is too much.\n  We will debate this more tomorrow. But tonight I wanted to just point \nout what we have in the bill, to try to help our farmers with \nconservation. Three of these programs will be put into jeopardy, and \nall will be underfunded. The Wetlands Reserve Program, the Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program and the Farmland Protection Program will all \nbe put in jeopardy because we will not fund them if the Lugar amendment \nis adopted.\n  Finally, I have had a lot of conversations with people at the White \nHouse and OMB today. They want to spend only $5.5 billion. When I asked \nwhy, I got the answer: Because they want $5.5 billion.\n\n[[Page S8847]]\n\n  I don't see any real reason for it because the budget does allow us \nto spend not only $5.5 billion in fiscal 2001, but $7.35 billion for \nfiscal 2002.\n  So what we are trying to do is what the budget allows us to do right \nnow: get the money out to help our farmers now, get the conservation \nprogram funding out, and get money out to help some of our specialty \ncrop producers around the country. And basically the President is \nsaying, no.\n  I hope the Senate will persevere. I hope we will tell the President \nwe have to fight for our farmers and our farm families; that we cannot, \nfor no good reason fail to send the help they need. I have not heard \none good reason from the White House why we should not put this money \nout to help save our farmers. I believe we have to, that we must, and I \nhope we do tomorrow.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, be allowed to speak for up to 15 \nminutes after I speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/02/senate-section/article/S8847-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO KANSAS GOVERNOR JOAN FINNEY\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nKansan the Presiding Officer knew. She died as a result of \ncomplications associated with her fight with liver cancer--a lady who \nwas the first female Governor of the State of Kansas, Joan Finney. She \nwas a lady I had the privilege of serving with in State government.\n  I was Secretary of Agriculture under her for a brief period of time. \nShe was a remarkable lady.\n  One of the tributes that was given to her yesterday, when the State \npaid their final respects to Governor Finney, was by Rev. Francis \nKrische, pastor of the Most Pure Heart of Mary Catholic Church, who \nstated to the mourners something about Governor Finney that probably \ncaptures the essence of Governor Finney, a beautiful woman. He said \nthis about her: ``She knew how to be with people. This was one of the \nkeys to her success.''\n  She really did know how to be with people. She had been elected \ntreasurer in the State of Kansas for 4 terms. She was elected as the \nfirst female Governor in the State of Kansas from 1991 to 1995. She \nstarted out her career in politics serving a Member of this body, \nSenator Frank Carlson, whose seat I now occupy.\n  She worked for him for several years doing constituent work, which \nfit Governor Finney beautifully because she so loved to help people. \nShe was beautiful about it. She was beautiful about working with \npeople. I would be around her at different events, and it was always so \namazing to me the depth of her knowledge of the people she would see \nwhom she knew. She knew the family members. She knew something about \nwhat was happening in their families. I sometimes thought she knew all \nof the people of Kansas.\n  She was really a beautiful lady. I think the depth of her caring was \nsuch a key characteristic of hers. To learn and know about an \nindividual is how much she cared about the people she was working for \nand serving, whether it was as a caseworker for Senator Carlson or \nwhether it was as State treasurer or whether it was as Governor of the \nState of Kansas.\n  The Democrat Party, in its annual meeting this year in Topeka, \nadopted a resolution regarding Governor Finney and stated this about \nher: ``She was truly one of Kansas' most adored native daughters. And \nshe was.'' She was adored by the people.\n  She felt that the people's view was the correct one, even though she \nmight disagree with it. She would go ahead and proceed forward with \nthat view, whatever it might be. She was, in that sense, a populist in \nthe best sense of the word: It was to represent the people. And the \npeople's will was paramount in politics.\n  She had a deep heart. She really cared for the people who she served. \nAnd you could see, this was not something that was a practiced skill of \nhers, where she would work, for example, at learning people's names. It \nwas written in her heart. She knew these people in her heart. She cared \nfor them. While many people would have had disagreements on different \npolicy issues, they would never disagree with the heart of Joan Finney \nbecause it was one of those pure hearts.\n  She played the harp for a number of people. She played it \nprofessionally. It was a gift that she used frequently when asked. It \nwas something I think that also helped to express just the inside of \nwho this beautiful woman was. She was somebody who really played \nbeautifully and played purely in the game of life.\n  So as people say their prayers tonight, I hope they remember Joan \nFinney, as well as her husband Spencer, who is still alive, although \nmourning, obviously, the death of his spouse. I hope they will remember \nher. And I can guarantee she would remember them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, on Wednesday, Kansans paid their final \nrespects to Governor Finney and I join with my colleague Senator \nBrownback in expressing our state's condolences to the Finney family.\n  While Senate business kept me from attending her funeral in Topeka, I \nwant to share with my colleagues her success in Kansas government and \npolitics. Although Joan and I belonged to different political parties, \nshe put those differences aside when it came to work together for the \nState of Kansas.\n  Governor Finney was a straight shooter, never ducking behind guarded \nwords. Some believe that her direct nature hurt her politically in the \nState Capitol, but Kansans appreciated this quality. In an interview \nwith the Topeka Capital Journal she said, ``I believe the people should \nbe supreme in all things . . . Even if you don't agree and the majority \nwant a certain issue and believe in a certain issue, I accept that and \nI will stand by the people.''\n  Governor Finney is a key figure in Kansas' strong tradition of \nelecting women to various offices. She served as State Treasurer for \nfour consecutive terms and then was elected as the first female \ngovernor serving from 1991 to 1995. She will be remembered for her \ndedication and hardwork for all Kansans throughout her life.\n  During his sermon, Reverend Francis Krische, pastor of the Most Pure \nHeart of Mary Catholic Church reminded mourners that ``She knew how to \nbe with people. This was one of the keys to her success''.\n  Madam President, it is painful when God calls home a friend and \ncolleague, but her memory will continue to remind us of our commitment \nto our constituents and family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
