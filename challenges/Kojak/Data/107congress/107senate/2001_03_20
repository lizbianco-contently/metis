Mr. President, today the Senate will immediately resume \nconsideration of the campaign finance reform legislation. An amendment \nregarding self-financed campaigns is expected to be offered, with up to \n3 hours of debate in order. It is also expected that some debate time \nwill be yielded back and that a vote will occur sometime around noon \ntoday--certainly before the weekly party luncheons. We will be in \nrecess from approximately 12:30 until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly \nconferences to meet. Amendments are expected to be offered throughout \nthe day and therefore votes on amendments are expected to occur \napproximately every 3 hours.\n  I am concerned about the very inauspicious beginning that the Senate \nhad on this legislation yesterday. I had described it as a jump ball, \nwhere everybody would have a free and fair opportunity to offer \namendments and have debate but there would be votes on those amendments \nafter 3 hours. I expected we would have a vote sometime between 5:30 \nand 6:30, as we did yesterday, and there would be debate on the next \namendment last night and we would be ready for a vote now. That is not \nthe case because of the spectacle that occurred at the end of the vote \nyesterday.\n  I thought it did not go well, and I thought the Senate looked very \nclose to being silly on our first amendment on this very important \nissue. I was stunned, quite frankly; on an amendment as broadly \nsupported as I know the amendment is, to give candidates that are \nrunning against superwealthy candidates some way to be able to compete, \nI can't help but believe that when we get a direct vote on that issue, \nit will pass overwhelmingly. My assumption was that it got tangled up \njust because it was the first vote and there was a desire to show that \none side or the other was going to win. I was very disappointed in \nthat.\n  I am also concerned, with the agreement that was reached, in all \nfairness, on both sides, that we would have amendments and regular \nvotes every 3 hours, we had already slipped 3 hours on that. And also I \nhope, once again, that objections to Senators amending their own \namendments will not be heard. The tradition around here is that we \nallow colleagues to amend their own amendments. I think that is when \nthe confusion began yesterday in a very disappointing beginning.\n  But Senators on both sides worked last night and worked this morning, \nand I understand an agreement has been reached as to the amendment that \nwill be offered in a few minutes. After that is offered, we will come \nback and have another amendment on this side of the aisle and Senator \nMcConnell and others will have an opportunity.\n  I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I tell the majority leader that we have an \namendment. I don't believe it will take all 3 hours because it was \ndebated last night. We have an agreement which is being written up now. \nSo I believe that\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\nwe could, within a fairly brief period of time, have a vote on it and \nmove on to another amendment from the Republican side, thereby sort of \ncatching up from yesterday.\n  I mention also that we were supposed to start at noon yesterday, but \nwe didn't start until 1. I don't know whose decision that was. That is \nnot important. We can catch up this morning. We met this morning and we \nare getting the final details, which we needed to do. This is a very \ncomplex, extremely complex issue.\n\n  The challenges of a millionaire declaring his or her candidacy in \nWyoming are significantly different from doing that in the State of \nCalifornia. We tried to accommodate it and, frankly, we have. Those \nissues were still unresolved last night when the vote was attempted, \nand all of us were confident that we could work out the differences, \nbring up an agreement, which will be brought up in the name of Senator \nDomenici and Senator DeWine and Senator Durbin, and we can have a \nrelatively brief period of debate and vote on it and then move to \nanother amendment by Senator McConnell, or whoever he designates.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say to Senator McCain--and then I \nwill yield to Senator Reid--I appreciate the fact that something has \nbeen worked out which appears to be fair to all sides. And since we \nalready debated it for a time yesterday, it won't be necessary to \nrehash all of that. Maybe we can make up for some of the lost time.\n  The clear understanding, when the Senator from Arizona and I \ndiscussed this issue, was that we would try to keep it on a steady \nschedule and get amendments offered and voted on every 3 hours, or less \nif possible.\n  I yield to Senator Reid.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are hopeful that the first vote is not \nindicative of what the future is going to hold. I hope that will be the \ndownside of the work on this important piece of legislation. I think \nyesterday was well spent. There were relatively very few quorum calls, \nmaybe just for brief moments, and I think we were able to accomplish a \nlot last night and this morning. I also say that during this next day \nor two, there are a number of Members who wish to give statements about \nthe bill itself. They can do this during the time these amendments are \npending. Some of them want to take the full 3 hours. I have already \ntold Senator McCain that I am not too certain that we need to \nalternate. We don't have many amendments over here. So I publicly \nadvise those on the other side of the aisle who want to offer \namendments, they should get them ready because we are not going to have \na lot to offer.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I may respond to the last suggestion, that would be \nfine. However, we want to make sure that, if we don't alternate, at the \nend we don't have amendments show up that would be offered, one behind \nthe other, on the other side. I know that is not the Senator's \nintention. That is one of the reasons why we alternate, so that one \nside or the other won't have a block of amendments at the end of the \nprocess.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Senator yielding. There are three \nRepublican amendments. There would be one Democratic amendment, and we \nwould go back to the Republican side. That is how we should do it.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2536-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 27, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 27) to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     of 1971 to provide bipartisan campaign reform.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Democratic \nleader, or his designee, is recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the amendment \nSenator Domenici is going to offer is not yet ready, but we want to \nstart talking about it, the procedure being at such time the amendment \ncomes from legislative drafting, Senator Durbin will be recognized when \nthe Chair feels that is appropriate. He will yield at that time to \nSenator Domenici, who will offer an amendment on his behalf, and \nwhoever else wants to be on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Nevada if he \nagrees that we ought to begin the 3-hour time limit.\n  Mr. REID. I agree.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, even though \nthe amendment has not yet been laid down, since we are going to be \ndiscussing it, that the 3-hour time limit begin with this discussion. \nWe understand most of that time may be yielded back, but at least this \nwill begin the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I believe the agreement of the Senate as \nwe adjourned yesterday was that the Democratic side, this Senator in \nparticular, would be offering an amendment. I am prepared very shortly \nto yield to the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Ohio and \nto acknowledge their leadership on this issue. We are addressing \nprobably one of the most complicated problems we face, a Supreme Court \ndecision in Buckley v. Valeo which said that a person who decides to \nrun for office and is personally wealthy cannot be limited in the \namount of personal wealth they spend in order to obtain this office.\n\n  Meanwhile, other candidates who are not personally wealthy face all \nsorts of limitations on how much money they can raise from individuals, \nhow much they can raise in a given period of time, how much they can \nraise from political action committees.\n  The effort in which I have joined Senator Domenici and Senator DeWine \nis a response to that, I hope a reasonable response to that, which says \nwe know the day will come when wealthy people will run for office, but \nwe also want to say if you are not wealthy, you should have a chance to \ncompete and to deliver your message to the voters and to appeal to them \nfor support.\n  We have come up with a proposal which Senator Domenici and Senator \nDeWine will describe in detail. We were having conversations on the \nfloor, up to the beginning of this speech, about aspects of this matter \nwhich we hope to address. If we cannot address it particularly in the \nlanguage of this amendment, we will acknowledge what we consider to be \nsome of the questions that will be raised and try to address it later \nin debate. We have been in conversation with Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold. They are familiar with what we are doing. I do not purport to \nsuggest they support it. They can speak for themselves. We believe this \nis a responsible way to address a serious problem we face in political \ncampaigns.\n  If the Senator from New Mexico is prepared, at this point I yield to \nhim with the understanding that when the amendment arrives, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, and Senator DeWine, and I will join as \ncosponsors with others.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator from Illinois, I thank the Senator \nfor his cooperation and help. Obviously, the Senator came on board with \nthe idea encapsulated in the Domenici amendment yesterday, and as we \nprogressed through it, it appeared that a number of Senators wanted \nsome changes. So we set about yesterday evening--and well into the \nevening--to try to arrive at changes necessary to accommodate a wide \nvariety of Senators and still make it effective.\n\n[[Page S2537]]\n\n  There is no question, anytime you work on something as complicated as \nthis, although we think we have done a good job, it may very well be in \ndue course, as this bill evolves further, that there may have to be \nother amendments as people analyze and find other problems that might \nbe inherent in this situation.\n  I thank in a very special way Senator DeWine from the State of Ohio. \nFrom the beginning, we had hoped that yesterday we would introduce a \nDomenici-DeWine amendment. I introduced the amendment which was debated \nyesterday. Many people at least understand what we are trying to do and \nwhat the problem is. To the extent we are trying to figure out a \nsolution, Senator DeWine has been a marvelous partner and an excellent \nleader.\n  Today I will briefly explain what we are trying to do and some of the \nbasic fundamentals, and then I will yield to Senator DeWine.\n  The way we will determine the trigger for the nonwealthy candidate--\nthat is, the candidate confronted with an opponent who will spend a lot \nof their own money--will vary in States depending on the voting age \npopulation. That is Senator DeWine's idea. In essence, it says to a \nSenator in a State such as Idaho, if somebody decides to run and spends \ntheir own money in large quantities, that Senator is going to be able \nto raise money somewhat easier than he or she would have if they were \nbound by the 26-year-old law which has $1,000 individual contribution \nlimits per election and $5,000 in money that can come from PACs.\n\n  Essentially, once you hit the formula amount, this is what will \nhappen. When you reach the first level, the individual limits are \nraised to $3,000 under current law. That means you can raise $3,000 in \nthe primary and $3,000 in the general. When you hit the next level, \nwhich Senator DeWine will talk about, the contribution limits for the \nnon-wealthy person are raised six times in the primary, $6,000 in the \nprimary, $6,000 in the general.\n  Then something new was brought into the discussion yesterday evening, \nprincipally based upon Senator Feinstein's discussion, after having \nfaced what one might call a superspender. We have a superspender \ndefined, and Senator DeWine will define what that is when he speaks.\n  We eliminate the party coordinated expenditure limits, all hard \ndollars--until the poor candidate raises up to an amount equal to the \nself-financing of the superspender. I assume during that period of time \nthey can continue to raise the $6,000 from individuals.\n  The way it is done, it requires a bit of bookkeeping, but everybody \nkeeps a lot of books now. Everybody has records galore. Obviously, \nthere are floating triggers that will come about based upon when the \nwealthy candidate, or superspender, starts putting their money into the \ncampaign.\n  There is one other provision that has been in both vehicles for \nSenators who spend their own money and get elected, a requirement that \nthey cannot change their mind about how to finance that campaign and \nstart raising money to pay back their debt after they are elected. We \npassed that around yesterday, and everyone seems to understand it. If \nyou incur debt from a personal loan and then you get elected as \nSenator, and then you go around and say, now I am the Senator, I want \nyou to get me money so I can pay back what I used of my own money to \nrun for election. It is clear in this amendment that you cannot do that \nin the future.\n  All that is future, prospective.\n  Senator DeWine will now explain the triggering mechanisms and how \nthis will apply to each State. We will have a chart so every Senator \ncan see how it applies. I thank Senator DeWine, who has been a real \nhelp. To the other Senators on the floor, particularly Senator McCain, \nthank you for your help. Senator McCain clearly said if we did not win \nthe other one, we would put this together and it would be bipartisan, \nand he joined.\n  There are a few things in this amendment we both know have to be \nironed out in the future, but I think it is an excellent amendment.\n  For the first time in history, we think we are legally addressing the \nissue of a person who asserts their constitutional rights--which the \nCourt said is constitutional--to spend their own money, but they do it \nin inordinate amounts as compared to what a candidate on the other side \ncould be expected to raise under current restrictive laws, which are 26 \nyears old and ought to be fixed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this chart we will discuss in a moment was \nprepared last night by my law clerk, Susan Bruno. She has been working \non that, and we thank her for it.\n  I congratulate and thank my colleague from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, and my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, for their \nwork on this amendment. The amendment we have now is the result of \nweeks of discussions and negotiations among Senator Domenici, Senator \nDurbin, and myself. That culminated last night in further discussions \ninvolving more Senators, both Republican and Democrat.\n  I thank the members of our staff who worked long into the night after \nwe had set the basic parameters ourselves for what this discussion \nwould be.\n  The amendment we have in front of us is bipartisan, and it is the \nwork product of a great number of people. But let me particularly thank \nSenator Domenici for taking the lead and for being one who had this \nidea, frankly, over a decade ago, and who has been talking about this \nidea year after year. We are now to the point where we have the ability \nto see this amendment enacted into law.\n  Let me, again, thank Senator Domenici, Senator Durbin, Senator \nCollins, Senator McCain, Senator Feingold, and others for their input, \ntheir suggestions, and their work during these negotiations.\n  I believe the amendment, with their help, is a consensus approach \nthat will help make our election process more fair and more equitable.\n  It is unfortunate that we need such an amendment at all. But the sad \nreality is in campaigns today we are moving down a road where personal \nwealth is becoming the chief qualification for candidates seeking \noffice. The reality is in the last several election cycles, both \nparties have looked around the country to try to find wealthy \ncandidates who can self-finance their own campaigns. This is no \nreflection on those candidates. But it is the reality of life today.\n  This amendment attempts to bring about equity and fairness and also, \nquite candidly, to increase the opportunity for all candidates to get \ntheir ideas to the public.\n  This amendment is truly about the first amendment--it is about free \nspeech--and it is about allowing candidates to have the opportunity to \ntake their ideas into the marketplace, to broadcast them, to be able to \npay for the commercials, and to have their exchange of ideas in that \npolitical marketplace that our Founding Fathers deemed so very \nimportant.\n  The reality is, though, personal wealth has changed the whole dynamic \nof today's Federal elections. It has changed it in a way that no one in \n1976, when the Supreme Court handed down it's decision, could have \nenvisioned. No one could have envisioned the amount of money individual \ncandidates now pour into their own campaigns.\n  The fact is, as I said on the Senate floor last night, there \ncurrently exists a loophole, but a constitutionally protected loophole, \nfor candidates to use their own personal money to finance their own \ncampaigns. This loophole, of course, resulted from the 1976 Supreme \nCourt case, Buckley v. Valeo. In that case, the Supreme Court reviewed \nthe constitutionality of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974. In \nthe Buckley case, the United States Supreme Court struck down \nlimitations on the following: One, campaign expenditures; two, \nindependent expenditures by individuals and groups; and, three, \nexpenditures by candidates from their personal funds.\n  The Buckley decision has effectively created a substantial \ndisadvantage for opposing candidates who must raise all campaign funds \nunder the current fundraising limitations. Current fund limitations, of \ncourse, are $1,000 per donor. So you have the situation where the \ncandidate who cannot self-finance has to raise money in a maximum of \n$1,000 increments but has to then go up against another candidate who \ncan put in maybe an unlimited amount of money--millions and millions of \ndollars.\n\n[[Page S2538]]\n\n  The fact is, because of the Constitution, because of the Supreme \nCourt's decision, and because of the statutes we have written, we now \nhave what, for the general public, would appear at least to be a rather \nludicrous situation. That situation is that everyone in the country is \nlimited to $1,000 they can put into a candidate's campaign--everybody \nin the country except one person. That one person who has the ability \nto put money in, in an unlimited fashion, in an unlimited amount, is, \nof course, the candidate.\n\n  That, I think, to most people would seem to be an absurd situation. \nBut this is a constitutional issue. This is, if it is a loophole, \ncertainly a constitutionally protected loophole--unlimited personal \nexpenditures from rich candidates but limited personal contributions \nfor everyone else. That is the reality today.\n  This reality has resulted in enhanced personal wealth in campaigns to \nsuch an extent that I think no one even 10 years ago could have \nimagined its importance.\n  The whole dynamic of political campaigning has fundamentally changed \nin this country because of this Court decision and because of the \nability in the last few years of candidates to self-finance their own \ncampaigns.\n  It has made it more difficult for nonwealthy opponents to compete and \nto get their messages and their ideas across to the public.\n  Our amendment tries in a constitutionally acceptable way to correct \nthis. It would create greater fairness and accountability in the \nFederal election process by addressing the inequity that arises when a \nwealthy candidate pays for his or her campaign with personal funds--\npersonal funds that are defined, by the way, to include cash \ncontributions and any contributions arising from personal or family \nassets such as personal loans or property used for collateral for a \nloan to the campaign.\n  The agreement we reached this morning and that was hammered out last \nnight--the amendment we will be offering in just a moment--has very \nimportant implications for our democracy, as I will explain.\n  The basic intent of our amendment is to preserve and to enhance the \nmarketplace of ideas--the very foundation of our democracy--but giving \ncandidates who are not independently wealthy an opportunity to get \ntheir message across to the voters as well.\n  Specifically, our amendment would raise the contribution limits for \ncandidates facing wealthy opponents to fund their own campaigns.\n  The contribution limit increases are based, as my colleague from New \nMexico has said, on a sliding scale depending on the size of each State \nand the amount of the wealthy candidate's personal expenditures.\n  The amendment creates a simple three-tiered threshold test to \ndetermine the contribution limit increases. This threshold test is \nbased on the individual voting age populations of each state, in \nrecognition that the cost of elections vary greatly between the states. \nThe actual calculation of the thresholds uses a baseline formula and \nmultiples of that baseline. Our population-based calculation allows the \nindividual contribution limit increases to kick in sooner in states \nwith smaller populations, where candidates get more bang for the buck. \nA half million dollars in a campaign in Wyoming, after all, goes a heck \nof a lot farther and can buy a lot more television air time and direct \nmail pieces than it can in Ohio or in California. Simple put, this \nformula recognizes that a one-size fits all approach won't work for all \nstates.\n  The baseline is based on the following formula: $.04 the voting age \npopulation + $150,000. The first threshold starts at double the \nbaseline.\n  When a wealthy candidate crosses the first threshold, the opposing \ncandidate's hard money cap for individual contributions, which \ncurrently is $1,000, goes up three times to $3,000. The second \nthreshold is a double the first threshold--and the hard money cap \nincreases to $6,000.\n  So when you get to that second threshold, when the wealthy candidate \nputs in that second amount of money or hits that level, the second one \nkicks in, which means then the nonwealthy candidate who was not being \nself-financed can raise six times what the current law is. The current \nlaw, of course, is $1,000. That would take it up to $6,000 you can \nraise from an individual donor.\n  Finally, the third threshold begins at ten times the baseline; once a \nwealthy candidate exceeds the third threshold, it removes the caps for \nState party coordinated expenditures of hard money.\n  Our amendment also, as my colleague from New Mexico has indicated, \nincludes a proportionality provision, a provision that means for all \ncap increases, a less wealthy candidate can use increased caps to raise \nonly--only--up to 110 percent of the amount contributed by the wealthy \ncandidate. This applies to all three of these thresholds.\n  Proportionality is important because it really helps level the \nplaying field from both directions so the wealthy candidate is not \npunished or is not inhibited from putting his or her own money into the \ncampaign, which is very important. What this means, in plain language, \nis that we try to increase free speech; we give that nonwealthy \ncandidate the opportunity to get his or her message out. We do not \npunish the wealthy candidate. And we take care of that in this well-\ncrafted amendment by saying we will limit how much that nonwealthy \ncandidate can raise above the caps, above the limits, and we limit it \nto, logically, how much money has been put in by the wealthy candidate.\n  So the wealthy candidate, again, is not punished, is not inhibited, \nis not discouraged from putting in his or her own money. I think this \nmakes a great deal of sense. This was a provision that was worked out, \nagain, last night.\n  Finally, our amendment includes a notice provision. This requires \ncandidates to notify the Federal Election Commission within 24 hours of \ncrossing a threshold. Candidates also must notify the FEC within 24 \nhours of any additional contributions totaling $10,000, once they are \nover a threshold.\n  That is our amendment in a nutshell. The fact is, the Supreme Court \nhas ruled that personal expenditures cannot be limited. Let me say this \nvery clearly: Our amendment is not trying to change nor challenge that. \nWe accept that. It is the interpretation of the Supreme Court, in \ninterpreting the first amendment to the Constitution, which we must and \ndo respect.\n  This amendment is not an attempt to undo what the Court decided. It \nis not an attempt to limit personal expenditures, nor in any way to \ninhibit those expenditures, nor in fact to punish people for making \nthose expenditures. Rather, it is an attempt to correct for the \nunintended effects of the Court's decision.\n  Again, no one--no one--when the Buckley case came out in the mid-\n1970s, could have envisioned what we have seen today. This amendment is \nbased upon our additional experience--25 years of experience--in seeing \nhow this has played out. It is an attempt to correct the inequities in \nthe system and establish fairness in the process.\n  I believe the courts are likely to uphold this provision because it \naddresses the public perception that there is something inherently \ncorrupt about a wealthy candidate who can use a substantial amount of \nhis or her own personal resources to win an election--not that there is \nanything corrupt about that particular candidate. It is the perception. \nIt is the perception that the public looks at this and, frankly, says \nsomething is just wrong with this.\n\n  The Supreme Court has said Congress has a compelling interest in \naddressing this perception. This amendment is narrowly tailored, and \nclosely related to such concerns about that perceived corruption. The \nreality is the courts carved out a constitutional protection for \nwealthy candidates. Our provision offsets that without infringing on \nthe rights of the wealthy candidates. Our provision expands the rights \nof the opposing candidate. Our amendment expands free speech. In fact, \nthis sort of approach to campaign financing actually bolsters first \namendment rights of candidates who do not have extensive personal \nresources.\n  Finally, the proportionality provision is key to ensuring that a \nwealthy candidate is not punished by the less wealthy candidate's \nability to raise funds with lower hard money caps.\n  Candidly, our amendment does not completely level the playing field. \nI think in most cases that would simply be impossible. We cannot do \nthat. However, it is a step towards increasing\n\n[[Page S2539]]\n\nfairness and accountability in our election process. And it is a step, \nagain, to expanding the individual's rights, those who do not have that \nindependent wealth, giving them the opportunity to take their ideas out \ninto the marketplace and to share them with the public, and giving them \nthe resources to share them.\n  It is a reasonable approach. It is a reasonable thing to do, \nespecially now that we are reforming our Nation's campaign finance \nlaws.\n  This is a great opportunity for us. We are today, with this \namendment, fine-tuning the process, correcting something the Court \ncould not have foreseen 25 years ago in Buckley; and that is that the \nunlimited personal expenditures can hurt an opposing candidate's \nability to compete fairly. When that happens, when huge funding \ndisparities exist between a wealthy candidate's unlimited personal \nexpenditures to their own campaigns and a less wealthy candidate's \nlimited individual contributions from others, it is the voters and our \ndemocracy that suffers the most.\n  In conclusion, wealthy candidates have an easier time communicating \ntoday with voters. That is just the reality of our current process. \nThey have the money it takes readily at their disposal to get their \nmessages out. When running up against such self-financed machines, less \nwealthy opponents have less chance to challenge those messages, less \nchance to get their own ideas on the table, less chance to communicate \nwith the voters, and to give them an alternative point of view.\n  As a result, it is the voters who have less chance to make informed \nchoices in elections. And that is just not good for our democracy. In \nessence, this struggle between rich and not so rich candidates really \nis a struggle for the soul of democracy. I say that because the free \nflow of ideas and information is the basis--the very foundation--of our \npolitical system. The exchange of ideas is a prerequisite for \ndemocratic governance. And it is ``ideas,'' as John Maynard Keynes once \nsaid, that ``shape the course of history.''\n  The more robust the marketplace of ideas, the better the political \nprocess. For our democracy to fully function and thrive, we need many \nideas--ideas competing with each other. That is the basis for the \ncritical thinking process, the basis for debate and challenges to \nsocietal norms. That is the basis for how we make changes in our \nsociety, for how we make the world a better place. When there are fewer \nideas being disseminated, there is a greater likelihood of political \nand societal stagnation. And when there is such stagnation, there is no \nsocial change, and the world is worse off for it.\n  Thomas Mann once said:\n\n       It is impossible for ideas to compete in the marketplace if \n     no forum for their presentation is provided or available.\n\n  That, unfortunately, seems to be the case for many less wealthy \ncandidates who face the power of the self-financed candidates. Our \namendment is a move away from that kind of inequity. It is a step \ntoward providing candidates the forum for the presentation of their \nideas. By taking that step, the free flow of ideas, the spirit, the \nessence, the foundation of our democracy is preserved and emboldened.\n  We have charts on the floor which we can share with all Members of \nthe Senate. We have a breakdown that shows State by State exactly where \nthose thresholds are and at what point they would kick in.\n  We would be more than happy to share those with any Members of the \nSenate who would like to take a look.\n  Again, it makes eminent sense to have a distinction between when the \nthresholds kick in between the State of Wyoming and the State of Ohio. \nIt just makes eminent sense.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from New Mexico, my colleague from \nIllinois, and my other colleagues who have worked long and hard on this \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join in the statement made by the \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, and my colleague, Senator DeWine \nfrom Ohio, in cosponsoring this amendment. A lot of people listening to \nthis debate can't understand the world we live in here, a world where \nwhenever you decide to be a candidate for the Senate, you face the \ndaunting task of convincing your family that it is a good idea and \nputting together a good campaign team. Then the reality hits you. Your \nmessage, whatever it is, to be delivered to voters across America, is \ngoing to be a very expensive undertaking.\n  I represent the State of Illinois with some 12 million people. How do \nI get their attention to tell them what I feel, what I would like to do \nin the Senate? The obvious methods are the use of radio, TV, direct \nmail, and telephone. All of those are very expensive. All of those are \nincreasingly expensive every 2 years. The cost of television \nadvertising, for example, goes up 20 percent every 2 years. So if you \nare running for reelection after 6 years, you have to raise some 60 \npercent more in funds to buy the same amount of television in my State \nand other States just to deliver your message in a campaign.\n  When Members of the Senate come to the floor and start talking about \nraising $1,000 here or $3,000 here or $6,000, I imagine most families \nacross America say: What kind of world do they live in that they would \nbe asking an individual to give them $6,000 of their money for a \npolitical campaign? Very few people do that in America.\n  Thankfully, for a lot of us, we have those who support us and will do \nit. For the vast majority of families, they must be scratching their \nhead at this debate and saying: Why don't they live in the real world \nwhere real people don't go around asking friends or even strangers for \n$6,000?\n  If you are going to mount a campaign in the State of Illinois to \nappeal to 12 million people and some 8 or 9 million voters, you have to \nraise over $10 million to get your message out.\n  Let me offer another insight. It costs you 50 cents to raise a \ndollar, so about half of the money you raise goes into the overhead of \na campaign, the administrative costs of staff people, mailing out \ninvitations, following up, making sure people are there. It is an \nextraordinarily expensive business.\n  It often puzzles me that people who are not otherwise capable of \nmanaging million-dollar companies manage multimillion-dollar campaigns \nthat come and go in a matter of 12 months. That happens in this \nbusiness of politics. That is the world in which we live.\n  There are ways to change it. We could change it pretty dramatically. \nWe could say television time is free for candidates. That would really \nchange it in a hurry because two-thirds of the money that most \ncandidates spend is on television. If the television didn't cost you \nanything, if you had access to it where you could go on and, instead of \ndoing a 30-second drive-by spot, you ended up having 5 minutes to \nexplain your position on tax cuts or Social Security, the voters would \nhave a chance to see you.\n  Of course, there is resistance to that idea from the people who own \nthe television stations. They make a bundle of money off political \ncandidates. They can't wait for these campaigns to get started because \nwe literally shovel money at them in the closing weeks of campaigns. \nThe managers of these stations have a perpetual smile for weeks on end \nwhen they see all the candidates lining up to pay for the advertising \non their television stations. So the idea of free television is not one \nthat has gone very far--nor free radio. The idea of free postage is not \nlikely going to occur either.\n\n  We live in a commercial world where we are trying to basically \ndeliver our message to the voters in a fashion that is extremely \nexpensive. Now we have the Supreme Court, which 25 years ago jumped \ninto this debate and said, if you are independently wealthy, if you are \na multimillionaire, we can't limit how much money you want to spend out \nof your own pocket.\n  An individual candidate who is not independently wealthy is limited \non how they can raise money. Under current law, I can only raise a \n$1,000 maximum contribution from each person from my primary election \ncampaign and my general election campaign and $5,000 for each campaign \nfrom political action committees. It sounds like a lot of money, until \nyou start adding up the $1,000 contributions it takes to reach $1 \nmillion. If you have a $10 or $12 million campaign in Illinois, imagine \nhow many people you have to appeal to, to raise $10 or $12 million.\n\n[[Page S2540]]\n\n  The Supreme Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, said if you happen to have a \nlot of money, then you can put all you want into it; you are not \nlimited as to the amount of money you can invest in a political \ncampaign.\n  We have come down to two categories of candidates in America, the M \ncategories: the multimillionaires, and the mere mortals. The mere \nmortals, frankly, stand in awe of those who can write a check and fund \ntheir campaign. What we are trying to address with this amendment is to \nlevel the playing field so that if someone shows up in the course of \nthe campaign who is independently wealthy and is willing to spend $10, \n$20, $30, $40, $50, $60 million of their own money--I am not making \nthese figures up, as they say; that has happened--then at least the \nother candidate has a fighting chance. That is what this amendment is \nall about. I have joined with Senator Domenici and Senator DeWine to \ntry to create this fighting chance.\n  How do we do it? Currently, you can only accept $1,000 per person per \nelection. We have said: If you run into the so-called self-financing \ncandidate who is going to spend millions of dollars, then you can \naccept a larger contribution from an individual. The calculation and \nformula we use is based on the number of people living in the State. \nSenator DeWine explained it earlier. For example, in my home State of \nIllinois, the U.S. Census projected the voting-age population for the \nyear 2000 was 8,983,000 people. We have a baseline threshold plus \n$150,000 which says that you can put $509,000 into your campaign of \nyour own money. That is your right to do, under the law and under this \namendment.\n  If you decide to put in over $1 million, if you put in $1 million, \nthen the candidate who doesn't have $1 million to put in, whether they \nare a challenger or an incumbent, can raise up to $3,000 from those who \nwill contribute, as opposed to a limit of $1,000. Furthermore, in \nIllinois, for example, if you put in $2 million of your own money, then \nwe allow the individual contribution to go up to $6,000.\n  I am sure most people listening to this can't imagine someone writing \na check for $6,000 to a political candidate. The folks who will do that \nare few and far between. The honest answer to that is, unless you \ncontrol the overall cost of political campaigns, you have to face the \nreality: People will show up with a lot of money in the bank, spend it \non the campaign, and literally blow away any type of political \nopponent.\n  Who loses in that process? The voters lose. If the system works as it \nis supposed to, you have a choice on election day. In order to have a \nchoice, you have information about all candidates. That means you have \nan information source not only from a wealthy candidate but from \nsomeone who is not so wealthy. This amendment, with its own formula \napproach, allows people to raise money so that they can keep up with \nself-financing candidates.\n  If in my home State of Illinois someone decides to put in $5 million \nor more, then we allow the Democratic or Republican Party in my State, \nthrough their coordinated expenditures, to really reach that same \nlevel, up to 110 percent of the amount that is being given by that \ncandidate to his or her own campaign.\n  This is an imperfect amendment. It is an effort by us to address a \nserious problem. It has in it an element that is important. It is an \nelement of fairness, an element of opportunity. It basically says that \nin America we won't let you buy an election. If you are going to come \nin and try to do that, then you are going to at least give the other \ncandidate a chance to compete.\n  There is one element in this amendment which I have discussed with \nthe sponsors that I hope we can address either with a second-degree \namendment, or a later amendment during the course of our debate, and \nthat is the money on hand. If an incumbent Senator has millions of \ndollars on hand and somebody walks in and decides to put in a million \ndollars to oppose them, I think you should take into account how much \nmoney the incumbent Senator has on hand. This amendment does not do \nthat. I would like to suggest a modification to it at some point.\n  But I believe our colleagues in the Senate will have a good \nopportunity later this morning to cast their votes on this amendment \nand to basically say that from the Senate's side, we are going to try \nto level this playing field and try to give a voice to all candidates. \nWe are not going to say this is a system that is open to the highest \nbidder. It is going to at least allow men and women to compete with \nsome element of fairness.\n  I thank my colleague from New Mexico, as well as my colleague from \nOhio. Both of them, and our staffs, worked late into the night last \nnight to prepare this amendment that will be forthcoming shortly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Domenici, Senator DeWine, \nand others. Last night, I believe we could have avoided the vote we \nhad. I hope in the future and during this debate we will make sure we \ntry to handle it in a more sensitive fashion. I will take the \nresponsibility for that.\n  We probably should have tried to--because we knew there were several \nareas that needed to be worked out, which have been worked out, and we \nare just awaiting the legislative counsel's language so we can move \nforward with the amendment--we probably should have waited until this \nmorning on the amendment. But that is done. The fact is, as we \ncommitted last night, we would reach agreement and work out the \ndifferences. There were several specific areas that had not been worked \nout last night, especially proportionality, among others. I am pleased \nwe worked it out and we are now ready to move forward as soon as the \nlanguage comes over, and we can vote on this amendment and move on to \nother amendments.\n  I do believe the principles of McCain-Feingold have been preserved \nbecause this deals in hard money. Yes, it lifts some restraints on hard \nmoney, but there is no soft money that would be permitted under the \nDomenici-DeWine-Durbin amendment. So it also addresses, in all candor, \na concern that literally every nonmillionaire Member of this body has, \nand that is that they wake up some morning and pick up the paper and \nfind out that some multimillionaire is going to run for their seat, and \nthat person intends to invest 3, 5, 8, 10, now up to $70 million of \ntheir own money in order to win.\n  So when I see the significant support for this amendment, I think \nthose reflect a genuine concern, as we know both parties have now \nopenly stated that they recruit people who have sizable fortunes of \ntheir own in order to run for the Senate.\n  I don't think this is a new phenomenon, Mr. President. I think it has \nbeen going on for years and years. But as money seems to play a greater \nand greater role in politics, and as television advertising continues \nto be more and more important, then, obviously, the ability of someone \nto achieve office with what is apparently an unfair advantage over a \ncandidate of lesser wealth is being addressed, at least in part, by \nthis amendment.\n\n  Also, I add to the sponsors of the amendment--and I already discussed \nthis with Senator Domenici and Senator DeWine --this isn't a perfect \nanswer. We all realize that. We know there are some areas that have \ngone unaddressed, and if there needs to be further addressing, that is \nwhy we have another nearly 10 days of debate and amendments. So I am \nglad we were able to work out the differences that existed last night. \nObviously, those negotiations needed to take place, and I hope we can \nmove forward on this amendment as soon as the legislative language \ncomes over from the legislative counsel, so we can move on to another \namendment at the earliest moment.\n  Again, I thank Senator Domenici and Senator DeWine and Senator Durbin \nand others for their efforts on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what are the rules guiding debate at this \npoint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 hours evenly divided. The \namendment has not yet been offered.\n  Mr. BYRD. What a mess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement----\n\n[[Page S2541]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Without the amendment being offered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was stipulated by consent.\n  Mr. BYRD. All right. Mr. President, when Cineas the Philosopher \nvisited Rome in the year 280 B.C. as the envoy of Pyrrhus, the Greek \ngeneral, and had witnessed the deliberations of the Roman Senate and \nhad listened to Senators in debate, he reported that, ``Here, indeed, \nwas no gathering of venal politicians, no haphazard council of mediocre \nminds.'' This was in 280 B.C.\n  In 107 B.C., Jugurtha, that Numidian prince, was in Rome. When he was \nordered by the Roman Senate to leave Italy and set out for home, after \nhe had passed through the gates of Rome, it is said that he looked back \nseveral times in silence and finally exclaimed, ``Yonder is a city that \nis up for sale, and its days are numbered if it ever finds a buyer.''\n  What a change; what a change had come over that Senate in less than \n200 years! I think we might also, with great sadness, reflect upon the \nreport by Cineas when he referred to the Roman Senate after he had \nwitnessed it--as I say, not as a ``gathering of venal politicians, not \na haphazard council of mediocre minds,'' but in reality ``an assemblage \nof kings.'' What a Senate that was that he reported to Pyrrhus as \nbeing, in dignity and in statesmanship, as a ``council of kings!'' It \nis in even greater sadness that we noted Jugurtha's words: ``Yonder is \na city up for sale, and its days are numbered if it ever finds a \nbuyer.'' But that is what is happening in this land of ours and in this \nbody of ours.\n\n  When I came to the Senate, Jennings Randolph and I ran for two seats, \nand we won. He ran for the short term, the 2-year seat that had been \ncreated by the death of the late M.M. Neely, and I ran for the full \nterm.\n  At that time, I ran against Senator Chapman Revercomb, a fine member \nof the Republican Party, but Randolph and I ran on a combined war chest \nof $50,000: two Senators on a combined war chest of $50,000. We did not \nhave television in those days, we did not have high-priced consultants, \nand our hands were not manacled by the shackles of money.\n  Today what do we find? What does the average Senate seat cost--$6 \nmillion or $8 million? Both parties are enslaved to those who give. The \nspecial interests of the country are the people who are represented--\nthe special interests, for the most part.\n  The great body of people out there are not organized, and they are \nnot represented here. We are beholden to the special interests who give \nus--when we go around the country holding out a tip cup saying, ``Give \nme, give me, give me,'' they are the people who respond and they are \nthe people for whom the doors are opened. They are the people for whom \nthe telephone lines are opened when the calls come in.\n  I offered an amendment on this floor one day, and I thought: I will \nat least get a half dozen votes. I got one--one vote. Those in this \nbody on both sides who were slaves to the particular interest group on \nthat occasion ran like turkeys to the fire escapes. I thought I would \nget half a dozen votes at least. I knew the amendment would not be \nadopted, but after hearing all the brave talk of some of the Senators \non both sides, I thought: At least I will get his vote, I will get his \nvote, and I will get her vote. I got one vote, my own.\n  That is what it has come to in this body. We are at the beck and \ncall, we know the feel of the whiplash when the votes come, and we are \nowned by the special interest groups.\n  That does not mean that every Senator does not have a free will. \nSenators exercise that free will about which Milton spoke in ``Paradise \nLost''--freedom of the will. That does not mean that the conscience of \nevery Senator here is bought, that his vote is bought. It does not mean \nthat at all, but it means that in our day and time, it cannot be said \nof this Senate that it is not a gathering of venal politicians. In \nJugurtha's words: ``Yonder is a city up for sale, and its days are \nnumbered if it ever finds a buyer.''\n  Mr. President, as one who has been in this body now going on 43 \nyears, I mourn the days of old when I came here. We still have good \nSenators. They are bright, they are dedicated, but the yoke, the Roman \nyoke that they have to go under to come here, is appalling--appalling. \nIt is sad. I compliment those on both sides who are seeking to do \nsomething about it, who are trying hard to deal with reality here and \nin such a way that the people might still look upon this body with some \nconfidence and respect. Yet, I do not think that they will be overly \nsuccessful in the effort.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, referring back to the \ndays when he was the leader, does he recall how many times he offered, \non behalf of the Democrats, a motion to invoke cloture on campaign \nfinance reform?\n  Mr. BYRD. I offered a motion to invoke cloture eight times during the \n100th Congress.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator recall the motion to invoke cloture being \noffered so many times to any other measure?\n  Mr. BYRD. Up to this point, there has been none.\n  Mr. REID. So if I understand what the Senator has said, when he was \nmajority leader in the 100th Congress, an attempt to invoke cloture was \ntried eight times unsuccessfully, and that holds the record for any \nlegislative issue of which the Senator is aware.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right.\n  I thank the Senator, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Texas is \nhere, and I yield her as much time as she needs off our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  I know my colleague from New Mexico and my colleague from Ohio have \nbeen working very hard on this amendment. I appreciate everything they \nare trying to do.\n  I have a separate amendment that has been incorporated into this \namendment. It has the same purpose, and I hope when everything is \nworked out, our purpose will succeed. Our purpose is to level the \nplaying field so that one candidate who has millions, if not billions, \nof dollars to spend on a campaign will not be at such a significant \nadvantage over another candidate who does not have such means as to \ncreate an unlevel playing field.\n  In fact, I think it was Senator Durbin who used these numbers: In the \n2000 elections, candidates took out personal loans for their campaigns \nof $194 million for Federal races. In 1998, it was $107 million. In \n1996, it was $106 million. That is a lot of strength. We pride \nourselves in our country on trying to have a level playing field to \nkeep our democracy balanced.\n  Under our Constitution, it is very clear that we cannot keep people \nfrom spending their own money however they wish to spend it. I will not \nargue that point ever. That is their constitutional right. They have a \nconstitutional right to try to buy the office, but they do not have a \nconstitutional right to resell it. That is what my part of this \namendment attempts to prevent, so a candidate can spend his or her own \nmoney but there would be a limit on the amount that candidate could go \nout and raise to pay himself or herself back.\n\n  My amendment and the amendment of Senator DeWine and Senator Domenici \nis $250,000. If a big State should have more, certainly I would look at \nwhat is reasonable. I want a level playing field. I want people to be \nable to spend their own money, but they need to know they are doing it \nbecause that is what they want to do, not because when they win they \nwill be able to go out and repay themselves, so it is not a risk they \nhave to take.\n  I have put my own money in campaigns in the past and I have taken the \nhit for it. A lot of people in this body have. It is a risk. It is a \nrisk I was willing to take. It happened to be a risk I lost. Other \npeople have been able to do that. Some have lost, some have won. I \nnever repaid myself the full amount that I loaned. I think we need to \nhave the level playing field.\n  We have a constitutional right to spend our money. No one argues \nthat. I do believe a retired police officer or retired teacher should \nbe able to run for public office on a level playing field and get the \nvariety of support from his\n\n[[Page S2542]]\n\nor her constituents and have as level a playing field as we can have \nprotecting the rights of the wealthy candidate to spend that money, but \nlimiting what could be paid back.\n  I thank Senator Domenici and Senator DeWine who have worked so hard \non their amendment. Their amendment includes other ways of leveling the \nplaying field by letting the other candidates have no limits or bigger \nlimits. I think that is fine, too. The point is, everyone would like to \nsee the most level playing field we can find, the most numbers of \ncontributors who care about this candidate being able to get behind \nsomeone and have a fair chance of getting the message out. That is what \nmy part of this amendment does.\n  I thank all colleagues for coming together on an amendment, an \namendment I hope will work. If for some reason this amendment goes \ndown, I hope my amendment, which I introduced as a bill 2 years ago, I \nhope it prevails and we will be able to work something out as we go \nthrough the 2 weeks of debating this bill that will be fair and that \nwill give everyone a chance to have the support of the biggest number \nof people and contributors in a person's home State, to have the \nability to get a message out that the people can decide if they like or \ndon't like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one of the advantages of having been \naround here a while is I remember when this idea first surfaced by the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico in the late 1980s. He correctly \nidentified this at that time as one of the significant problems \ndeveloping. Now, some 13 or 14 years later, we are finally getting an \nopportunity to address one of the significant issues, one of the \nsignificant problems in our current campaign system.\n  One, obviously, is the hard money contribution money limit being set \nat $1,000, back when a Mustang cost $2,700 which only exacerbated the \nproblem Senator Domenici is talking about because it is harder for a \nnonwealthy candidate to compete, given the eroding contribution limit.\n  The other, obviously, is the cost of reaching the voters, the \ntelevision time. That, I am sure, will be discussed in the course of \nthis 2-week debate.\n  I thank Senator Domenici for his important work on this over a \nlengthy period of time and congratulate Senator DeWine for his \ncontribution and the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, for her \ncontribution as well.\n  This is an important amendment. It will advance this debate in the \nproper direction, and given the support of Senator Durbin and others on \nthe other side of the aisle, we look forward to its passage later in \nthe day.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I clarify that our amendment takes \nplace in the future. It does not jeopardize someone who based his or \nher actions on the law as it is today, but for the future, when \neveryone is on notice this law would then take effect if the amendment \npasses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Parliamentary inquiry: Under the unanimous consent \nagreement, a vote must occur on an amendment, if not this amendment, at \n12:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent agreement, there \nare up to 3 hours of debate after which a vote on an amendment in \nrelation to the amendment shall occur.\n  Mr. DODD. Further inquiry: I presume the time will begin to toll once \nthe amendment is introduced, and the fact there is no amendment pending \nper se, other than the one we are discussing, the time is not really \ntolling; is that correct or am I incorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By consent, the time has been charged.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The time began to run on the amendment when the \ndiscussion began at what time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Nine-fifty.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If I could explain.\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senators involved in this with their staff worked \nvery late last night. The amendment is very complicated and it is being \ndrafted, and it has just been received. We cannot help that. It is now \nbeing looked at and it is practically ready. It is a very lengthy \namendment. They think they have found some unintended words and they \nare trying to fix that.\n  We have been explaining the amendment. Senator DeWine explained the \nstate-by-state formula very much in detail. I explained the intent and \nthe basic ideas, and as soon as we get it, we will introduce it and \nthen there will be additional time until we vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  That raises a concern. I have been around long enough to sense when \nsomething will happen. I get a sense this amendment will be adopted and \nmaybe by some significant numbers based on the sponsorships and the \nstatements made.\n  I will oppose the amendment. I may be the only person opposing it, \nbut I am deeply worried about it. The mere fact that we will vote in an \nhour on a highly complicated, very lengthy amendment that goes to a \nsignificant issue in this debate, and I cannot look at it, is an \nindication of the kind of trouble we may be getting ourselves into.\n  I appreciate the constraints of the managers and the leadership to \nmove this debate along. However, I am troubled. Let me state why. I \nhave great respect for the authors. We are trying to accomplish \nsomething. I have been, myself, a candidate with an opponent who \nannounced they would spend significant millions of their own money \nagainst me, so I am not unfamiliar with facing a challenger who has \ngreat personal wealth. However, it seems to me this is what I would \ncall incumbency protection. We are all incumbents in the Senate. We \nraise money all the time during our incumbency. I suspect most sitting \nMembers who have some intention of running again have amassed something \nbetween $\\1/2\\ million and $1 million. If you have been here for a \ncouple of years, I suspect you have done that. If you have been here \nlonger, I know colleagues have amounts in excess of $3, $5, and $7 \nmillion sitting in accounts, earning interest, waiting for the next \ntime they run.\n  I don't like the idea of a multimillionaire going out and writing \nchecks and running, I suppose. I understand the law. The Constitution \nsays if an individual in this country wants to spend his or her money \nthat way, there is nothing we can do here to stop them. What you are \ntrying to do is level the playing field.\n  It isn't exactly level, in a sense, when we are talking about \nincumbents who have treasuries of significant amounts and the power of \nthe office which allows us to be in the press every day, if we want. We \ncan send franked mail to our constituents at no cost to us. It is a \ncost of the taxpayer. We do radio and television shows. We can go back \nto our States with subsidized airfares. We campaign all across our \njurisdictions.\n  The idea that somehow we are sort of impoverished candidates when \nfacing a challenger who may decide they are going to take out a loan, \nand not necessarily even have the money in the account but may decide \nto mortgage their house--I don't recommend that as a candidate. But \nthere are people who do it. They go out and mortgage their homes. I \npresume if you mortgage your house, that is money in your account. It \nis not distinguished in this amendment. You go into debt.\n  For people who decide they want to do that and meet that trigger, all \nof a sudden that allows me as an incumbent to raise, I guess, $3 \nmillion at one level, $3,000 at one level, and $6,000 at another. The \ngates are open, and the race is on.\n  I am just worried that we are going in the absolute opposite \ndirection of what the McCain-Feingold bill is designed to do.\n  Again, I find it somewhat ironic that we are here deeply worried \nabout the capital that can be raised and the candidate who is going to \nspend a million dollars of his own money to level the playing field. \nBut those who oppose this bill don't have any difficulty with that same \nindividual writing out a million-dollar check in soft money, in a \nsense. It is somewhat of a contradiction to suggest somehow that we are \ngoing to protect ourselves against that million-dollar giver and we \ndon't have anything here to restrain this million-dollar giver in soft \nmoney. I find that somewhat ironic.\n  Again, I respect those who fundamentally disagree with McCain-\nFeingold. I don't agree with their arguments, but they have an argument \nto be made.\n\n[[Page S2543]]\n\n  It seems to me if we are going to go that route to do so, but the \nidea that all of a sudden we raise the threshold of hard money to \n$3,000 and $6,000 for an incumbent sitting with a treasury of \nsignificant money on hand, even though you may not be personally \nwealthy, but the fact is that you have this kind of money in your \naccounts--why not suggest, then, if you are an incumbent and, in the \ncase of Wyoming, you go to $500,000, whatever the trigger is, I say to \nthe Presiding Officer, or the Senator from Connecticut or California--\nif I have that amount of money in my treasury, why not let the \nchallenger, in a sense, reach the $3,000 and $6,000 level of individual \ncontributions in order to challenge me if I have it not in my own \npersonal account but in my political account?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First of all, there is no soft money in this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I understand that. My point was those who oppose the bill \nfeel as though individuals ought to be able to make whatever \ncontributions they want in soft money. I was making the observation as \na contradiction.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I also say to you, if you are worried about the \nperson who wants to put in their own money, and it will trigger raising \nthe personal caps, you understand that before we are finished with the \nMcCain amendment, it is going to be amended in terms of caps. Caps \naren't going to remain at $1,000. You understand the caps are going to \nbe raised.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I understand some are going to try to do that. I am not \ngoing to support it. But I understand there will be an effort to do \nthat.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It will happen because that $1,000 is 26 years old with \nno interest or inflation added, and it remains the most significant cap \non Senators and Representatives. And it is too low. You have to spend \nall your time raising money, which is the other side of the equation. \nIf it gets raised, also the person who had an idea of putting his own \nmoney in can look at it again and say, well, if I can raise $3,000, or \n$6,000, whatever it is changed to, and the PACs are changed to double, \nit might be that they will choose not to put their own money in because \nthey could actually have a shot at financing.\n  When you put in all of the negatives that exist today in terms of the \nbias of big money, I think this bill is a good effort to try to \nequalize that. Is it equal in every respect? No, it is not. Does it \ntake care of the fact that an incumbent may have already raised some \nmoney? No.\n  But let me tell you when you have a situation that says to somebody \nwho is, as was defined here, a super spender, who gets up into the \n10's, 20's, 30's, 40's, or 50's of the super spenders, to tell you the \ntruth, I don't have an awful lot of concern about them, in fact, not \nhaving a fair shake in this election. They are going to spend enough \nmoney to make sure they do. They know that. They assess it and their \nmoney. They say they are going to put in whatever is necessary to get a \nfair shake.\n  I am more worried about them putting in their money and the person \nrunning against them, say, in the northeastern United States, is not an \nincumbent; the person running is a challenger. There is no way, under \ncurrent law, that person could raise enough money to become known and \ndo what somebody who spends $40 million can. That is the kind of person \nI am worried about.\n  Mr. DODD. That very race that I think my colleague is talking about \nwas a fairly close race in the end. I can think of two specifically \nwhere, in fact, the individual raising that kind of money became a \nliability, and they lost.\n  I would like to reclaim my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to ask you about one other subject.\n  I think you should know what we are doing, respectfully, which is to \nsay that anybody who puts in their own money, however they got their \nown money, when they get elected, they cannot use their Senate seat to \nraise money to pay off what they put in an election. You raised one \nwhere somebody mortgages their house and puts in the money. If they \nmortgage their house, they still have to put in this threshold money, \nwhich is a lot of money to be from a home mortgage.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate that.\n  I come back to my point. I know there are super wealthy candidates. I \nguarantee that there are a lot more incumbents sitting with super \ntreasuries seeking reelection than there are individuals with vast \namounts of money seeking Senate seats. We have them, but it doesn't \nautomatically mean that they are guaranteed a seat. You see it in \nseveral jurisdictions.\n  My colleagues know what I am talking about and know the races \nspecifically that I am referring to where millions of dollars was spent \nby individuals who financed their own campaigns, and they lost. In \nfact, I think they lost in no small measure because people were \nsomewhat disgusted by the fact that they were giving the impression of \nbuying a Senate seat. The mere fact you write checks out of your own \npersonal account does not guarantee you a seat in the Senate.\n\n  We are clearly moving in the wrong direction. My issue is not that \nthere is too little money in politics. I think there is too much. I \nhear my colleagues say the $1,000 needs to be increased. My big worry \nis what happens to that $25 contributor, the $50 or $100 contributor \nwho we used to rely on and call upon to help support these candidates? \nWe don't pay attention to them anymore. We spend all of our time \nlooking for the large contributors.\n  By the way, a large contributor is $1,000 in my book or, a person who \ngives $2,000. Now we are going to raise it to $3,000 and $6,000 with \nthe mere suggestion that you might finance $500,000 or $1 million in a \nSenate election.\n  So the doors are open. Now the argument is made that we have done it \nhere and we ought to do it over there for the other side as well. All \nof a sudden, we have opened the gates, and we are up to $3,000, and \n$6,000, and forget about that $50 contributor, that small individual we \nare trying to engage in the political life of America. They are not \ngoing to get any attention whatsoever. My view is that is dangerous. I \nthink it is worthwhile that people are invested in the political life \nof America with their time and their financial resources. I have no \nobjection whatsoever to the idea that people write a check to support \ncandidates of their choice for State, local and national office.\n  What I find deeply troubling is that they no longer will be solicited \nbecause their contribution doesn't amount to anything because we are \ngoing to go after the big-dollar givers, the $3,000 giver and the \n$6,000 giver. What percentage of Americans can actually do that?\n  If we are financing elections across the board for the House and the \nSenate by only soliciting those kinds of contributions, or at least the \nbulk of those people, I think we are putting our democracy in peril.\n  I understand the concern my colleagues and incumbents have about \nfacing the wealthy opponent. But I don't think that concern should \noutweigh our determination to try to reduce the amount of money that is \nentering political life in America.\n  By adopting this amendment, as much as I empathize and understand the \nconcerns my colleagues have, it looks to me as though all we are doing \nis trying to protect ourselves rather than trying to level that playing \nfield.\n  If I am the only one to oppose it, I will do so.\n  Despite the good intentions of the authors of this amendment, I think \nit takes us in exactly the wrong direction. I think it makes a mockery \nof McCain-Feingold. I think we are beginning to just shred that piece \nof legislation. I know there is a strong determination to get a bill, \nbut a bill that has McCain-Feingold's name on it, and ends up doing \nwhat this amendment would do, I do not think deserves the label it \nmight otherwise get.\n  With that, Mr. President, I will oppose the amendment and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, he will not be the only person opposing this \namendment. I thank him for his eloquent, extraordinarily lucent \ndescription of this amendment and what it may mean. He\n\n[[Page S2544]]\n\nis right on the mark. I share his sympathy, his empathy, for those who \nmay be faced in the future with the circumstances some of our \ncolleagues already have been faced with--running against a well-\nfinanced, independently wealthy opponent.\n  I think the Senator from Connecticut puts his finger exactly on the \nproblem. This moves us away from limiting the money in the system. This \n``cure'' creates even more financial pitfalls and political \ndifficulties than the current system.\n  This amendment, however well intentioned, has three major problems. \nFirst, and foremost, it is an amendment that will create different \nstandards in different States. As a result of the different standards \nthat are created, most likely it will be declared unconstitutional. It \nwill allow different candidates to raise different levels of money in \ndifferent States depending upon circumstances. I cannot imagine that a \nsystem so confusing and biased could be upheld in any court of law. I \ncannot imagine that any court would look favorably at this inequitable \ndistribution of opportunity.\n  Secondly, this puts even more political power in the hands of fewer \nand fewer people. When we began this debate we were trying to address \nthis very problem--the concentration of political power in a wealthy \nfew. Even with the limits as they were in the last election, almost \nhalf of all total contributions to Senate candidates came from donors \nwho gave at least $1,000. So if the individual contribution limits now \nare raised to $3,000 or $6,000, or even higher if the underlying \nindividual limits are changed by this amendment process, we know \nwealthy donors are going to control the field even more. Why we would \nwant to do that in the name of campaign reform, I do not know?\n\n  I heard somebody say this is in the spirit of McCain-Feingold. This \nflies in the face of McCain-Feingold. There is nothing in the spirit of \nMcCain-Feingold in this amendment. This is not reform. This makes a \nmockery of reform.\n  Finally, I cannot imagine why the compromise has not addressed one of \nthe real problems that I see in this approach, which is that if an \nincumbent has $5 million in the bank or even $10 million in the bank, \nand his opponent declares that they want to spend some of their own \nmoney to mount a vigorous challenge, the incumbent gets to take \nadvantage of the raised individual contribution limits. In my state of \nSouth Dakota, if my opponent wanted to spend over $686,000 of their own \nmoney, I could take advantage of the new limits even if I might have $5 \nin the bank myself. If the same forces that want to pass this amendment \nturn around and triple the underlying contribution limits, I would be \nable to go out and raise as much as $18,000 from every individual who \nwants to contribute to my campaign.\n  How is that fair? Regardless of what money we may have in the bank, \nhow is it we would not look at that? Just because I might have a \nwealthy opponent, should I be allowed to open up the floodgates here \nand take whatever money I can raise? How is that limiting the influence \nof money? No, instead this protects incumbents. How is that in the \nspirit of McCain-Feingold? How can we seriously look at anybody and \nargue that this legislation benefits the true spirit and intent of what \nit is we are trying to do today?\n  I think the ranking member of the Rules Committee, the Senator from \nConnecticut, has articulately put his finger on the problem. We have to \noppose this if we really want to support meaningful campaign finance \nreform. Do not let anybody out there tell you that somehow, by \nsupporting this, we are moving in the right direction. This moves us \ndown the wrong track. We ought to oppose it. It ought to be defeated. I \nsupport McCain-Feingold, but I do not support this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the comments \nof the Senator from Connecticut. I am convinced that if he wants to \noffer an amendment to the Domenici amendment that says these amounts we \nare talking about for self-funded candidates also apply to incumbents \nwho have those amounts in their existing campaign funds, I would be \nhappy to support such a modification of the Domenici amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague would yield, my fear is once we have done \nthat, we are raising, of course, the hard limits, which takes us, as \nfar as I am concerned, in the wrong direction with the bill. I respect \nthose who say they are going to be raised anyway. But my concern is \nthat if we keep on ratcheting up those levels, then we are running \ncontrary to what I hope are the underlying motivations behind the \nunderlying bill.\n  So I merely pointed it out to show the inconsistency in someone's \npersonal wealth and a person's political wealth. We are applying one \nstandard on personal wealth and not the same standard on political \nwealth.\n  I appreciate the point. Someone else may offer the amendment. But I \nthank the Senator for raising the point.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Connecticut is exactly right. The \nreason I would support that is I am one of those who would increase the \nlimits. So this gives us an opportunity to support the increase in \nlimits in a number of other ways. But I appreciate this debate.\n  I will repeat what I said yesterday about my own experience, because \nI ran against a self-funded, wealthy candidate. If I had been under the \nrestrictions of the present law, let alone the restrictions of McCain-\nFeingold, I would never have gotten anywhere in the primary. The only \nway I was able to compete in the primary was to spend my own money and \nmatch the money that was being spent by a wealthy opponent.\n  As I said yesterday, and repeat for my friend from Connecticut, who \nhas an interest in Utah politics, my opponent--making the point of the \nSenator from Connecticut--outspent me three to one and lost. So that \nthe expenditure of huge sums does not automatically result in somebody \nbeing elected.\n  But, nonetheless, his willingness to spend $40 a vote in that primary \nmade it impossible for anybody to challenge him unless it was, as it \nturned out, a self-funded candidate who would come along and spend $15 \na vote. And that is about how it worked out. Actually, I do not think I \nspent quite that much per vote. But he spent $6 million. I spent less \nthan $2 million. I was able to get enough to get my message out and \nwin, but if I had to raise that less than $2 million, at $1,000 a \nperson, I guarantee you, I would not have been able to compete in any \nway. That is why I am sympathetic to the amendment of the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to colleagues, I will be \nrelatively brief. I do not have the full context of this amendment and \nthis debate, but my understanding is that this amendment is very \nsimilar to the amendment we voted on last night. I would like to repeat \nsome statistics I presented last night that I think apply.\n  Right now, do you know how many citizens contribute $200--just $200 \nor more? One quarter of 1 percent. One-quarter of 1 percent of the \npeople in this country contribute over $200. Do you know how many \npeople contribute over $1,000? One-ninth of 1 percent of the \npopulation. Do you know the reason? Because a whole lot of people \ncannot afford to give that kind of money to campaigns.\n  What we have here is an amendment that purports to improve the \nsituation by now creating a situation where you have people who are \nwealthy and have their own financial resources and finance their own \ncampaigns now challenged by people who are viable because they are \ndependent upon people who are wealthy and have financial resources.\n  The contest is between the wealthy with financial resources versus \nthe people who have access and are dependent upon the wealthy with \nfinancial resources. And this is called a reform? If the first thing we \ndo on the floor of the Senate is pass an amendment to put yet more \nmoney into American politics, I don't think people will find that all \nthat reassuring.\n  I say this because the more I follow this debate, the more convinced \nI am that public financing is the answer.\n\n[[Page S2545]]\n\n From the time I came here, this has always been a core question. Bill \nMoyers, who is a hero journalist to me, gave a speech and sent me a \ncopy of ``The Soul of Democracy,'' in which he argues basically what is \nat stake is a noble, beautiful, bold experiment, over 220 or 230 years, \nof self-rule. That is what is at stake, our capacity for self-rule.\n  If you are worried about what to do about millionaires or \nmultimillionaires running their own campaigns with their own resources, \nthe way to deal with that is to have a clean money, clean election, \nhave a system of public financing. We have seen some States such as \nMaine, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Arizona lead the way on this, where \nbasically people all contributed to a fund. Then you say, to abide by \nagreed-upon spending limits, you get public financing. Basically the \npeople themselves, who have contributed $5 or whatever per year in a \nState or in the country, they control the elections in their government \nand the capital and all the rest. It is much more of clean politics.\n  If someone says, no, I won't abide by that because I have zillions of \ndollars, and I will just finance my own campaign and go way beyond the \nexpenditure limits, then out of that clean money/clean election fund, \nmoney is given to the candidate who has agreed to abide by this to \nmatch that. That would be the direction in which you would go.\n  I don't know why Senators are so concerned about wealthy people \nrunning for office and financing their own campaigns and basically \nclobbering everybody else because they have the money. If this is the \nconcern of my colleagues, they should embrace public financing. That is \nwhat we want. Then we have a system that is honest, clean, and which \nbasically says all the people in the country contribute a small amount. \nWe are willing to abide by this. As to those candidates who don't, who \nwhen they run finance their own campaigns, there is additional money to \nmatch that. That is the direction in which we should go.\n  Before I take a question from my colleague, I want to say that one of \nthe amendments I will bring to the floor is an amendment--it is an \ninteresting proposition based upon an Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals \ndecision in Minnesota--that says: You change three words in Federal \nelection law and you make it possible for any State that so desires to \napply some system of public financing, whatever the States decide it \nis, not just to State elections but to Federal elections. If Utah wants \nto do it or the people in Minnesota want to do it and they vote for it \nor the legislature votes for it, then they ought to be able to do it. \nWe don't tell them what to do. We just say that if a State wants to \napply some system of public financing, some kind of clean money, clean \nelection to Federal races, they should be able to do so. That would be \nan amendment that goes in the direction we are going to have to go.\n  McCain-Feingold is very important and should not be watered down \nbecause I think it is an important step in the right direction. \nHowever, I cannot believe that what we have here--and I am very worried \nthis is a harbinger of what is to come--is an amendment that says we \nare going to vote for reform. We are going to now put more money into \npolitics. Those of you who run for office, here is the way we will \ncreate a level playing field. You can be even more dependent upon the \ntop one-quarter of 1 percent that now you can get $6,000 from or $5,000 \nfrom, or wherever you want to take the spending limit, in which case we \nare even more dependent on those folks; they have more clout, even more \npower.\n\n  And that is called reform. I just don't get it. Later on, there is \ngoing to be an amendment to raise campaign limits from 1 to 3 and 2 to \n6--unbelievable.\n  One more time--then I will take a question from my colleague--one-\nquarter of 1 percent of Americans made a contribution greater than $200 \nin the 1996 cycle--probably about the same in the 2000 cycle--.11 \npercent, one-ninth of 1 percent of the voting-age population, gave \n$1,000 or more. We are not talking about the population but the voting-\nage population. Now you are going to give wealthy citizens even more \nclout? You are going to give them an even greater capacity to affect \nelections and call this reform?\n  I yield for a question from my colleague.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend. Since he has raised the issue of \npublic financing in the campaign, I ask him if he would explain how the \npublic financing would work with respect to special interest groups \nthat raise their own money and run their own ads. We saw in the last \nelection, for example, groups such as the Sierra Club and the National \nRifle Association become very active in politics. We are no longer in a \nposition where it is just Republicans running against Democrats, as far \nas the airwaves are concerned, but a whole host of groups.\n  I ask the Senator, would he support public financing for political \nads for even the Sierra Club or the National Rifle Association?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I appreciate the question. There is a three-part \nanswer. You know I am long-winded. The first part is that you could \nhave additional public financing to match that. The second part is that \nthe amendment we are talking about here doesn't deal with that problem \neither. My colleague is raising yet another issue. I agree, it is a \nserious issue, but this amendment doesn't address that problem. My \ncolleague can raise this question, but it doesn't make a lot of sense \nin the context of this amendment. That is yet a whole separate issue \nwith which we have to deal.\n  My third point concerns another amendment I am thinking of which gets \nat part of the problem he is raising. I am very worried that what we \nare going to have is a bigger problem with the Hagel proposal. As much \nas I respect my colleague from Nebraska, I plan to be in vigorous \nopposition against it. I am worried that if you do the prohibition on \nthe soft money, it is going to shift to the sham ads, whoever is \nrunning those ads. The Senator mentioned some organizations. I could \nmention others. I am worried about that. It is like jello; you put your \nfinger here and it just shifts to over here.\n  In the McCain-Feingold bill, you deal with labor and you deal with \ncorporations. I am very worried that there will be a proliferation of \nall sorts of organizations, and labor and corporations with good \nlawyers will figure out basically how to make sure that their soft \nmoney also goes into this.\n  I would like to go back to the original McCain-Feingold formulation, \nwhich was in the bill that passed the House, to say that you have that \n60-day prohibition on soft money applied to all those sham ads, which I \nwould say to my colleague from Utah would be a very positive step.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator for his response. I agree with him \nthat my question didn't have anything to do with the amendment. It was \nstimulated by the Senator's endorsement of Federal funding. I thank him \nfor his response. I am prepared to debate the other issues he raises in \nthe appropriate context. I think we are both getting far away from the \namendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I don't think the first 75 percent of what I said was \nat all far away from it. Again, we have an amendment that purports to \nbe reform. The message to people in the country is, we are going to \nspend yet more money. Now we move from millionaires who can finance \ntheir own campaigns against people who are dependent upon millionaires \nwho can give them ever larger and larger contributions, with the top 1 \npercent of the population having more clout, more influence, more say. \nI don't view that as reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I can remember the first time I went to New \nYork City--amazing things to me--those tall buildings, those people--\nyou know, being from Nevada--teams of people milling around. But I have \nto acknowledge probably the most fascinating thing I saw was these \npeople on the street playing these games. They would try to entice \npeople to play. I learned later it was a shell game. I watched with \nfascination because nobody could ever win. No matter what you did, you \nalways picked the wrong place for that little object they were trying \nto hide.\n  I say that because I think that is what is happening with campaign \nfinance reform. In 1987, I came to the Senate floor saying: We have to \ndo something about campaign finance reform; we can't have another \nelection like I have just been through.\n  Well, I have been through two subsequent elections, and each has been \nprogressively worse, as far as money.\n\n[[Page S2546]]\n\n  Over these years, each time we were going to bring up campaign \nfinance reform, I looked with great expectation for the system to be \nmade better. But like the shell game I saw in New York, you never \npicked the right spot. It was always gone when you got there, and we \nnever did get to campaign finance reform. I can see that is what is \nhappening today.\n  All last week, I was kind of elated because Senators McCain and \nFeingold had worked to get their legislation on the floor. I felt there \nwas movement and that we could finally do something--if nothing more, \nget rid of soft money. Based on what happened last night, and I see \nwhat is happening today, I am very disappointed. I can't see, with all \ndue respect to my friends--and they are my friends, the Senator from \nWisconsin and the Senator from Arizona--how in the world they could \nsupport this amendment. If we are talking about campaign finance \nreform, this is going in the opposite direction, as has been so well \nput by the manager of the bill on our side, the ranking member of the \nRules Committee, the senior Senator from Connecticut.\n  The shell game is being played here. This is not campaign finance \nreform. I may not think the underlying campaign finance reform bill of \nMcCain and Feingold is perfect, but it is something I can support. The \nSenator from Connecticut is not going to be alone. We already know he \nhas a vote from the Senator from South Dakota, the Democratic leader. I \nacknowledged last night I wasn't going to vote for this thing. If we \nare going to have campaign finance reform, we are going to have \ncampaign finance reform.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut said, just because it has the name \n``McCain-Feingold'' on it doesn't mean it is campaign finance reform. \nWe keep moving away from it. I don't know how anybody can support the \nunderlying bill. I want to support campaign finance reform. I have \nwanted to support it since 1987. I have spoken on this floor as much as \nany other person about campaign finance reform. But today, again, I see \nthe shell game. I hope that I am wrong.\n  Yesterday, I acknowledged the great work of the Senators from \nWisconsin and Arizona in moving this bill forward. I don't, in any way, \nwant to imply anything negative other than disagreeing with the point \nof this legislation. But I want to say that I think the senior Senator \nfrom Kentucky has been masterful. I say that in the most positive \nsense. He has been one of the few people who has been willing to stand \nup and speak his mind. We have a lot of people who are doing things \nbehind the scenes to try to deep-six this bill, but the Senator from \nKentucky has never backed down a second, and I admire him. I disagree \nwith him, but I admire him for what he has done. In my estimation, I \nthink he has done very good legislating. I don't agree with him, but I \nhave the greatest respect and even admiration for the way he stood up \nwhen few people would oppose this legislation, and he did that. I \nrespect that.\n\n  Mr. President, we should acknowledge what is happening here. This \nunderlying McCain-Feingold legislation is slowly evaporating, and we \nare going to wind up with something else. It may have the name, but it \nis not going to be what I wanted to vote for.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that time be equally \ncharged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me briefly respond to my friends and \ncolleagues from Connecticut, South Dakota, and Nevada in regard to this \namendment. I certainly respect their opinions and respect their \ncomments.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that this amendment will enhance free \nspeech. It is true this amendment will move toward a more level playing \nfield and does address a problem that has arisen in the last few years \nwhen, because of a constitutionally protected loophole, the wealthy \ncandidate is the only person in the country who can put an unlimited \namount of money in a particular campaign--his or her own campaign. \nEverybody else is limited to $1,000 but not the candidate. So what has \nhappened is there has become a great search every election cycle, where \nboth the Republicans and the Democrats go out and they don't look for \npeople with great ideas. Some mechanics may have great ideas. They \ndon't look necessarily for people with a great deal of experience or \nwho bring other attributes, although a mechanic may have all of those \nthings. What they look for and what the great search around the country \nis for is people who have money--the more the better. If you can find \nsomeone who has that money and is articulate, and they are from a key \nState or from a State that is getting ready to elect a U.S. Senator, \nthen you have found what you were looking for.\n  There is an inequity in the current system. But that is not why this \namendment is being offered, and that is not why we should vote for this \namendment. We should not be concerned about the candidate who is \nrunning against the millionaire, not directly concerned about that \ncandidate. It is not just to level the playing field or to make it more \nequal. What we should be concerned about is the public and whether the \npublic will have the benefit of a free debate, free-flowing debate, a \ndebate where both candidates have the ability to get their ideas out.\n  This amendment enhances free speech, and it does it in a very \nrational way. Again, I point out to my colleagues who have come to the \nfloor to criticize this amendment, this amendment does not allow soft \nmoney. This amendment deals with very regulated, very much disclosed \nhard money. It basically builds on the current system. Where there is \nthe most accountability in the system today, and where we have had the \nfewest problems today is with hard money and with individual donors.\n  That is what this amendment builds on. It simply says that a person \nwho is faced with a millionaire putting his or her own money into the \ncampaign has the opportunity, because of this amendment, to go out and \nraise money from many people. When they raise that money, in each case \nit will be disclosed very quickly. It will be open to public scrutiny. \nIt will all be very much above board, and the end result will be not \nthat the candidate who is the millionaire will have a smaller \nmegaphone--that millionaire who is putting in his or her own money will \nhave the same megaphone they had before this amendment--but what it \nmeans is that the candidate who is facing that multimillionaire will \nalso have the opportunity to have a bigger megaphone, to grow that \nmegaphone if, in fact, he or she can go out and convince enough people \nto make individual contributions. That is what this amendment does.\n\n  Will it put more money into the political system? Yes, it will put \nmore money into the political system. I maintain, however, that the \neffect of that money will be to enhance the first amendment and not \ndiminish the first amendment. It will be to enhance people's ability to \ncommunicate and get a message across without in any way hurting someone \nelse's ability--namely, the millionaire--to get their message across.\n  My colleague and friend, the minority leader, talked about the \ndifferences between the States. I understand what his perspective is, \nbut I think, based upon the State he is from, he understands there is a \nfundamental difference between the expenditure of $1 million, or let's \nsay half a million dollars, in South Dakota and a half a million \ndollars in the State of Ohio. The half a million dollars in South \nDakota has a lot more impact than a half a million dollars in the State \nof Ohio. It seems to me it is incumbent upon us to make that \ndistinction.\n  How do we do it? First, I will talk about how we do not do it.\n  We do not make any difference in regard to whether there is a \nmultiple of three or multiple of six. We do not change that among the \nStates. We do not change the categories among the States, but what we \ndo say is that in a smaller State, when the millionaire puts in a \ncertain amount of money, that money does have more of an impact in that \nsmaller State than it has\n\n[[Page S2547]]\n\nin a larger State and, therefore, we start the process earlier and we \nkick it in earlier.\n  For example--and this is the chart my colleagues have--I will take \nthe first State, and that is the State of Wyoming. Recognizing the \ndifference that money has in Wyoming versus Ohio, we provide that the \nfirst threshold, which means you can raise $3,000 from a donor instead \nof $1,000 from a donor, that is triggered in Wyoming when the \nmillionaire, the person who is self-financing their campaign, puts in \n$328,640. The candidate who is running against the millionaire in \nWyoming would then have the opportunity to raise three times the limit \nfor each donor, which is $3,000.\n  In Ohio, we do not reach that threshold until that self-financed \ncandidate has put in $974,640. There is a difference in the impact that \nmoney has in one State versus the impact in another State. We do not \neven kick that in until that person has put in close to $1 million in \nthe State of Ohio.\n  It makes eminent sense to do it this way. It has been well thought \nout, and, frankly, it enhances the chance that a court will look at \nthis and say, yes, that is a rational approach.\n  Again, this is an amendment that has a lot of protections built in, \nand probably the most important one was added last night. That was the \nconcept that a wealthy candidate should not in any way be disadvantaged \nby the fact that he or she is exercising their constitutional right to \nput their own money into a campaign.\n  How do we ensure that? We ensure it by simply saying that the amount \nof money the nonwealthy candidate can raise above the normal caps will \nbe limited to the amount of money that the wealthy candidate puts in. \nIf the wealthy candidate puts in $5 million, the nonwealthy candidate \ncan only raise, with the enhanced caps from individuals, a total of \nthat up to $5 million.\n  It guarantees the wealthy candidate will not be disadvantaged, that \nhe or she will not have a smaller megaphone and there will not be a \ndisincentive for them to actually put their own money into the \ncampaign.\n  They will still have the ability to do that. They will not be \npenalized if they do that, but what it says is when that does happen, \nwhen the wealthy candidate does contribute a significant amount of \nmoney to his or her own campaign, then the nonwealthy candidate can go \nback, as a practical matter, to previous donors and try to get them to \ngive an additional $1,000, $2,000, or $3,000, depending on where they \nare.\n  It is a lot of work. It is something that is not easily done. It is \nsomething that will make sure there are more and more people involved \nin giving money, will involve more people in the process, and will \nenhance freedom of speech.\n  In summary, this is a well-crafted amendment. It is an amendment that \ndeals in a constitutional way with a problem of perception, and that \nperception is that someone today who is wealthy enough can buy a seat \nin the Senate. We know that may or may not be true in a particular \ncase, and we also know that many people who are wealthy and who are \nself-financed are fine people and fine candidates. That is not the \nissue.\n  What this amendment is aimed at dealing with is the perception, and \nthe perception that someone can buy a seat in the Senate with their own \nmoney. It begins to level that playing field. It makes it more \ncompetitive. It enhances free speech, and it does not diminish in any \nway what that wealthy candidate can say or do or their ability to get \ntheir message out, but enables the person who is not wealthy to also \nget their message out. We have done it, I think, in a rational way.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, after a long night and legislative \ncounsel drafting this amendment and then all of our collective staffs \nworking on it to make sure we had a draft we could offer, we are now at \nthat point. This amendment may need some technical and drafting changes \nas we move through this process, and that will be done.\n  Essentially, Senator DeWine has explained the technical part of this \nbill. I want to, once again, talk about why this bill is imperative for \nthe United States.\n  While we are here on the floor debating a McCain bill to change the \ncampaign laws of America because we are concerned about excess money \ncoming from sources--soft money, hard money, too much of this, too much \nof that--and I am not sure I agree with everyone, but I am saying where \nwe are there is a new and growing situation that involves this \namendment and what we are trying to do. That is the right of wealthy \nAmericans, men or women, to spend as much of their own money as they \ndesire in a campaign. Nobody is going to change that. This amendment \ncannot change that. The Supreme Court has said that is a right.\n  That right is being exercised in growing numbers by those who put not \na few thousand, not a few million, but tens of millions of dollars of \ntheir own money into campaigns.\n  What is wrong with that is not that they can put up $10 million, but \ntheir opponent is bound by 26-year-old caps that are so low that to \nmatch somebody who puts $10 million of their own money in, in a middle-\nsize State, the opposition must spend days upon days seeking $1,000 \ncontributions per election and seeking $5,000 per election from \npolitical action committees.\n  I never have figured out how much a person would have to spend of \ntheir time to match a $10 million contribution from a wealthy person or \nsuperwealthy contribution. It is an enormous amount of time. It is \nfrequently fruitless because you can't raise enough money to match.\n\n  I am not concerned today about making sure the candidate who puts up \nmillions is treated precisely as the person running against him, \nwhether the person is incumbent or otherwise. However, what we do is \nsay the man or woman running against the big contributor--the $5 \nmillion, the $3 million, the $20 million, we even had over $50 million \nof their own money spent--the opposition candidate has to have a change \nin those $1,000 cap restraints and the $1,000 has to be raised \nsubstantially. The hard money that can come from parties has to also be \nchanged substantially so the person running against a wealthy candidate \nwho spends a lot of their own--and I just described that; the other \nside of the aisle described it also, somebody on the other side of the \naisle said as much as $50 million--in a simple way raise the level of \nfunding that the opponent can raise from the American people, citizens \nof their State and from their party. That is fair. If it turns out in \nthe process you do not match equal dollars, that is all right with this \nSenator. We tried very hard to make sure the person running against the \nwealthy candidate gets a fair share.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 115\n\n  I send an amendment to the desk for myself, Senators DeWine, Durbin, \nEnsign, Feinstein, and Collins, and I ask it be immediately considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself, \n     Mr. DeWine, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Ensign, Mrs. Feinstein, and Ms. \n     Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 115.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe we have agreed we will vote at 12:15.\n  Mr. DODD. If I can make a point, my concern is that I don't know if I \nhave the final version of this amendment. I gather still technical \nchanges are being made as we stand here. I count 20 pages to this \namendment. Am I right, roughly 20 pages?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is 12 pages.\n  Mr. DODD. We are just getting an amendment that raises hard money \ncaps, based on triggers and formulas from 50 States. I am uneasy about \nthis body taking on an amendment such as this without knowing the \nimplications and going directly contrary to the thrust. While the bill \nfocuses on soft money, many believe the issue of the amount of money in \ncampaigns, raising this limit makes it that much easier later on for \npeople to raise the caps on\n\n[[Page S2548]]\n\nhard dollars. Nothing in here provides for the challenger who faces the \nincumbent with how many millions they may have in their own political \naccount.\n  I am troubled by this body on a matter such as this, when hardly a \nspeed-reader would have time to read this amendment, understand it, \ndigest it, and adopt it all in the next 10 minutes. It is troubling to \nme. I understand the need to move along. I oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Connecticut, the choice is \nbetween 12:15 and 12:50. We debated it 3 hours yesterday and we debated \nit for 3 hours this morning. We can agree to vote at 12:15 or vote at \n12:50.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. When he says ``agree to vote,'' are you assuming there is \na vote to--a motion to table either side?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am not assuming anything.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me say the current version of this \namendment represents a significant improvement over where it was last \nnight for a number of reasons.\n  First, last night's version did not keep a cap on contributions once \nthe trigger was triggered. The extra contributions triggered on but did \nnot trigger off. This version intends to trigger off the extra \nincreased contributions when the limit of the declaration of the \nwealthy person is reached. That is a significant improvement. That is \nconsistent with the purpose of McCain-Feingold--limits, trying to hang \non to limits for dear life.\n  Those limits have been blown by the soft money loophole and this \ncurrent version--and it is an improvement over the earlier version--at \nleast restores limits because you are not just triggering on the \nincreases from $1,000 to $3,000 or $1,000 to $6,000. You then trigger \noff the increases when the declared amount by the wealthy self-financed \nperson is made or is reached, either one. That is an improvement.\n  Second, I think the variation among the States is an improvement.\n  However, there is still a major problem, and I will address my friend \nfrom New Mexico and Ohio on this problem. In the effort to level the \nplaying field in one area, we are making the playing field less level \nin another area under this language. As the Senators from Connecticut \nand Nevada, and the Democratic leader, have pointed out, the playing \nfield will be less level for the challenger. For instance, the \nchallenger, who might want to put $1 million into the campaign, is \nself-financed to that extent. He or she may mortgage a home to get the \n$1 million so that he or she is able to compete against the incumbent, \nwhere the incumbent has $5 million in a campaign account. We make that \nsituation less level, not more level, because the incumbent is able to \nthen raise money at the higher contribution levels.\n  It seems to me that is a significant flaw which we should attempt to \naddress, and we should attempt to address it in this amendment before \nwe vote on it.\n  Now, the only way we can offer a second-degree amendment to a pending \namendment under our unanimous consent is if the motion to table is made \nand fails. That is the only way in which a second-degree amendment can \nbe offered. Since this is complicated language which is being presented \nto the Senate at this hour with very little opportunity for many \nMembers to read it or think through it, I suggest we do one of two \nthings. We either amend the unanimous consent in this case so we can \nvote after we have had a chance to second degree it, or at least \nconsider the language so we can determine if we want to second degree \nthe amendment. If that is not acceptable to the proponents, it seems to \nme we should move to table, the motion to table will be defeated, and \nthen it will be open to a second-degree amendment. Since that is the \nonly way in which anybody who wants to offer an amendment in the second \ndegree can offer it, it seems to me that is an appropriate way to \nproceed.\n  Let me summarize, I think this amendment is an improvement over what \nwe began with in a number of ways. We have a trigger off as well as a \ntrigger on. That is a plus. And there is variety among the States. That \nis a plus. However, it creates an unlevel field. As the Senator from \nConnecticut pointed out, along with the Senator from Nevada, there is \nan unlevel playing field which is created, a greater lack of a level \nplaying field in the case of the incumbent who has that campaign fund, \nwho is then being challenged by somebody who can self-finance to the \nextent of $\\1/2\\ million or $1 million. The incumbent who already has \nthe financial advantage and the incumbency advantage is then also given \nthe advantage of having the higher contribution limits.\n  The effort to level the playing field in a very appropriate way, as \nthe Senator from Ohio is doing, makes the playing field less level \nagainst the challenger.\n  This would be up to the managers of the bill. But I suggest that the \nMembers of the Senate be able to read this amendment, either delay the \nvote, or make it open to a second-degree amendment. Or, in the \nalternative, I suggest that we have a motion to table, which then \npresumably would be defeated, but which would open up the amendment to \nbeing read and considered and to a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I was talking to the assistant \nDemocratic leader. We agreed that we ought to have this vote at 12:15. \nIt is my understanding, I believe, that he is going to propound a \nconsent agreement for that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this has been cleared with Senator Dodd and \nmanagers of this bill. I ask unanimous consent that we have a vote on \nor in relation to this amendment at 12:15, and following that vote, our \nparty recesses would take place. We would be in recess and reconvene at \n2:15 today. The next amendment being offered would be a Republican \namendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, does \nthat mean an up-or-down vote on the Domenici amendment?\n  Mr. REID. No, it doesn't. We are under a unanimous consent agreement. \nWhatever happens happens.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me raise the issue. If the Democrat amendment is \nnot tabled, then it is open to second degrees. So the next amendment is \nnot necessarily a Republican amendment.\n  Mr. REID. The unanimous consent request indicates that if a motion to \ntable is not offered, then it is anybody's opportunity.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If a second-degree amendment were a Democrat \namendment, from a parliamentary point of view, we would be potentially \nin an extended discussion, which is what I see my friend from Michigan \nsmiling about.\n  What we feared when we entered into this consent agreement in the \nfirst place was the potential for anybody who wanted to kind of work \nmischief and to filibuster a second-degree amendment. I ask my friend \nfrom Michigan, is it his intent, then, to second degree the Domenici \namendment once it is not tabled, thereby preventing Republicans from \noffering the next amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. I am not intending to prevent Republicans from \noffering the next first-degree amendment at all. I am not sure I want \nto offer a second-degree amendment. With an amendment this complex, I \nwant there to be an opportunity for Members to read it, consider it, \nand decide whether or not to offer a second-degree amendment. I may try \nto offer a second-degree amendment along the lines that we talked \nabout. In no way am I trying to prevent Republicans from offering \namendments.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I don't know whether this is acceptable to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico. Since we were debating this issue all day yesterday \nand have been all day today, there are some Senators who, in order to \nmake progress on the bill, might want to go to another amendment. I am \nwondering about temporarily laying it aside or staying on this with a \nmotion to table.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What would be the status of the Domenici amendment? If \nwe would set it aside, it would be an amendment that has not been \ntabled, and that is subject to amendment pursuant to the unanimous \nconsent agreement. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. No. Wait a minute. Reserving the right to object, my point \nis that under the unanimous consent request a pending amendment cannot \nbe a second-degree amendment unless there is a tabling motion. If there \nis a\n\n[[Page S2549]]\n\ntabling motion, and that does not prevail, then that amendment is \nsubject to amendment.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I assume we are going to do that right now. Are you \ngoing to try to table it? You are going to lose.\n  Mr. DODD. It can be done in a number of different ways: withhold and \nlay the amendment aside; then bring up a Republican amendment after the \nrecess lunches and work on this amendment; or vote on this amendment; \nor have a tabling motion; and, if you do not prevail, then the \namendment is subject to future amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, let's \ncontinue the discussion for a moment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to proceed. I believe it is \n12 pages long. We have counted it. We have had hours in that Cloakroom \nwith staff from every Senator who is interested. The amendment we \nstarted with was rather lengthy. We just added to it. But we have added \nwhat all of these Senators wanted as if they were sitting in there in \nterms of modifying the Domenici amendment to make it a real Domenici-\nDeWine amendment which includes the state-by-state formula that he \nwants as well as proportionality that other Senators sought.\n  I want a vote up or down when the time comes. I hope it will come \nquickly. If it doesn't, we will vote at whatever time this time \nexpires. If somebody wants to table it, I would now, here and now, urge \nthat we not table it. It is a very good amendment. If you want to fix \nit up, you can fix it up a little bit. It still has to go to \nconference. But essentially a vote to table this is a vote not to do \nanything about the growing situation of extremely wealthy Americans \nusing their own money while, for the most part, the person running \nagainst him is encumbered by statutes in terms of what they can raise \nthat are totally unreasonable versus a candidate who puts in $10 \nmillion, $20 million, $30 million, or $40 million. That is the issue.\n  At this point, I yield the floor and hope we will vote soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I say in all due respect to \nmy good friend from New Mexico that you have provisions in here, as I \nlook at this thing, where you have inserts that I can't even find. \nInsert 301 in someplace, insert from 301--I am looking at an amendment \nthat I can't even follow. With all due respect, this is pretty serious \nstuff. I need to have a guide to get me through this. You are asking me \nto vote in a couple of minutes on a 12- or 15-page amendment that is \nvery important. This is a significant amendment.\n  It seems to me that we ought to take a little time either to get this \nright or not. But if you are going to rush this thing through without \nany explanation, I say to colleagues who want to, come over here to see \nan amendment insert that I can't find.\n  We ought to vote to table it, or take a little time and then sort \nthis out so at least Members know what they are voting on. But to vote \non this right now under these circumstances would be a travesty. It is \nnot the way to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest by the Senator from Nevada?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, Mr. \nPresident, let me point out a couple of things.\n  One is we have spent a long time on this issue. Negotiations included \nvirtually every Senator who was interested in this amendment. There are \ntwo parliamentary procedures. If the motion to table fails, yes, a \nsecond-degree amendment is in order. But a tabling motion to the \nsecond-degree amendment also is in order at any time. There is no \ntimeframe.\n  It is also available to further amendments in the future which could \nbe designed to affect the Domenici-DeWine amendment as well. If this \nissue is to be revisited with another amendment, it could be done as \nwell. You don't necessarily have to go to a second-degree amendment.\n  I point out to my colleagues that we have 2 weeks. We have now been \non this amendment for a number of hours, depending on at what they are \nlooking. We ought to be able to get this issue resolved quickly and \nmove on to other amendments.\n  I can understand the frustration of the Senator from Kentucky because \nhe was under the impression that the next amendment would be his \namendment, or one of the supporters of his position on the overall \nbill.\n  I hope we can have an up-or-down vote with the full and certain \nknowledge that another amendment to clarify or to change the underlying \namendment would be in order at any time, and by having an up-or-down \nvote, we can move on with the amending process.\n  I hope my colleagues can understand the logic of that. There is a \nlimitation of time. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the vote will be at 12:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will be at 12:15.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, does the Senator from New Mexico yield 3 \nminutes?\n  Mr. President, first, I say that if this amendment is adopted, I want \nto make it clear, given the concerns raised by the Senator from \nConnecticut, which I think are legitimate, that we have agreed on \nworking together to work out a technical amendment package that is \nagreeable to all of us.\n  We have an agreement as to the concept of the amendment, and we will \nmake sure that if the amendment is added to the bill it reflects our \nagreement. Without that, I certainly agree with the Senator from \nConnecticut that there will be problems.\n  There needs to be changes, and there needs to be some time to \nevaluate and make the changes.\n  I thank everyone for all the hard work that was put into this. It is \na very complicated issue. Senators have very strong feelings on it. \nEver since the Buckley case held that Congress cannot restrict a \ncandidate's spending of his or her own personal wealth, we have \nstruggled and struggled with how to handle the situation where \ncandidates have such disparate, unequal personal fortunes. \nUnderstandably, there is a great concern among Members of this body \nabout the possibility of facing a very wealthy challenger. Many of us \nhave had that experience, including myself. To the extent that an \nincumbent Senator is wealthy, it is very difficult to find a viable \nchallenger.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Domenici yesterday was certainly \nwell intentioned, but it had at least two significant flaws. First, it \nallowed candidates who faced a wealthy candidate to raise unlimited \nfunds from their contributors under increased limits. It even \npermitted, in my view, a very serious problem. It even permitted \nparties to pump unlimited funds into a race based on a situation where \nsomebody would put over $1 million of their own money into a race.\n  Secondly, it did not recognize the obvious fact that $500,000 of \npersonal spending in Maine is much more significant than $500,000 of \npersonal spending in a State such as California or New York.\n  I am pleased that we have addressed both of these problems in this \ncompromise. I am not happy with the idea that we are raising individual \nlimits in this way. I believe this sets a dangerous precedent both for \nthe future of this debate and for future debates, but the amendment is \nmuch improved, and in the spirit of compromise, I intend to support it.\n  However, this is not an amendment that I believe is essential to \nreform. In fact, I would rather see that we address this problem in a \ndifferent way. But this is a process in which we have to show some \nflexibility. So while I will vote for it, I fully understand that some \nvery strong supporters of our bill must vote against it. That is fine. \nI want to assure those who are watching that a vote against this \namendment is not, to my mind, an antireform vote.\n  I also add that with regard to those who have worked so hard on this \namendment, especially on the other side of the aisle, if they are \nsuccessful, I hope those Senators will be part of our reform effort and \nwill join us as this process proceeds with the common goal of passing--\nI ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n\n[[Page S2550]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator, are you in favor of the amendment or \nagainst the amendment?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am in favor of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me conclude and say it is essential that those who \nare a part of adding these items and these new considerations to the \nbill be part of the solution, which is to pass this legislation without \ntoo many amendments that would actually undercut its ability to get \nthrough this body and be a good piece of public policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The other side has time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I will be glad to yield to my colleague from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to ask the Senator from Wisconsin a question. Would \nthe Senator be open to a question?\n  This amendment will create a less level playing field in one area; \nthat is, when the incumbent has the large campaign fund, say, of $5 \nmillion, and the challenger then puts in $1 million of his own, this \nopens it up to the incumbent to have the higher contribution limits, \nwhich is a tremendous advantage, on top of the incumbency advantage.\n  Is the Senator from Wisconsin committed to an amendment which would \ntry to correct that deleveling of the playing field that is created by \nthis amendment?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in answer to the Senator from Michigan, \nI think that is a problem that should be addressed.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield back whatever time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the next amendment will be offered on \nthe Republican side. I had indicated to my colleague, Senator Dodd, it \nwill be either in the area of soft money or an amendment concerning \nlobbyists. We are going to work that out during lunch. It will be laid \ndown at 2:15 p.m. Of course, the amendment will be laid down at the \nbeginning. We will not have the confusion that surrounded the last \namendment, and everyone will be fully apprised of what is in it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before adjourning, I ask our colleagues, if \nthey have amendments on this bill, to get them to us, and those who are \ninterested in having amendments offered, let us know so we can start to \nline up these amendments and make sure all interested parties are aware \nof what amendments are coming. It would be very helpful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2550-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2550-S2552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 117.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \n     prohibit separate segregated funds and nonconnected political \n committees from using soft money to subsidize hard dollar fundraising)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 305. PROHIBITING SEPARATE SEGREGATED FUNDS FROM USING \n                   SOFT MONEY TO RAISE HARD MONEY.\n\n       Section 316(b)(2)(c) of the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 441b(b)(2)(c)) is amended by inserting \n     before the period at the end the following: ``, except that \n     the costs of such establishment, administration, and \n     solicitation may only be paid from funds that are subject to \n     the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of \n     this Act''.\n\n     SEC. 306. PROHIBITING CERTAIN POLITICAL COMMITTEES FROM USING \n                   SOFT MONEY TO RAISE HARD MONEY.\n\n       Section 323 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, \n     as added by section 101, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(f) Other Political Committees.--A political committee \n     described in section 301(4)(A) to which this section does not \n     otherwise apply (including an entity that is directly or \n     indirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled \n     by such a political committee) shall not solicit, receive, \n     direct, transfer, or spend funds that are not subject to the \n     limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of this \n     Act.''.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It is \nvery short. I hope it is very much to the point. I refer to it as a \nconsistency amendment; that is, it brings a degree of consistency to \nMcCain-Feingold that has not been there before.\n  I must confess I didn't read McCain-Feingold all that carefully in \nprevious debates since I was opposed to it and I was convinced it was \ngoing to fail. I opposed it on constitutional grounds. I still feel \nthat way about McCain-Feingold, but there is now a prospect that it \nmight pass. That being the case, I think it appropriate we address some \naspects that we perhaps did not look at before.\n  The fundamental proposition within McCain-Feingold, as I understand \nit, is that soft money is evil, soft money must be banned, soft money \nleads to the appearance of corruption, and therefore McCain-Feingold is \ndrafted to eliminate soft money.\n  As we went through McCain-Feingold carefully, we discovered it does \nnot eliminate all soft money. So my amendment, to be consistent, does \neliminate all soft money. Let me be specific as to that which is not \neliminated under McCain-Feingold and would be eliminated under my \namendment; that is, the use of soft money to pay the administrative \nexpenses of PACs, or political action committees.\n  I have something of a history with PACs by virtue of the fact at one \npoint\n\n[[Page S2551]]\n\nin my career I worked for the late and legendary Howard Hughes. Mr. \nHughes, or Mr. Hughes' executives, rather, constitute the fathers of \nPACs because in California, where Mr. Hughes had his operations, they \ninitiated what was at the time a whole new idea in politics. Mr. \nHughes' executives were tired of California politicians coming to them \nand saying: We want political contributions. So they said: Let's do \nsomething different. Come to our plant and address our employees, and \nwhen you have finished addressing our employees, we will pass out \nenvelopes and pledge cards to our employees and they can pledge money \nto you or to your opponent, depending on how they received your \npresentation when they were there.\n  To my knowledge--and I can be corrected on this--this was the \nbeginning of a political action committee. I can remember when I was \nemployed by the Hughes organization, every politician in California \nwanted to take advantage of this opportunity. They all wanted to come \nby the Hughes companies, address the Hughes employees, make their \npoints, and then walk away when it was over with a single check that \nrepresented the aggregate of the commitments the employees had made to \nthat particular candidate.\n  It was considered at the time to be individual participation in \npolitics at its finest, and it became, I believe, the pattern for the \npolitical action committee that we now have.\n  But it is very different from what we now have in that now instead of \nsimply inviting the candidates in and letting them speak to the \nemployees and then inviting employees to make contributions in whatever \nfashion and whatever amount the employees may want to do it, in today's \npolitical action committee, the organization--be it a union or a \ncorporation--goes out and actively raises the funds itself. It doesn't \ninvolve the candidate in any way except when it gets to the point of \ndisbursing the funds.\n  It has become a major business activity--I say ``business \nactivity''--a major campaign activity on the part of corporations and \nunions.\n  The administrative costs of running this activity are traditionally \nborne by the corporation and union. In other words, this is a soft \nmoney contribution on behalf of the corporation or the union which is \nnot disclosed in any way.\n  Let me share with you some numbers that come from the summary page of \nreports filed with the Federal Election Commission.\n  The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Committee on \nPolitical Education reported that they raised in the calendar year \n$2,653,257.29. That is a high enough figure to get everybody's \nattention. What were their operating expenditures? Zero.\n  Mr. President, you and I and every other person who is in this body \nknows that you don't raise $2.6 million without having any overhead. \nIndeed, the rule of thumb is that you spend a minimum of 25 percent of \nyour receipts in raising the money, and sometimes it can go as high as \n45 percent.\n  If we simply take that kind of rule of thumb and say a third of \n$2.650 million is $700,000, or $800,000, that means this report is \nprima facie evidence of an $800,000 soft money contribution to this PAC \nby the overhead of the union. It is not just unions. There are \nbusinesses that do it. I will give you some summary data with respect \nthereto.\n  For example, Bank One had receipts of $2,378,211 on their FEC report, \nand they showed operating expenses of $259.46. Again, we know that \ncouldn't possibly be true if you take the rule of thumb and apply it. \nIt is somewhere, once again, between $700,000 and $800,000 that it \nwould cost to raise that amount of money. This is an effective soft \nmoney contribution of between $700,000 and $800,000.\n  Let me be clear. Based on my past history and my voting prospects, I \ndo not object to Bank One doing that. I do not object to the soft money \nthat they contributed.\n  But McCain-Feingold, as a bill, does. If it passes, I believe it \nshould be consistent because this soft money contribution, unlike the \nothers that we have heard so much about on the floor, is not disclosed. \nThis soft money contribution must be devised by the kind of \nmathematical analysis I have just applied to it. I could be completely \nwrong. I do not know that it is $700,000 to $800,000 that Bank One put \ninto rates raising that much money because it is not disclosed in any \nway. This is not to imply any wrongdoing on Bank One's part because the \npresent law does not require it. They are abiding by the present law in \na perfectly legitimate and proper way.\n  The same thing can be said of the International Brotherhood of \nElectrical Workers Committee on Political Education. The present law \ndoes not require them to disclose the amount of soft money they put \ninto raising the $2.6 million that they report on their FEC report.\n\n  But if we are going to be consistent, if we are going to say that \nsoft money is bad, this amendment that I am offering will close a \nsignificant soft money loophole. It will close the loophole where soft \nmoney is currently being spent by both corporations and unions and is \nnot being disclosed in any way.\n  I don't know how controversial this might be. But I offer it because \nI think it shines an appropriate spotlight on an aspect of the McCain-\nFeingold bill that has not been discussed in the past.\n  I have no desire to take the full hour and a half. I see that there \ndoesn't seem to be a great deal of interest one way or the other on \nthis. But I will be happy to yield for questions or comments by any \nMember of the Senate who wishes to discuss this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Certainly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the understanding of the Senator from Kentucky \ncorrect that the principle involved in the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Utah is that if all Federal political parties, and State and local \npolitical parties in even numbered years have to operate in 100-percent \nhard dollars, then those organizing political action committees which \nare the possessors of 100 percent of the hard dollars must raise their \nmoney through 100 percent hard dollars as well? In other words, the \nadministrative costs of the parties that engage in 100-percent hard \ndollars would also be applied to corporations and unions. Is that the \nprinciple established?\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Kentucky is correct. All of us are \nfamiliar with the requirement to cover our administrative costs for \nfundraising out of the proceeds of that fundraising effort. The Senator \nis correct that this amendment would simply put PACs on the same course \nas individual candidates. A PAC could not raise money with the \nadvantage of soft dollars any more than a candidate would.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is further correct in that it has an impact \non what happens at the State party level because I understand now that \na State party can use soft dollars to do certain kinds of things \nunconnected with advertising or direct contributions to candidates. \nThey would say: No, you can't do that if there is a fundraising effort. \nThe fundraising expenses must be paid out of the fundraising receipts \nand cannot be solicited in soft dollars.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the principle of the Senator from Utah that even \nthough he, like the Senator from Kentucky, does not oppose non-Federal \nmoney, if such a standard of Federal money only is established for the \nnational political parties, and State and local parties in even \nnumbered years, then that same principle should apply to everyone \nparticipating?\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Kentucky is correct. That is exactly \nthe position I have taken.\n  In the interest of full disclosure of motive, I know there is some \nconversation on this floor about raising the limits for hard dollar \nsolicitations. I am solidly and strongly in favor of raising the limits \non hard dollar solicitations. I recognize if this loophole for soft \ndollars--as I have pointed out--is, in fact, closed it will increase \nthe pressure when we get to the appropriate amendment to raise the hard \ndollar limit because it will shut off one significant source of soft \ndollar contributions that is currently in the bill.\n  I don't want to fly under any false pretense. I am hoping that by the \npassage of my amendment we will not only achieve the intellectual \nconsistency I have been discussing with the Senator from Kentucky, but, \nquite frankly, it would create some political pressure to raise the \nhard dollar limits\n\n[[Page S2552]]\n\nbecause I think raising the hard dollar limits is a salutatory thing to \ndo.\n  So let there be no mistake that that agenda is in my mind as I offer \nthis amendment. But nonetheless, I think the amendment has an \nintellectual sustaining consistency to it because it takes the position \nthat if, as McCain-Feingold says, soft money is inherently corrupting, \nor gives the appearance of corruption, this is a form of soft money \nthat is even more the appearance of corruption because under McCain-\nFeingold it is, A, allowed and, B, not disclosed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Then as a practical matter, just sort of putting it \nanother way, the treasury funds of unions and corporations cannot be \nused to underwrite fundraising or administrative costs in political \naction committees?\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Kentucky is exactly correct.\n  If this amendment passes, treasury funds in the union, treasury funds \nin the corporation, cannot be used to pay the expenses of political \nfundraising in a political action committee that is organized by either \nthe union or the corporation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Utah for the answer.\n  Mr. BENNETT. As I said, the amendment is very short. It is very \nstraightforward. It does not require the kind of complex analysis that \nwent into the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico, which required \nan entire evening to review and rewrite. I think it is very \nstraightforward. I am not anxious to prolong the debate, but I will, of \ncourse, be here to respond to any comments anyone might have one way or \nthe other.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, at the appropriate time I am going to make \nsome comments about the pending amendment. But as has been the custom \nover the years, our distinguished former leader, the distinguished \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, makes it a point, at the change of \nthe seasons in our country, to remind us of the importance of \ntransition, hope, and promise.\n  In the midst of this debate, I would like to yield whatever time the \nSenator from West Virginia may need for some remarks that do not \npertain directly to this amendment but do pertain to the spirit in \nwhich this body ought to consider legislation in any season.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I yield whatever time the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia may need.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2552-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2552-S2553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MILLENNIAL SPRING\n\n  Mr. BYRD. In the midst of this very important discussion on a very \nserious subject, if we could take just a few minutes to call attention \nto the coming of spring.\n  It used to be that Senators would take note of these things years ago \nwhen I first came here. They would talk about Flag Day, Independence \nDay, Easter, the Fourth of July--I already mentioned that--and the \ncoming of spring, the coming of summer, the coming of fall, the coming \nof winter, and so on. Those things do not seem to be of great interest \naround here anymore. But as one who has been here a long time, I still \nlike to hold on to the old ways.\n  Percy Bysshe Shelley said:\n\n       Oh, Wind, if Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?\n\n  Well, spring is here. I was asked by my friend from Nevada, Senator \nReid, if I might think of a poem that could be appropriate for this \noccasion. I have thought a little bit about it, and the words of \nWilliam Wordsworth come to mind. I hope I can remember them. He said:\n\n       I wander'd lonely as a cloud\n       That floats on high o'er vales and hills,\n       When all at once I saw a crowd,\n       A host of golden daffodils;\n       Beside the lake, beneath the trees,\n       Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.\n\n       Continuous as the stars that shine\n       And twinkle on the Milky Way,\n       They stretch'd in never-ending line\n       Along the margin of a bay:\n       Ten thousand saw I, at a glance,\n       Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.\n\n       The waves beside them danced; but they\n       Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:\n       A poet could not but be gay,\n       In such a jocund company:\n       I gazed--and gazed--but little thought\n       What wealth the show to me had brought:\n\n       For oft, when on my couch I lie\n       In vacant or in pensive mood,\n       They flash upon that inward eye\n       Which is the bliss of solitude;\n       And then my heart with pleasure fills,\n       And dances with the daffodils.\n\n  Mr. President, today is the first spring day of the third millennium. \nWe have survived the great change of the calendar, and the world did \nnot end. We endured the buffeting of a winter of uncertainty, with \nskyrocketing fuel bills--and we are still very much engaged in that \nmatter--threats of nor'easters--I wonder why these television people \nalways say ``nor'easters.'' They just are trying to join in the spirit \nof things, I suppose. But I still call them northeasters--threats of \nnor'easters and even earthquakes now behind us.\n  The NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow, the S 500--all \nhave been on a roller coaster ride of short heights followed by heart-\nstopping plunges. The uncertainties of last year's Presidential \nelection have become a comedic staple of dimpled, pregnant, and hanging \nchads, the punch lines obscuring the gravity of ensuring the stable \ntransition of government power. But today, it is spring--it may not be \nthe first spring day, but it is the first day of spring--and it is a \ngood time to pause, and take a deep breath--ah--and savor the moment.\n  The change of seasons is a reassuring constant in our lives. The slow \nswing of the celestial clock chimes in close harmony with our deepest \nnature. It is as deep and calm as our own mother's, keeping time with \nthe lullabies she used to lull us to sleep with, as infants. Today, the \npeals ring in the spring.\n  Across the country, warm days call us forth, out of our stale houses, \naway from our rumpled, dormant winter hibernations in front of \nyammering, yakking television sets. As we rake the drifts of dead \nleaves from the sheltered corners where they have gathered, we stir up \nthe sweet perfume--ah, the sweet perfume--of the awakening earth. Under \nthe cold brown coverlet of dirt, spring's life-force is beginning to \nstir. The dainty crocus sparkle amid the straw colored remains of last \nyear's lush lawn.\n  I was commenting to my wife Erma about those crocuses outside, just \nbeside the front porch of our house. Gaudy daffodils, about which \nWordsworth wrote, reward the early bumblebee. Young squirrels are \nchasing--and they like peanuts. I have several squirrels at my humble \ncottage in McLean, and each night I take a handful of peanuts and put \nthem under a table there just outside the door that goes out into my \nbackyard. Those squirrels, by the time I rise in the morning, by the \ntime I have a chance to take my little dog Billy Byrd out for a walk, \nsneak away, taking those peanuts from underneath the table. Then I \nwill, a little later, open the door, and there are two, three, four, \nfive, or six squirrels, and I toss them out a handful of peanuts.\n  Those young squirrels are chasing each other up and down and around \ntree trunks in a three-ring circus display of acrobatics. Talk about \nacrobatics, they can put on a show. Already, the first robins have \nreturned, and birds are warbling their finest arias in between the \nlabors of nest building. The turquoise skies of autumn faded to the \npale aquamarine of winter, but now glow as vibrantly as a star \nsapphire.\n\n     Again rejoicing Nature sees\n     Her robe assume its vernal hues,\n     Her leafy locks wave in the breeze,\n     All freshly steep'd in morning dews.\n\n  So wrote the poet Robert Burns. With all these signals, I do not need \na calendar to tell me that the vernal equinox heralding the official \narrival of spring is at hand.\n  In the rejuvenating warmth of the spring sun, the dot.com die-off no \nlonger looms as threateningly as the extinction of the dinosaurs. It is \npossible to view the stock market correction--I say to my dear friend \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd--with equilibrium, if not with \nenthusiasm. We have made it through another winter, a winter of our \ndiscontent, to paraphrase Shakespeare. The great Bard also said--and \ntruly--``Daffodils, that come before the swallow dares, and take the \nwinds of March with beauty.'' With the daffodils, hope also blossoms.\n\n[[Page S2553]]\n\n  Mr. President, I hope for a spring of millennial proportions--a \nspring of renewed vigor and energy in this nation to tackle the \nchallenges ahead. I hope for new growth in our economy. Over the past \nweeks, the Senate has been debating the budget and tax cuts. It has \nbeen a difficult task, made more so by the lack of detail provided by \nthe administration. The size of the tax cut promise has been clear, but \nthe spending plans to accompany it have been vague. The administration \nis asking us to trade our cow for a handful of magic beans but, unlike \nJack in the fable, I am not so sure that this fairy tale will end well. \nIt may be that the giant comes crashing down on us in the form of large \nfuture deficits. After all, these projected surpluses are based upon \nprojections of economic growth that have not, and may not, materialize.\n  Every good gardener knows, especially in springtime, that garden \nplans made in the glow of a winter's fireside do not always pan out \nwhen faced with the vagaries of late frosts, early droughts, or insect \ninfestations. Indeed, one fierce storm can lay low all of one's efforts \nin a single blow. A wise gardener dreams big but takes care of the \nbasics first. He builds rich soil, clears it, weeds it well, plants \nstrong seedlings, and tends to them carefully. Patience and a long \nviewpoint are the watchwords. On the national economic level, that \nmeans paying down the debt and maintaining the economic infrastructure \nthat is the soil for our current and future economic growth. Just as a \ngarden needs hoses to carry water and flats in which to tend seedlings, \nso the nation needs transportation networks to carry commerce and \nschools in which to nurture and teach our children. Then as prosperity \nblossoms can some blooms be harvested in the form of targeted tax cuts, \nleaving most of the plant intact to set seeds and prepare for the \ncoming winter. But one certainly does not pull up the entire plant at \nthe first sign of fruit! That is short-sighted and imprudent. It leaves \nnothing to carry the family through the winter that will surely come.\n\n  But now, Mr. President, it is springtime and everything feels \npossible. Let us rejoice--my dear friend, Senator McCain, and Senator \nDodd, an equally dear and trusted friend--let us rejoice in the new \ngrowth and in the growing strength of the brightening sun. Let us take \nup with patience the gardener's hoe and weed the row before us. Our \ndiligence and care now will bring us rewards later. Let us savor the \nmoment and rejoice in the first day of spring. Who knows whether we \nshall see another, so let us rejoice in this one. I close with the \nwords of the poet Robert Browning that have always captured for me the \nspirit of this time of year:\n\n     The year's at the Spring,\n     And the day's at the morn;\n     Morning's at seven;\n     The hillside's dew-pearled;\n     The lark's on the wing;\n     The snail's on the thorn:\n     God's in his Heaven--\n     All's right with the world!\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia. In the midst of a debate on campaign finance reform, \nthis was a needed respite from the minutia of fundraising, attempts to \nmodify the present system. His words of eloquence are always welcome in \nthis body but never more so than in the midst of the debate today.\n  I appreciate his quoting of Robert Burns and Browning and Wordsworth, \nbut listening to him describe the arrival of spring and the departure \nof winter is poetic in itself. I can see one day people quoting Robert \nC. Byrd, the poet, when they welcome the spring at some future year.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend for his \noverly gracious comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Byrd for his annual \nadmonition to all of us to conduct ourselves in a way that reflects the \ndignity and comity of this institution and reminds us of the transience \nof all this and the importance of friendships and relationships that \nare established in this very unique organization.\n  There is a time for us to pause and reflect. There is no one in this \nbody who gives us a more enlightening opportunity than the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  So I thank Senator Byrd. And I also admire the vest he is wearing \ntoday as well. I thank the Senator and I will speak on the pending \namendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2553-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2553-S2571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is kind of obvious what the strategy is \nthat is going to be employed here, and that is to sort of love this \nlegislation to death. In other words, let's not leave any stone \nunturned; let's make sure this is a perfect bill, and anything less \nthan that is not acceptable. So let's have a series of amendments, \nwhich I certainly admit are very clever, including this one.\n  I want to point out that this bill says, basically, ``except that the \ncost of such establishment, administration, and solicitation may only \nbe paid from funds that are subject to the limitations.'' In other \nwords, only hard dollars can pay for a political action committee's \nestablishment, administration, and solicitation.\n  Well, Mr. President, we try to help PACs. We try to help political \naction committees because they provide us, generally speaking, with \nsmall donations that are an expression of small individuals' \ninvolvement, as opposed to the so-called soft money, which we are \ntrying to attack. So we have tried to, in the past, make it as easy as \npossible for political action committees to function, rather than make \nit difficult.\n  Also, the Senator from Utah interprets this as some way to put \npressure on to increase hard money limits. Hard money limits will be \ndebated, and I am confident, to some degree, that hard money limits \nwill be raised. But here is the situation: We have a company, a \ncorporation, in Salt Lake City, UT, and it has a PAC. Where is the \noffice of that PAC? Generally speaking, they don't go out and rent a \nbuilding or a home or something. They set up a PAC in one of the \noffices in their building. Usually, the person who administers that \nPAC--it is not their sole job. It is something that they many times do \non a voluntary basis and many times with small compensation for their \ntime, and they are located usually in the building. That is generally \nthe way PACs are administered. So how do you get money for your PAC? \nYou probably put it in the company newsletter, where you say, ``All \nemployees who want to contribute to Acme PAC, please do so,'' and then \nthat money comes in and the individual puts it in their account, et \ncetera.\n  How do you assess the cost of that? Who pays for that? The CEO, \nprobably on an annual basis, calls the senior managers together and \nsays: I want all you guys and women to contribute to our political \naction committee. It is that time of year. We are in an election year \nand we want to support good old Bob Bennett. He has always been a \nfriend of business.\n  What is that worth? How do you assess the cost of that good friend of \nSenator Bennett's soliciting money for his political action committee \nso he can support him? Does a notice of contributions in an internal \nnewsletter have a value? What is the value in a newsletter?\n  What about the electricity costs of the office that houses the PAC of \nthe employee who does it on a part-time basis? Well, what we need, \nobviously, is a new arm of the IRS, or the FEC, or maybe a new \norganization that we could call the ``PAC police,'' who say, aha, you \nspent 2 hours today, and that, at your hourly salary, is so much money, \nand that has to come from hard money donations. Clearly, my friends, \nthis is not an amendment that would have an effect that we could ever \nenforce, that we could ever make a reasonable kind of a thing. \nObviously, it would have some debilitating effects on PACs.\n  The authors of this amendment could not really understand too well \nhow political action committees--particularly the small ones--operate, \nand think somehow that we could assess the costs and then take that out \nof hard money and put it into some kind of payment or payback.\n  So I have to oppose this amendment. I think it is not workable. I \ndon't think it is logical or reasonable to do so. The Senator from Utah \nmentioned the fact that this is soft money and that we are\n\n[[Page S2554]]\n\nbanning all soft money. Well, as the Senator from Utah knows because he \nmentioned that he read the bill, we don't ban soft money in a lot of \nareas such as for State parties, or we don't ban soft money in some \nother areas. But we certainly are banning soft money for the use in \nFederal campaigns.\n  So I have to oppose the amendment. I hope that my colleagues will \nunderstand that this amendment is not an acceptable one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to my good friend and \ncolleague from the State of New York, Mr. Schumer.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nyielding. I thank all of my colleagues--the Senator from Kentucky and \nthe Senator from Connecticut for leading this debate, as well as, of \ncourse, my colleagues from Arizona and Wisconsin for their leadership \non this issue, which is something I believe in, as they do.\n  As we go through this debate on campaign finance reform, I guess \nthere are two ways to look at it. They are the larger picture and the \nsmaller picture--the forest or the trees. When you look at the trees, \nit is awfully difficult to come up with a perfect bill. I think every \none of us has found numerous objections to any proposal that is made. \nNone of them works perfectly. None of them is without flaws. Much of \nwhat we will talk about today and over the next two weeks will be in \ndiscussion of those trees: It will be better to do something this way \nor there is an inequity when ``A'' is put slightly disadvantaged to \n``B.'' I can figure out a scheme that will work for my State better \nthan the present one. Over and over again, we can hear arguments just \nlike that. And because of the fragility of campaign finance reform, \nbecause it has taken so long for it to come here, because it is not \neasy for people to reform themselves, which is basically what we are \ndoing, any one of those arguments, those trees, could end up ruining \nthe whole forest.\n  The other way to look at this is as a forest, Mr. President. Our \nsystem is simply a mess. I say this to my colleagues on my side of the \naisle particularly but to everybody here as well: We believe in \nGovernment. We don't believe Government is an enemy. We believe \nGovernment is something to do good, to improve the lives of people. We \nbelieve it is basically a necessity. And this system of finance so \nerodes confidence in this Government that we have all dedicated our \nlives to seeing that something has to change.\n  The forest is the right argument here--looking from 10,000 feet at \nthe landscape is far more important than looking from 100 feet above \nthe landscape on this issue. It may not be true of all issues, but it \nis true of this one. So if I had a plea to make to my colleagues, who I \nknow are torn on this bill, who I know are ambivalent about whether \nthis provision or that provision not only affects them--those who write \nand say, well, they are just interested in their own survival, \nhegemony, that is really not fair because we all live with this system. \nWe all have ideas about it, like a carpenter would have better ideas \nabout how to carve a chair, or a doctor might come and tell us how to \ndesign a better medical system. I say to my colleagues who do care \nabout this Government, and we have devoted our lives to it, that if \nthere were a watchword for this debate, it would be a simple one: Do \nnot let the perfect be the enemy of the good because if there was ever \na place where the perfect or the desire to attain perfection could kill \nthe good that would come about, it is in campaign finance reform. That \nis what we have seen over and over.\n\n  I know there are some, such as my colleague, my friend from Kentucky, \nwho are just opposed to this bill in broad concept. He believes it \nviolates the first amendment, and he has put his money where his mouth \nis and his courage in supporting the amendment against burning of the \nflag. So I do not begrudge his point of view; I disagree with it. We \nare not going to win him over.\n  The worry I have is with many of my colleagues who are unsure, who \nlook at one imperfection or another in this bill and let it be, let \nthose imperfections prevent us from moving forward at all, as move \nforward we must.\n  When the Founding Fathers put together our Government and when you \nread the Federalist Papers and some of the commentaries, the thing they \nprobably worried more about than anything else, even more than the \noverarching power of a central government, was the apathy of the \ncitizens, the lack of involvement by the citizens. They wondered if \npeople would put themselves forward for public office, and they \nwondered if people would participate in a government where they had \ncontrol.\n  For quite a while, in the flush of democracy and with so many of the \nearly issues, those worries subsided, but since World War II, they have \ncome back at us larger than ever in the history of our country.\n  The percentage of people who vote, the percentage of people who \nregard the Government with only cynicism, the percentage of people who \nbelieve they do not have any power, even the brief antidote of the \nFlorida election has not stemmed that tide.\n  One of the main reasons people have that apathy, that cynicism which \nis so corrosive to democracy, is the way we finance our campaigns. They \nknow they cannot write out large checks, and they believe, rightly or \nwrongly, that those who can have far more weight than they do. I think \nmost of us in this body have to say certainly that appearance is there, \neven for those who do not agree that the reality is there.\n  We are here really not just to fix a system, not just to tinker and \nsay we can make it a little better here, a little better there, not \njust to smooth off the surface; we are here in an attempt to revitalize \nour sacred democracy.\n  I say to my colleagues, that is what is at stake, no less. If we pass \nup the opportunity to pass a bill, if each of us has to have his or her \nown way and say, I want it my way or no way, we are not just changing \nthe balance of power between the parties or how this candidate or that \ncandidate might run in a new election. We are passing up an opportunity \nto stem the tide of negativity toward our Government which at least, it \nseems to me, is probably the greatest problem this Government faces as \nwe move into the 21st century.\n  I urge my colleagues to summon forth and see the big picture. I urge \nmy colleagues to not get mired in every single detail because there is \nno perfect system. There is certainly no perfect system with Buckley v. \nValeo as the supreme law of the land, and there is probably no perfect \nsystem without Buckley v. Valeo as well. We are not going to \nachieve perfection, and none of us is going to be 100 percent or even \n90 percent happy with the bill, but the alternative, which is we do \nnothing--this is our last chance, that is for sure--the alternative of \ndoing nothing and allowing the mistrust to continue, the alternative of \nthrowing up our hands, which is what the public will think, in deadlock \nand not reforming is too great a danger and too foreboding to the \nRepublic to entertain.\n\n  I urge my colleagues, again, to keep their eye on the ball, keep \ntheir eye on the big picture, keep their eye on the problem we face and \nmake sure we pass McCain-Feingold because it is so important to \nrejuvenating the democracy we have.\n  There is one final point I will make on an issue I will be speaking a \nlot about the following week, which is the Hagel amendment and soft \nmoney.\n  I have seen, during the brief time I have run for higher office, how \ndramatically this has changed, not only the amount of soft money but \nthe restrictions on soft money. It is such that in the 2000 elections, \none could do virtually the same thing with soft money as one could with \nhard money. Yes, there may be a little sentence put in the commercial \nthat says, ``Call up so and so,'' or even some words that are put at \nthe bottom of the ad that can hardly be seen, but the bottom line is \nthat the ability to spend soft money on virtually everything has made a \nmockery of the original law we passed in the seventies.\n  The Hagel amendment, which will allow lots of soft money to continue \nto cascade into our system, is, in my judgment, a killer amendment. It \nis a killer amendment not simply because of what it means for McCain-\nFeingold in terms of how many votes it has, but it is a killer \namendment in the sense that the whole idea behind McCain-\n\n[[Page S2555]]\n\nFeingold--which is to limit the influence of large contributions--would \nbe thrown out the window.\n  When it comes to the Hagel amendment--and he is a good friend of mine \nand I respect completely his sincerity in offering this amendment--but \nwhen it comes to the Hagel amendment, we would end up being a little \nbit pregnant and that just does not work.\n  I thank my colleagues for their efforts. I say to my friend from \nWisconsin, he has done a marvelous job on our side. I say to, again, my \nfriend from Connecticut that he, too, has led the early hours of this \ndebate extremely well and extremely fairly, and that also goes for the \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  I hope in this body we can debate the issue as seriously as we can, \nand then my sincere hope is that at the end of the day, we emerge with \nthe same basic bill that the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nWisconsin introduced.\n  I yield back whatever time remains to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York. His \ncomments are among the most important comments that have been made so \nfar in this debate and, frankly, on any other debate we have had on \ncampaign finance reform in the last 6 years. That is because he has \nidentified the real issue.\n  When the Senator from New York was in the other body, he was part of \nthe solution there. He was part of the effort to get through a similar \nbill in the House where people did see the forest for the trees, \nexactly the point the Senator from New York is making.\n  There are so many amendments that are attractive to us, including \nmany provisions that Senator McCain and I have offered in the past, \nhaving to do with free television time, having to do with other \nimprovements in the system that many of us would like to see. We have \nto keep our eye on the ball, as the Senator from New York has \nsuggested. I don't know if he is a Mets or Yankees fan.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yankees.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yankees.\n  Keeping the eye on the ball is the final goal and the central issue. \nI am grateful after all these years of the frustrating process of \ncoming to the floor and having a few speeches and a cloture vote and \nhaving to shut it down, we can have a Senator from New York talk about \nsomething real, about a process that can have an end and actually work. \nIt will require the kind of unity and discipline of reformers on both \nsides of the aisle that has been demonstrated in the other body on a \nnumber of occasions.\n  My hat is off to the Senator from New York, but also the reformers in \nthe other body, particularly Representatives Shays and Meehan, who have \nshown the way. Now it is up to the Senate to do what the Senator from \nNew York suggested. There will be attractive amendments on aspects of \npublic financing which I would like to see that could upset the balance \nwe have. There will be poison pill amendments to try to embarrass one \nparticular series of interests such as unions, to try to kill the bill, \nand then there will be so-called alternatives, as the Senator from New \nYork has suggested--in particular, the Hagel alternative offered by a \ncolleague we all respect--which is, in fact, worse for the current \nsystem because it will put the stamp of approval on the soft money \nsystem once and for all.\n  I think the Senator from New York is right. I don't think we will \never be able to change it if we adopt that kind of amendment. I am \ngrateful to him for his work in the House, especially grateful to him \nfor his work with a small group of Members who have been working on \nthis for over a year, and particularly grateful for his leadership that \nhas started today and will continue through this process of pointing \nout that the Hagel alternative is, frankly, worse than no bill at all. \nMy thanks, again, to the Senator from New York for his leadership and \nhis commitment to this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to the Senator from \nNew York and will respond in a moment. We are on my amendment so I \nwould like to talk about the details of my amendment. Before I do, the \nSenator from Arizona gave an example of volunteer activity, all of \nwhich is currently exempted under Federal law and which would continue \nto be exempted under Federal law.\n  My amendment goes to organizations such as those we have all seen in \nthe field where there are a number of paid employees devoted full time \nto PAC activities, occupying dedicated facilities that can be easily \nidentified, running up travel expenses that are clearly billed to that \nactivity. There would be no difficulty on the part of the cost \naccountant, be it in a union or a corporation, to identify that kind of \nPAC activity. There is no question that the sort of informal activity \nof people talking in the workforce, saying they want to support Senator \nBennett or Senator McCain, does go on, is voluntary, is completely \nexempted from all law now, and would continue to be exempted. My \namendment would not apply to that.\n  I also point out McCain-Feingold has some of the same aspects of how \nto anticipate time because, as currently drafted, in Federal election \nyears, McCain-Feingold requires State, district, and local parties to \nuse 100-percent federally regulated hard dollars for the entire salary \nof any State, district, or local party committee employees who spend 25 \npercent or more of his or her time in a single month in any of the \nabove-mentioned Federal election activities. If it will be difficult, \nas the Senator from Arizona described, to figure out what constitutes \nvolunteer activity on behalf of a PAC and what constitutes activity \nthat should be reimbursed out of the hard dollar profits of the PAC, it \nwill be equally difficult, if not more so, for some Federal official to \ndetermine what constitutes 25 percent or more of an individual's time \nin a single month on a particular Federal activity. There will be \nhairsplitting in that regard that will go further than the \nhairsplitting to which the Senator from Arizona objected as he made his \ncomments about my amendment.\n\n  Let me respond in a different way to the comments of the Senator from \nNew York when he said we should look at the forest. I agree with him \nabsolutely. We should look at the forest. I have tried to do that in \nall of my activity with respect to campaign finance reform since I \nfirst came here in 1993.\n  The forest I look at, that must be preserved and protected--indeed, \nthat which I have taken an oath to preserve and protect--is the \nConstitution of the United States. I do not want to be part of a \nCongress that dilutes the freedoms that are outlined in the \nConstitution of the United States and, specifically, the first \namendment thereto.\n  We are in the 250th anniversary of the birth of James Madison, little \nJimmy, as he was called by his contemporaries, because he was short. \nThat seemed to be the kind of nickname that stuck with him. I make this \ninteresting point about Madison before I go on. This comes from an \narticle on money and politics that was printed in the Wilson Quarterly \nin the summer of 1797. Reference has been made to the Founding Fathers. \nThe Founding Fathers were geniuses, the Founding Fathers gave us an \nincredible legacy, but the Founding Fathers were also very practical \npoliticians or they wouldn't have been in the positions where they \nwere.\n  Quoting from the Wilson Quarterly:\n\n       George Washington spent about 25 pounds apiece on two \n     elections for the House of Burgesses, 39 pounds on another, \n     and nearly 50 pounds on a fourth, which was many times the \n     going price for a house or a plot of land.\n\n  Going back to the debate we had with the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, George Washington was a wealthy man, trying to buy his \nelection, if we use today's rhetoric.\n  Washington's electioneering expenses included the usual rum punch, \ncookies and ginger cakes, money for the poll watcher who record the \nvotes, and even one election eve ball, complete with fiddler.\n  Now it talks about James Madison and money:\n\n       James Madison considered the ``corrupting influence of \n     spiritous liquors and other treats'' ``inconsistent with the \n     purity of moral and Republican principles.'' But Virginians, \n     the future president discovered, did not want ``a more chaste \n     mode of conducting elections.'' Putting him down as prideful \n     and cheap, the voters rejected his candidacy for the Virginia \n     House of Delegates in 1777.\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\n      Leaders were supposed to be generous gentlemen.\n\n  Madison's attempt at purity, though futile, signified the changing \nideological climate. Madison obviously learned elections cost money, \neven in the days of the Founding Fathers.\n  The one thing that Madison guaranteed would happen in every election \nwas that there would be complete freedom of expression at every place \nand at every point.\n  Since this is the 250th anniversary of Madison's birth, may I, with \nthe suspension of belief, resurrect James Madison and place him in the \ngallery, if you will, in the press gallery, because James Madison has a \nhistory of being an author and a journalist, being the author of much \nof the Federalist Papers. Let us have Madison up there, listening to \nthis debate. Now, he would turn to one of his friends in the press \ngallery to have him explain terms that would be unfamiliar to him. He \nwould say: What is hard money? What is soft money? What is the \ndifference?\n  What is it used for? He would have explained too much hard money is \nthis and soft money is that. He might have a little trouble \nunderstanding the difference because he would say: Wait a minute. In \nthe first amendment that I authored you were free to speak in whatever \nway you wanted. You could be like Washington and buy rum punch and \nginger cakes, if that is what it took to get the voters to listen to \nyou; or you could run an ad. You could print a pamphlet. That is what \nHamilton and Jay and I did. We went out and raised money and printed \nour own pamphlets and circulated them. Maybe you have seen them.\n  Madison's friend up there in the press gallery might say: Yes, I have \nseen them.\n  We call them the Federalist Papers today. But we must remember that \nwhen they were written, they cost money. Madison could not have spoken \nif he had not raised and spent some money. Money was speech all the way \nback in James Madison's time.\n  As James Madison sits there in the gallery, and he hears the details \nof McCain-Feingold, James Madison says: Wait a minute. You are telling \nme that there will be limits on how Americans can participate in the \npolitical process?\n  Yes. There will be limits.\n  James Madison asks: Who is in charge of this outrageous idea?\n  You see the handsome young fellow from Madison, named after you, from \nWisconsin, his name is Russ Feingold. He has been pushing for this.\n  James Madison says: I must do something about this. I must express my \nopinion with respect to Senator Feingold.\n  He snaps a finger and gets his partner, Alexander Hamilton, to join \nhim.\n  He says: Alexander, look what is happening. There is that fellow down \nthere from Wisconsin. He comes from a town named after me. He is trying \nto limit Americans' ability to speak in politics. What do we do about \nit?\n  Alexander Hamilton says: You do whatever you always do when you want \nto make a statement. You write a letter to the New York Times.\n  James Madison says: Great, Alexander, let's do that.\n  Alexander Hamilton and James Madison sit down and write a letter to \nthe New York Times protesting the activities of Senator Feingold.\n  The editor of the New York Times says: We are not going to run it.\n  Madison says: Well, Alexander, you certainly lost your cachet. There \nwas a time when anything you said in New York automatically was run in \nany newspaper. What do we do?\n  Alexander Hamilton says: Well, we are going to have to buy an ad in \nthe New York Times. That way they cannot censor our speech. Money is \nrequired. How much money do you have, little Jimmy?\n  Madison puts his hands in his pocket, and he pulls out whatever money \nhe brought with him from the 18th century. And he says: Ready cash, I \nhave $7.23. How about you, Alexander?\n  Alexander Hamilton says: Don't get into the issue of money. I don't \nwant to talk about the blackmail payments I have been making. It is a \nvery sore political point. I can't help you. But maybe the amount of \nmoney you have will do the job.\n  So they call the New York Times and say: How much is the full page ad \nin the New York Times?\n  The New York Times says $104,000.\n  I have $7.23. I can't speak unless I raise some money. Who do we know \nthat knows how to raise money?\n  Snap of the finger and Benjamin Franklin appears.\n  Benjamin, you were one of America's good businessmen. He said: Yes. \nAnd I put mine in a CD that has been accumulating interest ever since I \ndied in the 1700s, and I have enough for an ad in the New York Times. \nBut let me be practical with you. Not only am I a practical \nbusinessman, but I recognize that most of the people in Madison, WI, \ndon't read the New York Times. That is going to come as a great shock \nto you, Alexander Hamilton. You think the whole world reads the \nnewspapers in New York. The fact is, if we are going to have an \ninfluence by running our ad, we are going to do it in Madison, WI.\n  They contact the Madison, WI, paper, and find out that the cost of a \nfull-page ad is 10 percent of the cost of the New York Times; $14,000 \non a Sunday gets you a full-page ad in the newspaper in Madison, WI.\n  Let's do it.\n  But while they are debating, while they are doing this-- again we are \ncompressing time--McCain-Feingold passes and is the law of the land, \nand it is within 60 days of the election of the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and Benjamin Franklin walk into \nthe newspaper and say: We want to buy an ad urging people to vote \nagainst Senator Feingold.\n  The editor of the newspaper says: In the name of campaign finance \nreform, we will not permit you to buy that ad. We will not permit you \nto express your opinion about Senator Feingold or any other candidate. \nWe will forbid you from speaking.\n  As they turn to walk from the editor's office, with Madison and \nHamilton disconsolate about the fact they cannot speak their mind, \nBenjamin Franklin says: I can fix it.\n  How can you fix it, Benjamin? He says: I told you I put my money in a \nCD, and it has been accumulating interest ever since the 1700s. I have \nenough to buy the newspaper. I don't have to buy the ad. I have enough \nto buy the paper. Once we own the paper, then we will have unlimited \nfree political speech because, you see, the impact of McCain-Feingold \nmeans the people who have the most speech are the people who truly have \nthe most money--the people who own the newspapers, the people who own \nthe television station, and people named Turner who own networks. They \nhave complete freedom of speech because they have enough money. And it \nhas taken almost 250 years for me to accumulate enough. But I, Benjamin \nFranklin, have enough that I can buy their newspaper. And then I can \nrun an editorial attacking Senator Feingold every day of the week, if I \nso choose.\n  At that point, there are absolutely no limits on any speech. But you, \nJames Madison and Alexander Hamilton, there are limits on your speech \nplaced there by McCain-Feingold saying that there will be no political \nspeech from you during the 60 days before the election.\n  We come back to reality. James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and \nBenjamin Franklin are not available as witnesses in this particular \ndebate, even though I called them up rhetorically. But I am moved to do \nthat by the comment of the Senator from New York who says we must look \nat the forest and we must protect the big picture. The big picture, as \nwe are debating McCain-Feingold, has to do with freedom of speech. It \nhas to do with robust debate of the American economy. It does not have \nto do with getting money out of politics because the reality in the big \npicture is that we never have had money out of politics, starting with \nGeorge Washington and his rum punch and his ginger cakes. And we never \nwill have money out of politics. Somebody will find a way to do it.\n  I am a cosponsor with Senator Allen who has offered the Virginia \nPlan. I am not sure it is going to be offered on this floor. But it is \noffered in the arena of public opinion. I hope it gets offered.\n  Historians will recognize that the Virginia Plan was James Madison's \nplan for the Constitution.\n  What is the Virginia Plan for campaign finance reform? Two sentences.\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\n The first one, worthy of James Madison, says: No American, any \nprovision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, shall be prohibited \nfrom expressing himself or herself in any way in any arena or any \ncontribution to any party or any candidate.\n  That sounds like first amendment language to me. That sounds like \nJames Madison language about which he would be very comfortable.\n  Then the second one, recognizing where we are in technology, says--I \nam not quoting the legal language, just the effect of it--every one of \nthose donations will be in the modern world disclosed, using the \ntechnology that is available to us.\n  This means in all probability, 48 hours, and it is on the Internet \nfor everybody to see. Forty-eight hours, and electronically the \ncontribution is there. That is the Virginia plan.\n\n  When I discuss this with people outside the Senate, they all say: \nGee, that makes a lot of sense. Why don't you start voluntarily \ndisclosing within 48 hours right now? If you are such a great campaign \nfinance reformer, why don't you do that immediately?\n  I say: You know, there was one candidate for President who did that.\n  It is a very interesting thing to do. I recommend it to all of you in \nyour town meetings.\n  I say: There was one candidate for President who did, in fact, \ndisclose every one of his donors within 48 hours.\n  Question: Do you know who it was?\n  I did this to a group of political science students the other day.\n  The first answer I got back was Ralph Nader.\n  I said: No, Ralph Nader did not do it.\n  Then someone answered: Well then, was it John McCain?\n  I said: No, it was not John McCain.\n  Then someone answered: Gee, Al Gore?\n  I said: No. The candidate who did it is now sitting in the White \nHouse. His name is George W. Bush. He got little or no credit for doing \nit from those who sit in the press gallery because they do not want to \nadmit that he was on to a good idea--in my opinion, a better idea than \nthe bill we are debating.\n  None of this has had anything to do with my amendment, and I \nrecognize that. But none of the debate on the other side has had \nanything to do with my amendment either. And, if I may, if the Senator \nfrom West Virginia can talk about spring, I hope the Senator from Utah \ncan talk about the Constitution.\n  I remain ready to answer any questions about my amendment or respond \nto anything about my amendment. But, so far, there has been little or \nno debate about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Does the Senator from Utah yield the floor?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I congratulate the Senator from Utah for a brilliant \ndiscourse on the importance of the first amendment through the course \nof the debate and in all of our discussions on campaign finance reform. \nHe has made it so clear and understandable for all of our Members. I \ncongratulate him for his contribution.\n  With regard to his amendment, I am told we will be prepared on both \nsides to vote at 4 o'clock. I will enter that consent in a moment.\n  But let me say, with regard the Senator Bennett's amendment----\n  Mr. REID. Why don't we do that consent request now?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote on \nthe Bennett amendment occur at 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. A vote on or in relation to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my understanding, talking to the Senator from \nNevada, it was going to be an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. REID. I do not know of anyone who wishes otherwise. I think it \nwill be an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL: On or in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the only request I have is \nSenator Feingold wants 5 minutes and Senator Levin wants 5 minutes and \nSenator Dodd needs 5 minutes. The time will be a little uneven, but if \nthe Senator will agree to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say, having been involved in \nthis debate over the years, I have frequently heard the words, ``Don't \nlet the perfect be the enemy of the good.'' My friend from Utah recalls \nthat we hear that from time to time.\n  I have taken a look at when that comes up, ``Don't let the perfect be \nthe enemy of the good,'' and every single time those words come up--\n``don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good''--is in relation to \nan amendment that might have some impact on organized labor--some \nimpact.\n  I have watched this carefully now for some 10 or 12 years, and every \ntime the words ``Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good'' are \nexpressed, it is because there is an amendment pending that might have \nsome impact--ever so tiny--on organized labor.\n  Now, the Bennett amendment is very evenhanded. It is not targeted at \norganized labor, by any means?\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is that correct? I ask the Senator from Utah, this is \nnot an amendment targeted at the heart of organized labor?\n  Mr. BENNETT. The amendment deals with activities on the part of \ncorporations every bit as much as on the part of labor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Utah.\n  So this is not about organized labor. It is about how you raise money \nfor political action committees.\n  It has been said on the floor of the Senate that a political action \ncommittee cannot get started without expenditures of soft money. We all \nknow that is not true. There are a number of leadership PACs formed by \nMembers of the Senate and the House. We do not spend soft money to get \nthose leadership PACs up and running. You get a few hard money checks. \nYou file with the FEC. You get a few hard money checks and you are up \nand running.\n  Believe me, it is possible to start a PAC without the expenditure of \nsoft money, I say to my friend from Utah. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have never started a leadership PAC \nbecause I have never been in a leadership position. But I understand \nthat it is, indeed, easy to do; and it is done only with hard money. \nThere does not seem to be any difficulty in keeping track of who is \nvolunteering and who is being paid.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  So this is really an amendment that is quite simple. The principle of \nthe underlying bill, which I, as the Senator from Utah, do not support, \nis that Federal elections should be conducted in Federal money, hard \ndollars. And in pursuit of that principle, McCain-Feingold requires the \nnational political parties to operate in 100 percent Federal dollars, \nso-called hard dollars--100 percent.\n  And in even numbered years, it essentially requires all the State and \nlocal parties in our country to operate, similarly, in Federal hard \ndollars.\n  So in the name of fairness, we ask the question, Why should labor and \nbusiness be allowed to, in effect, subsidize their hard dollar \nactivities, which are their political action committees--100 percent \ndollars--and why should they be allowed to subsidize the raising of \ntheir hard dollars when America's political parties can't do it, and \nwhen America's State and local parties can't do it in even numbered \nyears? Where is the fairness?\n  If the idea is that Federal elections should be conducted in Federal \ndollars, why is that principle only going to be applied to the Nation's \npolitical parties?\n  The Bennett amendment is quite simple. It is easily understood. For \nthose who believe soft money is a pernicious thing undermining our \ndemocracy, then why should they think it would only be pernicious when \nraised and spent by political parties but perfectly OK when raised and \nspent by labor and business?\n  That is the heart of this amendment. That is what this vote will be \nall about. We will have that vote at 4 o'clock. I think that pretty \nwell adequately describes our side of this amendment.\n  I will be happy now to yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend and colleague \nfrom Michigan.\n\n[[Page S2558]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I very much oppose this amendment. The \nSupreme Court has told us over and over again that the standard for \ncontribution limits that is constitutional is the appearance of \ncorruption, the appearance of impropriety, and the appearance of undue \ninfluence, that large contributions or the solicitation of large \ncontributions can create.\n  There is no such appearance problem with these expenditures. In fact, \nthe expenditures which the Senator from Utah would require to be paid \nfor out of hard dollars has explicitly been excluded from that \nrequirement by law since 1974. So since 1974, the statute under which \nwe have all operated has excluded:\n\n       . . . the establishment, administration, and solicitation \n     of contributions to a separate segregated fund to be utilized \n     for political purposes by a corporation, labor organization, \n     membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without \n     capital stock.\n\n  The administrative expenses, the establishment expenses, and the \nsolicitation of contributions to a PAC have not been considered to be \nlimited by the hard money restrictions of law since 1974.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could finish my remarks.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Just a quick question: Isn't that precisely the point? \nThat is precisely the point of the Bennett amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is exactly the point of the Bennett amendment: to \nrepeal a law which has been in place since 1974 and has created no \nharm. Sometimes we say around here that the cure is worse than the \ndisease. This is a cure looking for a disease. There is no disease here \nthat has been shown.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could continue, this is just an effort being made to \ntry to say: Oh, you guys over there who are trying to ban soft money, \nyou are not being perfectly consistent because, look, you allow the \nestablishment, administration, and solicitation of contributions to a \nPAC to be paid for out of treasury dollars. You are not being totally \nconsistent.\n  The answer to that is, wait a minute, the law of 1974 also says that \ncommunications by a corporation to its stockholders and executive \nadministrative personnel and their families or by a labor organization \nto its members and their families on any subject, that is not subject \neither.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will in a couple of moments.\n  Here we have a cure looking for a problem. There has been no problem \non this. There is no practical way to keep track of these expenses, no \npractical way to do this. A corporation sends out a newsletter to its \nstockholders or to its executives saying: Which of the candidates out \nthere should our PAC contribute to? Now someone has to sit and figure \nout: What is the cost of printing that newsletter; what page is that \nnotice on; is that on page 1 where it has the biggest impact or on page \n4 of the newsletter; what part of the postage of that newsletter goes \nto that issue; how much of the time of the secretary who took the \nminutes of that meeting where we discussed that issue can be attributed \nto that request.\n  You have a bookkeeping nightmare that you are creating for no \nproblem. There is no problem, that I know of, that has been shown over \nthese almost 30 years. Yet in order to try to show some kind of a flaw, \nlooking desperately for a flaw in the ban on soft money, the proponents \nof this amendment say: Aha, you are not being consistent.\n  Well, we are being consistent because in the case of banning soft \nmoney, there is a disease that needs a cure--unlimited contributions to \npolitical campaigns that are being accomplished through soft money.\n  The Supreme Court said: We can prohibit that constitutionally. That \nis what the Supreme Court has said.\n  I don't know of any evidence that this particular provision in law, \nwhich has been in place for 26 years now, has created a problem. I say \nto my good friend from Utah, this amendment is not needed. It has not \nbeen shown to address a problem in the law. It will create a \nbookkeeping nightmare to try to in any way comply. It will put people \ninto an illegal netherworld for no good reason that has been \ndemonstrated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The appearance of impropriety, the appearance of \ncorruption, which is the only basis on which we can act as a \njustification for limiting contributions of a large size to candidates, \nthat justification does not exist here with corporate or union treasury \nmoney being spent to administer a PAC.\n  I urge that we either table this amendment or defeat this amendment. \nI am sorry my friend from Kentucky did not have a chance to ask me the \nadditional question. I would be happy to try to answer it, if our good \nfriend from Connecticut wants to yield the time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I think our colleagues have covered this. I \nthink we can get to a vote fairly quickly. As my friend from Utah \nknows, I think of myself as the third Senator from Utah. I am not sure \nUtah thinks of me as its third Senator, but he and I have a wonderful \nrelationship and have worked so closely together over the years that I \nam not comfortable disagreeing with him on his amendment. I admire him \nimmensely.\n  In addition to what my colleague from Michigan has said about the \n1974 law, there is also a restriction in the 1974 law which doesn't \npertain to any other kind of activity that has otherwise been \ndescribed. Under the 1974 act, unions, corporations and membership \norganizations can only solicit their own members and stockholders, \nunlike other organizations which can solicit from the universe within \nthe country. Under the 1974 act, as you are establishing your PAC, you \ncan only get the support from your own organization's membership. That \nis a significant restriction which applies to them which does not apply \nto others.\n  In addition, there is this balance that was written into the law in \n1974, as the Senator from Michigan properly points out, where there has \nnot been any identifiable abuse of this exception in the law whatsoever \nhere.\n  Secondly, because of the universe to which they are restricted in \nsoliciting dollars, they then have allowed, in a sense, their general \ntreasuries to be used in order to communicate with their restricted \nclass and membership--not with people outside of that restricted class \nmembership but with their own membership. Were they communicating to \nthe universe at large, then I think the point the Senator from Utah has \nraised would be appropriate. But when you are restricting, under the \n1974 act, the audience to which they can communicate, it seems to me \nthis balance is appropriate, narrowly tailored and proper. To disrupt \nthat now would be a mistake.\n  The point the Senator from Arizona made is also worth repeating; that \nis, this is awfully difficult. One of the things we don't want to do is \ncreate situations which make people potential targets of indictment. \nThis gets pretty amorphous, as to what constitutes an expenditure of \nsoft dollars in order to solicit hard dollars for your PAC.\n  Again, the Senator from Michigan and others have made this point. \nWhen you get into this area in trying to identify how much has been \ncommitted or whether or not it was committed at all, a simple address \nby the CEO or the president of a local to the membership of that \ncommunity--how would you put a value on that? Your inability to do so \nor to provide a proper accounting of it exposes you then to the \npotential of indictment. I don't think anyone in our interests here \nshould try to necessarily do that. It is so difficult to write that \ninto law, even when the law has only civil jurisdiction.\n  I urge a rejection of the amendment. A communication which is \nspecifically protected by the Constitution and recognized by Buckley, \nwhere it is involved in a significant balance between the ability to \ncommunicate with your restricted class or membership and only that \ngroup, then the resources of that organization to do so are appropriate \nand proper. To upset that balance would be a mistake.\n  The law has worked well for 26 years. We ought not to change it at \nthis\n\n[[Page S2559]]\n\npoint. For those reasons, I respectfully urge our colleagues to vote \nagainst the amendment.\n  I yield whatever time my colleague from Wisconsin so desires.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I \nthank the Senator from Michigan especially for his excellent remarks on \nthis amendment, and also the Senator from Arizona. We are united in our \nopposition to it. I, too, as the Senator from Connecticut, find it a \nlittle bit unpleasant to oppose the Senator from Utah. We have \nthoroughly enjoyed working together and share quite an affection for \nhis beautiful State and appreciate those opportunities. On this one, we \nreally have to call this amendment what it is. It is simply another \nattempt to change the subject.\n  Somehow it doesn't trouble the Senator from Utah or the Senator from \nKentucky that soft money to the parties was $82 million in 1992, $260-\nsome million in 1996, and is now approaching $500 million in the year \n2000. That doesn't bother them. That is just fine. What does bother \nthem is somehow trying to undo a reasonable balance that was created \nback in 1974 in the law at the time after Watergate and in the Buckley \ndecision.\n  The problem is not PACs. The problem isn't how PACs raise their hard \nmoney contributions. We used to think PACs were the problem. I hope the \nAmerican people now realize that PACs are limited to giving $10,000. We \nused to think that was a lot of money. Unfortunately, given this insane \nsoft money system, it is starting to look as if it is spare change. But \nthat is what the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Utah want \nto change the subject to: Worrying about how union members and perhaps \ncorporate entities get their people together and spend a little money \nin order to raise the modest amounts that can be contributed through \nPACs. It is a blatant attempt to change the subject.\n  It does not relate at all to the real abuse in the system, the \nhorrible situation where huge contributions on the very day that votes \nare made are given to the political parties, and then legislation \npasses creating an appearance of impropriety or corruption that is very \ndisturbing to the American people.\n  To reiterate, the 1974 act that created PACs had an explicit \ntradeoff. Separate segregated funds that are connected with the union \nor corporation can use their treasury funds for their administrative \ncosts, but they can solicit only their members or executive and \nadministrative personnel for contributions. On the other hand, \nnonconnected PACs must use their PAC money for the costs of \nadministration, but they can solicit the general public. That was the \ntradeoff.\n  That was the balance to which the Senator from Connecticut referred. \nAs he said, this amendment would disturb the balance. That tradeoff has \nbeen a part of the law for 25 years. It is not a loophole. It is not a \ncesspool of soft money. It is working. It may not be perfect, but it is \nthe very thing that, along with other things, survived after the \nBuckley case. We have a fairly decent, but not perfect, system of \ncampaign financing in this country. That is what is falling apart.\n  There is also a constitutional dimension to this amendment. The law \nallows corporations and unions to communicate with their members when a \nunion or a corporation solicits members for a PAC contribution. That \nsolicitation is a communication. We cannot interfere with that \ncommunication without running afoul of the first amendment. I would \nthink, given the frequent speeches by the Senator from Kentucky on the \nfirst amendment, that would concern him as well.\n  Let me say that I, as well as my lead author, Senator McCain from \nArizona, oppose this amendment. It may be particularly targeted at \nunions because they have less money and may be perceived that way. As \nthe so-called paycheck protection amendment, this is an attempt to \ncripple a labor union. It is a poison pill amendment targeted at labor \nunions and perhaps at corporate PACs, as well, and is not reform.\n  Corporate labor PACs have been permitted to use treasury funds for \ntheir administrative costs since the passage of the 1974 act. As the \nSenator from Michigan said so well, there has been no showing of abuse \nof this narrow exception--the prohibition of corporate and union \nspending of treasury funds in Federal elections--and yet these two \nSenators have virtually nothing to say about the enormous abuse of the \ngaping loophole of soft money that has destroyed the reforms after the \nWatergate era. All those supporting McCain-Feingold should strongly \noppose the Bennett amendment. We strongly oppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I had not realized, until I heard from \nmy friend from Michigan, that the Federal Election Campaign Act was so \nsacrosanct that it should not be changed. If that is the case, I don't \nknow why we are here at all because the whole purpose of the McCain-\nFeingold bill is to change the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974.\n  Further, it is suggested that this is not an abuse. Well, what we do \nknow is that organized labor spends essentially no hard dollars at all \nraising hard dollars for their PACs. Now, as a defender of soft money, \nI must tell you I am not troubled by that in principle any more than I \nam troubled in principle by the political parties having nonfederal \nmoney. It has been suggested on the other side that this would be an \ninconvenience for organized labor or corporations. What about \ninconveniencing the parties--by taking away 40 percent of the budget of \nthe Republican National Committee and the Democratic National \nCommittee, and 35 percent of the Republican Senatorial Committee and \nthe Democratic Senatorial Committee, and federalizing State and local \nparties for even-numbered years? What about the inconvenience to them? \nWhy is it only political parties that it is OK to inconvenience and no \none else?\n  I repeat, every time you hear the argument, ``don't let the perfect \nbe the enemy of the good,'' you can be sure the subject being debated \non the Senate floor at that time is an amendment that might have some \nimpact on organized labor. Virtually every time you hear the words \n``poison pill,'' you can be assured the subject matter we are debating \nat that time will be an amendment that might have some impact on \norganized labor.\n\n  The reform industry, led by the New York Times and the Washington \nPost, has been allowed to get away with defining what reform is. In \nfact, reform is what the New York Times and the Washington Post and \nCommon Cause say it is, and everything else is a poison pill.\n  Now, the underlying bill is designed to reduce the effectiveness of \nAmerica's great political parties--the one entity that will always be \nthere for a challenger. Here Senator Bennett is just trying to say, \nlook, let's have a level playing field. If the parties are going to \nhave to operate in 100 percent hard dollars, why not the unions and the \ncorporations? Why not? Why not, I ask? What is so pernicious about the \ninfluence of Federal, State, and local parties that their resources \nhave to be taken away, their voices lowered, their efforts inhibited, \nand no one else?\n  This is not a ``level playing field,'' as often is said by the other \nside. I have heard the argument over the years that we need to have a \nlevel playing field. If hard dollars are to exclusively be the future \nof the parties, why not for business and labor?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Michigan said this is a solution \nlooking for a problem, that there has been no abuse of this in the \npast. I was interested and pleased to hear the Senator from Wisconsin \nsay we used to say PACs were a problem. I remember when the Senator \nfrom Kentucky and I were lonely voices here defending PACs as being a \nlegitimate thing in the face of those who were attacking it in the name \nof campaign finance reform. So at least that debate is over and now \nPACs are good.\n  To the point the Senator from Michigan raised, would the Senator \nthink this exception--I will call it an exception--could, in fact, \nbecome a major loophole in the future if McCain-Feingold passes, and \nthat some clever lawyers could sit down and figure out a way to create \nsomething that came under this exemption that could raise\n\n[[Page S2560]]\n\nsignificant amounts of hard dollars, funding them with soft dollars \nthat are totally undisclosed, unlike the other soft dollars to which \nthey object--soft dollars that would be totally undisclosed, finding a \nway to turn this into the next monster that we hear about in campaign \nfinance reform debates 5 to 10 years from now?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend, he described the situation today. \nThat is the situation today. We have unlimited and undisclosed soft \ndollars--we don't know how much--underwriting the PACs of corporations \nand unions. That is the situation today. All I believe the Senator from \nUtah is doing is trying to create a level playing field of hard \ndollars. If hard dollars are good for parties, why not for companies \nand labor unions?\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is my thought, I say to the Senator from Kentucky, \nthat the reason we have not considered this as an abuse in the past is \nbecause there have been other things at which we have been looking. But \nif McCain-Feingold outlaws those other things, there is no reason to \nbelieve that this will not become the target of campaign finance \nreformers in the years ahead, and we will see at that point their \nthundering rhetoric about how terrible it is.\n  Today, they have no rhetoric and they say it is no problem. Of \ncourse, I say to the Senator from Kentucky, knowing how he feels, I \nthink the thundering rhetoric is overheated as to the problem on the \nother side, but corruption becomes ultimately in the eye of the \nbeholder.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. If the Senator from Utah will yield, I had an \nopportunity to listen to some of his comments about the Snowe-Jeffords \nprovisions. They were amusing, but far from accurate.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to be corrected.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. First of all, there is nothing in Snowe-Jeffords that \nprohibits or prevents ads to be purchased in newspapers. There is no \nproblem there.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Is it only television?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Television and radio, probably.\n  Mr. BENNETT. So by choosing gentlemen who like the print media rather \nthan the electronic media--I miss the point?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. He misses the point that all that it requires is \ndisclosure. We would like to know who it is making the ads on \ntelevision. It is a simple disclosure provision that says people ought \nto know, if somebody is making accusations, who is doing it.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Is there no prohibition for ads 60 days prior to the \nelection?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. There is no prohibition 60 days prior to the election.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I stand corrected. It was my understanding that there \nwas a prohibition 60 days prior to the election. Can the Senator from \nKentucky help us out on this?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Utah, we are looking up the \nlanguage. I say to my friend, unless the Senator from--I thought the \npoint of the Snowe-Jeffords language was to make it difficult for----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under the previous \norder, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nUtah, Senator Bennett.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 37, nays 63, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 39 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--37\n\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n\n                                NAYS--63\n\n     Akaka\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say briefly that the vote which \njust occurred is instructive in that I would predict that any amendment \nbetween now and the end of the debate that might have any adverse \neffect of any kind on organized labor is likely to be defeated.\n  Senator Bennett can speak for himself, but my understanding of the \npurpose of that amendment was to point out the imbalance between taking \nall non-Federal dollars away from parties at the Federal level--the \nState and local level in the even-numbered years--making the parties \noperate 100 percent in hard dollars, and yet no one else who expressly \nadvocates a candidate through a PAC is required to do that.\n  We have carved out an exception for corporations and unions so that \nthey can continue to use millions of dollars in corporate and union \nsoft money to underwrite the expenses of their political action \ncommittees.\n  Having said that, the next amendment will be offered by the Senator \nfrom Oregon, Mr. Smith, who will be here momentarily. Senator Dodd and \nI would like for that vote to occur at 6:15 or 6:30. We will lock it \nin, in a few moments. It is my understanding that that will be followed \nby an amendment by Senator Torricelli.\n  Mr. DODD. The idea would be I think at that point, depending on what \nleadership wants, to lay down the Torricelli amendment. I gather there \nis some event this evening that people believe they are obligated to \nattend. The Torricelli amendment will be laid down, and we will begin \ndebate on that in the morning at whatever time the leader wants to come \nin. We might get a time agreement in the morning on that. I have \nseveral amendments I am lining up for tomorrow afternoon. So we will \nhave a clear flow by tomorrow morning as to the amendments we will be \nproposing tomorrow during the day.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, point of inquiry: Did I understand from \nthe floor managers that there would be a vote at 5:30?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No. It is probably at 6:15.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Many of us are going to this March of Dimes event \ntonight. I think it starts at 6.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think many Members are going to that event.\n  Mr. DODD. The March of Dimes event I know is very important. Maybe we \ncan aim for 6 p.m.\n  It will obviously depend on what Senator Gordon Smith wants to do.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I certainly concur with that because many of us have \nto cook.\n  Mr. DODD. In that case, knowing that my colleague from Alaska may be \ndoing the cooking, Members may want to stay until 10 tonight.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. After listening to the persuasive speech of the junior \nSenator from Alaska, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur at 6 \np.m. on or in relation to the Smith amendment shortly to be laid down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, without \nknowing what the subject matter of the amendment is, I object until we \nare able to determine that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Smith will be here shortly. Hopefully, we can \nlock in the vote.\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. In the meantime, Mr. President, if I may, Members who want \nto be heard on the bill itself should take advantage of the time. I \nsuspect the Smith amendment will not consume all of the hour and a \nhalf. We urge Members who want to make statements on the bill to please \ncome to the floor.\n  I see now our colleague from Oregon is here. While he is getting \norganized, let me in response to my friend from Kentucky regarding the \nlast amendment that it was not just about labor unions.\n  This last amendment also covered corporations and membership \norganizations, among a few others. The 1974 law made it very specific. \nWe said that general treasury funds from those organizations could be \nused to establish, administrate, and solicit contributions to be used \nfor political purposes, such as communicating only with their \nrestricted class or membership. That makes them distinct and different \nfrom the other organizations which can communicate with the universe. \nBut these organizations can only communicate with their members. For \nthat reason, the 1974 law specifically wrote into the law that general \ntreasury funds, if you will, could be used for the purposes of \ncommunication.\n  So it was not just about labor unions, it was also about \ncorporations, membership organizations and other such entities that are \nconfined to communications with their own members.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding the Senator from Oregon is \nprepared to go forward with his amendment. It is a pretty simple \namendment. It is a fairly straightforward amendment. I think we could \nget a time agreement, if the Senator from Kentucky is agreeable, say, \nfor a vote at 6 o'clock. After that vote we could lay down another \namendment. So we will be ready to go on that, if that is agreeable.\n  Mr. DODD. That is agreeable. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe that is acceptable to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the time between now and 6 \np.m. be divided in the usual form, and at that time the Senate proceed \nto vote on or in relation to the amendment about to be sent forward by \nthe Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith. \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Therefore, the next vote will occur at 6 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 118\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I have an amendment that I send \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 118.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit candidates and Members of Congress from accepting \n          certain contributions while Congress is in session)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 305. PROHIBITION ON ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN CONTRIBUTIONS \n                   WHILE CONGRESS IS IN SESSION.\n\n       Title III of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 \n     U.S.C. 431 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 324. PROHIBITION ON ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN \n                   CONTRIBUTIONS WHILE CONGRESS IS IN SESSION.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--During the period described in \n     subsection (b), a candidate seeking nomination for election, \n     or election, to the Senate or House of Representatives, any \n     authorized committee of such a candidate, an individual who \n     holds such office, or any political committee directly or \n     indirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled \n     by such a candidate or individual shall not accept a \n     contribution from--\n       ``(1) any individual who, at any time during the period \n     beginning on the first day of the calendar year preceding the \n     contribution and ending on the date of the contribution, was \n     required to be listed as a lobbyist on a registration or \n     other report filed pursuant to the Lobbying Disclosure Act of \n     1995 (2 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.);\n       ``(2) an officer, owner, or senior executive of any person \n     that, at any time during the period described in paragraph \n     (1), employed or retained an individual described in \n     paragraph (1), in their capacity as a lobbyist;\n       ``(3) a political committee directly or indirectly \n     established, financed, maintained, or controlled by an \n     individual described in paragraph (1) or (2); or\n       ``(4) a separate segregated fund (described in section \n     316(b)(2)(C)).\n       ``(b) Period Congress is in Session.--The period described \n     in this subsection is the period--\n       ``(1) beginning on the first day of any session of the body \n     of Congress in which the individual holds office or for which \n     the candidate seeks nomination for election or election; and\n       ``(2) ending on the date on which such session adjourns \n     sine die.''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, this amendment is a very simple \none but one that I believe will go a long way toward restoring public \nconfidence in elected leaders and alleviating the perception that \npoliticians are beholden to special interests.\n  My amendment simply prohibits Senate and House candidates from \naccepting campaign contributions from lobbyists when Congress is in \nsession.\n  The amendment is fair and it is balanced. It applies to both \nincumbents and challengers. Since the danger of corruption or the \nappearance of corruption applies with equal force to challengers and \nincumbents, Congress has ample justification for imposing the same \nfundraising constraints on both incumbents and challengers.\n  This is not new. This is a law that currently operates in many \nStates. In my own State of Oregon, we have long had just such a law on \nthe books; one that I was proud to stand squarely behind as a State \nlegislator. The Oregon law first enacted in 1974 has been in effect for \n27 years and has been integral to ensuring Oregonians' confidence in \nthe integrity of their political system at the State level.\n  The core tenet and assumption behind the McCain-Feingold legislation \nis that money in politics corrupts elected officials. Backers of the \nMcCain-Feingold bill often use catch words and phrases, such as ``quid \npro quo,'' to suggest that money can buy not only legislative action \nbut legislators themselves.\n  This is not my view. It is my belief that the vast majority of the \nmen and women with whom I serve in the public process and in this body \npossess the highest degree of professional and personal integrity. \nHowever, if the public perceives that campaigns are corrupt, that money \ntalks, then I think we owe it to the public to allay those concerns.\n  Prohibiting contributions from registered lobbyists to candidates and \nFederal officeholders while Congress is in session will go a long way \ntoward quelling the perception that we are bought and sold. My \namendment addresses the public's fears directly by eliminating what \nthey view as the disease rather than trying to just treat the symptoms.\n  We are not breaking new ground because we will be doing what other \nStates have done. Oregon is joined by at least 10 other States with \nlaws just like this that prohibit candidates and officeholders from \nsoliciting or accepting contributions while their legislatures are in \nsession\n  In 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in North \nCarolina Right to Life v. Bartlett, upheld the constitutionality of \nNorth Carolina's law prohibiting lobbyist contributions and \nsolicitations while its general assembly is in session, stating that \nthe law ``serves to prevent corruption and the appearance of \ncorruption.'' The Fourth Circuit concluded that ``in the end, North \nCarolina law does nothing more than recognize that lobbyists are paid \nto persuade legislators, not to purchase them.'' Last month the Supreme \nCourt agreed by denying the petition for review of this very case.\n  So I am confident that my amendment will withstand judicial scrutiny. \nMy amendment only restricts a candidate or officeholder from accepting \ncontributions at a certain time and place, not if they can eventually. \nThis is no different than time and place regulation of other first \namendment issues.\n  Furthermore, I think it is important to point out that my amendment \nis narrowly crafted to prohibit candidates\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\nand officeholders from accepting contributions from lobbyists and the \npolitical action committees that employ them.\n\n  My amendment does not place the burden on lobbyists offering \ncontributions to candidates but, rather, squarely and more fittingly on \nthe candidate. The onus, therefore, is on the candidate or \nofficeholder, not the lobbyist.\n  In closing, let me emphasize that the touchstone issue is the \nappearance of influence pedaling and corruption and the role that money \nplays. If money in the system corrupts, then my amendment lessens its \nrole. Diminishing the role of money is also one of the stated goals of \nthe McCain-Feingold bill. But unlike the McCain-Feingold bill, my \namendment does so, I believe, in a constitutional way.\n  Again, my amendment merely prohibits House and Senate candidates and \nofficeholders from accepting political donations from lobbyists while \nCongress is in session.\n  My amendment is evenhanded, it is constitutional, and it addresses \nthe perceived problem that politicians can be bought and sold, and my \namendment does so in a way that does not shut down the entire universe \nof citizen participation in our political process.\n  I hope my colleagues will unanimously support my amendment, following \nOregon's lead, and that of other States, to restore confidence in the \nintegrity of our political system.\n  Finally, some of my colleagues will worry that this includes the \npublic generally. It does not. It involves registered lobbyists, PACs, \nand all special interest groups. A citizen can send in a contribution \nto a candidate. That is fine. But what is disturbing to people is the \nnexus that exists between legislating in the morning and fundraising at \nnight with the very same industries. This will prohibit that. We will \nseparate these two activities and restore some confidence that people \nare entitled to have in their political process.\n  Some people will say this just isn't possible because the Congress is \nalways in session. There may be an unintended but beneficial \nconsequence. We may have shorter congressional sessions. We may get our \nwork done more quickly, and we may be able to thereby provide the \nAmerican people a little less rhetoric, a lot more action, a lot more \nvoting, getting their job done and getting home to be with the folks \nand ultimately to meet with these interest groups. If they want to \nsupport you, fine, but they can't do it while you are about the \npeople's business in making law.\n  I encourage a unanimous vote, and I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Inevitably, I would say to the Senator from Oregon, there \nis going to be a question of constitutionality. It is my understanding, \nfrom my informed staff, that there was a case in North Carolina that \nwas upheld but it has never gone any higher than that.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. The Supreme Court, I understand, denied \ncertiorari, thereby upholding the fourth circuit decision that allows \nfor this kind of prohibition of fundraising from special interest \ngroups while the North Carolina legislature is in session.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What about the fact that you are clearly saying to an \nindividual that because you are in a certain line of work, you are not \ngoing to be able to do what other citizens do? How do you respond to \nthat?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I respond to that by saying that this is not \nunlike other time-and-place regulation of speech issues. People come to \nthis building all the time and would love to come in this Chamber and \nprotest from the very seats above us. They are not allowed to. They are \ngiven a place to protest but not to disrupt the public's work.\n  What I am saying is, this is a time-and-place regulation of speech. I \nadmit that. I am saying it passes the smell test far better than our \ncurrent system.\n  Mr. McCAIN. But the Senator does admit that there might be some \nquestion of the constitutionality of this issue raised.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Clearly, there will be, but ultimately the issue \nof constitutionality is for the Court across the street to decide. It \ndoes not prohibit them from making a contribution later. It just says \nthere is a time to do it and there is a time not to do it.\n\n  I think what disturbs all of us is the notion of holding a hearing on \nan industry in the morning and then going to their fundraiser in the \nevening. That is the nexus that is wrong. That is what, I agree with \nthe Senator from Arizona, we ought to do away with. This works in my \nState. It works in your State also. Arizona is one of those States that \nhas this restriction. It works. It smells better. It doesn't violate \nconstitutional rights, but it does vest us with more of a process of \nintegrity.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Clearly, Arizona has the finest State government of any \nof the 50, I am sure the Senator from Oregon would agree.\n  Again, I ask the Senator from Oregon: There is going to be some \nquestion in people's minds about the constitutionality of this \namendment; you would agree?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Therefore, it would seem to me that the Senator from \nOregon would understand that the whole issue of severability in this \nbill would then take on increased prominence. It is my understanding \nthat the Senator from Oregon may be in support of nonseverability. I \ndon't get the logic there. You are clearly supporting an amendment that \nhas constitutional questions associated with it, and yet at the same \ntime you would not understand that this bill may have portions of it, \nparticularly during the amending process, that the U.S. Supreme Court \nwould deem unconstitutional, including this one which, even if made \nunconstitutional, would not affect the thrust of the bill.\n  I am hopeful that the Senator from Oregon will see the logic here--I \nam dead serious--because it is going to be a big issue, the fact that \nthere should be, as there have been in all but 12 bills passed by the \nCongress in the last 10 years, a severability clause in this \nlegislation.\n  I would give a lot more credibility to the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Oregon if he believed, as he has stated, that there will be \nconstitutional questions, that this bill should not rise or fall based \non a decision concerning what a lobbyist does because there are much \ngreater issues at stake. I certainly hope the Senator from Oregon \nunderstands my logic in that argument.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I do understand that logic. I would be happy to \ninclude this in any nonseverability amendment that I would propose. As \na practical matter, as the Senator knows--and I have said this to him \nand Senator Feingold--I have legitimate questions as to the \nconstitutionality of McCain-Feingold. I am not a judge. We get really \nangry at judges who act as legislators. We are often acting as a bunch \nof judges. We have a responsibility to uphold the Constitution. It is \ntheir responsibility to interpret it.\n  I don't know how all this will cut. My concern about the severability \nclause or a nonseverability clause, which I will be happy to include \nthis in, is that we will leave our country worse off rather than better \noff if we say to the political parties: You can't have a role any \nlonger in elections, but the folks who will go into the smoke-filled \nrooms, who are not disclosable to the American people or accountable to \nthe American people, will then be the ones who have the power because \nthey will run campaigns about candidates.\n  Frankly, I have seen this happen with a campaign finance issue in \nOregon. It was not pretty. It was an ugly situation because the citizen \nand the candidate were disenfranchised by it and were the victims, \nalong with democracy in Oregon, because of a system that would empower \nthose who are nondisclosable and unaccountable to the American people. \nThey get all the power.\n\n  That is my concern, Senator. That is why I have believed a \nnonseverability clause is important in order that we not leave our \ncountry worse off.\n  With that, I am telling you and the whole world, I am prepared to \nvote for\n\n[[Page S2563]]\n\nyour bill, but I think that that is an essential ingredient, as I have \ntold you privately. I really believe without it we will leave our \ncountry worse off based on the experience of my State of Oregon.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will agree to one more question, I want to \nget back on the bill. First, I hope we will be able to convince the \nSenator from Oregon that any provision in this bill, if passed, would \nmake us better off than we are today--any provision, including the \nSenator's. Any part of it that would stand would improve the present \nsituation where, indeed, the case exists, and you have heard my \nargument about that before.\n  The amendment talks about registered lobbyists, but does it also add \npeople who are in charge of political action committees and run PACs? \nAre there additional individuals covered by this amendment?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. It does not.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is simply people who are registered lobbyists, who \nhave voluntarily decided to register as a lobbyist under the law.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Oregon. I have enjoyed this \nchance to pose questions to him. I appreciate the courtesy of his \nresponse and look forward to working with him on this legislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Senator also.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. First of all, I appreciate the spirit of the amendment. \nOur two States, Oregon and Wisconsin, are very similar in our pride and \nour reform history. Obviously, this amendment is offered in that \nspirit. I appreciate that.\n  My questions are similar to those of the Senator from Arizona, but I \nbelieve the Senator from Oregon indicated he would consider a \nseverability provision with regard to this amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I have so much confidence in its \nconstitutionality based on its judicial history already, I would be \nhappy to include it in a severability clause because I think everything \nwe are doing here has a reasonable constitutional question. We ought to \nask the Supreme Court to rule on it. This could be among them in terms \nof any nonseverability, as far as I am concerned.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I was interested in the Senator's remark that we \nshouldn't act as judges here; we should act as legislators. I agree. I \nask the Senator if he is aware of how infrequently legislatures, in \nparticular the U.S. Congress, have actually had a nonseverability \nprovision. Does the Senator realize that it is incredibly rare, \nsomething that is rather unlikely for legislators to do?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I am aware of that, but I think what we are \ndebating here is of so fundamental a nature to our liberty--that is, \nour speech; our most important speech being our political speech--that \nI have no doubt this would make it to the U.S. Supreme Court because \nthis would fundamentally affect the future of our country.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. One other question: Is the Senator completely opposed \nto the notion of having the entire bill be severable?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I am prepared to include the soft money ban to \nthe regulation of the outside groups. And if we want to include this as \nwell, I am comfortable with that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The reason I am asking this question--the spirit of \nthis amendment is very positive, as I have indicated. But what I am \ntrying to determine is whether we would have a fair chance to send a \nbill over to the Supreme Court where, if for any reason you were right \nabout the constitutionality about this, the rest of the bill could \nstill stand. Is that something the Senator is open to?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I am open to discussing it with the Senators.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. One other question. I want to follow up on the scope of \nthis amendment. I have the amendment in front of me. Under section 324, \nthere are several different paragraphs relating to who is covered. It \nrefers to ``any individual who, at any time during the period beginning \non the first day of the calendar year preceding the contribution and \nending on the date of the contribution, was required to be listed as a \nlobbyist. . . .''\n  Under section (2), it refers to ``an officer, owner, or senior \nexecutive of any person that, at any time during the period described \nin paragraph (1). . .'' is a lobbyist.\n  And then in (3), it says, ``a political committee directly or \nindirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled by an \nindividual . . .''\n  And finally, (4), a separate segregated fund.\n  I ask the Senator how he can say it only refers to registered \nlobbyists when it has three other categories of people listed in the \nface of the amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. This is referring to a registered lobbyist or \nthose who employ them.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. What about a political committee?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. If they employ them, they are covered by this \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for a question, it counts not \nonly registered lobbyists, but it is a person who employs that lobbyist \nas well. In other words, I am the CEO of a company back in Arizona, or \nI am a president of a union back in Arizona, and I am not allowed to \ncontribute while Congress is in session because I have employed that \nlobbyist?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Under that guide, that is correct. However, if \nyou sent that person a solicitation in the mail asking for a maximum \nhard money contribution as a private citizen, they would be allowed to \nmake that contribution. But what I am trying to do is stop us spending \ntime, while we are lawmaking, down at the RSCC and the DSCC, spending \nhundreds, even thousands, of hours raising money.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, if the Senator will yield further, I agree with \nwhat he is trying to get at. I think that, frankly, also during the \ncampaign of President Bush, this was part of his campaign finance \nreform proposal, as I remember. But I think we have to worry about this \nlanguage because if I am the senior executive of a company or \ncorporation away from Washington that employs a lobbyist, and I am not \nallowed to contribute at that time, that could be a very large number \nof people. I wonder if we can work on language with the Senator from \nOregon to achieve this goal, without throwing a pretty wide net here. \nIf I am thinking through this legislation, which I am looking at for \nthe first time----\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I am happy to work with the Senator on an \namendment to this amendment. I am not locked down. It is offered in the \nspirit of my experience as an Oregonian. I believe Wisconsin and \nArizona have similar laws. It works. It will be more difficult for \nCongress, but it ought to be done in Congress.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If the Senator will yield for a further question, I \nwill tell you one thing: This certainly will shorten legislative \nsessions, which is a wonderful aspect, as the Senator from Nevada \npointed out. Under sub (4), it refers to a separate segregated fund. I \nam advised that this basically would include political action \ncommittees.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. That is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Is it the Senator's intention to prohibit the lobbyist \nfrom giving individual contributions, but also PACs during this period?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. That is correct, during a legislative session. \nWhen we gavel the session in, you can't do it until you gavel sine die. \nIf the world of special interests wants to evaluate what they think of \nyour performance and help you in your election, fine. We are \nsegregating the function of lawmaking and moneymaking. I think that \ngoes a long way to fixing what you think and feel, rightfully, is \nbroken in this country.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Does the Senator believe it could be unconstitutional \nto prohibit PAC contributions?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I don't believe so. It doesn't prohibit them. It \nregulates them in terms of time and place.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest that the effect of this is to \nunconstitutionally prohibit PAC contributions, and I would be concerned \nabout that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S2564]]\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. There is nobody in this body for whom I have more respect. \nWould this amendment not give a tremendous advantage to wealthy people \nwho are members of the national legislature?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I don't believe it would. They can give a hard \nmoney contribution of $1,000 per campaign.\n  Mr. REID. No. What I am saying is, if you are a Member of Congress, \nwould you not have an advantage over everyone else if you were rich \nbecause it would limit so much of the time for people to do the \nfundraising?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. There is no question but that this amendment \nwill do more to drive money out of politics than anything that has been \nproposed yet. There is no question about that. But we have just passed \nan amendment that doesn't give a perfect playing field to the \nchallenger against the multimillionaire, but it gives them a better \nplaying field than we have had before.\n  Mr. REID. My friend has not answered the question. Would this not \ngive an advantage to a Member of Congress who is rich, because during \nthe period of time that Congress is in session, basically, there would \nbe a tremendous inability to raise money, whereas if somebody finances \ntheir own campaign, it doesn't matter to them?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I would concede the point. But I would simply \nsay that what this does is prohibit the challenger or the Member of \nCongress from being involved in this. I think it is a heavy \nrestriction, but I think it is the right restriction, and I think if we \ncan go to this kind of a standard, it is going to look better to the \nAmerican people and, frankly, it is going to drive a lot of money out \nof politics and clean up our day by making us spend time lawmaking \ninstead of fundraising. And at the end of the day, if somebody wants to \nspend their own money, they are going to have to comply with the law or \nthe amendment we just passed, and it will equalize it somewhat.\n\n  Mr. REID. One more question. While the Senator's amendment bans \ncontributions during the time we have talked about, it doesn't ban \nsolicitations during that time; is that right?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. It does.\n  Mr. REID. It does ban solicitations?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. It bans accepting them.\n  Mr. REID. It would not ban solicitations. You could go to the NRA, or \nwhoever gives money, and you could ask them for money at that time, and \nthey would have to give it to you at a subsequent time when we were out \nof session?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. It doesn't prohibit that. I don't know how to \nprohibit that constitutionally, but I do know how to constitutionally \nprohibit the time and place in which these activities are engaged. But \nthe Senator, in his earlier point, said: What does this mean to a \nMember of Congress? You don't have to be a millionaire to have an \nadvantage by being a Member of Congress. You probably have a large \ncampaign war chest already carried over from your last campaign, if you \nare a safe incumbent. So these are just the facts of life. I don't know \nhow I can make it perfect, but I know this amendment makes it better.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If the Senator will yield, the Senator is doing an \nexcellent job taking on these questions from all corners. But it is a \nvery interesting amendment. I think my own State of Tennessee has a \nsimilar amendment. I think what happens is anybody comes to town a \ncouple days sooner to collect the money.\n  Other than that, my concern, as we consider these amendments, has to \ndo with constitutionality issues. I want to make a couple comments and \nthen ask a question. Obviously, none of us is going to be able to tell \nwhat is constitutional or not. But if we have a nonseverability \nclause--and we don't know whether or not we will--after we have a vote, \nany amendments that turn out to be not constitutional bring the whole \nbill down. Some people think that is good. I think we will wind up with \na hard money increase, which I think is good, and doing something about \nsoft money, which I think is good. So I think that would be a bad \nresult if that happened.\n  Personally, I think this so-called millionaire amendment we just \npassed is of very doubtful constitutionality. That is the reason I \nvoted against it. I don't see how you make the kinds of distinctions \nthat that amendment made when you have free speech protection with \nregard to his spending his own money, how you then favor one over the \nother, and what you do about the person who wants to make a \ncontribution, and he can give up to, say, $5,000 to candidate X, but to \ncandidate Y he can only give $1,000.\n  We already have an amendment that has been adopted with questions \nabout its constitutionality.\n  With regard to your amendment, my question is this: Will the issue \nnot be resolved on the basis of whether or not there is a compelling \nState interest? It seems to me that is the question, and if that is the \nquestion, if that is the issue, then I look at it to see whether or not \nwhat we are doing is of sufficient compelling State interest to \novercome the first amendment problems.\n  Obviously, we are impinging on the first amendment. The Supreme Court \nhas said in some cases we can impinge on the first amendment. That is \nwhat we are doing when we put hard money limits on people. We impinge \non the first amendment, but the Supreme Court says there is a \ncompelling interest to doing that, and that is the appearance of \ncorruption.\n  The question is, it seems to me, are we doing enough? Is there \nsufficient, compelling State interest for us to do this? Is it really \nhelping the system that much in this time-place-manner amendment in \norder to impinge on the admitted free speech rights of a potential \ncontributor?\n  I take it the Senator thinks we would be doing enough to help the \nsystem, to help the Nation by placing these kinds of limitations on \npeople to overcome an impingement on their first amendment rights. Does \nmy colleague agree that is the issue with which we are dealing?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I agree with the Senator. Let me read the exact \nwording of the Fourth Circuit's response to that very question.\n  A unanimous Fourth Circuit found the restriction was narrowly \ntailored and served the compelling interest.\n\n       The restrictions are limited to lobbyists and the political \n     committees that employ them, the two most ubiquitous and \n     powerful players in the political arena.\n\n  They found the restrictions cover only that period during which the \nrisk of an actual quid pro quo or the appearance of one runs the \nhighest risk.\n  Again, it is a time-and-place regulation. I suspect people in North \nCarolina, just as the people of Oregon, have a lot more confidence in \nhearings going on in the morning and know there is not a fundraiser \ngoing on in the evening.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I say to my colleague, that does carry a certain amount \nof logic to it, but we all know that some of these bills carry on for a \nlong period of time, and these big issues where people are greatly \ninterested and their businesses are greatly affected sometimes go on \nfor a period of years and we have fundraisers interspersed with them.\n  I do not know that I agree the greatest danger has to do with the \ntime proximity of the contribution, but I ask my friend if the rest of \nhis bill tracks what they were doing in that Fourth Circuit situation \nin terms of the people involved, in terms of the places limited, in \nterms of the time restriction?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. We have tailored this amendment after the North \nCarolina one in order to make sure it passes judicial muster. I believe \nit does. I am willing to put it as part of a nonseverability clause.\n  I say to the Senator, my concern about the absence of nonseverability \nis not to every component of this bill. It is the banning of soft \nmoney, whereas I would limit it, as the Hagel proposal. It is the \nbanning of soft money if you do not also include these outside groups.\n  The Senator knows firsthand, I am sure, as a Republican, when it \ncomes time that you are under attack, you have some very powerful and \neffective groups against you. You have the Sierra Club; you have the \ntrial lawyers; you have labor unions, and on and on. They are very good \nat what they do. They hit and they run and are accountable to no one. \nThey do not even have to tell the truth. But the only rescue for a \nRepublican is the Republican Senate Campaign Committee.\n\n[[Page S2565]]\n\n  Just in fairness, if you are going to empower such groups, if you are \nnot going to include them, then, frankly, I think we do great damage. \nTo Democrats who may say this is to our advantage, let me say what will \nhappen.\n  The day this is enacted and soft money is banned and held \nconstitutional, every Republican dollar flowing to that Senate \ncommittee is going to find its way immediately into a Republican Sierra \nClub, and all of this will not be disclosable, it will not be \naccountable, and we will have dumbed down America's democracy.\n  That is the point I am trying to make. That is why those two \ncomponents, soft money versus regulating outside groups, have to be \ntied together if we are to make our country better instead of worse.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator said there would not be fundraisers held. There \nwould be nothing wrong. You could have fundraisers and solicit the \nmoney. You just could not collect it; is that right?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. If you wanted to tighten up the bill even more \non that account, I would be happy with an amendment you might offer to \nthat effect. I am trying to go as far as I can constitutionally and say \nthere can be no exchange of cash when you are in a legislative session \nbecause it does not look good. It does not smell good. We ought to \nchange it, and a lot of States are cleaning up their State governments \nwith this very kind of law. We should do no less in this Congress.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the point. I wanted to make sure the record \nreflected, in response to a question from the Senator from Tennessee, \nthat there would not be any fundraisers. There may not be as many, but \ncertainly you could have as many fundraisers as you wanted and solicit \nthe money at the fundraisers. You just could not collect the money that \nnight or that day.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I guess my question is, Would the Senator like \nto amend the amendment to include the prohibition of these kinds of \nsolicitations?\n  Mr. REID. Of course, we cannot amend anything the way the unanimous \nconsent agreement is in place. I think the Senator from Arizona wishes \nto discuss possible amendments with the Senator, and that would be \nsomething.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Would it be appropriate to call for a quorum \ncall to work it out?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I realize there is a time constraint here \nbecause, under the UC, we have a vote at 6 o'clock. We have been trying \nto work out an agreement on this amendment. We have been unable to do \nso. We will go ahead and have the vote at 6. I will make a tabling \nmotion, but I am committed to working with Senator Smith to see if \nthere is a way that we can work it out to his and everyone's \nsatisfaction. It is overly broad in its language at this time, but we \nhave not been able to reach a conclusion.\n  I regret that because I agree with Senator Smith's intent, and I \nthink he is trying to do something that would cure a very bad \nperception that persists in Washington.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is out of time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut controls the \nremainder of the time, 16 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I am glad to yield to my colleague for a couple minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. That would be all I would need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank Senator Dodd. I know this is not easy. I \nknow Congress meets for a long time. I know State legislatures are \ndifferent just in terms of time. In every other respect, this law is as \nvalid here as it is other places, in my view. If we are worried about \nappearance, if we want to move soft money, if we want to move money out \nof politics, nothing will do that better than this amendment. Nothing \nwill shorten congressional sessions more than this amendment.\n  In my opinion, we ought to vote on it. We ought to pass it. I will \npledge my best efforts to work with Senator McCain to get it in a shape \nthat wins his support as well. It is consistent with the spirit of \nMcCain-Feingold.\n  I thank my colleague for the time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 4 minutes to my \ncolleague from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, following up on my earlier comments, I am concerned \nabout this amendment because I fear it may very well be \nunconstitutional. If one of these amendments is unconstitutional and \nthe reform side does not win on the severability issue, the whole thing \nfalls. Obviously, the question of constitutionality is always \nimportant, but it is even more important now.\n  My concern is this: We have to clearly have a compelling governmental \ninterest to override the first amendment rights of people to give money \nto candidates. They clearly have that right here. We are clearly \noverriding it. The question is whether or not there is a sufficient \ngovernmental interest.\n  The case that was cited from the Fourth Circuit--and that case was in \nNorth Carolina--pointed out that it only covered a narrow area and that \nthe Legislature of North Carolina only met for a few months out of the \nyear.\n  This body sometimes meets the entire year. There is no way a person \ncould raise any money at any time during the year under those \ncircumstances. Clearly, the Fourth Circuit is not authority for the \nconstitutionality of this bill. It might be wrong. The Fourth Circuit \nmight be incorrect in its analysis that it should be narrowly tailored. \nBut that causes me a great deal of concern and difficulty. As well \nmeaning as this amendment is, and in many ways as much as I would like \nto see it, it causes me great concern to vote for an amendment with \nwhat I believe raises pretty serious constitutionality questions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is not pleasant to oppose this \namendment. The Senator from Oregon is a wonderful Senator. We have \nworked together on a lot of issues, in the Foreign Relations Committee, \nthe Budget Committee, and the like. We do share a great progressive \ntradition in our two States of Wisconsin and Oregon. That is the spirit \nof this amendment.\n  I have to agree with the distinguished Senator from Tennessee. This \ndoes raise some real questions because it doesn't apply to State \nlegislatures. It applies to this Congress. It may make sense for State \nlegislatures that convene for a few months every year, but it doesn't \nmake sense for this Congress. In the year 2000, this Congress went into \nsession in January and, as we painfully remember, did not adjourn until \nDecember. There was even a possibility that we were going to go up to \nNew Year's Eve. So it is not realistic to have this kind of limitation \nthat we have in States such as Wisconsin and Oregon at the Federal \nlevel.\n  The cost of campaigns is regrettably high. Obviously, future reforms \nshould address this problem. As has been said by other speakers, this \namendment is overly broad in its attempt to prohibit congressional \ncandidates from accepting contributions while the Congress is in \nsession from all the following individuals or entities. It is not just \nregistered lobbyists, as some thought when the amendment was first \ndescribed. It is much more than that. It is registered lobbyists that \nare affected, PACs, senior executives, officers, or owners of any \norganization that employed or retained a registered lobbyist during a \ncalendar year preceding the contribution.\n  It would prohibit not just contributions from lobbyists but, as the \nSenator from Arizona has pointed out, contributions from executives of \nany company that employs a lobbyist--the executives of General Motors, \nof Federal\n\n[[Page S2566]]\n\nExpress, and every other company. It would prohibit all union and \ncorporate PACs from contributing basically almost all year-round \nbecause, as I pointed out, we are in session so much of the year.\n  I am afraid this amendment also gives a huge advantage to wealthy \nincumbents or any incumbents who have a substantial war chest. Under \nthe Smith amendment, while challengers are unable to raise funds from \nthose listed above throughout this very extensive time period in a \nyear, the incumbents who have a lot of resources would be able to rely \non their existing war chests or personal wealth. That concerns me as \nwell.\n  Finally, as the Senator from Tennessee has focused on, there is a \nserious question of the constitutionality of this amendment. This is \none of the reasons I asked the Senator from Oregon at the beginning \nabout whether this affected PACs. He conceded that banning PAC \ncontributions does raise constitutional questions. It calls into \nquestion the whole bill.\n  Of course, if the Senator from Oregon, as we proceed with this bill, \nis willing to work with us on making sure this entire bill is severable \nso that each provision can stand on its own and the Court can determine \neach one, that could be a different story with regard to that argument, \nbut that is the kind of discussion we need to have.\n  I want him to know I am eager to have those discussions. I appreciate \nhis attitude toward reform, and I hope that in the end perhaps we can \nwork something out relating to this, but even more importantly, he can \nbe part of our efforts. In light of these concerns, I will urge that \nall those supporting the McCain-Feingold bill should oppose the Smith \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I don't know if others want to be heard on \nthis. If my colleague would like to rebut, I will be willing to yield \nsome time to him.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I recommit \nto work with Senator McCain and Senator Feingold and see if we can \nnarrow this down. We worked on this a long time. It is hard to do. We \nare intruding upon speech, there is no question about it. The question \nis whether this is a permissible time-and-place regulation and is there \na legitimate State interest. Absolutely, because you are separating the \nfundraising from lawmaking. That not only will drive money out of \npolitics, it will help us to focus more on lawmaking and less on \nfundraising.\n  There is a time and a season for everything. That season is after we \ndo our business. Everybody can have their say and make their \ncontribution. You just can't do it when we are doing the people's \nbusiness.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, I will take a couple minutes to \nconclude. I have great respect for my friend from Oregon. We serve on \ncommittees together, and I enjoy working with him on numerous issues. \nThere has been a lot described as to why the amendment is troublesome. \nThere is one element not included in the language that I find \nappealing, and the public might be attracted to the fact that this may \nhave the net effect of abbreviating sessions of Congress. That may have \nsome appeal to a certain number of Americans. If you can only fundraise \nwhen Congress is not in session, we might be through with business in \nApril or May. Seriously--I am not being facetious in those comments--\nthis is a provision that concerned me a little bit. It goes back to the \ndebate we had earlier in the day about the nonincumbent. I understand \nthe effort may be to modify this amendment and bring it back at a later \ntime as a modified amendment. But it also affects the nonincumbent.\n  As I understand the last provision of the bill, ``beginning on the \nfirst day of any session of the body of Congress to which the \nindividual holds office, or for which the candidate seeks nomination \nfor election or election,'' and it could be, of course, that someone in \na larger State would begin to challenge one of us as incumbents 2 or 3 \nyears out, which is not uncommon today in larger States, and if we are \nin session in those years, obviously, a challenger who wants to be \nheard, where you have a State such as California, or Texas, or \nIllinois, or New York, you may want to begin that process earlier and \nthey would be restrained from raising any money if this amendment were \nadopted as presently crafted.\n  So I, too, respect immensely my colleague's motivations. We talked \nover the last 2 days about the fact that under present circumstances in \nan average Senate race of $6 or $7 million--that is what an individual \nhas to raise in a contested race--a Member would literally have to \nraise thousands of dollars every day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, \nfor the entire 6-year term. Somebody pointed out that in the State of \nCalifornia that number is more like $10,000 a day every day when you \nstart talking about $20 million or $30 million. Obviously, for any \nMember of this body who is raising $10,000 a day every day for 6 years, \nthere is a portion of your responsibilities, to put it mildly, as a \nMember of this body that is suffering.\n\n  It goes to the very heart of what Senators McCain and Feingold are \ntrying to achieve in this legislation. I don't subscribe to the notion \nthat it is an inevitability that campaigns should increase in cost \nexponentially as they have been. I think you can put on the brakes. And \nwhat Senators McCain and Feingold are doing is trying to put the brakes \non a bit in the area of soft money. Our colleague from Oregon is also \ntrying to put on some brakes, and I respect that.\n  For the reasons articulated by Senators McCain, Feingold, Thompson of \nTennessee, and others, I reluctantly oppose this amendment, and I will \nlook for an opportunity when a modified version may come back. I thank \nour colleague for raising the subject matter. I urge rejection of the \namendment.\n  I don't know if any more time is being sought. We can yield back the \ntime left. I think our colleague from Arizona may want to make an \nappropriate motion. We are prepared to yield back time on our side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator yield me 1 minute?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to Senator Gordon Smith what I said to him before. \nWe have our staffs working. I believe I will be able to table this \namendment, but if not, he wins. If it is tabled, we want to work \ntogether with him. It is the unseemly appearances the American people \ndon't like. We ought to try to fix it. I think there should be both \ntime and effort in the consideration of this legislation to narrow this \namendment so it does meet constitutional concerns expressed by Senator \nThompson and others.\n  I thank Senator Smith not only for his involvement in this issue but \nin the entire issue of campaign finance reform. I know he comes from a \nState where there is a lot of interest in this issue, as there is in \nmine--the ``clean campaign'' State referendum. I think he is \nrepresenting his constituents when he is heavily involved in this \nissue. I look forward to working with him not only on this one, but as \nwe approach some of the more important issues in the coming days. I \nthank him for his efforts.\n  Mr. President, if it is an appropriate time, I move to table the \nSmith amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow I will join my colleagues, \nSenators Durbin, Corzine and Dorgan, to support an amendment designed \nto reduce broadcast rates for political candidates and parties. This \nwill be discussed at length tomorrow. For this evening's purposes, it \nis probably best to introduce the amendment with the words of David \nBroder today in the Washington Post who writes the current campaign \nfinance debate:\n\n       . . .focuses too much on the people who write the checks. \n     It's time to question, as well, where the money goes.\n\n  There remains no greater factor in the astronomical expense in \npolitical campaigns than the rising cost of televised political \nadvertising. Nearly $1 billion was spent on political advertising in \nthe 2000 Federal campaign, a 76 percent increase since 1996. As demand \nfor advertising time rose, advertising rates have risen as well.\n  In Philadelphia and in New York City, the cost of some political ads \nincreased 50 percent between Labor Day and Election Day. Political \ncandidates were held hostage by the calendar and the television \nnetworks took full advantage. By law, candidates are supposed to pay \nthe lowest unit rate for a station's most favored commercial \nadvertisers.\n  That is the law.\n  The problem is that to ensure their advertisements do not get \ndisplaced, candidates often end up paying the highest rates available.\n  This Congress had an intent, and it wrote a law that Members of the \nCongress have available the lowest unit rate available by station. But \nit isn't happening. That is the purpose of this amendment.\n  In Detroit, 88 percent of the advertisements at one television \nstation were sold above the lowest rate. In Minneapolis, 95 percent of \nall the advertising sold was above that minimum rate. The lowest unit \nrate has become\n\n[[Page S2568]]\n\na fiction. Political candidates are competing with General Motors, \nProcter & Gamble, Ford, and the greatest advertisers in the Nation. We \nare in a bidding war against commercial interests in order to \ncommunicate public policy issues with the American people.\n  There is no greater hypocrisy in our time than the television \nnetworks that have maintained the need for a change of a campaign \nfinance system at the same time they are increasing rates during the \nfall campaigns and gouging political candidates for more and more \nmoney. Indeed, political advertising is now the third greatest source \nof revenue for the television networks behind retailers and the \nautomobile companies.\n  The Torricelli-Durbin-Corzine amendment prevents broadcasters from \ngouging candidates and parties into paying the highest rates for fixed \ntime by:\n  One, requiring stations to charge candidates and parties the lowest \nrate available throughout the year;\n  Two, ensuring that candidates and party ads are not bumped by other \nadvertisers willing to pay more for the time in the bidding war in \nwhich we are now engaged with commercial parties;\n  Three, requiring the FCC to conduct random checks during the \npreelection period to ensure compliance with the law.\n  Candidates in markets of all sizes would benefit. A candidate in \nAlabama could save at least 400 percent on one station alone. We have \ncalculated that a candidate in Los Angeles could save 75 percent at one \nstation by having this lower rate available.\n  This amendment does not require broadcasters to allocate candidates \nfree time, as indeed is done in almost every other industrial democracy \nin the world. Many of my colleagues believe such free time is the \nanswer. We are not requiring that in this amendment.\n  We are not altering the content of their programming nor charging a \nfee for use of the public spectrum. All we are doing is requiring what \nwe required so long ago, but now enforcing it --now ensuring that it \nhappens in practice; that is, that the lowest unit rate be made \navailable.\n  This will be discussed in length tomorrow. But it is eminently \nreasonable that in a public policy debate, in choosing leaders of this \ncountry, the public airwaves provided on license to the television \nnetworks not be a financial opportunity for the networks to get \ncandidates in a bidding war against commercial advertisers, and not \ntaking advantage of those weeks before an election when advertisers, by \nnecessity, must be placed and, therefore, an opportunity for the \nnetworks to increase their rates to take advantage of the calendar.\n  This simply assures fair access at a fair price. It is a necessary \ncomponent of campaign finance reform. If we are to reduce the amount of \nmoney that is available as part of the effort to perform, reduce the \namount of political money in this system in order to ensure the \nintegrity of our Government and increase public confidence, and if we \nare to reduce these expenditures without reducing the cost of \nadvertising, there is only one possible result: Less campaign \nfundraising will result in less communication, less informed voters, \nand candidates unable to bring their message to the people.\n\n  There is only one way to avoid this eventuality: Reduce the amount of \ncampaign money by reducing campaign costs. That is at the heart of the \nTorricelli - Corzine - Dorgan - Durbin amendment.\n  I will return tomorrow morning with my colleagues. We will present \nour case at length and I think make a real and lasting contribution to \nthe fight for reform.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Ensign of Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I have been in four very tough campaigns \nin the last 8 years. I have a lot of experience buying television time. \nBeing a small State, the State of Nevada, in which we only have two \nmedia markets, it is a lot less expensive than in the State of my good \nfriend from New Jersey.\n  In 1994, our television time was a lot less expensive. Just in the \nlast 8 years, television has literally at least tripled in price in my \nState. At election time, when the Senator was talking about the \ngouging--whatever term you want to use--by the station, there are so \nmany independent expenditures and so many candidates advertising on \ntelevision that the price goes up. As a matter of fact, at the \nbeginning when you are doing your budgeting for your campaign and you \nare trying to get the lowest unit rate, it is supposedly going to be at \nthe end of the campaign so that you can determine how much money you \nwill be able to spend on television and how much you will be able to \nput your message out to the voters.\n  I remember asking my people: What about this lowest unit rate we \nheard about? I always hear about that in every campaign. My campaign \npeople say that is really a farce, because the lowest unit rate is \nsomething that is preemptible time, so we don't recommend that you ever \nbuy the lowest unit rate. I think we bought a few spots at the lowest \nunit rate. But other than that, we had to buy nonpreemptible time so we \nwould make sure we had the slots and our message would get to the \npeople to whom we wanted to get.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. If I could interrupt the Senator, on tomorrow we will \npresent to the Senate correspondence illustrating exactly the \nphenomenon to which the Senator from Nevada was speaking. Political \ncandidates will place an ad for $20,000 in compliance with Federal law \nat the lowest unit rate, and the television station will write back and \nsay: You have an advertisement placed at $20,000, and you should know \nthere is a commercial buyer for that time. If you do not send us \nanother $20,000, you will lose the slot. We will move your ad where we \nintend to move it, which means the middle of the night.\n  In fact, they take a candidate's time trying to communicate to the \nAmerican people in accordance with Federal law at the lowest unit rate, \nand then you get into a bidding war with the commercial interests \nbecause the station is trying to take advantage of the time. They know \nyou advertise in October and September.\n  Tomorrow we are going to have a complete example of what the Senator \nis discussing.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If the Senator will yield again, my personal experience \nwith this has gone on. We just had the broadcasters from Neveda in our \noffice last week. I don't blame them for wanting to make a profit. That \nis their business. I don't blame them at all. But we have to spend a \nlot more time and effort raising money. And this drives up the cost of \nall of our campaigns simply because of what has happened in the last \nfew election cycles. This phenomenon we are seeing has really happened \nin the last three or four election cycles--this bidding up of the \nprices right before election day.\n  As a matter of fact, when I first got into this in 1994, the \ntelevision stations didn't like the political season because it was the \ntime when they lost money because they used to give out a lot of low \nunit rates. But today they love the election cycles. It is one of their \nhighest profit margin times--at least that is what they tell me--simply \nbecause there are so many people trying to get on the air to advertise. \nCandidates cannot get the lowest unit rate. They don't choose to do it \nanymore. And they have to bid up this time.\n\n  So I applaud the three Senators for bringing this amendment up. I \nthink it is the right thing to do. I do not know whether the amendment \nis going to be adopted, but I certainly think it is the right thing to \ndo. I will be joining with you tomorrow in voting for this.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator for his help. I believe we will \nsucceed tomorrow on a bipartisan basis. I think people recognize the \npurpose of campaign finance reform is not that the United States have \nless political debate, not that the American people will be less \ninformed, but that there will be less money in the system. If we\n\n[[Page S2569]]\n\nare to achieve both--and that is, to have people to be well informed \nbut have less money in the system, and build confidence--we have to \nlower the cost of campaigns. This is the way to do it--on the public \nairways.\n  Unfortunately, we are not doing what is done in Britain or France or \nEngland, which is providing this time free because they are public \nairwaves. We are taking a very modest step. Indeed, we are only putting \ninto law what really, in fact, was in the law but now is being evaded, \nand that is this requirement of lowest unit rate.\n  Indeed, the Senator's experience in Las Vegas is not unusual. He has \nseen a 300-percent increase during this decade. As I pointed out, the \nnational average, in just 4 years, is 76 percent. There is no cost of \nbusiness for any industry I know of that is rising faster than the cost \nof advertising for a political candidate. But what is unbelievable is, \nin the entire national debate on campaign finance reform, this has \nlargely been absent.\n  It is as if candidates are raising money because they enjoy it, that \nsomehow people like to raise money because it is entertaining. People \nare raising these phenomenal amounts of money for one purpose: to feed \nthe television networks that are demanding it, and holding the \npolitical system hostage.\n  So I suggest that tomorrow Mr. Brokaw and Mr. Jennings and Mr. \nRather, who have led this campaign for campaign finance reform--we are \njoining them and going to make the point that rather than being a \ncritic of it, you can make a contribution. This is their way of making \na contribution. We are going to lead them to do so tomorrow.\n  Would the Senator like to add a point?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If the Senator will further yield, to just give the \nAmerican people a little bit of insight into how campaigns work, when \nyou are setting up your budget, in the beginning you set up your TV \ntarget market and how much you want to advertise--not how many dollars \nyou want to put into it but what level of penetration into the market \nyou want to get, something called the gross rating point. And we \ndetermine each week from election day backward approximately how many \npoints we would like to get in the market. That will determine how much \nof our message gets to the voters. Then we try to figure out, after we \ndo that, approximately how much the stations are going to charge us for \neach one of those commercials we put on television.\n  In the last few years, because of the huge increases, obviously, we \nhave had to adjust our budgets. From that point we go forward and \ndetermine how much money we need to raise in our campaigns. That is why \nthe cost of campaigns has continued to go up and up and up and up. From \n1995 to 1998, we spent about $3.5 million in our first Senate race. In \nour second Senate race, just 2 years later, we spent almost $5 million. \nThat is the reality. Mail costs about the same, and radio has gone up a \nlittle bit but not too badly, and almost all of the increase has been \nbecause of the cost of television.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. If I could share one of my own experiences: In 1996, \nin my own Senate race, we tried to buy the advertising in advance. We \nknew, as did the Senator, how many points we wanted to buy. We offered \nto send the money to television. They would not take it because they \nwanted to increase the rates. They told us in advance: These rates will \nnot hold. We will not take your money. The more they see the demand \nfrom political candidates, the more they increase the cost.\n  Now, to the point, if we are to have a $1,000 limit on all \nexpenditures under McCain-Feingold--no soft money--only $1,000 \ncontributions, in the city of New York an ad covering much of the State \nof New Jersey can be $60,000 or $70,000. So it will take 70 people \nwriting $1,000 contributions to pay for one ad--one.\n  The point becomes, how many people do you need? How much do you have \nto raise to run a television campaign? Effectively, for a candidate in \nNew York today, we will never see another Senate campaign that costs \nless than $25 million. At that rate, how many thousands and thousands \nand thousands of people have to write $1,000 contributions? There is no \nescaping this addiction of money until we lower these costs.\n  I am very grateful the Senator from Nevada has joined this cause. I \nam very grateful on a bipartisan basis it seems overwhelmingly the \nSenate is prepared now to have the second leg on the chair of campaign \nfinance reform--control the money, control the costs, and then we have \na balanced program for genuine reform.\n  I thank the Senator. I look forward to being with him in the debate \ntomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend our colleagues from New Jersey \nand Nevada. This exchange between these two fine Senators represents \nthe quality of the debate the Senate is now experiencing on this \nimportant issue of campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to read into the Record \nthe following article by Stanford law professor Kathleen Sullivan, \nentitled ``Paying Up Is Speaking Up.'' In it, she notes that politics \nand political campaigns are far cleaner today than they were in the \ndays of Tammany Hall. She also notes that in Bucklay v. Valeo the \nSupreme Court made things worse by striking down expenditure limits \nwhile upholding contribution units, resulting in a situation where \ngovernment may limit the supply of political money but not the demand.\n  Professor Sullivan says:\n\n       Those who claim that our political system is awash in \n     money, corruption and influence peddling were predictably \n     upset that the Senate again defeated the campaign finance \n     restriction proposed by Senators Russell Feingold and John \n     McCain. The Senate's failure to ban ``soft money''--large \n     contributions to political parties that are made to avoid \n     tight restrictions on donations to candidates--drew \n     laments from editorial pages to corporate boardrooms, \n     where some business executives now plead, ``Stop us before \n     we spend again.''\n       The advocates of new, improved campaign finance reform are \n     well-intentioned but misguided. Of course none of us wishes \n     to live in a plutocracy, where wealth alone determines \n     political clout. But as Senator Mitch McConnell noted in a \n     heated exchange with Senator McCain, American politics today \n     is far from ``corrupt'' in the traditional sense. And the \n     most troubling features of political fund-raising today are \n     the unintended consequences of earlier efforts at campaign \n     finance reform.\n       Begin with the allegations of ``corruption.'' Contributions \n     to candidates and parties today do not line anybody's \n     pockets, as they did in the heyday of machines like Tammany \n     Hall. Vigilant media and law enforcement now nip improper \n     personal enrichment in the bud, as politicians involved in \n     the savings and loan scandals found out to their detriment.\n       Political money today instead goes directly into political \n     advertising, a quintessential form of political speech. Our \n     large electoral districts and weak political parties force \n     candidates to communicate directly with large groups of \n     voters. This depends on the use of the privately owned mass \n     media. Thus getting the candidate's message out is expensive.\n       Reformers sometimes decry today's political advertising as \n     repetitious and reductive. But it is not clear what golden \n     age of high-minded debate they hark back to; the antecedents \n     of the spot ad are, after all, the bumper sticker and slogans \n     like ``Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too.''\n       Nor is there any doubt that restrictions on political money \n     amount to restrictions on political speech. Reformers \n     sometimes say they merely seek to limit money, not speech. \n     But a law, say, barring newspapers from accepting paid \n     political advertisements or limiting the prices of political \n     books would also limit only the exchange of money. Yet no one \n     would question that it would inhibit political speech--as do \n     restrictions on campaign finance.\n       Unfortunately, the Supreme Court only half recognized this \n     point when, in 1976, it struck down limits on political \n     expenditures while upholding limits on political gifts. \n     Expenditures, the Court reasoned, may not be limited in order \n     to level the playing field, but political contributions may \n     be limited to prevent the reality or appearance that big \n     contributors will have disproportionate influence. So we \n     still have in place the 1974 law limiting individual \n     contributions to a Federal candidate to $1,000 per election--\n     the equivalent of about $383 in 1999 dollars--and, \n     perversely, candidates must spend ever more time chasing an \n     ever larger number of donors.\n       The Court's noble but flawed attempt at compromise leaves \n     us in the worst of all possible worlds: government may limit \n     the supply of political money but not the demand. This is a \n     situation that in a commercial setting would produce a black \n     or gray market, and politics is no different. Instead of \n     money flowing directly to candidates, it flows to parties as \n     soft money, or to independent advocacy organizations for \n     issue ads that often\n\n[[Page S2570]]\n\n     imply support for or opposition to specific candidates.\n       Political spending and speech thus have been shifted away \n     from the candidates, who are accountable to the voters, to \n     organizations that are much harder for the voters to monitor \n     and discipline--a result that turns democracy on its head.\n       Reform proposals such as McCain-Feingold proceed on the \n     assumption that the answer is to keep on shutting down \n     ``loopholes'' in the system. But in a system of private \n     ownership and free expression, we can never shut all the \n     loopholes down. If the wealthy cannot bankroll campaigns, \n     they can buy newspapers or set up lobbying organizations that \n     will draft legislation rather than campaign ads. When the \n     cure has been worse than the disease, the solution is not \n     more doses of the same medicine.\n       Does this mean we should eliminate all campaign finance \n     regulation? Certainly not. Even if we give up on contribution \n     limits, we should retain and enhance mandatory disclosure and \n     public subsidies--two kinds of government intervention that \n     are consistent with both democracy and the Constitution.\n       Mandatory disclosure of the amounts and sources of \n     political contributions enables the voters themselves, aided \n     by the press, to follow the money and hold their \n     representatives accountable if they smell the foul aroma of \n     undue influence. Such disclosure is an extraordinarily \n     powerful and accessible tool in the age of the Internet.\n       And more widespread public subsidies, like those now given \n     in presidential and some state races, could, if given early \n     in campaigns, help political challengers reach the critical \n     threshold amounts they need to get their messages out.\n       In ongoing debates about campaign finance reform, it is \n     worth remembering that free speech principles bar the \n     creation of ceilings on political money, but they do not bar \n     the raising of floors.\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to read into the Record a recent \narticle by Stuart Taylor Jr. of the National Journal entitled ``How \nMcCain-Feingold Would Constrict Speech.'' It explains how McCain-\nFeingold would make our political system worse, not better. It notes \nthat each new step down the road of restricting political speech and \npolitical spending actually creates new problems.\n  Mr. Taylor's article says:\n\n       It all sounds so clean, so wholesome, so righteous: close \n     the loopholes in our campaign finance laws. End what Sen. \n     John McCain, R-Ariz., calls the ``corrupting chase for \n     `soft money.' '' Curb the influence of corporations and \n     labor unions. Stop special interests from polluting our \n     politics with ``sham issue ads.'' Mandate greater public \n     disclosure of political spending.\n       But in reality, the McCain-Feingold-Cochran campaign \n     finance bill would make our politics worse, not better, by \n     further entrenching incumbents against challengers, by \n     weakening our political parties, by increasing the influence \n     of wealthy individuals and huge media corporations, by \n     stifling political debate, and by attacking the First \n     Amendment's premise that political speech should be free and \n     uninhibited, not hobbled by a maze of prohibitions and \n     regulations.\n       We might be able to make our politics cleaner and fairer by \n     supplementing private campaign funding with some form of \n     public financing to help give voice to candidates and causes \n     with scant financial resources. (More on that next week.) We \n     will not achieve this by piling onerous new restrictions on \n     privately funded speech.\n       Our experience with the current curbs on campaign \n     contributions, which were enacted in the early 1970s, should \n     be sobering. Spread through hundreds of pages of almost \n     indecipherable legalese understood only by specialists, these \n     curbs are filled with traps, technicalities, and \n     opportunities for selective enforcement by politically \n     appointed bureaucrats and judges. Their main impact has been \n     to force federally elected officials and their challengers to \n     spend a huge percentage of their waking hours soliciting \n     ever-smaller (after inflation) contributions from ever-larger \n     numbers of people. Meanwhile, incumbents have become harder \n     to defeat, the influence of special interests has grown, \n     voter turnout has declined, and public confidence in our \n     political system has plunged.\n       The solution, say McCain and other ``reformers,'' is to \n     plug loopholes in the current laws--first and foremost, by \n     ending the ability of wealthy individuals, corporations, and \n     unions to circumvent the limits on ``hard-money'' \n     contributions to candidates by giving their political parties \n     unlimited sums of soft money to be spent promoting the \n     candidates. This would make it harder for politicians to \n     extort money from those who would prefer not to give. That is \n     good. But it would also weaken the parties' ability to \n     finance indisputably healthy grass-roots activities such as \n     voter education, registration, and turnout drives, while \n     spurring the many companies, unions, and individuals who want \n     to be active in politics to take their money elsewhere. That \n     is very bad.\n       The most obvious outlet for private money would be to fund \n     so-called issue advertisements praising their preferred \n     candidates and attacking their adversaries, either directly \n     or by giving to one or more of the interest groups that buy \n     such ads. These groups range from the Chamber of Commerce, \n     the National Right to Life Committee, and the National Rifle \n     Association on the right to labor unions, Planned Parenthood, \n     and the Sierra Club on the left. Such a governmentally \n     engineered shift of money and power from the parties--our \n     most broad-based vehicles for citizen participation in \n     politics--to single-issue groups and other ideologically \n     driven organizations would warp our political discourse.\n       Not to worry, McCain and his allies say, we also have a \n     plan to curb the financial clout of corporations, unions, and \n     independent interest groups. This proposal (Title II of the \n     bill) would severely restrict such organizations' spending on \n     issue ads and other activities designed to disparage or \n     promote federal candidates. Indeed, for some incumbents \n     facing re-election battles, these provisions are the main \n     attraction of the McCain-Feingold-Cochran bill. ``We're \n     totally defenseless against the juggernaut of huge, \n     unregulated, undisclosed expenditures'' by independent \n     groups, Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., who faces an election \n     next year, told the Wall Street Journal.\n       This part of the bill would, in the words of Brooklyn Law \n     School professor Joel M. Gora, who has long worked with the \n     American Civil Liberties Union on campaign finance issues, \n     ``effectively silence a great deal of issue speech and \n     advocacy by non-partisan citizen groups, organizations, labor \n     unions, corporations, and individuals.'' It would altogether \n     bar for-profit corporations and unions from buying television \n     or radio ads, or giving independent groups money to buy ads, \n     that so much as mention--let alone criticize or praise--a \n     federal candidate during the critical 60 days before an \n     election and the 30 days before any primary. These are \n     precisely the periods during which the public is most \n     attentive to debate about political issues and candidates. \n     The bill would also prohibit independent groups from buying \n     such pre-election issue ads unless they set up unwieldy \n     separate, segregated funds that shun corporate and union \n     money and publicly disclose all individual contributions \n     above $1,000.\n       An even more radical provision would expose such groups to \n     possible legal sanctions if they do anything, at any time, \n     that might help any candidate with whom they have \n     ``coordinated''--a term defined so broadly and vaguely as to \n     encompass almost any contacts with candidates or their \n     aides--in working on issues of mutual interest. So \n     restrictive are these ``coordination'' rules that some of \n     McCain-Feingold-Cochran's biggest champions might have run \n     afoul of them had they been in effect during the 1999-2000 \n     election cycle. Common Cause, for example, worked closely \n     (``coordinated'') with McCain in late 1999 on strategies for \n     promoting his bill, while spending lots of its own soft money \n     touting the bill (and McCain) to the public, at a time when \n     McCain himself was putting campaign finance reform at the \n     center of his presidential candidacy. Under his own bill, \n     such routine political activities involving Common Cause and \n     McCain might be deemed illegal corporate campaign \n     contributions.\n       Nor is McCain-Feingold-Cochran's requirement that \n     independent groups disclose the names of all donors of more \n     than $1,000 for pre-election issue ads as innocuous as it may \n     seem. It is, some independent groups argue, mainly for the \n     benefit not of the public, but of powerful incumbents and \n     other politicians who might use pressure and intimidation to \n     deter people from funding issue ads the politicians don't \n     like. Thus could a bill that purports to curb the influence \n     of Big Money in politics have the effect of increasing the \n     power of politicians to silence critics both big and small.\n       Fortunately, McCain-Feingold-Cochran's proposed \n     restrictions on issue ads and independent groups will have \n     trouble getting through Congress now that the AFL-CIO is \n     opposing them--a major break with its usual Democratic \n     allies. And even if enacted, these restrictions have little \n     chance of surviving judicial review. They fly in the face of \n     rules laid down by the Supreme Court in a long line of First \n     Amendment decisions that guarantee that issue advocacy by \n     independent groups, corporations, and unions will enjoy broad \n     protection from all forms of official regulation, including \n     public disclosure requirements.\n       In any event, any portion of McCain-Feingold-Cochran that \n     manages to get through Congress and past the courts would not \n     take Big Money out of politics. The bill would, rather, \n     increase the relative power of those moneyed interests that \n     remain unregulated. These would include individuals rich \n     enough to finance their own campaigns, such as Ross Perot, \n     Steve Forbes, and the four Senate candidates (all Democrats) \n     who each spent more than $5 million of their own money to win \n     their races. This group was topped by Jon Corzine's $60 \n     million purchase of a seat to represent New Jersey. Power \n     would also flow to the national news media, which are owned \n     by huge corporations such as AOL-Time Warner and General \n     Electric, are staffed by journalists with their own biases, \n     and are busily clamoring for restrictions on the campaign-\n     related spending and First Amendment rights of everybody \n     else.\n       Those reformers who are most serious about driving Big \n     Money out of politics see McCain-Feingold-Cochran as only a \n     first, tiny step. They would also cap campaign spending by \n     wealthy candidates--a step that would require overruling the \n     Supreme Court's landmark 1976 decision in Buckley vs. Valeo. \n     And a few reformers have asserted that, in the words of \n     associate professor\n\n[[Page S2571]]\n\n     Richard L. Hazen of Loyola University Law School in Los \n     Angeles: ``The principle of political equality means that the \n     press, too, should be regulated when it editorializes for or \n     against candidates.''\n       Each new step down this road of restricting political \n     spending and speech creates new problems and new inequities, \n     fueling new demands to close ``loopholes'' by adding ever-\n     more-sweeping restrictions. How far might campaign finance \n     reformers go if they could have their way? Was McCain serious \n     when he said on Dec. 21, 1999. ``If I could think of a way \n     constitutionally, I would ban negative ads''? Shades of the \n     Alien and Sedition Acts.\n       Politics will always be a messy business. Money will always \n     talk. And the cure of legislating political purity and \n     purging private money will always be worse than the disease.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to read into the Record an \narticle by Judge James Buckley entitled ``Campaign Finance: Why I Sued \nin 1974.'' Judge Buckley was the lead plaintiff in the landmark \ncampaign finance case of Buckley v. Valeo. This article provides an \nimportant historical context to the current debate over restricting \nCampaign finances further.\n  It says:\n\n       Twenty-five years ago, I was a member of the Senate \n     majority that voted against the legislation that gave us the \n     present limitations on campaign contributions. Having lost \n     the debate on the floor, I did what any red-blooded \n     American does these days: I took the fight to the courts \n     as lead plaintiff in Buckley v. Valeo. This is the case in \n     which the Supreme Court held that the 1974 act's \n     restrictions on campaign spending were unconstitutional \n     but that its limits on contributions were permissible in \n     light of Congress's concern over the appearance of \n     impropriety.\n       The issue of campaign finance is again before the Senate. \n     Unfortunately, today's reformers are apt to make a badly \n     flawed system even worse.\n       To understand why, it is instructive to take a look at the \n     Buckley plaintiffs. I had squeaked into office as the \n     candidate of New York's Conservative Party. My co-plaintiffs \n     included Sen. Eugene McCarthy, whose primary challenge caused \n     President Lyndon Johnson to withdraw his bid for re-election; \n     the very conservative American Conservative Union; the \n     equally liberal New York Civil Liberties Union; the \n     Libertarian Party; and Stewart Mott, a wealthy backer of \n     liberal causes who had contributed $200,000 to the McCarthy \n     presidential campaign. We were a group of political underdogs \n     and independents; and although we spanned the ideological \n     spectrum, we shared a deep concern that the 1974 act would \n     dramatically increase the difficulties already faced by those \n     challenging incumbents and the political status quo.\n       Incumbents enjoy formidable advantages, including name \n     recognition, access to the media, and the goodwill gained \n     from handling constituent problems. A challenger, on the \n     other hand, must persuade both the media and potential \n     contributors that his candidacy is credible. This can require \n     a substantial amount of seed money. As we testified, Sen. \n     McCarthy could not have launched a serious challenge to a \n     sitting president and I could not have won election as a \n     third-party candidate under the present law. Large \n     contributions from a few early supporters established us as \n     viable candidates. Once the media took us seriously, we were \n     able to reach out to our natural constituencies for financial \n     support and to attract the cadres of volunteers that \n     characterized our campaigns.\n       Although we won a number of the arguments we presented in \n     Buckley, we lost the critical one when the court held that \n     the limits on contributions were constitutional. Experience, \n     however, has vindicated our worries over the practical \n     consequences of these and other provisions of the 1974 act.\n       The legislation was supposed to de-emphasize the role of \n     money in federal elections and encourage broader \n     participation in the political process. Instead, by limiting \n     the size of individual contributions, it has made fund \n     raising the central preoccupation of incumbents and \n     challengers alike; and it created a bureaucracy, the Federal \n     Election Commission, that has issued regulations governing \n     independent spending that are so complex and have made the \n     costs of a misstep so great that grassroots action has \n     virtually disappeared from the political scene. Today, anyone \n     intrepid enough to engage in such activities is well advised \n     to hire a lawyer; and even then, he must be prepared to \n     engage in protracted litigation to prove his independence.\n       Legislation that was supposed to democratize the political \n     process has served instead to reinforce the influence of the \n     political establishment. By compounding the difficulties \n     faced by challengers, it has consolidated the advantages of \n     incumbency and increased the power of the two major parties. \n     By limiting individual contributions to $1,000, it has \n     enhanced the political clout of both business and union \n     political action committees--the notorious PACs.\n       Moreover, if today's reformers succeed in their efforts to \n     restrict ``issue advocacy,'' the net effect will be to \n     increase the already formidable power of the media. The New \n     York Times or The Wall Street Journal will be free to throw \n     their enormous influence behind a particular candidate or \n     cause through Election Day. But public interest groups would \n     be denied the right to advertise their disagreement with the \n     Times or the Journal during the final weeks of a campaign.\n       What is needed is not more restrictions on speech but a re-\n     examination of the premises underlying the existing ones. \n     Recent races have exploded the myth that money can ``buy'' an \n     election. Ask Michael Huffington, who lost his Senate bid in \n     California after spending $28 million. The voters always have \n     the final say. What money can buy is the exposure challengers \n     need to have a chance. And while large contributions can \n     corrupt, studies of voting patterns confirm that that concern \n     in vastly overstated. The overwhelming majority of wealthy \n     donors back candidates with whom they already agree, and they \n     are far more tolerant of differences on this point or that \n     than are the PACs to which a candidate will otherwise turn.\n       An alternative safeguard against corruption is readily \n     available--the daily posting of contributions on the \n     Internet. This would enable voters to judge whether a \n     particular contributions might corrupt its recipient. What \n     makes no sense is to retain a set of rules that make it \n     impossible for a Stewart Mott to provide a Eugene McCarthy \n     with the seed money for a challenge to a sitting president, \n     or that make elective politics the playground of the super \n     rich.\n       The problem today is not that too much money is spent on \n     elections. Proctor & Gamble spends more in advertising than \n     do all political campaigns and parties in an election cycle. \n     The problem is that the electoral process is saddled by a \n     tangle of laws and regulations that restrict the ability of \n     citizens to make themselves heard and that rig the political \n     game in favor of the most privileged players. And because \n     congressional incumbents are the beneficiaries of the titled \n     playing field, it is fanciful to believe that Congress will \n     re-write the rule book to give outsiders an even break.\n       We have nothing to fear from unfettered political debate \n     and everything to gain. American democracy can ill afford \n     government control of the political marketplace; but that is \n     where today's reformers would lead us.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2571-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a serious and \neffective use of new technologies in our military operations. While I \nwill focus on a specific directed energy technology, the Joint Non-\nLethal Weapons Program Office is involved in many other research areas \nthat provide innovative solutions to our military men and women in \ntheir daily missions.\n  Recently, the Marines unveiled a device known as Active Denial \nTechnology, ADT. This is a non-lethal weapons system based on a \nmicrowave source. This device, mounted on a humvee or other mobile \nplatform, could serve as a riot control method in our peacekeeping \noperations or in other situations involving civilians. This project and \ntechnology was kept classified until very recently.\n  The Pentagon noted that further testing, both on humans and, \nevidently, goats will be done to ensure that it truly is a non-lethal \nmethod of crowd control or a means to disperse potentially hostile \nmobs. The notion that the Pentagon is using ``microwaves'' on humans, \nand especially on animals, has inflamed some human and animal rights \ngroups. Among others it has simply sparked fear that a new weapon \nexists that will fry people.\n  This is not the case. And, unfortunately, few of the media reports \noffer sufficient detail or comparisons to clarify the value of such a \nsystem or put its use in perspective. While ADT is ``tunable,'' the \nenergy cannot be ``tuned up'' to a level that would immediately cause \npermanent damage to human subjects.\n  The technology does not cause injury due to the low energy levels \nused. ADT does cause heat-induced pain that is nearly identical to \nbriefly touching a lightbulb that has been on for a while. However, \nunlike a hot lightbulb, the energy propagated at this level does not \ncause rapid burning. Within a few seconds the pain induced by this \nenergy beam is intended to cause the subject to run away rather than to \ncontinue to experience pain.\n  Such technologies have never before been used in a military or \npeacekeeping endeavor. Therefore, there is\n\n[[Page S2572]]\n\nnaturally suspicion or fear of the unknown and usually the worst is \nimagined. I believe this is unwarranted, especially when one considers \nthe currently available options in these types of military situations.\n  Think of 1993 in Somalia. The U.S. lost 18 soldiers and somewhere \nbetween 500 and 1,000 Somalis were killed on the streets of Mogadishu. \nThe Somalis used children as human shields, and our military was forced \nto fire on angry crowds of civilians, some civilians having automatic \nrifles and grenades.\n  Peacekeeping operations are not void of lethal threats. Oftentimes \nour military is confronted with armed civilians or situations where \nunarmed, defenseless civilians are intermixed and indistinguishable \nfrom persons possessing lethal means.\n  Regardless of the new Administration's approach to involvement of the \nU.S. military in non-traditional operations, I believe these types of \nmissions will continue to be a staple of our military's daily \noperations for a long time to come. Further, these missions often \ninvolve situations that render U.S. soldiers vulnerable or threaten the \nlives of innocent civilians.\n  I believe that the applications of directed energy technologies in \nthese and other operations can provide a more humane and militarily \neffective approach. Active denial technology is merely one device on a \nlist of research and development endeavors currently underway by the \nPentagon's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program.\n  I would encourage my colleagues to get briefed on the mission and \nprojects in the Non-Lethal Weapons Program. Further, I believe that the \ntunability of microwave and laser technologies will offer a palette of \nreadily available options to address operational needs in both \ntraditional and non-traditional military operations, and I fully \nsupport further funding of research in this area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2572-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO ARMY SERGEANT PHILLIP FRELIGH\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my sympathies \nto the families and loved ones of those killed during the recent Naval \ntraining exercise in Kuwait. Of the five U.S. military personnel killed \nin the accident, Sergeant Phillip Freligh, whom I intend to pay tribute \nto today, was from my home state of Arkansas.\n  Army Sgt. Phillip Freligh, of Paragould, AR, graduated in 1993 from \nGreene County Tech and enlisted in the Army later that same year. He \nattended jump training and was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division. \nHe then was trained as a bomb specialist and was assigned to the 734th \nExplosive Ordinance Division in White Sands, NM and was on a six month \ndeployment in Kuwait when the accident occurred.\n  I want to express my deepest regret and sympathies to the family and \nfriends of Sgt. Freligh as well as the families of all the servicemen \nwho lost their lives in this tragic accident. We owe it to all of our \nbrave servicemen and those who serve with them to do our best to \nuncover the cause of this tragedy, and to do our utmost to prevent it \nfrom happening again.

Mr. President, on Friday, March 16, Stephanie Bernstein, \nwho lost her husband on Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, \naddressed a conference on the future of Libyan-American relations \nhosted by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the \nAtlantic Council, and the Middle East Institute.\n  Ms. Bernstein's remarks are insightful and show, in very real human \nterms, the pain suffered by the Lockerbie families. They also \ndemonstrate the need for the U.S. and the international community to \nkeep the pressure on Qadhafi until he accepts responsibility for the \nactions of Libya's intelligence officer, tells what the Government of \nLibya knows about the bombing and compensates the families of the \nvictims for this horrible tragedy.\n  I urge my colleagues to read Ms. Bernstein's remarks as we consider \nthe reauthorization of the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that her statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks of Stephanie L. Bernstein--Conference on U.S.-Libyan Relations \n          after the Lockerbie Trial: Where Do We Go From Here?\n\n                                                   March 16, 2001.\n       I would like to thank the Atlantic Council, the Middle East \n     Institute, and the Woodrow Wilson Center for inviting me to \n     participate in this conference.\n       I have been asked to talk from my perspective as someone \n     whose life has been profoundly and permanently altered by the \n     actions of the government of Libya. I am not a diplomat or a \n     politician, but an average citizen of a country, 189 of whose \n     citizens were brutally murdered on December 21, 1988. The \n     impact of this savage act of mass murder was described in \n     eloquent terms by the Lord Advocate of Scotland during his \n     remarks to the Scottish Court just prior to its sentencing of \n     the defendant, Megrahi, who was found guilty of murder on \n     January 31, 2001:\n       ``More than 400 parents lost a son or daughter; 46 parents \n     lost their only child; 65 women were widowed; 11 men lost \n     their wives. More than 140 children lost a parent and 7 \n     children lost both parents.''\n       I would like to tell you briefly about one of the 270 \n     people who was murdered in the Lockerbie bombing. My husband, \n     Mike Bernstein, was an ordinary person who died an \n     extraordinary death. His dreams were simple: he wanted to \n     guide his children into adulthood. He wanted to grow old with \n     his wife. He wanted to do work which brought him satisfaction \n     and which made the world a better place than he found it. He \n     graduated with distinction and high honors from the \n     University of Michigan, and received his law degree from the \n     University of Chicago, where he was an associate editor of \n     the Law Review. Mike was the Assistant Deputy Director of the \n     Office of Special Investigations at the U.S. Department of \n     Justice. This office finds, denaturalizes, and deports \n     persons from the United States who participated in Nazi \n     atrocities during World War II. Mike left two children, ages \n     7 and 4, a wife, a mother, and countless friends. He was 36 \n     years old.\n       Over the last 12 years, the family members of those who \n     were murdered in the Lockerbie have worked hard for some \n     measure of justice. As a result of our efforts, and with the \n     support of our many friends on Capitol Hill, legislation has \n     been passed which sought to make aviation safer from \n     terrorist acts and to put pressure on countries such as Libya \n     which have been state sponsors of terrorism. The Aviation \n     Security Act of 1992, the Lautenberg Amendment, and the Iran-\n     Libya Sanctions Act would not be law without the efforts of \n     the Lockerbie families.\n       On January 31 of this year, we achieved another victory \n     when Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, a Libyan security agent (JSO), \n     was convicted of the murders of my husband and 269 others. \n     The Scottish Court was strong in its opinion that Megrahi was \n     acting at the behest of the Libyan government:\n       ``The clear inference which we draw from this evidence is \n     that the conception, planning and execution of the plot which \n     led to the planting of the explosive device was of Libyan \n     origin.'' (p.75)\n       ``We accept the evidence that he was a member of the JSO, \n     occupying posts of fairly high rank.'' (p. 80)\n       Since the verdict, the Bush administration has been firm in \n     its insistence that Libya abide by the terms of the U.N. \n     Security Council Resolutions, which call for Libya to accept \n     responsibility for the bombing, and for payment of \n     appropriate compensation to the families. The sanctions are \n     rooted in the concept in international law that a government \n     is responsible for the wrongful acts of its officials.\n       In a meeting with family members on February 8 of this \n     year, Secretary of State Colin Powell was clear in detailing \n     the Bush administration's policy:\n       ``President Bush intends to keep the pressure on the Libyan \n     leadership, pressure to fulfill the remaining requirements of \n     the U.N. Security Council, including Libya's accepting \n     responsibility for the actions of its officials and paying \n     appropriate compensation.''\n       The Bush administration has stated that the investigation \n     into the Lockerbie bombing is still open. A $5 million dollar \n     award is still in place for information leading to the arrest \n     and conviction of others involved in the bombing. State \n     Department spokesman Richard Boucher said last month that the \n     United States will follow the evidence ``wherever it leads.'' \n     Secretary Powell, in his meeting with the families, \n     elaborated on this as well:\n       ``However we resolve this and however we move forward from \n     this point on, we reserve the right to continue to gather \n     more evidence and to bring more charges and new indictments . \n     . . So accepting responsibility as a leader of a nation, and \n     as a nation, doesn't excuse other criminals who might come to \n     the fore and be subject to indictment.''\n       Unfortunately, there are others who have not supported the \n     reasonable aims of the Security Council, the United States, \n     and Great\n\n[[Page S2573]]\n\n     Britain. In an interview with The Indepdent on February 9 of \n     this year, Nelson Mandela, who helped broker the agreement \n     which persuaded Gaddafi to turn the suspects over for trial, \n     accused the U.S. and Great Britain of having ``moved the \n     goalposts'' on the issue of lifting sanctions.\n       ``The condition that Gaddafi must accept responsiblity for \n     Lockerbie is totally unacceptable. As President for five \n     years I know that my intelligence services many times didn't \n     inform me before they took action. Sometimes I approved, \n     sometime I reprimanded them. Unless it's clear that \n     Gaddafi was involved in giving orders it's unfair to act \n     on that basis.\n       I ask: is it really possible to believe that a Libyan \n     intelligence agent would carry out a massive operation such \n     as the downing of a passenger aircraft without approval from \n     those higher up the chain of command?\n       Similarly, oil companies, some of whom I know are \n     represented here today, have seen the verdict as the first \n     step in resuming normal relations with Libya. Archie Dunham, \n     the Chairman and Chief Executive of Conoco, stated last month \n     that he was ``very optimistic'' that President Bush will lift \n     the unilateral U.S. sanctions against Libya, in part because \n     of the President and Vice President Cheney's ties to the \n     Texas oil industry.\n       I find these efforts to promote business at the expense of \n     justice to be deeply disturbing. I am afraid that comments \n     such as those by Mr. Dunham and Mr. Mandela send a message \n     that terrorists and the countries which sponsor or harbor \n     them will not have to pay a significant price for their \n     actions. When we allow ourselves to believe, as is a popular \n     view now, that encouraging business relationships with \n     countries such as Libya which carry out terrorist acts will \n     somehow inoculate us against further terrorist attacks, I \n     believe that we are dangerously naive. Is it really good \n     business to do business with terrorists? Every corporation \n     represented in this room today must ask if it is worth it to \n     resume business in a country whose leader refuses to \n     acknowledge his responsibility for the mass murder of 270 \n     human beings. Anyone in this room could have easily had a \n     loved one on Pan Am 103.\n       Where do we go from here? The government of Libya and Col. \n     Gaddafi must accept responsibility for the bombing of Pan Am \n     103 and the murders of 270 people. The government of Libya \n     must pay appropriate compensation to the families. The \n     government of the United States must continue to pursue and \n     develop information leading to the indictments, arrest, and \n     conviction of the others responsible for the bombing. The \n     world community must realize that lifting the sanctions \n     against Libya before Libya has fully complied with them sends \n     a signal that the civilized countries of the world are not \n     serious about going after perpetrators of mass murder. The \n     business community must know that sweeping Pan Am 103 under \n     the rug will, ultimately, not be good for business. We must \n     press for renewal of the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act which is \n     due to expire in August. We must re-impose the U.N. sanctions \n     if the Libyan government does not comply with the terms of \n     the original sanctions. Support for these positions is \n     embodied in a current Sense of Congress resolution which has \n     bipartisan support.\n       Finally, I think it is vital for everyone to know that the \n     Pan Am families will not go away. In a Reuters article dated \n     February 13 of this year, Saad Djebbar, a London based lawyer \n     who has advised the Libyan government was quoted as follows:\n       ``The more the United States sticks to the original \n     agreement that the aim of the process was the surrender and \n     trial of the two accused, the more the Libyans will cooperate \n     and compensate the families.''\n       I interpret this to mean that if the families back off, the \n     government of Libya will pay compensation to the families. \n     This cynical approach dishonors the memories of our loved \n     ones and we will never agree to it. Continuing to pursue what \n     and who was behind the Lockerbie bombing and the acceptance \n     of responsibility by the Libyan government are goals which \n     will not be abandoned by the families.\n       Another British expert on Libya, George Joffe, was quoted \n     in the same article as follows:\n       ``Gaddafi knows he's going to have to pay compensation. The \n     question is whether he can control the domestic agenda and \n     curb his own tongue over the next few months, and whether \n     extremists on the other side of the Atlantic among the \n     families and their supporters in Congress can be kept under \n     control.''\n       The ultimate resolution of the rift between the United \n     States and Libya does not hinge on whether Gaddafi can ``keep \n     his tongue.'' The ultimate resolution will come when the \n     Libyan government meets its responsibilities to the families \n     and to the international community. As for the families and \n     our supporters in Congress being ``kept under control''--we \n     have been invigorated by the verdict of the Scottish court, \n     and we will not go away.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2573-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2573-S2574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SWORD TO PLOUGHSHARES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss some efforts in \ndefense conversion that are reaping great gains. In the book, ``The \nIdea of National Interest'', Charles Beard wrote:\n\n       Government might legitimately take the initiative and \n     pursue some interests aggressively. Furthermore, it might \n     make use of its own citizens and their interests to advance \n     the national interest.\n  Early on U.S. foreign policy for the Former Soviet Union, FSU, was \ndesigned to do just that: make use of U.S. citizens' interest to \nadvance our national security objectives.\n  Today, I would like to briefly underscore some successes, \nspecifically in the realm of defense conversion. Before doing so, \nhowever, I wanted to offer some insights regarding the scope of the \nproblem.\n  First, the legacies of a command economy were prevalent in all \nnations behind the Iron Curtain. Such legacies included: a structure of \nproduction dominated by heavy industry, distorted factor and product \nprices, antiquated or obsolescent capital stock, inadequate skills to \ncompete in a modern economy; a neglected infrastructure, severe \nenvironmental degradation, trade oriented towards other uncompetitive \nmarkets, and large volumes of non-performing loans and heavy foreign \ndebt.\n  The FSU was no exception with respect to inheritance of these burdens \nand impediments. And despite all these similarities with other eastern \nEuropean states, the FSU, especially Russia, was unique in one very \nimportant way.\n  For Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan ``heavy industry'' was \nthat of defense. Fifty-two percent of Russia's industry was involved in \nmilitary-related research, design and manufacturing. In Ukraine, \nBelarus, and Kazakhstan, the defense industry comprised about fifteen \npercent of their heavy industry.\n  This distinction made the Soviet industry not merely an economic \nconcern, but rather a central threat to international security. As \nSoviet central authority deteriorated, control over its massive \nmilitary complex also crumbled. As such international security concerns \nare not limited to issues of control over nuclear weapons and material, \nbut include attaining a degree of economic stability to offer stable \nemployment to a vast number of persons in military and military-related \noccupations, especially scientists and engineers in that sector.\n  The threat was apparent; the risk of inadequate action has been \nreadily apparent. The national interest, indeed, the global interest, \nis in securing stability in the region. Stability in the region equates \nwith global stability, especially in light of the potential leakage of \nknowhow from weapons complex.\n  Our approach has come in fits and starts. We have not offered a \nintegrated, comprehensive plan for U.S. economic assistance or \nnonproliferation programs. Increasingly, however, we are coming to \nrecognize the interrelationship between these two elements of our \nRussia policy, even if we still haven't achieved a semblance of a \nstrategy.\n  I did, however, want to discuss some efforts that have succeeded. \nThey are not sufficient in breadth, depth or financial means. \nNonetheless, the are an exception to the rule in our efforts to provide \nmeaningful, stable employment to former Soviet scientists and \nengineers.\n  I begin with the efforts of the Cooperative Research and Development \nFoundation, CRDF. CRDF was created pursuant to Section 511 of the \nFreedom Support Act of 1992 in 1995. Its mission is to conduct \ninnovative activities of mutual benefit with the countries of the FSU. \nFurther, CRDF was to offer opportunities to former weapons scientists \nto achieve transition to productive civilian research. They have been \nremarkably successful.\n  Since its inception, CRDF has expended $16 million of U.S. Government \nfunds and $1 million from private foundations. The FSU, in turn, has \ncommitted $4.8 million to these activities. These funds have backed 597 \nprojects that supported a total of 4300 scientists and engineers.\n  In addition, with major contracts from the DOE, DoD, NIH, and EPA as \nwell as industry, CRDF is helping U.S. participants address issues of \nfinancial integrity in their dealings with the FSU. Over $30 million \nfor over 500 projects has been managed by CRDF through these contracts.\n  The Foundation has committed an additional $11.8 million to projects \nin five program areas.\n  CRDF's industry programs reduce the risk for U.S. companies to engage\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\nFSU scientists. These grants have leveraged 300 percent of U.S. \nGovernment funds through in cash and in-kind contributions from U.S. \nindustry.\n  I would also note that more than 95 percent of the collaborations \nformed in CRDF awards will continue, whether with CRDF support or not. \nOver 100 U.S.-FSU teams are seeking commercial applications for the \nproducts of their collaborative research. Twenty-two teams have filed \nfor patents, fourteen of which are joint.\n  For over a year now CRDF has ensured financial integrity for \nDepartment of Energy projects under the Initiatives for Proliferation \nPrevention, IPP, program. The United States Industry Coalition, USIC, \nthe industry-arm of the IPP program, now boasts 96 members throughout \nthe U.S. and several substantial commercial successes with FSU \npartners. Through its cooperation with CRDF, USIC and the IPP program \nnow can ensure that funding for FSU scientists involved in these \nresearch efforts avoids taxation by Russian or other officials. This \naspect is critical for maximizing the impact of U.S. Government or \nindustry investments to provide stable employment and a steady income \nto FSU scientists.\n  Since 1994, the IPP program has engaged over 6,200 former weapons of \nmass destruction scientists. Importantly, USIC members usually surpass \ncost-sharing arrangements with DOE expenditures totaling $39.3 million \nversus the $63.4 million invested by U.S. industry. Currently, 75 of \nUSIC's members are engaged in 120 cost-shared projects.\n  I would like to briefly highlight a recent success story in my home \nstate of New Mexico. On January 15, I participated in a technology \ndemonstration and press conference to announce a $20 million \ninternational investment in technologies jointly developed by a small \nU.S. engineering company, a Russian nuclear weapons plant, and two of \nthe Department of Energy's facilities.\n  An entrepreneurial American company, Stolar Horizon of Raton, NM, a \nlong-standing member of USIC, identified a Russian technology with \nmarket potential, then staked over $5 Million of its own money to \ndevelop it. Stolar Horizon worked in tandem with Sandia National \nLaboratories and the Kansas City Plant through the IPP program to test \nand refine the technology for commercial, peaceful applications.\n  The result: Credit Suisse First Boston has committed $20 million in \nfinancing to take the product to the global market. An estimated 350 \nnew jobs will be created in New Mexico, and over 600 jobs await Russian \nnuclear scientists and technicians in Nizhny Novgorod at the Institute \nfor Measuring Systems Research, NIIIS, are planned.\n  I would remind everyone that U.S. appropriations in FY2001 for the \nIPP program is only $24.5 million. In this one example, Credit Suisse \nwill provide an investment equal to 80 percent of our own in this \nfiscal year.\n  The Stolar Horizon/NIIIS success is a concrete example of the \noriginal IPP vision: making the world a safer place through cooperative \ncommercial efforts leading to long-term, well-paying jobs in both \nnations.\n  The cooperative efforts of USIC members, DOE-IPP, other U.S. \ngovernment agencies, and the scientific institutes of the NIS are \nrevolutionizing the post-Cold War world, creating new opportunities for \nweapons scientists and engineers, and making our world more safe and \nsecure.\n  I return to the thoughts of Charles Beard. In pursuit of its \ninterests, Government might make use of citizens' interests to advance \nthe national interest. This is the foremost objective of \nnonproliferation programs that seek to create commercial opportunities \nin the FSU.\n  The statistics and examples I've offered above underscore the \nsuccesses we've achieved. Obviously, our attempts have frequently \nstumbled sometimes as a result of our own false starts and other times \ndue to circumstances beyond our control. However, at the same time, we \nhave never faced a situation similar to the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion. We had never before legislated or formulated programs with the \nexpress intent of preventing proliferation through promotion of \ncommercial opportunities. We had never confronted providing economic \ndevelopment aid to countries burdened by legacies of a command economy. \nFrom this perspective, we've made remarkable progress.\n  Mr. President, I would conclude on the following note: each concrete \nsuccessful commercial venture will have exponential benefits. I am \nconvinced that these ventures will pay off--by mitigating immediate \npotential proliferation threats, contributing to a stable economy in \nthe region, and advancing U.S. citizens' own monetary interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2574-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING FIRST BOOK\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last Friday, Congressman Mike Capuano and \nI had the honor of congratulating First Book for distributing over a \nquarter of a million books to children across Massachusetts. My \ndistinguished colleague from Massachusetts is a tireless advocate for \nensuring that children of all ages obtain the reading materials and \nskills they need to become active members of our State and of our \nNation, and I am happy to have been able to share this important \nafternoon with him.\n  Thanks to the coordination of First Book, the generous donations by \nRandom House Children's Books and Little, Brown & Company, and the \ndedicated volunteers from the Campus Outreach Opportunity League, the \nCoast Guard and First Book, thousands of children throughout our state \nwho do not always get the opportunity to receive brand new books, are \nnow enjoying their gifts.\n  First Book is making it possible for young children to have access to \nbooks and take the first steps toward learning to read and it is making \na real difference in their lives. It is impressive that last year, \nFirst Book was responsible for distributing more than 4 million books \nto children in more than 290 communities across the country.\n  A 1999 evaluation of First Book conducted by Lou Harris and funded by \nthe U.S. Department of Education, showed that after a child's \ninvolvement in First Book, 55 percent of them reported an increased \ninterest in reading. Ninety-eight percent of the local advisory boards \nreported that their community was better off because of the support of \nFirst Book.\n  Children need to have reading materials outside of school, and even \nbefore they start school. It is the best way to develop a love of \nreading early in life.\n  When President Kennedy was young, two of his favorite books were \n``Billy Whiskers'' and ``King Arthur and the Round Table.'' My mother \nread for endless hours to all nine of us, and she was conscientious \nabout choosing books that were educational and inspirational as well as \nentertaining. She instilled a love of reading in all of us.\n  Reading is the foundation of learning and the golden door to \nopportunity. First Book knows that to open a book is to open a child's \nmind to a world of new possibilities.\n  But too many children fail to read at an acceptable level. Reading is \na pleasure, but today it is also a necessity. Students who don't learn \nto read well in their early years cannot keep up in their later years. \nThat is why literacy programs are so important. They give young \nchildren practical opportunities to learn to read and practice reading.\n  As a volunteer for a reading program in Washington, I know that \nliteracy and mentoring programs make a difference not only for the \nchildren who participate in them, but the children in the program make \na difference in my life, too.\n  This is the fourth year that Jasmine and I have been reading partners \nat Brent Elementary School, and it is very impressive to see her make \nprogress as a reader. There is nothing more exciting for Jasmine and me \nthan when we get to choose a brand new book to read together.\n  If we all work together, families, schools and communities, children \nwill have the support they need to become good readers in their early \nyears, and gain an appreciation for reading that will last a lifetime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2574-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2574-S2575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TAXES, THE ECONOMY AND THE FUTURE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, after nearly a decade of economic growth, \nhistoric gains in productivity and reining in the Federal budget \ndeficits, Congress is now considering enacting a tax\n\n[[Page S2575]]\n\ncut. I support a tax cut. And I think it should be retroactive to \nJanuary 1 of this year to provide a needed boost to our economy.\n  Cutting taxes now will be helpful both to individual taxpayers and to \nour economy. But we also need to use some of the expected available \nsurplus to pay down our Federal debt. If a country runs up a debt \nduring tough times, it should pay it down during good times. And some \nof the surplus should be used to do other important things like improve \nour schools, provide emergency help to family farmers, and help the \nelderly afford prescription drug costs.\n  There is an effort by some to frame this tax cut debate in terms of \nwhether one supports the President. But it is not about who we support. \nRather, it's about what we support. What kind of a tax cut should we \nenact and how large should it be?\n  Here's what I think we should do:\n  One, enact the income tax cut in phases. The projected 10 year budget \nsurpluses are just that, projections, and are not at all certain. \nTherefore we should be conservative. Enact the first phase of the tax \ncut now, and make it retroactive to January 1. In 2 years, if our \neconomy is still producing the expected surpluses, add to the tax cut.\n  Two, cut income tax rates and do it in a way that provides fair tax \ncuts for all tax brackets.\n  Three, eliminate the marriage tax penalty in the income tax code.\n  Four, simplify filing requirements by allowing ``return free filing'' \nfor up to 70 million Americans.\n  Five, totally exempt all family farms and family businesses from the \nestate tax and increase the estate tax exemption to two million dollars \nfor all estates--$4 million for married couples.\n  Six, add a tax credit for investments that are made in rural States, \nwhere there is out-migration of people. We should use this opportunity \nto use tax cuts to stimulate new jobs and economic growth in rural \nstates that have been left behind.\n  Here are some of the major issues that we must consider as we enact \nthis tax cut.\n  The President's plan assumes we will have budget surpluses for the \nnext 10 years. I hope that is the case, but with the current slowdown \nin our economy, we ought to be cautious. Economic forecasts are no more \nreliable than weather forecasts. If we lock in a large tax cut and then \ndo not get the expected surpluses, we will once again put our country \nin financial trouble.\n  One of the major priorities for using the surplus should be to pay \ndown the Federal debt. It grew by trillions in the 80s and early 90s. \nNow we have the opportunity and an obligation to use part of these \nsurpluses to pay down that debt.\n  Our Government collects about $1 trillion in personal income taxes \nand about $650 billion in payroll taxes from individuals each year. The \ntop 1 percent of all income earners in the U.S. pay 21 percent of all \ntaxes, but under the President's plan they would receive 43 percent of \nthe tax cut. That's not fair. We should make changes to the President's \nplan to provide a larger share of the tax cuts to working families.\n  A tax cut is a priority, but so too is fixing our schools, helping \nfamily farmers through tough times, dealing with the high prices of \nprescription drugs, and strengthening Medicare and Social Security. \nYes, surpluses need to be used to cut taxes and reduce the debt, but \nsome should be used to address other urgent needs that improve our \ncountry.\n  This debate is larger and more important than partisan politics. And \nthese decisions are bigger than whether the Congress is supporting a \nnew President.\n  Our country works best when we think ahead and think together. That \nis what we need to do on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2575-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          VETERANS' HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am privileged to be a cosponsor of the \nVeterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act of 2001, S. 131, and I \nwill explain why this legislation is so important.\n  No one from either side of the aisle questions the importance of \neducation as the steppingstone to success in the 21st century. We all \nknow that the economy of the future is going to require people with \nspecialized training and skills, while the unskilled labor that \ntypified the 18th and 19th centuries is becoming less and less useful. \nIn this regard, it is hardly surprising that Congress is flooded with \nproposals to enhance access to high-quality elementary education, \nsecondary education, and higher education. I myself have strongly \nsupported expansion of Pell Grants, broadening of student loans, and \ntax incentives to help families pay for a college education.\n  As we rightly promote the importance of government help for higher \neducation, it might be useful to recall that one of the first, and most \nsuccessful, of these higher education initiatives was the GI bill that \nwas enacted back in 1944. Following World War II, millions of veterans \nwere able to obtain college educations through the GI bill, with the \nresult that many were able to attain a standard of living they could \nnot have imagined. Furthermore, all this college-trained talent \ncontributed to the burst of economic advances that improved life for \nall of us over the ensuing decades.\n  Fast forward 57 years. We still have a GI bill, and in our highly \nsuccessful all-volunteer military, it turns out that the single most \nimportant factor that attracts many young people to join the military \nis the availability of educational benefits after discharge. Yet the \ncurrent GI bill suffers from one big flaw: the educational stipend is \nno longer sufficient to pay for the cost of a college education.\n  The current monthly payment in the GI bill has not come close to \nmatching the rate of inflation in educational costs over the past 50 \nyears. Just consider these statistics. At present, the standard GI bill \nbenefit is $650 per month for 36 months. That is it. Moreover, we now \nask servicemembers who want educational benefits after discharge to \ncontribute $1200 while they are in the military. By contrast, when it \nbegan in 1944, the GI bill benefit included full tuition and fees at \nany educational institution to which the veteran could gain admittance, \nPLUS a monthly stipend equivalent to $500 in 2001 dollars, $750 for \nmarried veterans.\n  We thus find ourselves in an anomalous situation: at the same time \nthat the Government is ramping up its support and subsidy for non-\nveterans seeking college educations, the program that started this \nwhole thing, and which provides key benefits for those who put their \nlives at risk for the country, is lagging way behind.\n  The Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act of 2001 goes a long \nway toward redressing this situation. The key provision of this bill is \nquite simple: the total VA educational stipend under the Montgomery GI \nBill will be increased to a level equal to the average cost of tuition \nat 4-year public colleges. In other words, the standard 36 months of GI \nbill benefits will be sufficient to allow a veteran to attend college \nand complete a degree.\n  The Veterans Higher Education Opportunities Act of 2001 provides the \nminimal benefit that we should be offering to those who are willing to \nmake the ultimate sacrifice to keep our country free and prosperous, \nand I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2575-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2575-S2576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FARMERS AND RANCHERS ON NATIONAL AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today marks National Agriculture Day. \nUnfortunately, what should be a celebration is instead overshadowed by \nthe grim reality that many of the hardworking families producing food \nfor this Nation and world are having a difficult time making ends meet.\n  I salute our farmers and ranchers for many reasons. First, Americans \nspend less than anyone in the world on their grocery bill. Roughly 11 \npercent of our household income is spent on food, and it takes a mere \n38 days to earn enough income to pay a food bill for the entire year. \nWe truly enjoy the most nutritious, affordable, and stable food supply \nin the world.\n  Furthermore, the American economic engine depends upon a strong \nagricultural sector to run on all cylinders. Indeed the agricultural \neconomy is central to my State's prosperity or adversity. According to \nSouth Dakota State University, the multiplied value of agriculture's \nimpact on South Dakota's economy was $16 billion in 1999, one-fourth of \nour total economic output and more than double that of\n\n[[Page S2576]]\n\nany other industry in my State. I believe the public institutions and \nprivate businesses that lay the foundation for rural communities thrive \nonly when we have a strong base of independent family farmers and \nranchers in South Dakota.\n  Finally, agricultural producers are the day-to-day stewards of our \nland. Environmental and conservation benefits like clean water and air, \nrich soil, and diverse wildlife habitat are enjoyed by the public \nlargely due to the care and management of family farmers and ranchers.\n  So, why aren't we truly celebrating National Agriculture Day?\n  Because current economic conditions are poised to squeeze many of \nSouth Dakota's 32,500 farmers and ranchers right out of business--\nconditions set to reverberate across the entire country. Absent farm \naid and long-term farm policy fixes that provide true economic security \nto family farmers and ranchers, the environmental benefits and food \nsecurity enjoyed by so many in this country may not survive on a \nsustained basis.\n  I believe Congress must take two fundamental steps to remedy this \nsituation: modify the farm bill now and strengthen our laws so the \nmarketplace is truly competitive and fair for all.\n  Since 1997, U.S. farmers have experienced a price crisis of enormous \nproportions, exacerbated by a series of weather-related disasters in \nmany regions of the Nation. Surplus crop production, both here and \nabroad, weak global demand, marketplace concentration, and an \ninadequate farm income safety net are prime reasons for this price \ncrisis.\n  Moreover, given the input-intensive nature of production agriculture, \nmany farmers and ranchers are paying more each year for critical inputs \nlike fuel and fertilizer. Corn and wheat farmers in South Dakota may be \nforced to pay up to twice per acre for fertilizer this year, and still \nnot cover enough acres to boost yields to profit-producing levels. This \nsituates farmers in a price-cost squeeze making it nearly impossible to \nearn income that covers total expenses.\n  As a result of an inadequate farm bill, Congress has enacted multi-\nbillion dollar disaster programs in the last 3 years--a record $28 \nbillion in fiscal year 2000. USDA economists predict 2001 may be the \nworst year ever. Without supplemental income or emergency aid, USDA \nestimates that net farm income in 2001 could approach its lowest level \nsince 1984. Clearly, the 1996 farm bill fails to provide a meaningful, \nfiscally-responsible, safety-net for farmers when prices are poor on an \nannual and sustained basis.\n  I am concerned that the administration's budget blueprint apparently \ndoes not grasp the economic obstacles facing the Nation's farmers, \nranchers, and rural communities, as illustrated by the fact that the \nbudget includes zero funding for emergency aid or a farm bill rewrite. \nThis seems ironic, since every major farm group has sent myself and \nothers on the Senate Budget Committee a letter agreeing that roughly \n$10 billion per year will be needed to modify the farm bill for future \nyears, and that around $9 billion is needed in fiscal year 2001 to \noffset income losses due to low prices and failed farm safety-net \npolicies.\n  Already, these farm groups and some Members of Congress are \nsuggesting that we will simply assemble a fourth consecutive aid \npackage for farmers in 2001. I will support this imperative aid when \nthe time comes, but suggest American farmers and taxpayers deserve \nbetter. These ad hoc emergency bills, totaling billions of dollars each \nyear, are a poor excuse for a long term policy fix. I believe Congress \ncan and should amend current farm policy immediately to provide a more \npredictable, secure safety-net for farmers now.\n  One farm bill alternative I have introduced is S. 130, the Flexible \nFallow farm bill amendment. Rep. Doug Bereuter (R-NE) has introduced an \nidentical bill in the House. Under my Flex Fallow bill--an idea \ndeveloped by two South Dakota agricultural producers--farmers \nvoluntarily devoting part of their total cropland acreage to a \nconservation use receive greater price support on their remaining crop \nproduction. My proposal embodies the planting flexibility so popular \nunder ``Freedom to Farm,'' yet strengthens the underlying farm income \nsafety net. In fact, my Flex Fallow bill has been endorsed by Iowa \nState agricultural economist Neil Harl, who believes the proposal works \nin a market-oriented fashion and said Flex Fallow ``is the missing link \nto the 1996 Farm Bill.''\n  Furthermore, I believe agricultural producers want to derive income \nfrom the marketplace, and in order to assure that can happen, Congress \nmust restore fair competition to crop and livestock markets. The forces \nof marketplace concentration are squeezing independent farmers and \nranchers out of profit opportunities.\n  The livestock market is one case in point. Meatpacker ownership and \ncaptive supply arrangements tend to transpire outside the cash market. \nAs a result, the process of bidding in an open fashion for the purpose \nof buying slaughter livestock--which is central to competition--is \nfading away. As such, livestock producers--who depend upon competitive \nbidding to gain a fair price--are forced to either enter into \ncontractual, ownership, or marketing arrangements with a packer or find \nthemselves left out of market opportunities.\n  I have authored a bipartisan bill, S. 142, with Senators Grassley, \nThomas, and Daschle to forbid meatpackers from engaging in these \nanticompetitive buying practices. While my legislation is just one of \nmany steps that should be taken to bolster our laws to protect true \nmarket competition, I believe Congress should move to address this \nissue in earnest.\n  Former President Eisenhower once said, ``farming looks mighty easy \nwhen your plow is a pencil and you're a thousand miles away from a \nfarm.'' Because we live in a country where the food is safe and \naffordable, and the environment is not taken for granted, perhaps some \nhave forgotten President Eisenhower's simple yet honest-to-goodness \nwords.\n  So today, let us not overlook the critical role farmers and ranchers \nplay in weaving the economic, social, and environmental fabric of this \ncountry. Instead, I join all Americans to salute farmers and ranchers \non National Agriculture Day. And I invite all Americans to support \nefforts to ensure a brighter future for the families who put food on \nour tables every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2576-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONDEMNATION OF THE TALIBAN'S WAR ON GLOBAL CULTURE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to condemn an act of \nmindless destruction by a regime known for its intolerance. I am \nreferring to the reported destruction of the two ancient statues of \nBuddha carried out by the Taliban government in Afghanistan and the \nTaliban's call for complete elimination of all artifacts in the region.\n  The Bamiyan Buddha statues were priceless artifacts. They stood for \ncenturies as guardians of the silk route that connected the ancient \nGreek and Roman Empires to Asia. Once one of the most cosmopolitan \nregions in the world, Afghanistan is now one of the most intolerant and \nrepressive nations due to the actions of the ruling Taliban faction. \nThe destruction of these 1,500- year-old statues was ordered and \ncarried out for fear that they would be used for idol worship. \nDestroying those creations because of an irrational fear motivated by \nintolerance of other cultures and religions should be condemned by \nthoughtful people everywhere.\n  The country of Afghanistan and the global community has lost two of \nits greatest treasures, and the world is poorer for it. We cannot \ntolerate the willful destruction of international treasures that are a \npart of the world's heritage.\n  People of all faiths and nationalities, including Muslim communities \naround the world, have condemned this action. It is imperative that the \nUnited States Senate join the people and governments around the world \nin condemning these senseless acts of destruction, and call on the \nTaliban regime to immediately cease the destruction of other Pre-\nIslamic relics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2576-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2576-S2577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PRESCRIPTION DRUG SOLUTION MUST BE A PRIORITY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, few issues have caught the public's \nattention more than prescription drugs, and\n\n[[Page S2577]]\n\nfew are more deserving of Congress' attention.\n  We live at a time when we can clearly discern remarkable benefits \nfrom all manner of drugs. It is nothing short of miraculous when we \nconsider the relative ease and success of today's treatment of common \ndisorders, as compared with that of only two or three generations ago.\n  When World War II began, for example, penicillin and other similar \nantibiotics were known only to a small number of scientists. At the \nconclusion of the War in 1945, penicillin was widely available, used \nnot only for battle wounds but for infectious diseases in the general \npublic as well. Patients with high blood pressure or high cholesterol \nlevels were, at best, only partially and inadequately treated in the \n1940s and 1950s. Now success is the rule, rather than the exception. \nCalvin Coolidge's son died in 1924 as a result of a blister and a skin \ninfection after playing tennis at the White House. An infection such as \nthat today would be treated as simple, outpatient therapy.\n  While these examples are noteworthy and provide us with a valuable \nperspective of times gone by, the hard, cold fact is that many of these \nmodern miracles are still out of the reach of too many American \ncitizens. They simply cannot afford the drugs that might so often prove \nlifesaving, because of either no insurance or lack of drug coverage \nwithin their insurance.\n  Recent studies indicate that if you go to virtually any other \nindustrialized democracy, the cost of prescription drugs is about half \nwhat it is in the United States. We pay about double what anybody else \nin the industrialized world pays. That to me is so utterly unacceptable \nand unfair.\n  When Medicare was created 35 years ago, its benefits were based on \nprivate sector coverage, which rarely included prescription drugs. Now, \nhowever, virtually all private sector plans include coverage for \nprescription drugs, while Medicare does not. As a result, many millions \nof Americans, both Medicare age and younger have either inadequate or \nno prescription drug insurance at all. A byproduct of no coverage is \nthat these patients wind up paying the highest rates of anyone--an \naverage of 15 percent more than those with insurance. Many of these \nuninsureds, including the seniors often called ``The Greatest \nGeneration'' are not filling prescriptions because of their cost, \nchoosing between food and medicine. Or they split pills in half to make \nthem go farther. This is shameful. These are very real every day \nproblems that beg for help.\n  I strongly believe that all Medicare beneficiaries deserve affordable \ncoverage and financial protection as prescription drugs costs grow at \ndouble-digit rates. Astronomical drug prices have come hand-in-hand \nwith the great improvements in drug therapy. Spending for prescription \ndrugs in the United States doubled between 1990 and 1998. In each of \nthe 5 years between 1993 and 1998, prescription drug spending increased \nby an average of 12.4 percent. In 1999, the drug spending increase was \n19 percent and just last year we saw another double digit increase. My \noffice recently completed a three-year statewide survey of prescription \ndrug prices in South Dakota, using a sample of the most heavily \nprescribed drugs for seniors. I was astonished to find that over 60 \npercent of the drugs' prices grew at a pace that exceeded the cost-of-\nliving adjustment provided by Social Security, which many Medicare \nbeneficiaries rely on to meet their daily financial needs. In fact, 30 \npercent of the drugs increased at a pace that was double that of the \nCOLA.\n  In response to evidence such as this, along with having heard from \nthousands of concerned South Dakotans affected by skyrocketing drug \nprices, I have recommitted myself to finding a solution for the \nprescription drug needs of all Medicare beneficiaries. As such, I have \nreintroduced two bills that comprise the main pillars of my \nprescription drug plan: the Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act \nof 2001, and the Generic Pharmaceutical Access and Choice for Consumers \nAct of 2001. I don't proclaim these proposals to be the magic bullet \nthat solves all of our nation's prescription drug concerns but they are \nsensible, financially reasonable approaches that should be a part of an \noverall prescription drug plan for Medicare beneficiaries. The Fairness \nbill would provide Medicare beneficiaries access to prescription drugs \nat the same low prices that drug manufacturers offer their most favored \ncustomers. As well, I strongly believe we cannot develop a financially \nfeasible prescription drug benefit without maximizing the utilization \nof generic drugs. My proposal would increase access and choice in \nFederal programs by encouraging greater usage of generic \npharamaceuticals as a safe, less costly alternative to an often \nexpensive brand-name pharmaceutical. Generic pharmaceutical drugs have \nbeen shown to save consumers between 25 percent and 60 percent on their \naverage prescription drug and this plan would greatly benefit many of \nthe most vulnerable members of society.\n  I do believe Congress needs to create a universal, voluntary drug \nbenefit in the Medicare program, one that provides all Medicare \nbeneficiaries with affordable coverage for drug costs. Perhaps most \nimportantly for South Dakota's Medicare beneficiaries, the plan must \nensure access for beneficiaries in rural and hard-to-serve areas \nincluding incentives to rural pharmacies and the private entity serving \nthose areas to ensure rapid delivery of prescription drugs.\n  I believe that these efforts are both comprehensive and achievable in \nthe 107th Congress, and I will work closely with my colleagues to \naccomplish my personal goal of ensuring access to affordable \nprescription drugs for all Medicare beneficiaries both in South Dakota \nand around the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2577-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I'm sad to inform my colleagues \nthat on Saturday, March 17th, Washington State lost a great advocate \nfor families, and I lost both a good friend and mentor, with the \npassing of Grace Cole.\n  At this difficult time, my heart goes out to her family including her \ntwo brothers, four sons, four daughters in law, and six grandchildren. \nI want them to know what the rest of us have known for years: Grace \nCole made a difference. We are proud of her and grateful for all she \ndid. And even though she's no longer with us, her activism and her \npassion live on in the men and women she led into public service.\n  Well-known and well-loved in Shoreline, in Olympia, and among \nfamilies and educators throughout our State, Grace Cole set a new \nstandard for public service with strong words and a soft heart. She led \nthe way for advocates like me to follow her from the local school board \nto the Washington State legislature. And most important, she made a \ndifference for thousands of families throughout our state by standing \nup for education, the environment and social justice.\n  Mr. President, today moms and dads who serve their communities in \nWashington State know they can go on to serve at the State and Federal \nlevel.\n\n[[Page S2578]]\n\n Years ago, however, that path wasn't so clear. Grace Cole blazed that \ntrail and then helped others like me follow her into public service. \nWhen I look at the Washington state legislature, I see the impact Grace \nCole has made.\n  I first met Grace in the early 1980s when I started attending \nShoreline School Board meetings. During her many years of service on \nthe school board, Grace was a strong and honest voice who always came \ndown on the side of our children.\n  When I decided to run for the Shoreline School Board, Grace \nencouraged me and counseled me. During the time I served with Grace on \nthe school board, she always made sure we were acting in the best \ninterests of those we served. Grace knew just what to say, and on many \noccasions, her wise words helped ease tense moments.\n  In 1983, Grace was appointed to the House of Representatives. She was \nreelected seven times and retired in 1998. As long as Grace served in \nthe House, I knew Washington's children had a strong advocate.\n  In 1987, I decided to run for the Washington State Senate. Once \nagain, Grace was there for me as a counselor, a supporter, and a \nfriend. Even though she was running for reelection at the same time, \nGrace took the time to make sure that I and others could follow in her \nfootsteps. That is the way Grace was. She set a path and helped us \nfollow it.\n  Grace Cole also set a new standard for what it means to be an \noutstanding school board member. In fact, new members of the Shoreline \nSchool Board are often measured by the ``Grace Cole Standard.'' I've \nheard people say of new members, ``She'll be great--just like Grace \nCole.'' In 1998, the Shoreline School Board honored Grace with its \nfirst Distinguished Service Award.\n  What made Grace Cole such an icon? First, she knew how to lead. She \nlistened to all sides, helped bring people together, and knew how to \nput people at ease. She was also a community builder. She worked side-\nby-side with other parents to pass school levies. She put labels on \nletters and walked through neighborhoods knocking on doors to ensure \nvoters would go to the polls.\n  Most of all, Grace was compassionate and caring. Her passion for \nchildren drove everything she did. I remember her bill in the state \nlegislature to outlaw spanking in schools. It seemed like such an \nuphill battle, but Grace would always say, ``Kids need to learn by \nexample.'' She said that over and over again for years until her bill \nfinally passed. The bill's opponents eventually went along because they \nrealized that Grace Cole would never give up on something she believed \nin.\n  In the State legislature, Grace won the respect of all lawmakers on \nboth sides of the aisle. I knew that her time in the House was a \npersonal sacrifice for her. She had to leave her family in Shoreline to \nwork long hours in Olympia, then return home to attend community \nmeetings and to help others. During all her public service though, \nGrace made sure to always put her kids first.\n  For me, Grace was a perfect example of selfless community service. \nToday's leaders are too often judged on how much press they get or how \n``visible'' they are. Grace was the person who worked behind the scenes \nto make people's lives better.\n  I will miss Grace. She always knew the right thing to say, and she \nwas never afraid of tough votes. She didn't have to be. She knew to do \nthe right thing. Grace showed me and countless others the path to \npublic service. Over the years, so many have followed her--starting in \nPTA, serving on the school board, and then going to Olympia to fight \nfor their communities.\n  I know that at this difficult time her four sons and their families \nfeel tremendous sorrow. We all do, but through her work Grace left us \nso much to be proud of: a strong community of good schools, good \nneighborhoods, and good friends.\n  Grace had such a strong and positive spirit that I have a feeling \nwherever she is, she's organizing a coffee get-together to make sure \neveryone is doing the right thing. If there are envelopes to lick, \nphone calls to make, or laws to write, I am sure Grace is making sure \nit gets done.\n  I feel fortunate to have known Grace. I am proud to call her a mentor \nand guide, and I will miss her greatly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2578-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF LEA MIHALEVICH\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I would like to use this occasion to \nrecognize and commend the premier indoor high school track and field \nevent in the Nation. Found in my very own backyard, the Simplot Games \nare held annually at Holt Arena on the campus of Idaho State University \nin Pocatello, ID. For the past twenty-three consecutive years, the \nSimplot Games have provided an opportunity for thousands of youths to \ncompete with top-ranked athletes from every corner of the United States \nand Canada in a nurturing and supportive environment. Run almost solely \nby volunteers, the Games are a source of inspiration and pride for all \nparticipants. The J. R. Simplot Company, a sponsor of the Games, should \nbe applauded for its dedication to the athletes, not only financially, \nbut for providing such a stage to showcase so many talented young \npeople from around the nation.\n  The Simplot Games are held annually during the third weekend of \nFebruary on the fastest indoor track in the country. It is certain a \nfew national records will be broken every year before a cheering crowd \nof thousands, not to mention the national television audience. I had \nthe opportunity to attend the games this year and witness firsthand the \ncamaraderie and team spirit these exceptional young adults displayed. \nIt was impossible not to be caught up in the excitement of this unique \nevent.\n  The Simplot Games are sanctioned by USA Track and Field, and awards \nare presented to contenders finishing in the top six places of their \nrespective events. The Games are not just about athletics, but also \nabout providing guidance and advice to the young competitors. Many \nnotable athletes of Olympic and professional fame make a personal \ncommitment to be a positive influence on the participants through their \nwork with the Simplot Games. This year, Olympians included: Al Joyner, \nHonorary Chairman of the Simplot Games and 1984 Gold Medalist in the \ntriple jump; Dick Fosbury, 1968 Gold Medalist in the high jump and U.S. \nOlympic Hall of Famer; Paralympian Marlon Shirley, 2000 Gold Medalist \nin the 100-meter dash; Andre Phillip, 1988 gold medalist in the 400-\nmeter hurdles; and Dan O'Brien, 1996 Gold Medalist in the decathlon and \nUniversity of Idaho graduate.\n  In conjunction with the Games, the Adidas Golden Spike Invitational \nmeet was held during the Simplot events. This professional event \nbrought a hefty number of world class athletes to Pocatello to \nchallenge each other for qualifying marks for the 2004 Summer Olympic \nGames. Through the competition, one hometown favorite was a particular \nbright spot: Stacy Dragila, 2000\n\n[[Page S2579]]\n\nOlympic Gold Medalist in women's pole vaulting, eclipsed her own world \nrecord of fifteen feet, five inches, by a full inch and three quarters.\n  Next year the Simplot Games will be held February 14-16. I encourage \nall who compete or have sons and daughters that compete in track and \nfield to participate in this world-class event. If you cannot make the \ncompetition, or cheer from a seat in the arena, I invite you to watch \nthis exciting and uplifting event unfold from your own living room on \ntelevision. I am proud that my state of Idaho is the home of this \nwonderful event and its sponsor, the J.R. Simplot. I am also proud of \nall the athletes who compete, not only with the other participants but \nwith themselves, to be the best. It is encouraging for all Americans to \nsee how our children are capable of rising above our expectations and \naccomplish great things.\n  While I have the focus on Pocatello and Idaho State University, I \nwould like to congratulate the ISU women's basketball team for earning \nits first berth ever to the NCAA Women's Tournament. The Bengals went \nundefeated in the Big Sky Conference this year and tied the nation's \nlongest winning streak this season with 21 straight victories. Despite \nISU's first round loss to Vanderbilt, the Bengals showed a lot of heart \nand determination, and I am proud of all they accomplished this \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2579-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SHRM VISIT TO CAPITAL\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to welcome the \nmembers of the Society for Human Resource Management, SHRM, to \nWashington for their 18th Annual Employment Law and Legislative \nConference. Today, close to 300 SHRM members will visit Capitol Hill to \nshare their views on and experience with issues such as the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, health care, the Fair Labor Standards Act, pension \nreform, and Section 127 educational assistance.\n  The Society for Human Resource Management, SHRM, is a strong voice \nfor the human resource profession. SHRM represents its members on \nissues affecting the workplace, employment, employers, and employees. \nIt also provides them with invaluable services such as government and \nmedia representation, education and information services, conferences \nand seminars, online services, and publications.\n  SHRM was founded 52 years ago by a small group of ``personnel'' \nofficers to help the nation work through its post WW II labor-\nmanagement challenges and improve the professionalism of the industry. \nToday, SHRM's membership includes over 155,000 human resource \nprofessionals in all fifty states and ranges from small one-person \nconsulting firms to Fortune 500 companies. SHRM's members also \nrepresent a wide variety of industries, from the 25 percent who work in \nmanufacturing to the 15 percent who work in the service sector. Other \nmembers work in the transportation, utilities, retail, finance, \ninsurance, health, real estate, construction, and technology \nindustries.\n  I want to commend the members of SHRM for taking time out of their \ndemanding daily lives to come to Washington, D.C. to speak with their \nSenators and Representatives regarding the issues that affect their \nprofession. As a legislator, I cannot stress enough the importance of \nlegislative conferences through which members of associations like the \nSociety for Human Resource Management come to our nation's capital to \nparticipate in the legislative process. Citizen participation is a \ncrucial component of the legislative process because it allows \nlegislators and their staff to hear their constituents explain their \nexperiences as they live and work under our nation's laws. The \nknowledge that legislators gain through these conversations results in \nsounder legislation and, ultimately, a stronger democracy. Accordingly, \nI sincerely thank the members of SHRM for their commitment not only to \ntheir profession but to the political process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2579-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2579-S2582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1005.

A bill entitled the ``Health Care Access Improvement Act''; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Health Care \nAccess Improvement Act of 2001.'' This bill is designed to dramatically \nexpand rural America's access to modern health care.\n  The Health Care Access Improvement Act creates a significant tax \nincentive, which encourages doctors, dentists, physician assistants, \nlicensed mental health providers, and nurse practitioners to establish \npractices in under-served areas. Until now, rural areas have not been \nable to compete with the financial draw of urban settings and therefore \nhave had trouble attracting medical professionals to their communities. \nThe $1,000 per month tax credit will allow health care workers to enjoy \nthe advantages of rural life without drastic financial sacrifices. But \nthe real winners in this bill are the thousands of Americans whose \naccess to health care is almost impossible due to a lack of doctors and \ndentists in small town America.\n  There are nine counties in the great state of Montana which do not \nhave even one doctor. In these rural settings, agriculture is often the \nonly employer. Farming and ranching is hard, dangerous work. Serious \ninjuries can happen in an instant. And while Montanans have always been \nknown as a heartier breed of people, we get sick too. It is \nunreasonable to expect the farmer who has had a run-in with an auger or \nthe elderly rancher's widow to drive two hours or more to get stitched \nup or to have a crown on a tooth replaced. As doctors, dentists, \nphysicians assistants, mental health providers, and nurse practitioners \nare attracted to the more urban areas, Montanans and others in isolated \ncommunities will suffer. We must do what we can to ensure that these \nhealth care providers come to rural America, we must give them some \nincentive to practice in these smaller communities so that citizens \nliving in these areas can finally enjoy the medical treatment they \ndeserve.\n  This problem is not unique to my State of Montana, alone. In fact, \nthroughout the United States, we continue to experience scarcity in all \nor parts of 2,692 counties. In rural areas, serious shortages exist in \nthe supply of primary care practitioners and specialty care \npractitioners. This is precisely the reason why this bill is so \nimportant.\n  Twenty-nine health care organizations believe strongly in this \nlegislation, as well. They actively support the introduction of this \nlegislation to provide a tax credit to health care providers \nestablishing practices in underserved areas because they realize it \nwill help thousands of health care providers make decisions to \nestablish their practices in America's underserved communities. So many \ncommunities whose access to qualified health care professionals has \nbeen a constant ``revolving door'' will be greatly helped by this tax \ncredit. Mr. President, I hold here in my hand a letter on behalf of \nthese various groups which I ask to be inserted in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BURNS. It is important to note that less than 11 percent of the \nnation's physicians are practicing in non-metropolitan areas, less than \n11 percent. This is a significant number, folks. We owe it to the men, \nwomen, children, elderly and families living in these non-urban \ncommunities to take steps necessary to increase this percentage and get \nmore health care providers to their communities.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services uses a ratio of one \nprimary care physician per 3,500 population as the standard for a \nprimary care Health Professional Shortage Area, HPSA. More than 20 \nmillion Americans live in rural and frontier HPSAs. Most of the State \nof Montana is beyond rural, it's frontier. As of 1997, more than 2,200 \nphysicians were needed nationwide to satisfy these non-metropolitan \nprimary care HPSAs shortages. I think this bill is a step in the right \ndirection.\n\n[[Page S2585]]\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to work with me and join in \nsupport of this legislation. Rural Montana, rural America, and health \nservice providers all benefit from increased access, service and a \nbetter quality of life. In short, everyone wins with this legislation. \nI look forward to making this legislation work for so many of the men, \nwomen and children in need of quality health care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 569\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It is estimated that more \n     than 20,000 clinicians are needed to eliminate all of the \n     Primary Care Dental, Medical and Mental Health, Health \n     Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) now designated across our \n     nation.\n       Please accept our endorsement for this critical proposal \n     that will improve America's public health and access to \n     health care in underserved areas. Thank you for offering such \n     an important proposal at the outset of the legislative \n     session and for your continued leadership. Please let us know \n     how we may be helpful to you as we work together to improve \n     access to care. We are committed to provide sustained \n     assistance as you move this proposal forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                             Richard W. Valachovic, D.M.D., M.P.H.\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n       On behalf of the: American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry; \n     American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine; \n     American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy; American \n     Association of Community Dental Programs; American \n     Association for Dental Research; American Association of \n     Public Health Dentistry; American College of Nurse-Midwives; \n     American College of Nurse Practitioners; American College of \n     Osteopathic Emergency Physicians; American College of \n     Osteopathic Family Physicians; American Dental Association; \n     American Dental Education Association; American Dental \n     Hygienists' Association; American Medical Student \n     Association; American Optometric Association; American \n     Osteopathic Association; American Psychological Association; \n     American Student Dental Association; Association of Academic \n     Health Centers; Association of American Medical Colleges; \n     Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges; \n     Association of Schools of Allied Health Professions; \n     Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry; Association \n     of Schools of Public Health; Clinical Social Work Federation; \n     Coalition of Higher Education Assistance Organizations; \n     National Association of Graduate-Professional Students; \n     National League for Nursing and National Organization of \n     Nurse Practitioners Faculties.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Levin, Mr. Specter, \n        Mrs. Carnahan, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Miller, Ms. Collins, and Mr. \n        Carper):\n  S. 570. A bill to establish a permanent Violence Against Women Office \nat the Department of Justice; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, I address once more the subject of \nviolence against women. It is still a problem.\n  According Justice Department statistics, violence against women by \nintimate partners is actually down, falling 21 percent from 1993 to \n1998. Luckily, we can thank the programs created by the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, which I introduced almost a decade ago, and the \nefforts of advocates all across this country, from Dover to Denver, in \neducating us to confront domestic violence head-on.\n  Yet, unfortunately, we are far from eradicating this crime. It is a \ncrime which harms women, leaving them battered and blue, sending them \nto the hospital, and causing them to miss work. We have also a crime \nthat affects their children--children who cower while watching their \nmother get battered, children who too often then act out their own \naggression.\n  I would love to say that, in my lifetime, we will break this cycle of \nfamily violence. But, we are not there yet.\n  One way of working towards this goal, however, is to preserve the \nViolence Against Women Office at the Justice Department. Today I, along \nwith Senators DeWine, Levin, Specter,\n\n[[Page S2586]]\n\nCarnahan, Hutchison, Miller, Collins, and Carper, have introduced a \nbill making the Office permanent.\n  This office is vital because it has been instrumental in our efforts \nto help women harmed by domestic violence. Since its inception, the \nViolence Against Women Office has distributed over one billion dollars \nin its first five years to states, localities, tribal governments, and \nprivate organizations. These governments and groups, in turn, have used \nthese precious funds to improve the investigation and prosecution of \ncrimes of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault; to train \nprosecutors, police officers, and judges on the special aspects of \ncases involving violence against women; and to offer the needed \nservices to victims and their families.\n  In particular, this funding includes the incredibly successful STOP \ngrants--grants which fund the Services for the Training of Officers and \nProsecutors. These STOP grants--the largest grant program created by \nthe Violence Against Women Act, are especially effective because each \ngrant must be used to upgrade three vital areas: prosecution, law \nenforcement, and victim services.\n  Likewise, the Violence Against Women Office has awarded grants to \nencourage arrest policies, which seek to educate our police officers \nthat, when they answer a call for help by a woman being battered, they \nshould not turn away. This battery is not a private matter, to be left \nbehind closed doors--where a man as king of his castle can do as he \npleases. No, not anymore. That woman's abuser is committing a crime and \nhe is subject to arrest and prosecution.\n  The Office has also distributed monies to our rural areas as part of \nthe program for Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement. I \nam sorry to say but this problem is in every part of this nation, and \nthe Violence Against Women Office has sent funds to every corner of \nAmerica, all the way from Orem, UT to Waterbury, VT. Yet, despite its \npervasiveness, domestic violence itself is under attack.\n  And the Violence Against Women Office is leading the fight. Given the \nsuccess of the many programs of the Violence Against Women Act as \nadministered by the Office, I believe that the time has come to make \nthe Violence Against Women Office permanent by statute. This Office is \nlong overdue a strong foundation.\n  Moreover, the Office is due the prestige it deserves. My bill \nrealizes this aim in a couple of ways. First, my bill provides that the \nOffice be separate from any division or component of the Justice \nDepartment. In this regard, with the Office's Director reporting \ndirectly to the Associate Attorney General, as my bill requires, the \nOffice will be shielded from any attempts to undo the great work it has \nhistorically accomplished. Why mess with success?\n  Second, my bill provides that the Director of the Office shall now be \nnominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. This, too, \nraises the prestige of the work that the Violence Against Women Office \nseeks to accomplish day-in and day-out. It also subjects the selection \nof the Director, who performs the essential job of implementing the \nViolence Against Women Act, to the democratic process--thereby insuring \nthat we attract the best candidates.\n  Yes, indeed, we are far from solving the crime of domestic violence. \nBut let us take a step in the right direction. Join me in making the \nViolence Against Women Office permanent. The safety of women and their \nfamilies depends on it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 570\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the location of the National Museum of \nthe United States Army; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncreate a National Museum for the United States Army. This endeavor is \nimportant to every American, every veteran, and all Members of \nCongress.\n  I would be greatly pleased to have my colleagues join me in \nsponsoring this worthy legislation.\n  Our great Capital City and its surrounding countryside host every \nkind of museum imaginable, but not one for one of this Nation's \ngreatest institutions, the United States Army. Area museums serving the \nAmerican public today are all worthy museums, but this great city and \nthis great Nation are sadly without a museum for its citizen-soldiers \nwho have sacrificed so much for their country.\n  The purpose of the legislation which I introduce today is to \ndesignate a place for the Army Museum to be built to preserve, \ninterpret, and display the important role the Army has played in the \nhistory of our Nation.\n  What I propose is not new. Over the past two decades many sites have \nbeen suggested and most are unsatisfactory because they have \nunrealistic development requirements, because their locations are \nunsuitable for such an esteemed building, or they lacked an appropriate \nArmy setting. Since 1983, the process of choosing a site for the Army \nMuseum has been a long cumbersome undertaking. A site selection \ncommittee was organized and it developed\n\n[[Page S2587]]\n\na list of 17 criteria which any candidate site is required to possess \nbefore it was to be selected as home to the Army Museum. Among other \nrequirements, these criteria required such things as: an area \npermitting movement of large military vehicles for exhibits and tractor \ntrailer trucks for shipments, commanding and aesthetically pleasing \nvistas, positive impact on environment, closeness to public \ntransportation, closeness to a Washington Tourmobile route, convenience \nto Fort Myer for support by the 3rd Infantry, The Old Guard, \naccessibility by private automobile, adequate parking for 150 staff and \nofficial visitors, adequate parking for a portion of the 1,000,000 \nvisitors per year that do not use public transportation, food service \nfor staff and visitors, area low in crime and safe for staff and \nvisitors, suitable space, 300,000 square feet, for construction, a low \nwater table, good drainage and no history of flooding and suitability \nfor subterranean construction.\n  Since 1984, more than 60 sites have been studied, yet only a handful \nhas been worthy of any serious consideration.\n  The most prominent recent site suggestions have included Carlisle, \nPennsylvania; Gettysburg, Pennsylvania; the Washington Navy Yard; and \nFort Belvoir, Virginia. Of these sites, most clearly have \ncharacteristics which are directly contrary to the established criteria \nfor site selection. The extraordinary distance of Carlisle from \nWashington speaks for itself. The suggestion that the Army locate its \nmuseum in Washington's Navy Yard is also directly contrary to \nprerequisites for site selection. The Washington Navy Yard is situated \nin a dangerous and difficult-to-get-to part of Washington, on the \nAnacostia River and on a precarious 50-year flood plain. Because this \narea floods so often, a ``Washington Navy Yard Army Museum'', let me \npause to repeat this awkward location a ``Washington Navy Yard Army \nMuseum'', might well suffer the embarrassment of being closed ``due to \nflooding.'' This would not be the way America should honor Army \nhistory. The Navy Yard over the years has become less military in \ncharacter and a patchwork home to various government offices. To locate \nthe Army Museum in an old Navy yard, which is sometimes under water, \nwould send a clear signal to visitors that choosing a home to their \nhistory was nothing more than an afterthought.\n\n  In 1991, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed that the site \nsearches include the Mount Vernon Corridor as a possible location for \nthe Army Museum. Fort Belvoir quickly became a very attractive \nlocation. Fort Belvoir offers a 48-acre site, only 5 minutes from \nInterstate 95, which is traveled by over 300 million vehicles annually, \nit is 3 minutes from the Fairfax County parkway, and is served by Metro \nBus, the Fort Belvoir site fronts on US Route 1, Richmond Highway and \nis next to the main gate of Fort Belvoir.\n  The Fort Belvoir site is also a winner historically. It is on a \nportion of General George Washington's properties when he was Commander \nin Chief of the Continental Army. It is located on the historical \nheritage trail of the Mount Vernon Estate, The Grist Mill, Woodlawn \nPlantation, Pohick Church, and Gunston Hall. Situating the Army Museum \nat Fort Belvoir is a natural tie to a long established military and \nhistoric installation that has already been approved by the National \nCapitol Planning Commission to be used for community activities, which \nincludes museums, as a part of the Fort Belvoir Master Plan. The Fort \nBelvoir site meets all 17 criterions originally established by the \nArmy.\n  The bill I am introducing today names Fort Belvoir as the site for \nthe Army Museum. Fort Belvoir is the best location in the Washington \narea to host an Army museum. Army veterans want to remember and show \ntheir contribution to history in an Army setting and culture in which \nthey themselves once served. Fort Belvoir is the perfect place to do \nthis and it qualifies on every criterion established in 1983 by the \nArmy's Site Selection Committee. For Belvoir is Army and should host \nArmy history. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues support this bill and \nbring the 18-year search for a home for the Army Museum to a close by \nselecting a worthy home for one of this Nation's greatest institutions.\n  Thomas Jefferson wrote to John Adams in 1817, ``A morsel of genuine \nhistory is a thing so rare as to be always valuable.'' I am pleased to \nsee that the National U.S. Army Museum is a task for this Congress at \nthe beginning of a new century, at a time when all Americans are proud \nof their Nation's accomplishments and those who made it all possible. I \nam absolutely concerned that all our veterans are honored, and honored \nhonorably. Every year Army veterans bring their families to Washington \nand are disappointed that no museum exists as a tribute to their \nservice and sacrifice. Time is running out for many Army veterans, \nespecially those of World War II. I urge my colleagues to review this \nimportant piece of legislation and support its passage. Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill and the site \nselection criteria be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 571\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Museum of the \n     United States Army Site Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Nation does not have adequate knowledge of the role \n     of the Army in the development and protection of the United \n     States.\n       (2) The Army, the oldest United States military service, \n     lacks a primary museum with public exhibition space and is in \n     dire need of a permanent facility to house and display its \n     historical artifacts.\n       (3) Such a museum would serve to enhance the preservation, \n     study, and interpretation of Army historical artifacts.\n       (4) Many Army artifacts of historical significance and \n     national interest which are currently unavailable for public \n     display would be exhibited in such a museum.\n       (5) While the Smithsonian Institution would be able to \n     assist the Army in developing programs of presentations \n     relating to the mission, values, and heritage of the Army, \n     such a museum would be a more appropriate institution for \n     such programs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide for a permanent site for a museum to serve \n     as the National Museum of the United States Army;\n       (2) to ensure the preservation, maintenance, and \n     interpretation of the artifacts and history collected by such \n     museum;\n       (3) to enhance the knowledge of the American people of the \n     role of the Army in United States history; and\n       (4) to provide a facility for the public display of the \n     artifacts and history of the Army.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to allow \nchildren enrolled in the State children's health insurance program to \nbe eligible for benefits under the pediatric vaccine distribution \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S2588]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues \nSenators Chafee, Durbin, Reed, Murray, and Boxer to introduce a bill to \nclarify that children receiving health insurance under the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, in States like California \nare eligible for free vaccines under the federal Vaccines for Children, \nVFC, program.\n  Providing low-income children with access to immunizations is a high \npriority of mine. I believe that we must work to ensure that our \nnation's youngsters begin life protected against the diseases for which \nthere are vaccinations available.\n  The Centers for Disease Control, CDC, estimates that in many areas of \nthe U.S. immunization rates continue to fall below 75 percent among \nchildren under 2 years old. This is unacceptable.\n  In 1993, the U.S. experienced the largest outbreak of whooping cough \nin over 20 years. Additionally, from 1989 to 1991, a measles outbreak \nresulted in 123 deaths and 55,000 cases. These are diseases for which \nvaccinations are available.\n  While we are doing a better job of educating families about the \nimportance of receiving timely immunizations, we must now focus our \nefforts on ensuring access to immunizations for those most in need.\n  The federal Vaccines for Children program, created by Congress in \n1993, P.L. 105-33, is an excellent example of a program that provides \nvaccines at no cost to low-income children.\n  To be eligible for the VFC program under current federal law, a child \nmust be a Medicaid recipient, uninsured, or of American Indian or \nAlaskan Native heritage.\n  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, argues that a \nchild participating in SCHIP, called Healthy Families in California, is \nnot eligible for the free immunizations provided by the VFC program \nbecause that child is ``insured.''\n  I believe the interpretation of ``insured'' is not consistent with \nCongress's intent in establishing SCHIP. I believe that in defining the \nterm ``insured'' at that time Congress clearly meant private health \ninsurance plans.\n  Children enrolled in SCHIP, or in my State the Healthy Families \nprogram, are participating in a federal-state, subsidized insurance \nplan. Healthy Families is a state-operated program. Families apply to \nthe State for participation. They are not insured by a private, \ncommercial plan, as traditionally defined or as defined in the Vaccine \nfor Children's law (42 U.S.C. sec. 1396s(b)(2)(B).\n  Several California based provider groups agree. For example, in \nFebruary 1999 the California Medical Association wrote to then-HHS \nSecretary Donna Shalala: ``As they are participants in a federal and \nstate-subsidized health program, these individuals are not ``insured'' \nfor the purposes of 42 U.S.C. sec. 1396s(b)(B).''\n  HHS has interpreted the law so narrowly that as many as 630,000 \nchildren in California under California's Healthy Families program have \nlost or will lose their eligibility to receive free vaccines. \nApproximately 428,641 kids have lost eligibility to date.\n  The VFC program is particularly important to California in ensuring \naccess to life-saving immunizations for two reasons.\n  First, California ranks 40th overall among states having children \nfully immunized by the age of 19 to 35 months. In 1996, however, \nCalifornia ranked 32nd. Clearly the situation in California is getting \nworse rather than better. Allowing SCHIP children to access \nimmunizations through the VFC program could increase the number of \nchildren receiving vaccinations in the State.\n  Second, in creating SCHIP in California, the State chose to set up a \nprogram under which the State contracts with private insurers, rather \nthan providing eligible children care through Medicaid, Medi-Cal in \nCalifornia.\n  The California Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board, which is \nadministering the new program with the Department of Health Services, \nwrote to HHS in February 1999: ``It is imperative that states like \nCalifornia, who have implemented SCHIP using private health insurance, \nbe given the same support and eligibility for the Vaccines for \nChildren, VFC, program at no cost as States which have chosen to expand \ntheir Medicaid program.''\n  A study conducted by the California Medical Association found that \npediatric capitation rates for children ages 0-21 averages $24.24 per \nchild per month. However, a 1998 Towers Perrin Study of physician costs \nfor children ages 0-21 years found averages to be $47.00 per child per \nmonth. These numbers demonstrate the discrepancy between payment and \ncosts for children enrolled in a capitation plan, which includes all \nchildren enrolled in California's Healthy Families program.\n  Add to this discrepancy in payments the fact that children need 18 to \n22 immunizations before the age of 6. This process becomes quite \ncostly!\n  The discrepancy in payment and costs means that many California \nphysicians cannot afford to provide patients with the necessary life-\nsaving immunizations, so children in my State are often going without \nvaccinations.\n  This reality has caused serious problems for children in California.\n  For example: From 1993 to 1997, Orange County California had 85 \nhospitalizations and four deaths related to chicken pox. Across the \nState in 1996 there were 15 deaths and 1,172 hospitalizations related \nto chicken pox. The Immunization Branch in California reported over \n1,000 whooping cough cases, including 5 deaths, in 1998--the largest \nnumber of cases and deaths since the 1960s.\n  Whooping cough and chicken pox are two examples of diseases for which \nthere are vaccinations available.\n  We must do more to increase access to vaccinations for our nation's \nchildren.\n  In 1998, as many 743,000 poor children in California, who were \nuninsured or on Medicaid, received these vaccines. This number is down \nby approximately 32,000 children in comparison to the 1997 immunization \nfigures for California's poor children.\n  What can be so basic to public health than immunization against \ndisease? Do we really want our children to get polio, measles, mumps, \nchicken pox, rubella, and whooping cough, diseases for which we have \neffective vaccines, diseases which we have practically eradicated by \nwidespread immunization?\n  Congress recognized the importance of immunizations in creating the \nVFC program, with many Congressional leaders at the time arguing that \nchildhood immunization is one of the most cost-effective steps we can \ntake to keep our children healthy.\n  It makes no sense to me to withhold immunizations from children who \n1. have been getting them when they were uninsured and 2. have no other \nway to get them once they become insured.\n  According to an Annie E. Casey Foundation report, 22 percent of \nCalifornia's two-year olds are not immunized. Add to that the fact that \nwe have one of the highest uninsured rates in the country.\n  Over 28 percent of California's children are without health \ninsurance, compared to 25 percent nationally, according to the Annie E. \nCase Foundation. Clearly, there is a need.\n  The San Francisco Chronicle editorialized on March 10, 1998: ``More \nthan half a million California children should not be deprived of \nvaccinations or health insurance because of a technicality . . .,'' \ncalling the denial of vaccines ``a game of semantics.''\n  Children's health should not be a ``game of semantics.'' Proper \nchildhood immunizations are fundamental to a lifetime of good health. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, to help \nme keep our children healthy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 574. A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act \nto allow States to provide health benefits coverage for parents of \nchildren eligible for child health assistance under the State \nchildren's health insurance program, to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. Today, I am introducing legislation to \nallow States, at their option, to enroll parents in the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, known as S- CHIP.\n  This bill could provide insurance to 2.7 million uninsured parents \nnationwide and 356,000 parents in California at a time when the \nuninsured rate in\n\n[[Page S2589]]\n\nthe country and in California continues to rise.\n  Congress has appropriated a total of $17.2 billion for SCHIP for \nFiscal Years 1998, 1999, and 2000, or about $4.3 billion for each \nFiscal Year.\n  SCHIP is a low-cost health insurance program for low-income children \nup to age 19 that Congress created in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. \nAfter three years, SCHIP covers approximately two million children \nacross the country, out of the three to four million children estimated \nto be eligible.\n  Congress created SCHIP as a way to provide affordable health \ninsurance to uninsured children in families that cannot afford to buy \nprivate insurance. States can choose from three options when designing \ntheir SCHIP program: 1. expansion of their current Medicaid program; 2. \ncreation of a separate State insurance program; or 3. a combination of \nboth approaches.\n  California's SCHIP is known as the Healthy Families program and is \nset up as a public-private program rather than a Medicaid expansion. \nHealthy Families allows California families to use federal and State \nSCHIP funds to purchase private managed care insurance for their \nchildren.\n  Under the federal law, States generally cover children in families \nwith incomes up to 200 percent of poverty, although States can go \nhigher if their Medicaid eligibility was higher than that when SCHIP \nwas enacted in 1997 or through waivers by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. In California, eligibility was raised to 250 percent of \npoverty in November 1999, which increased the number of eligible \nchildren by 129,000.\n  Basic benefits in the California SCHIP program include inpatient and \noutpatient hospital services, surgical and medical services, lab and x-\nray services, and well-baby and well-child care, including \nimmunizations. Additional services which States are encouraged to \nprovide, and which California has elected to include, are prescription \ndrugs and mental health, vision, hearing, dental, and preventive care \nservices such as prenatal care and routine physical examinations.\n  In California, enrollees pay a $5.00 co-payment per visit which \ngenerally applies to inpatient services, selected outpatient services, \nand various other health care services.\n  The United States faces a serious health care crisis that continues \nto grow as more and more people go without insurance. The U.S. has seen \nan increase in the uninsured by nearly five million since 1994.\n  Currently, 42 million people, or 17 percent, of the non- elderly \npopulation in the country are uninsured. In California, 22 percent, or \n6.8 million, of the nonelderly are uninsured.\n  A study cited in the May 2000 California Journal found that as many \nas 2,333 Californians lose health insurance every day. A May 29, 2000 \nSan Jose Mercury article cited California's emergency room doctors who \n``estimate that anywhere from 20 percent to 40 percent of their walk-in \npatients have no health coverage.''\n  Among the 1.85 million uninsured children in California, nearly two-\nthirds or 1.3 million are eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP, \ncalled Healthy Families in the state, according to the University of \nCalifornia at Los Angeles.\n\n  Last year, we passed legislation enabling California to keep \napproximately $350 million of the $600 million unspent SCHIP funds. My \nstate and others were at risk of losing funds because the law required \nstates to use all their funds in three years and time was running out \non the 1998 funds. Since my state and others still have these funds, as \nwell as funds allotted in fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2001, enrolling \nparents and more children could be a good way to increase enrollment.\n  The bill we are introducing today would gives States the option to \nexpand SCHIP coverage to parents whose children are eligible for the \nprogram at whatever income eligibility level the state sets. In my \nState, that would mean a family of four earning up to $42,625 would be \neligible for coverage.\n  This bill would retain current funding formulas, State allotments, \nbenefits, eligibility rules, and cost-sharing requirements. The only \nchange is to allow States the option to enroll parents.\n  An SCHIP expansion should be accomplished without substituting SCHIP \ncoverage for private insurance or other public health insurance that \nparents might already have. The current SCHIP law requires that State \nplans include adequate provisions preventing substitution and my bill \nretains that. For example, many States require that an enrollee be \nuninsured before he or she is eligible for the program. This bill does \nnot change that requirement.\n  This bill is important for several reasons. More than 75 percent of \nuninsured children live with parents who are uninsured. Many experts \nsay that by covering parents of uninsured children we can actually \ncover more children.\n  If an entire family is enrolled in a plan and seeing the same \ndoctors, in other words, if the care is convenient for the whole \nfamily, all the members of the family are more likely to be insured and \nto stay healthy. This is a key reason for this legislation, bringing in \nmore children by targeting the whole family.\n  Private health insurance in the commercial market can be very \nexpensive. The average annual cost of family coverage in private health \nplans is around $6,000. California has some of the lowest-priced health \ninsurance, yet the State ranks fourth in uninsured.\n  In California, high housing costs, high gas and electricity prices, \nexpensive commutes, and a high cost-of-living make it difficult for \nmany California families to buy health insurance. Over eight in ten of \nuninsured Californians are working, but they do not earn enough to buy \nprivate insurance. SCHIP is a practical and attractive alternative.\n  Many low-income people work for employers who do not offer health \ninsurance. In fact, forty percent of California small businesses, those \nemploying between three and 50 employees, do not offer health \ninsurance, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study in June 2000. \nCalifornians in 1999 were 6.6 percentage points less likely to receive \nhealth insurance through employers than the average American, 62.8 \npercent versus 69.4 percent, according to UCLA experts.\n  We need to give hard-working, lower income American families \naffordable, comprehensive health insurance, and this bill does that.\n  The California Medical Association and Alliance of Catholic Health \nCare agree with us and support this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and passing this bill. \nBy giving States the option to cover parents--whole families--we can \nreduce the number of uninsured, encourage the enrollment of more \nchildren, and help keep people healthy by maximizing this valuable, but \ncurrently under-utilized program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Ms. Snowe).\n       S. 575. A bill entitled the ``Hospital Length of Stay Act \n     of 2001'', to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, Senator Olympia Snowe and I are \nintroducing a bill to guarantee that the decision of how long a patient \nstays in the hospital is left to the attending physician. Our \nlegislation would require health insurance plans to cover the length of \nhospital stay for any procedure or illness as determined by the \nphysician to be medically appropriate, in consultation with the \npatient.\n  The bill is endorsed by the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican College of Surgeons, the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, and the American Psychological Association.\n  We are introducing this bill because many people, patients and \nphysicians, have told us that HMOs set limits on hospital stays that \nare shorter than what the attending physicians believe are medically \nnecessary. In my view, only the physician who is taking care of the \npatient understands the patient's full medical history and the \npatient's medical condition and needs. Every patient's condition and \ncourse of illness varies. Patients respond differently to treatments. \nComplications arise. The doctor should decide when patients are \nmedically ready to be discharged, not an insurance plan.\n  The American Medical Association has developed patient-based \ndischarge criteria which say: ``Patients should not be discharged from \nthe hospital\n\n[[Page S2590]]\n\nwhen their disease or symptoms cannot be adequately treated or \nmonitored in the discharge setting.''\n  A number of physicians have shared with me their great frustration \nwith the health care climate, in which they feel they spend too much of \ntime trying to get permission and justify their decisions on medical \nnecessity to insurance companies.\n  A California pediatrician told me of a child with very bad asthma. \nThe insurance plan authorized 3 days in the hospital; the doctor wanted \n4-5 days. He told me about a baby with infant botulism (poisoning), a \nbaby with a toxin that had spread from the intestine to the nervous \nsystem so that the child could not breathe. The doctor thought a 10-14 \nday hospital stay was medically necessary for the baby; the insurance \nplan insisted on one week.\n  A California neurologist told my staff about a seven-year-old girl \nwith an ear infection and a fever who went to the doctor. When her \nillness developed into pneumonia, she was admitted to the hospital. \nAfter two days she was sent home, but she then returned to the hospital \nthree times because her insurance plan only covered a certain number of \ndays. The third time she returned she had meningitis, which can be life \nthreatening. The doctor said that if this girl had stayed in the \nhospital the first time for five to seven days, the antibiotics would \nhave killed the infection and the meningitis would never have \ndeveloped.\n  Another California physician told my office about a patient who \nneeded total hip replacement because her hip had failed. The doctor \nbelieved a seven-day stay was warranted; the plan would only authorize \nfive.\n  A Chico, California, maternity ward nurse put it this way: ``People's \ntreatment depends on the type of insurance they have rather than what's \nbest for them.'' A Laguna Niguel, California woman, Gwen Placko, wrote \nthis to me: ``. . . doctors have become mere employees of for-profit \ninsurance companies. They are no longer captains of their own `ships' \nso to speak. . . Only doctors should be the ones to make decisions for \nthe direct treatment and benefit of their patients.''\n  Physicians say they have to wage a battle with insurance companies to \ngive patients the hospital care they need and to justify their \ndecisions about patient care.\n  A study by the American Academy of Neurology found that the Milliman \nand Robertson guidelines used by many insurance companies on length of \nstay are ``extraordinarily short in comparison to a large National \nLibrary of Medicine database . .. And that [the guidelines] do not \nrelate to anything resembling the average hospital patient or attending \nphysician. . . .'' The neurologists found that these guidelines were \n``statistically developed'' and not scientifically sound or clinically \nrelevant.\n  The arbitrary limits HMOs and insurance plans have set are resulting \nin unintended consequences. Some 7 in 10 physicians said that in \ndealing with managed care plans, they have exaggerated the severity of \na patient's condition to ``prevent him or her from being sent home from \na hospital prematurely.''\n  The American College of Surgeons said it all when this prestigious \norganization wrote: ``We believe very strongly that any health care \nsystem or plan that removes the surgeon and the patient from the \nmedical decision-making process only undermines the quality of that \npatient's care and his or her health and well being. . . . \nspecifically, single numbers [of days] cannot and should not be used to \nrepresent a length of stay for a given procedure'', April 24, 1997. ACS \nwrote, ``We believe very strongly that any health care system or plan \nthat removes the surgeon and the patient from the medical decision \nmaking process only undermines the quality of that patient's care and \nhis or her health and well being.''\n  The American Medical Association wrote, ``We are gratified that this \nbill would promote the fundamental concept, which the AMA has always \nendorsed, that medical decisions should be made by patients and their \nphysicians, rather than by insurers or legislators. . . We appreciate \nyour initiative and ongoing efforts to protect patients by ensuring \nthat physicians may identify medically appropriate lengths of stay, \nunfettered by third party payers.''\n  The American Psychological Association wrote me, ``We are pleased to \nsupport this legislation, which will require all health plans to follow \nthe best judgment of the patient and attending provider when \ndetermining length of stay for inpatient treatment.''\n  Americans are disenchanted with the health insurance system in this \ncountry, as HMO hassles never seem to end and physicians are \neffectively overruled by insurance companies. Doctors and patients feel \nthat patient care is compromised in a climate in which anonymous \ninsurance clerks interfere with medical decision- making.\n  This bill is one step toward returning medical decision- making to \nthose medical professionals trained to make medical decisions.\n  To summarize, the Hospital Length of Stay Act of 2001:\n  Requires plans to cover hospital lengths of stay for all illnesses \nand conditions as determined by the physician, in consultation with the \npatient, to be medically appropriate;\n  Prohibits plans from requiring providers (physicians) to obtain a \nplan's prior authorization for a hospital length of stay;\n  Prohibits plans from denying eligibility or renewal for the purpose \nof avoiding these requirements;\n  Prohibits plans from penalizing or otherwise reducing or limiting \nreimbursement of the attending physician because the physician provided \ncare in accordance with the requirements of the bill; and\n  Prohibits plans from providing monetary or other incentives to induce \na physician to provide care inconsistent with these requirements.\n  It includes language clarifying that: nothing in the bill requires \nindividuals to stay in the hospital for a fixed period of time for any \nprocedure; plans may require copayments but copayments for a hospital \nstay determined by the physician cannot exceed copayments for any \npreceding portion of the stay.\n  It does not pre-empt state laws that provide greater protection.\n  It applies to private insurance plans, Medicare, Medicaid, Medigap, \nfederal employees' plans, Children's Health Insurance Plan, the Indian \nHealth Service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 576. A bill to require health insurance coverage for certain \nreconstructive surgery; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill to \nrequire health insurance plans to cover medically necessary \nreconstructive surgery for congenital defects, developmental \nabnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors, or disease.\n  This bill is modeled on a California law and responds to reports that \ninsurance plans are denying coverage for reconstructive surgery that \ndoctors say is medically necessary. Too many plans are too quick to \nlabel it ``cosmetic surgery.'' The American Medical News has called the \nHMOs stance, ``a classic health plan word game. . . .''\n  Dr. Henry Kawamoto, testifying before the California Assembly \nCommittee on Insurance stated:\n\n       It used to be that if you were born with something \n     deforming, or were in an accident and had bad scars, the \n     surgery performed to fix the problem was considered \n     reconstructive surgery. Now, insurers of many kinds are \n     calling it cosmetic surgery and refusing to pay for it.\n\n  Many doctors have told me that before the heavy penetration of \nmanaged care, repairing a person's abnormalities was considered \nreconstructive surgery and insurance companies reimbursed for the \nmedical, hospital, and surgical costs. But today, many insurance \ncompanies and managed care organizations will not pay for \nreconstruction of many deformities because they deem them to be \n``cosmetic'' and not a ``functional'' repair.\n  This bill is endorsed by the March of Dimes, Easter Seals, the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the National Organization for Rare \nDisorders, the American College of Surgeons, the American Society of \nPlastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, the American Association of \nPediatric Plastic Surgeons and the American Society of Maxillofacial \nSurgeons.\n  The children who face refusals to pay for surgery are the true \nevidence that this bill is needed. Here are some of the examples that \nwere brought to the California legislature:\n\n[[Page S2591]]\n\n  Hanna Gremp, a 6-year old from California, was born with a congenital \nbirth defect, called bilateral microtia, the absence of an inner ear. \nOnce the first stage of the surgery was complete, the Gremp's HMO \ndenied the next surgery for Hanna. They called the other surgeries \n``cosmetic'' and not medically necessary.\n  Michael Hatfield, a 19-year old from Texas, has gone through similar \nstruggles. He was born with a congenital birth defect that is known as \na midline facial cleft. The self-insured plan his parents had only paid \nfor a small portion of the surgery which reconstructed his nose. The \nHMO also refused to pay any part of the surgery that reconstructed his \ncheekbones and eye sockets. The HMO considered some of these surgeries \nto be ``cosmetic.''\n  Cigna Health Care denied coverage for surgery to construct an ear for \na little California girl born without one and only after adverse press \ncoverage reversed its position saying that, ``It was determined that \nstudies have shown some functional improvement following surgery.''\n  Qual-Med, another California HMO, initially denied coverage for \nreconstructive surgery for a little boy who also had microtia, \nauthorizing it only after many appeals and two years delay.\n  The bill uses medically-recognized terms to distinguish between \nmedically necessary surgery and cosmetic surgery. It defines medically \nnecessary reconstructive surgery as surgery ``performed to correct or \nrepair abnormal structures of the body caused by congenital defects, \ndevelopmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors, or disease to \n(1) improve functions; or (2) give the patient a normal appearance, to \nthe extent possible, in the judgment of the physician performing the \nsurgery.'' The bill specifically excludes cosmetic surgery, defined as \n``surgery that is performed to alter or reshape normal structures of \nthe body in order to improve appearance.''\n  Examples of conditions for which surgery might be medically necessary \nare the following: cleft lips and palates, burns, skull deformities, \nbenign tumors, vascular lesions, missing pectoral muscles that cause \nchest deformities, Crouson's syndrome (failure of the mid-face to \ndevelop normally), and injuries from accidents.\n  This bill is an effort to address the arbitrariness of insurance \nplans that create hassles and question physicians' judgments when \npeople try to get coverage under the plan they pay premiums for every \nmonth.\n  We need our body parts to function and, fortunately, modern medicine \ntoday can often make that happen. We can restore, repair, and make \nwhole parts which by fate, accident, genes, or whatever, do not perform \nas they should. I hope this bill can make that happen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 577. A bill to limit the administrative expenses and profits of \nmanaged care entities to not more than 15 percent of premium revenues; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Health \nBenefits Integrity Act to make sure that most health care dollars that \npeople and employers pay into a managed care health insurance plan get \nspent on health care and not on overhead.\n  Under my bill, managed care plans would be limited to spending 15 \npercent of their premium revenues on administration. This means that if \nthey spend 15 percent on administration, they could spend 85 percent of \npremiums revenues on health care benefits or services.\n  This bill was prompted by a study by the Inspector General (IG) for \nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported under a USA \nToday headline in February, ``Medicare HMOs Hit for Lavish Spending.'' \nThe IG reviewed 232 managed care plans that contract with Medicare and \nfound that in 1999 the average amount allocated for administration \nranged from a high of 32 percent to a low of three percent. The IG \nrecommended that the Department establish a ceiling on the amount of \nadministrative expenditures of plans, noting that if a 15 percent \nceiling had been place in 1998, an additional $1 billion could have \nbeen passed on to Medicare beneficiaries in the form of additional \nbenefits or reduce deductibles and copayments.\n  The report said, ``This review, similar OIG reviews, and other \nstudies have shown that MCOs' [managed care organizations'] exorbitant \nadministrative costs have been problematic and can be the source for \nabusive behavior.'' Here are some examples cited by the Inspector \nGeneral on page 7 of the January 18, 2000 report: $249,283 for food, \ngifts and alcoholic beverages for meetings by one plan; $190,417 for a \nsales award meeting in Puerto Rico for one plan; $157,688 for a party \nby one plan; $25,057 for a luxury box at a sports arena by one plan; \n$106,490 for sporting events and/or theater tickets at four plans; \n$69,700 for holiday parties at three plans; $37,303 for wine gift \nbaskets, flowers, gifts and gift certificates at one plan.\n  It is no wonder that people today are angry at HMOs. When our hard-\nearned premium dollars are frittered away on purchases like these, we \nhave to ask whether HMOs are really providing the best care possible. \nFurthermore, in the case of Medicare, we are also talking about wasted \ntaxpayer dollars since Part B of Medicare is funded in part by the \ngeneral treasury. One dollar wasted in Medicare is one dollar too much. \nMedicare needs all the funds it can muster to stay solvent and to be \nthere for beneficiaries when they need it.\n  I was also encouraged to introduce the bill because of annual studies \nprepared by the California Medical Association, CMA, called the ``Knox-\nKeene Health Plan Expenditures Summary.'' The March 2001 CMA report \ncovering Fiscal Years 1999 to 2000 found a range of administrative \nexpenditures from plans in my state from a low of 2.7 percent, Kaiser \nFoundation Health Plan, Southern California, to a high of 22.1 percent, \nOMNI Healthcare, Inc.\n  If HMOs are to be credible, they must be more prudent in how they \nspend enrollees' dollars. Administrative expenses must be limited to \nreasonable expenses.\n  An October 1999 report by Interstudy found that for private HMO \nplans, administrative expenses range from 11 percent to 21 percent and \nthat for-profit HMOs spend proportionately more on administrative cost \nthan not-for-profit HMOs. This study found the lowest rate to be 3.6 \npercent and the highest 38 percent in California! In some states the \nmaximums were even higher.\n  The shift from fee-for-service to managed care as a form of health \ninsurance has been rapid in recent years. Nationally, 86 percent of \npeople who have employment-based health insurance (81.3 million \nAmericans) are in some form of managed care. Around 16 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries are in managed care nationally (40 percent in \nCalifornia), a figure that doubled between 1994 and 1997. By 2010, the \nCongressional Budget Office predicts that 31 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries will be in managed care. Between 1987 and 1999, the \nnumber of health plans contracting with Medicare went from 161 to 299. \nAs for Medicaid, in 1993, 4.8 million people (14 percent of Medicaid \nbeneficiaries) were in managed care. Today, 17.8 million (55.6 percent) \nare in managed care, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. In \nCalifornia, 52 percent or 2.6 million out of 5 million Medicaid \nbeneficiaries are in managed care.\n  In California, the state which pioneered managed care for the nation, \nan estimated 88 percent of the insured are in some form of managed \ncare. Of the 3.7 million Californians who are in Medicare, 40 percent, \n1.4 million, are in managed care, the highest rate in the U.S. As for \nMedicaid in California, 2.5 million people, 50 percent, of \nbeneficiaries are in managed care.\n  And so managed care is growing and most people think it is here to \nstay.\n  I am pleased to say that in California we already have a regulation \nalong the lines of the bill I am proposing. We have in place a \nregulatory limit of 15 percent on commercial HMO plans' administrative \nexpenses. This was established in my state for commercial plans because \nof questionable expenses like those the HHS IG found in Medicare HMO \nplans and because prior to the regulation, some plans had \nadministrative expense as high as 30 percent of premium revenues.\n  This bill will never begin to address all the problems patients \nexperience with managed care in this country.\n\n[[Page S2592]]\n\n That is why we also need a strong Patients Bill of Rights bill. I \nhope, however, this bill will discourage abuses like those the HHS \nInspector General found and will help assure people that their health \ncare dollars are spent on health care and are not wasted on outings, \nparties, and other activities totally unrelated to providing health \ncare services.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me in enacting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 578. A bill to prohibit the Secretary of Transportation from \namending or otherwise modifying the operating certificates of major air \ncarriers in connection with a merger or acquisition for a period of 2 \nyears, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am very concerned about the current \nstate of affairs in our nation's airline industry. The way airlines \nhave remade themselves since deregulation is very troubling to me and \nshould be very troubling to most of the traveling public in this \ncountry.\n  Since deregulation we have seen an unprecedented number of mergers in \nthe airline industry. What used to be 11 airlines is now 7, and now \nwith United wanting to buy US Airways, and American wanting to buy TWA \nout of bankruptcy, there is a very high risk that we will quickly be \nreduced to three mega-carriers in this country. I am afraid of what \nthis will mean to competition which is already almost non-existent in \nso many parts of the country.\n  That is because the major carriers have spent the last 20 years \nretreating into regional hubs, such as Minneapolis, Denver, and \nAtlanta, where one airline will control 50 percent, 70 percent, 80 \npercent of the hub traffic. The result has been that a dominant airline \ncontrolling the hub traffic sets its own prices, and it is the people \nin sparsely populated areas in the country that end up paying for it \nwith outrageously high prices.\n  These proposed mergers fly directly in the face of public interest \nand ought not to be allowed. We need more than three airlines. \nIncreased consolidation would be moving in the wrong direction. We need \nmore competition, not more concentration.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation today to place a moratorium \non airline mergers above a certain size for a couple years so we can \ntake a breath and evaluate what kind of air transportation system we \nwant in this country.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in expressing loudly that we must \navoid having this country go to three major airline carriers. It would \nbe a step backward, not forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 579.

Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \nauthorize the establishment of nonprofit entities to provide grants and \nother assistance for international educational, cultural and arts \nprograms through the Department of State. This is an initiative that \nwas developed last year in discussions with officials of the Department \nof State.

Trade disputes, ethnic and regional \nconflicts, and issues such as biotechnology all have cultural and \nintellectual underpinnings.\n  Cultural programs are increasingly necessary to promoting \ninternational understanding and achieving U.S. national objectives. \nAmerican multinational companies and other Americans doing business \noverseas welcome opportunities to support the unique cultures of \nnations in which they do business, as well as telling the story of \nAmerica's diversity in other countries.\n  One way they could do this is by helping to sponsor cultural exchange \nprograms arranged through the Department of State. Department officials \ntells us, however, that there is apparently no easy way to do that. \nMoreover, many people in our own government are uncertain whether they \nshould engage in presenting the creative, intellectual and cultural \nside of our nation.\n  Under this legislation Congress would authorize the Secretary of \nState to provide for the establishment of private nonprofit \norganizations to assist in supporting international cultural programs, \nmaking it both easy and attractive for private organizations to support \ncultural programs in cooperation with the Department of State. In so \ndoing, we would affirm support for the promotion and presentation of \nthe nation's intellectual and creative best as part of American \ndiplomacy.\n  This initiative would support a broad range of cultural exchange \nprograms. Its priority would be to support the organization and \npromotion of major, high-profile presentations of art exhibitions, \nmusical and theatrical performances which represent the finest quality \nof creativity our nation produces. These should be presentations that \nreach large numbers of people, which contribute to achieving our \nnational interests and which represent the diversity of American \nculture.\n  The bill would provide authority to solicit support for specific \ncultural endeavors, offering individuals, foundations, corporations and \nother American businesses engaged overseas the opportunity to publicly \nsupport cross-cultural understanding in countries where they do \nbusiness.\n  The non-profit entity would work with the Bureau of Educational and \nCultural Affairs as well as the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy at \nthe Department of State.\n  I understand that the House International Relations Committee is \nplanning to consider a version of this bill later this week. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on this legislation \nin the coming weeks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 579\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is in the national interest of the United States to \n     promote mutual understanding between the people of the United \n     States and other nations.\n       (2) Among the means to be used in achieving this objective \n     are a wide range of international educational and cultural \n     exchange programs, including the J. William Fulbright \n     Educational Exchange Program and the International Visitors \n     Program.\n       (3) Cultural diplomacy, especially the presentation abroad \n     of the finest of the creative, visual, and performing arts of \n     the United States, is an especially effective means of \n     advancing the United States national interest.\n       (4) The financial support available for international \n     cultural and scholarly exchanges has declined by \n     approximately 10 percent in recent years.\n       (5) There has been a dramatic decline in the amount of \n     funds available for the purpose of ensuring that the \n     excellence, diversity, and vitality of the arts in the United \n     States are presented to foreign audiences by and in \n     cooperation with United States diplomatic and consular \n     representatives.\n       (6) One of the ways to deepen and expand cultural and \n     educational exchange programs is through the establishment of \n     nonprofit entities to encourage the participation and \n     financial support of multinational companies and other \n     private sector contributors.\n       (7) The United States private sector should be encouraged \n     to cooperate closely with the Secretary of State and the \n     Secretary's representatives to expand and spread appreciation \n     of United States cultural and artistic accomplishments.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH NONPROFIT ENTITIES.\n\n       Section 105(f) of the Mutual Educational and Cultural \n     Exchange Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2455(f)) is further amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(f)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n       ``(2) The Secretary of State is authorized to provide for \n     the establishment of private, nonprofit entities to assist in \n     carrying out the purposes of the Act. Any such entity shall \n     not be considered an agency or instrumentality of the United \n     States Government, nor shall its employees be considered \n     employees of the United States Government for any purposes.\n\n[[Page S2593]]\n\n       ``(3) The entities may, among other functions--\n       ``(A) encourage United States multinational companies and \n     other elements of the private sector to participate in, and \n     support, cultural, arts, and educational exchange programs, \n     including those programs that will enhance international \n     appreciation of the cultural and artistic accomplishments of \n     the United States;\n       ``(B) solicit and receive contributions from the private \n     sector to support these cultural arts and educational \n     exchange programs; and\n       ``(C) provide grants and other assistance for these \n     programs.\n       ``(4) The Secretary of State is authorized to make such \n     arrangements as are necessary to carry out the purposes of \n     these entities, including--\n       ``(A) the solicitation and receipt of funds for the entity;\n       ``(B) designation of a program in recognition of such \n     contributions; and\n       ``(C) designation of members, including employees of the \n     United States Government, on any board or other body \n     established to administer the entity.\n       ``(5) Any funds available to the Department of State may be \n     made available to such entities to cover administrative and \n     other costs for their establishment.

A bill to expedite the construction of the World War II \nmemorial in the District of Columbia; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would expedite construction of the World War II Memorial. Some of \nour colleagues may not be aware that even after having had the \nopportunity to argue their case before the twenty-two public hearings \nover the last five years regarding the site and design of the memorial, \nopponents have now turned to the courts to overturn the Memorial's \napproval.\n  Regrettably, it is now clear that legislation will be needed if the \nWorld War II Memorial is to be constructed before all the patriots who \nfought in defense of liberty have passed on. The ugly truth is that \nevery day we lose more than a thousand members of our greatest \ngeneration. How many more will be deprived of the joy of seeing this \nrichly deserved tribute to their heroic service completed?\n  According to the American Battle Monuments Commission, the World War \nII Memorial will be the first national memorial dedicated to all who \nserved in the armed forces and Merchant Marine of the United States \nduring World War II and acknowledging the commitment and achievement of \nthe entire nation. All military veterans of the war, the citizens of \nthe home front, the nation at large, and the high moral purpose and \nidealism that motivated the nation's call to arms will be honored.\n  Symbolic of the defining event of the 20th century in American \nhistory, the memorial will be a monument to the spirit, sacrifice, and \ncommitment of the American people, to the common defense of the nation \nand to the broader causes of peace and freedom from tyranny throughout \nthe world. It will inspire future generations of Americans, deepening \ntheir appreciation of what the World War II generation accomplished in \nsecuring freedom and democracy. Above all, the memorial will stand for \nall time as an important symbol of American national unity, a timeless \nreminder of the moral strength and awesome power that can flow when a \nfree people are at once united and bonded together in a common and just \ncause.\n  Construction of this memorial is long overdue. Opponents have had \nample opportunity to make their case, and while I respect their \nopinions, the simple truth is that the site has been selected and the \ntime to begin to move dirt has arrived. I hope all of my colleague \nswill join me in sponsoring this resolution. Let us, as a nation, \nprevent the cheapening of this tribute by putting a stop to frivolous \nlegal challenges. Let us say thanks to those who fought to save the \nbabes of humanity from the wolves of tyranny. Let's build the World War \nII memorial, let's build it upon the National Mall, and let's build it \nnow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 580\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to authorize \nArmy arsenals to undertake to fulfill orders or contracts for articles \nor services in advance of the receipt of payment under certain \ncircumstances; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 581, a \nbill that will help United States Army arsenals remain competitive and \nproductive in the 21st century. The Army arsenals have long been an \nimportant military resource. They have not only served as a cost-\neffective supplier of high-quality military equipment, they have also \nproven to be an invaluable supplier of last resort, providing mission-\ncritical parts when private contractors have lacked the capacity to \nmeet emergency needs or have breached their contracts with the \ngovernment. This bill will help ensure that these important facilities \ndo not fall into disuse during the periods between national emergencies \nand heightened military needs.\n  Rock Island Arsenal, in my home state of Illinois, was acquired by \nthe United States in 1804. Located on an island in the Mississippi \nRiver, the area was converted to its current function, and named Rock \nIsland Arsenal, in 1862. Since then, Rock Island Arsenal has built \nweapons and military equipment for all of our nation's wars, developing \na specialty in the manufacture of howitzers.\n  Today, Rock Island Arsenal is the Department of Defense's only \ngeneral-purpose metal-manufacturing facility, performing forging, sheet \nmetal, and welding and heat-treating operations that cover the entire \nrange of technologically feasible processes. Rock Island Arsenal also \ncontains a machine shop that is capable of such specialized operations \nas gear cutting, die sinking, and tool making; a paint shop certified \nto apply Chemical Agent Resistant Coatings to items as large as tanks; \nand a plating shop that can apply chrome, nickel, cadmium, and copper, \nand can galvanize, parkerize, anodize, and apply oxide finishes.\n  These capabilities have proven essential to the functioning of the \nUnited States military. In recent years, Rock Island Arsenal has been \ncalled on to produce M16 gun bolts when a private contractor defaulted \non a contract. It has also produced mission-critical pins and shims for \nApache helicopters when outside suppliers have proven unresponsive to \nthe Army's needs.\n  S. 581 will help guarantee that United States arsenals will be there \nagain when the military needs them in an emergency, by helping to \nensure that arsenals have an adequate workload in normal times. During \nthe 1990s, the Department of Defense shifted away from direct funding \nof arsenals to the Working Capital Fund, ``W.C.F.'', system,\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n\nunder which private companies compete with the arsenals for government \nservice and production contracts. This system has improved the \nefficiency of the military by promoting cost transparency and \ndiscouraging the overconsumption of arsenal goods and services.\n  Unfortunately, implementation of the W.C.F. system has also produced \nsome unintended consequences. As arsenals have been placed in \ncompetition with private firms, they have remained tied down by \ngovernment rules that place the arsenals at a competitive \ndisadvantage--and that hamper their efforts to secure a full workload. \nOne of these rules is the requirement that arsenals be paid in advance \nfor all services and products that they provide. Private firms are not \nrequired to operate under such conditions, they routinely receive \npayment only once they have delivered on their contract. As a result, a \nmilitary department seeking goods or services, or a private contractor \nseeking help in supplying the government--is discouraged from \ncontracting with an arsenal. Even when an arsenal can provide higher \nquality or at lower cost, the requirement of up-front payment may prove \nburdensome enough to convince purchasers to meet their needs elsewhere.\n\n  The legislation that I introduce today will place United States Army \narsenals on a more equal footing with their private competitors. It \nwill limit the advance-payment requirement to only those circumstances \nwhere payment is less than certain, and will otherwise allow arsenals \nto accept payment after performance. Specifically, arsenals will be \nallowed to accept later payment when the United States purchases \ndirectly from an arsenal, when an arsenal supplies a contractor serving \nthe United States, or when payment for foreign military purchases is \nguaranteed by the United States. In these cases, an advance-payment \nrequirement is unnecessary--it serves only to put the arsenals at a \ncompetitive disadvantage. Application of the requirement in these \ncircumstances should be ended.\n  S. 581 will help ensure that Army arsenals will be able to secure an \nadequate workload in periods between supply emergencies. This bill will \nalso serve taxpayers' money by encouraging efficient use of reserve \nresources, which must be maintained regardless of whether or not they \nare fully in use. Therefore, in the interest of encouraging optimal \nutilization of an invaluable national resource, and to help integrate \nthe Army arsenals into the private-competition system of the Working \nCapital Fund, I today introduce s. 581.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 581\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERFORMANCE OF ORDERS FOR ARTICLES OR SERVICES BY \n                   ARMY ARSENALS BEFORE RECEIPT OF PAYMENT.\n\n       (a) Authority.--(1) Chapter 433 of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 4541 the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 4541a.

Res. 8. A joint resolution designating 2002 as the ``Year of the \nRose''; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention \nof the Senate, the continuing beauty and appeal that flowers bring to \nour nation. Americans have always loved the flowers which God has \nchosen to decorate our land. In particular, we hold the rose dear as \nsymbols of life, love, devotion, beauty, and eternity. For the love of \nman and woman, for the love of mankind and God as well as for the love \nof country, Americans who would speak the language of the heart do so \nwith a rose.\n  We see evidence of this everywhere. The study of fossils reveals that \nthe rose has existed in America for ages. We have always cultivated \nroses in our gardens. Our first President, George Washington bred roses \nand a variety he named after his mother is still grown today. The White \nHouse itself boasts of a beautiful Rose Garden. We find roses in our \nart, music, and literature. We decorate our celebrations and parades \nwith roses. Most of all, we present roses to those we love, and we \nlavish them on our altars, our civil shrines, and the final resting \nplaces of our honored dead. In 1986, in recognition of the high esteem \nroses are held, President Ronald Reagan and the Congress of the United \nStates proclaimed the rose as the National Floral Emblem of the United \nStates of America.\n  This proclamation was as a result of the handiwork and dedication of \nthe American Rose Society. The American Rose Society is the premier \norganization dedicated exclusively to the cultivation of roses. Since \n1892, the American Rose Society has strived to enhance the enjoyment \nand promotion of roses to gardeners of all skill levels. In 2001, the \nAmerican Rose Society, in conjunction with the 37 member countries that \nmake up the World Federation of Rose Societies, the National Council of \nState Garden Clubs, and the American Nursery and Landscape Association \nbegan waging a campaign to honor our national floral emblem, the Rose.\n  In an effort to increase support for public rose gardens in the \nUnited States; recognize the beauty and inspiration roses add to the \nenvironment and landscapes of cities, and communities around the \ncountry; to introduce the therapeutic benefits of roses to people of \nall ages and background; to provide educational programs designed to \nstimulate and teach about the joys of gardening, especially rose \ngardening; and to teach the great history and diversity the genus \noffers, the American Rose Society, whose national headquarters is \nlocated in Shreveport, Louisiana, is requesting a joint congressional \nresolution proclaiming the year 2002 as the Year of the Rose.\n  The American people have long held a special place in their hearts \nfor roses. Let us continue to cherish them, honor the love and devotion \nthey represent and to bestow them upon all we love just as God has \nbestowed them on us.\n  I ask unanimous that the text of this resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 8\n\n       Whereas the study of fossils has shown that the rose has \n     been a native wild flower in the United States for over \n     35,000,000 years;\n       Whereas the rose is grown today in every State;\n       Whereas the rose has long represented love, friendship, \n     beauty, peace, and the devotion of the American people to \n     their country;\n       Whereas the rose has been cultivated and grown in gardens \n     for over 5,000 years and is referred to in both the Old and \n     New Testaments;\n       Whereas the rose has for many years been the favorite \n     flower of the American people, has captivated the affection \n     of humankind, and has been revered and renowned in art, \n     music, and literature;\n       Whereas our first President was also our first rose \n     breeder, 1 of his varieties being named after his mother and \n     still being grown today; and\n       Whereas in 1986 the rose was designated and adopted as the \n     national floral emblem of the United States: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n\n[[Page S2595]]\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress--\n       (1) designates the year of 2002 as the ``Year of the \n     Rose''; and\n       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to observe the year with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Reid, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Specter, and Mr. Chafee):\n  S.J. Res. 9. A joint resolution providing for congressional \ndisapproval of the rule submitted by the United States Agency for \nInternational Development relating to the restoration of the Mexico \nCity Policy; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on February 15, the United States Agency \nfor International Development issued Contract Information Bulletin 01-\n03 regarding the ``Restoration of the Mexico City Policy.''\n  This bulletin reinstates the international gag rule, which prohibits \ninternational family planning organizations that receive federal \nfunding from using their own privately-raised funds to counsel women \nabout abortion, provide abortion services, and lobby on reproductive \nrights.\n  Today, I am introducing, along with Senators Reid, Snowe, Jeffords, \nCollins, Specter, and Chafee, a joint resolution of disapproval under \nthe Congressional Review Act.\n  As my colleagues know, the CRA establishes a procedure for the \nexpedited consideration of a resolution disapproving an agency rule.\n  I can think of no other case where expedited procedures are more \nappropriate. Women's lives are at stake.\n  Approximately 78,000 women throughout the world die each year as a \nresult of unsafe abortions. At least one-fourth of all unsafe abortions \nin the world are to girls aged 15-19. By 2015, contraceptive needs in \ndeveloping countries will grow by more than 40 percent.\n  As a result of the gag rule, the organizations that are reducing \nunsafe abortions and providing contraceptives will be forced either to \nlimit their services or to simply close their doors to women across the \nworld. And this will cause women and families increased misery and \ndeath.\n  Make no mistake, the international gag rule will restrict family \nplanning, not abortions. In fact, no United States funds can be used \nfor abortion services. That is already law, and has been since 1973. \nThis gag rule does, however, restrict foreign organizations in ways \nthat would be unconstitutional here at home and that is why we seek to \nreverse it in an expedited fashion under the CRA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 9\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     disapproves the rule submitted by the United States Agency \n     for International Development relating to the restoration of \n     the Mexico City Policy (contained in Contract Information \n     Bulletin 01-03, dated February 15, 2001), and such rule shall \n     have no force or effect.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Boxer in \nintroducing a joint resolution of congressional disapproval relating to \nthe restoration of the Mexico City Policy.\n  We are taking this step because the global gag rule--which denies \nfunding to any organization that uses its own funds to provide or \npromote abortion services overseas--is an ill-conceived, anti-woman, \nand anti-American policy.\n  The President's rationale for reimposing the gag rule was that he \nwanted to make abortions more rare. Yet the last time the Mexico City \nPolicy was in effect, there was no reduction in the number of \nabortions, only reduced access to quality health care services, more \nunintended pregnancies and more abortions. Research shows that the only \nway to reduce the need for abortion is to improve family planning \nefforts that will decrease the number of unintended pregnancies. Access \nto contraception reduces the probability of having an abortion by 85 \npercent.\n  It the only reason to repeal the Mexico City Policy was to decrease \nthe need for abortions then that would be enough. But our support of \ninternational family planning programs literally means the difference \nbetween life or death for women in developing countries. At least one \nwoman dies every minute of every day from causes related to pregnancy \nand child birth in developing nations. This means that almost 600,000 \nwomen die every year from causes related to pregnancy. Family planning \nefforts that prevent unintended pregnancies save the lives of thousands \nof women and infants each year.\n  In addition to reducing maternal and infant mortality rates, family \nplanning helps prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. \nThis effort is particularly critical considering that the World Health \nOrganization has estimated that 5.9 million individuals, the majority \nof whom live in developing nations, become infected with HIV almost \nevery year.\n  Let me be clear: We are not asking to use one single taxpayer dollar \nto perform or promote abortion overseas. The law has explicitly \nprohibited such activities since 1973. Instead, the Mexico City Policy \nwould restrict foreign organizations in a way that would be \nunconstitutional in the United States. The Mexico City Policy violates \na fundamental tenet of our democracy--freedom of speech. Exporting a \npolicy that is unconstitutional at home is the ultimate act of \nhypocrisy. Surely this is not the message we want to send to struggling \ndemocracies who are looking to the United States for guidance.\n  When President Bush reinstated the Mexico City Policy, he turned the \nclock back on women around the world by almost two decades. Today, \nSenator Boxer and I are looking toward the future and taking the first \nstep to repeal this antiquated, anti-woman policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/20/senate-section/article/S2595-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 115.
