Madam President, on October 25, I lost a good friend, \nthe Senate lost a leader, and the American people lost an advocate who \nwas never afraid to stand up and speak for those who had no voice.\n  I rise today to honor my friend and colleague, Senator Paul \nWellstone, who inspired so many people to speak up and to serve. Even \nas I stand here today, I cannot imagine that when I turn around I won't \nsee Paul standing at his desk, his arms flailing in the air, making \nsome point with great passion.\n  Paul, with his energy and optimism, has left a mark on all of us. In \n1990, when Paul Wellstone ran for the Senate, a lot of people were \nwatching him and following his race. Political pundits said he could \nnot win. But as I watched him, I became motivated. At the time, I was \nserving in the Washington State Senate, and I, too, was frustrated by \nwhat I saw happening in Washington, DC.\n  In Paul I saw someone who cared about the little guy and who spoke \npassionately. Paul was never afraid to voice his ideas or take on big \nfights. Not only did he win that Senate race, but in the process he \ninspired a generation of young people to serve their communities.\n  On a more personal level, Paul inspired me to run for the U.S. \nSenate. His brilliant example reminded me that you don't need to be \npowerful or rich--or even tall--to make a difference. You just need to \nhave an honest concern for others, an optimistic spirit, and the \ncourage to act.\n  Over the last 10 years, I have agreed--and disagreed--with Paul on \nany number of issues. But never once did I doubt his conviction, and \nnever once did Paul let his policy disagreements soften the love and \nfriendship he felt for all of us. Paul and I worked on everything from \ndomestic violence and education to providing health care for veterans \nand protecting families from asbestos.\n  I could always count on Paul to remind me that so many Americans have \nbeen dealt a tough hand in life. So many families, through no fault of \ntheir own, find themselves struggling, and they need an advocate to \nspeak out for them in this Congress.\n  No matter what pressures he faced in the Senate or even with his own \nhealth, Paul always reminded me how lucky we are to be able to serve in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  One thing I will not forget about Paul is that every one of us was \nimportant to him and he proved that time and again. A few months ago, I \nheld a meeting in my office to develop a legislative strategy on a \nbill. I wanted to keep the discussion small and focused and frank, so I \ninvited two other Senators and told them not to bring any staff \nmembers. When it was time to start the meeting, Paul bounced through \nthe door with three people in tow. Even though staff were not invited, \nPaul didn't mind. But these weren't his staff--they were his interns. \nHe proudly introduced each one of them to us, and they all stayed for \nthe entire meeting. We were still able to get everything done that we \nneeded to do in the short time we had. Those young students got to see \ndemocracy up close. They got to sit in on a closed-door meeting, and \nthey got a sense--just for a moment--that they, too, belonged there and \nthey, too, could do it.\n  Paul never stopped showing people what they could accomplish, and \nthat is because he knew that people--plain old people--were important. \nHe didn't care about pollsters and consultants; he cared about people. \nHis love did not depend on whether they could write him a check.\n  My favorite all-time campaign event with Paul was not a fundraiser, \nbut--in true Paul style--it was a ``time-raiser.'' On a cold Saturday \nmorning, Paul jammed a hall with folks who could not write a check but \nwho could donate 2 hours of time to call or leaflet or answer phones. \nJudging from the enthusiasm of that crowd, yelling to the rooftops in \nthe packed room, Paul was their Senator and their guy. He valued them \nand they valued him.NOTICE\n\nIf the 107th Congress, 2d Session, adjourns sine die on or before \nNovember 22, 2002, a final issue of the Congressional Record for \nthe 107th Congress, 2d Session, will be published on Monday, \nDecember 16, 2002, in order to permit Members to revise and extend \ntheir remarks.\nAll material for insertion must be signed by the Member and \ndelivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of \nDebates (Room HT-60 or S-123 of the Capitol), Monday through \nFriday, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. through \nFriday, December 13. The final issue will be dated Monday, December \n16, 2002, and will be delivered on Tuesday, December 17, 2002.\nNone of the material printed in the final issue of the \nCongressional Record may contain subject matter, or relate to any \nevent that occurred after the sine die date.\nSenators' statements should also be submitted electronically, \neither on a disk to accompany the signed statement, or by e-mail to \nthe Official Reporters of Debates at ``Record@Sec.Senate.gov''.\nMembers of the House of Representatives' statements may also be \nsubmitted electronically by e-mail, to accompany the signed \nstatement, and formatted according to the instructions for the \nExtensions of Remarks template at http://clerkhouse.house.gov.

Deliver statements to the \nOfficial Reporters in Room \nHT-60.\nMembers of Congress desiring to purchase reprints of material \nsubmitted for inclusion in the Congressional Record may do so by \ncontacting the Congressional Printing Management Division, at the \nGovernment Printing Office, on 512-0224, between the hours of 8:00 \na.m. and 4:00 p.m. daily.\nBy order of the Joint Committee on Printing.\n                                                                \nMARK DAYTON, Chairman.\n\n[[Page S10851]]\n\n  I remember another event when Paul wasn't even scheduled to speak, \nbut he ended up stealing the show. Earlier this year, I was at a press \nconference on education in the Dirksen Building. Senators Kennedy, \nHarkin, Reed, and others were scheduled to talk about making classrooms \nless crowded. Out of nowhere, Paul Wellstone rushed into the room \nlooking a bit confused. My colleagues and I looked surprised because \nSenator Wellstone was not scheduled to speak and was not on the agenda. \nWhen Paul got to the podium, the first thing he said was:\n\n       I am not sure if I am in the right room. When I ran into \n     Ted Kennedy on the floor a while ago, he asked me if I was \n     going to the education press conference, and I said I hadn't \n     heard about it, but I would be there.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Frankly, I don't even know if I am talking to the right \n     group, but I am going to tell you why we need to fight for \n     our kids.\n\n  Everyone laughed. Paul went on to give a passionate, off-the-cuff \nspeech that wowed and inspired every person in that room.\n  To me, that really captures Paul's spirit. Wherever some cause needed \na voice, he would rush in--regardless of the schedule--and give his \nimpassioned best. If there were a need, he would be there to speak out.\n  Paul had said he didn't know if he was in the right room, but today I \ncan say with confidence that Paul was in the right place all along.\n  We are all poorer for the loss of Paul Wellstone, his wife Sheila, \nhis daughter Marcia, the members of his staff, and the pilots who were \ntaken from us on that dark day. It is sad to say that the Senate will \nno doubt change without Paul. No one will pace down this aisle and \nspeak as passionately as Paul did for so many causes. But I hope that \neach one of us who are here will take on part of Paul's legacy--for \nexample, the spirit to speak out for the underprivileged, for students \nin classrooms with leaky roofs, for the woman on welfare not because \nshe wants to be, but because of domestic violence and she is trying to \nget back on her feet.\n  I hope we will pick up his legacy and speak out for the workers who \nare out of a job because this economy has left them behind, or for \nthose who are trying to overcome mental illness and just need some help \nfrom their insurance company.\n  I hope, too, that we will carry on Paul's legacy of respect. Paul \nspoke from the heart and he spoke passionately. But he never held any \ndisrespect for those with different views. I saw him so many times \ndebate long and hard against another Senator and then step away from \nthe microphone and share a laugh or a hug with the very person he had \njust debated a few moments before.\n  If we can remember to fight for all Americans, no matter what \nchallenges they have been dealt, and if we do it with respect and \ndignity, then Paul's legacy will live on in the Senate, as it lives on \nin our hearts and in our minds. I, for one, am going to miss him very \nmuch. He was all heart and soul. He is impossible to replace.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business to \npay tribute to Paul and Sheila Wellstone. It is a difficult thing to \ndo. It is a difficult thing for all of us to do. It is easier for me, \nright now, to imagine Paul standing over there and articulating a great \npoint, a great point that would be for the consideration of some group \nof people or an individual about whom he would be deeply concerned--he \nwas clear, passionate, and very forceful in his advocacy for them--\nrather than to think of him as being gone but he is.\n  You cannot really measure the height of a tree until it is down. That \nis, unfortunately, again, the case for Paul and Sheila Wellstone. He \nwas a really tall man. They were really tall trees in what they did.\n  I had the great fortune to be able to work with both Paul and Sheila \non an issue we cared a lot about--the trafficking of individuals across \ncountry borders, generally for reasons of prostitution but also for \nother purposes. We found this was going on.\n  Actually, Sheila discovered this was happening by visiting with a \nnumber of Ukrainian women, some of whom had been trafficked themselves \nwhen the Soviet Union fell, when the superstructure that was the Soviet \nUnion came down.\n  It turned out that gangs, groups came in, the Mafia-type \norganizations, to operate in the former Soviet Union, and they would \nrun a number of different things. They would run drugs, they would run \nweaponry, and they would run people. It turned out the trafficking of \npeople was actually their third most profitable operation. It was a \nreal despicable thing they were doing. They would actually go into \ncommunities, trick young ladies, generally--sometimes young boys, but \ngenerally young girls--saying: We have this great bit of excitement for \nyou. We are going to be able to have you travel to Europe or to the \nMiddle East.\n  With the fall of the Soviet Union, they didn't see hope or \nopportunity in their own country, and they would sign on, only to have \ntheir papers taken away once they crossed the border. They would be put \ninto a brothel, in some cases chained and tortured until they would \nsubmit to prostitution. And then they would even be moved from brothel \nto brothel. It was a real seamy, dirty, ugly thing that was taking \nplace. It was a dark side of the globalizing economy. It was a dark \nside of the fall of the Soviet Union. And Sheila found out about it by \nmeeting with Ukrainian women.\n  Now, I am sure there were not many votes at all in Minnesota that \nwere going to hinge on whether or not Paul or Sheila were going to work \non the issue of the trafficking of young girls from the former Soviet \nUnion, Nepal, and India, or from other places. Generally, there was \ntrafficking from poorer countries into richer countries. But Paul was \nsuch a champion of the value and the beauty of each person and the \nneeds and the dignity of that individual, and Sheila was as well, that \nthey were willing to put this issue forward and fight for it over a \nperiod of a couple years, until we could get the bill passed.\n  Sheila found out about it. She brought it to Paul's attention. He \nlearned about it and talked with some of these women who had been \ntrafficked. I started to hear about it. I met with women who had been \ntrafficked and found out about the despicable nature of this new form \nof human slavery, a human slavery of which one person even wrote a book \nentitled, ``Disposable People,'' because it happened in a situation \nwhere they would be moved from one brothel to another, and then, as \nthey would get sick or diseased--in some cases they would get \ntuberculosis, AIDS--the owners would even throw them out on the street \nand say: Well, we are done with that one. It was just the most ugly \nact.\n  I remember being in a home for girls who had been trafficked and \nreturned to Nepal. There were 50 girls, 16 to 18 years of age. Many of \nthem had been trafficked when they were 12 to 14 years of age. And a \nlady was helping run this home. This was a recovery house for girls \nafter they would come back from the brothels. This woman was trying to \nteach them a trade, trying to get them back into the community in \nNepal. She would point around the room and say: That girl has \ntuberculosis and AIDS and she is dying. This girl is dying. That girl \nhas this disease; I don't know if she is going to make it. These were \ngirls who were 16 years of age who should have been in the very flower \nof their lives, and they were all dying.\n  They saw it. They were willing to fight for these other people. And \nwe were able to get through legislation on sex trafficking.\n  Paul joked with me afterwards. He is a more liberal Member and I am a \nmore conservative Member. After that legislative session, he commented \nthat he moved from being the most liberal Member to the second most \nliberal Member of the Senate, and he blamed it on working with me. I \nsaid: Well, just hang around with me, Paul, and we will get you \nreelected.\n  He had that kind of humor. He was a friend. He was a friend that was \nnot\n\n[[Page S10852]]\n\nscared of ideology splitting people apart. He had his beliefs; I had \nmine. We all do. But he did not let that separate him. He did not judge \na person's soul by their ideology. He judged people by their character \nand their heart, where they would be willing to stand.\n  I would often see him come over to greet and talk with Jesse Helms. \nHe and Jesse disagreed on a number of issues, but they both had \npassion, soul, and heart. That is what they respected and loved about \neach other, and that is what I continue to see and love about Paul and \nSheila Wellstone, that passion, heart, and soul that would carry them \nforward.\n  I do not know that there is a better quote one could put forward than \nfrom Dr. Martin Luther King. He once noted that the ultimate measure of \na man is not where he stands in moments of comfort but where he stands \nat times of challenge and controversy.\n  If we measure Paul and Sheila by that measurement, they stand as a \nvery tall tree. Paul knew controversy. He knew difficulty. He knew \nchallenge. It rallied him. It made him taller. It made him stronger. It \nwas not comfort that he sought. It was not comfort that he wanted to \nhave. I have often thought that in this life it is challenges that \nbuild us, it is not comfort that builds us; that God has created us to \nmeet challenges, not to sit back and to eat bon-bons or to let things \ngo by in a measurable way, but He puts challenges in front of us. The \nmore we are willing to accept, the more He is willing to give, and the \nmore He is willing to test us.\n  Paul and Sheila accepted challenge after challenge, controversy after \ncontroversy, always with a pure heart, wanting to do the right thing to \nhelp people, regardless of what it might mean to themselves. They were \nthere to do it and they wanted to do it. They relished doing it and \nthey grew in doing it. He was a spirited fighter.\n  I remember reading about--certainly I was not in this body then--when \nHubert Humphrey served in this body and was dying of cancer and they \nhad a tribute to him in Time magazine. I remember so vividly reading \nabout it. The title of it was ``Happy Warrior,'' because he was a \nwarrior and he was happy about it, that his course, his challenge, in \nlife was to be a warrior. He relished in the opportunity to be a \nwarrior.\n  I did not know him personally, but he could not imagine, as I \nunderstand his personality, that there would be any calling any better \nthan to be a warrior.\n  Paul followed in those footsteps in a great and magnificent way. He \nwas a happy warrior, happily fighting for his cause, happily pressing \nforward, knowing that people disagreed with him. I disagreed with him \noften, but I could never disagree with that passion. Nor could I ever \ndisagree with that heart. We developed a really good friendship.\n  He is a man I was very fond of and I am fond of even now. As I say, \nit is hard to think of him being gone. I suppose that is because he and \nSheila really probably still are here.\n  My prayers have been with them, with the other people who went down \nin that plane. So tragically their lives were ended early. None of us \nwill know why on this side of eternity, but we can always learn and \ngrow from him. We are caused to grow in our life by each person with \nwhom we come in contact. I was caused to grow in a very profound and \nvery personal way by my contact with Paul and Sheila. I am indebted to \nthem. I pay tribute to them and what they have done. God bless them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to join my colleague, Senator Brownback, \nin paying tribute to the life of Paul and Sheila Wellstone. It is also \nso important for us to remember the staff and others who were on that \nairplane. We have people in this country who serve every one of us, and \ntheir lives were given in service of their country also.\n  Paul was a unique individual, no doubt about it, a man who made us \nsmile even when we were in debate against him. He was a happy warrior. \nI think that is a good description of him.\n  All of this points out, as the Scripture says, that life is but a \nvapor. We are only here a short time. We might as well pour ourselves \ninto it and fight for what we believe. Else, what is life all about?\n  He did that. He poured himself into his job, poured himself into his \nview of the world and life in general and fought for that. His \npolitical agenda was an expanded government. He wanted to help people \nin need. He was passionate about that. He wanted to help people. To a \nlarge degree, I suppose the disagreement I had with him was that he \nbelieved that government was the way to make that happen, but the goal \nwas good. I know Paul liked me, and I loved him. He was an individual \nwho was very special.\n  I feel real sad about this entire event, as do all of us in this \nSenate. I remember his vote against the Iraq resolution, which was \nsomething I felt very strongly in favor of. He was the only Member of \nthis body who was up for reelection who had to answer to the voters on \nthat issue. He did not see it the way I saw it, and he did not tack to \nthe wind. He voted against that resolution and went back home and \nanswered to people of Minnesota. He told them why he did it, and either \nthey agreed with him or they forgave him. He was able to cast what many \nthought was an unpopular vote and not suffer the apparent political \nconsequences.\n  I believe Paul was a special person. He set a good example for all of \nus to realize that life is short. We are only given this opportunity to \nserve in the greatest deliberative body of the greatest country in the \nhistory of the world for what we have to assume is a very short time. \nWe might think constantly that therefore we should use this office for \nthe people's good, and if we do that, we will have honored his name, \nhonored the commitment he made to public service, and honored the \npeople of the United States.\n  I will miss Paul. He was a man of great strength and character. This \nbody will be poorer for his absence. Our thoughts and prayers go out to \nhis family and friends.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I take a moment to pay my personal \ntribute to Paul Wellstone. Paul was a dear friend and someone for whom \nI had a great deal of respect, someone with whom I enjoyed working. We \nserved on the Health, Education, and Labor Committee together. We \nserved on the Workforce Protections Subcommittee together. We had many \nopportunities to deal on differing positions, obviously, on that \ncommittee, but always with great congeniality and with a great deal of \naffection for one another.\n  He and I were both in very heated reelection campaigns, very tight \nreelection campaigns, and oftentimes discussed before the adjournment \nour mutual desire to be able to campaign in our States.\n  I share the grief of my colleagues in the loss we have all \nexperienced, the State of Minnesota has experienced, along with his \nfamily and what they are enduring. We also look back with a great deal \nof joy at the life he lived and the contribution he made not only to \nhis State, to his country, but to each one of our lives.\n  I recall so often Paul standing at his desk. He took the desk of one \nof my predecessors in the Senate, Dale Bumpers from Arkansas. He was a \ngood successor for that position. Where Senator Bumpers would often \nwalk up and down that aisle with great passion, so, too, Paul Wellstone \nwould use the entire length as he wandered that aisle and as he spoke \nwith such passion and such conviction.\n  I remember often his referring to himself, as he would speak, ``as a \nSenator from the State of Minnesota.'' He would use that expression. I \ndon't know if that is as commonly used as he used it--``as the Senator \nfrom the State of Minnesota''--and he stated his position and \nconviction. I thought that phrase, ``a Senator from the State of \nMinnesota,'' summed up an awful lot of Paul Wellstone. He was proud of \nthe State of Minnesota, representing the State of Minnesota and the \npeople of Minnesota. He was proud also of this institution, being a \nSenator. He never lost the love and the awe for serving in\n\n[[Page S10853]]\n\nthis great institution. In my mind, I will always be able to hear \nechoing Paul Wellstone as he spoke on issue after issue as a Senator \nfrom the State of Minnesota.\n\n  The area in which we found mutual interest and, though from very \nopposite ends of the political spectrum, similar feelings was the area \nof human rights, especially on the cause of China and the people of \nChina, telling the world about the human rights abuses that continue \neven to this day in China. Paul and I held many press conferences with \nMembers, colleagues from the House, who shared concerns about China. He \nand I made many floor speeches about the remembrance of the Tiananmen \nSquare massacre and some of the tragedies in the past.\n  I speak today with great affection, great admiration, and a great \nsense of loss about Paul Wellstone. He was a person who had great \nconvictions. He was a man of great conscience. He was a man who did not \nmind if he upset the political order. He did not care that it might \ndisrupt someone's schedule if he needed to make a speech on a position \nabout which he felt very deeply. As one who admired him for his \nconscience and his passion, I simply pause today to express my \nappreciation and admiration for the contribution he has made to all of \nus.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I would like to add my voice \nto the many already heard today in remembrance of a passionate, \nintelligent, spirited man, Paul Wellstone.\n  Senator Wellstone was an original in a crowd abounding with \ncharacters. Paul first gained notoriety for earning this office logging \nmiles on a green school bus, traveling across the State of Minnesota \ntouching the lives of everyone he came across. Once in Washington, Paul \nmade his mark quickly on each Senator, aide, reporter, and officer who \nhas been lucky enough to serve this institution, with him.\n  Paul Wellstone was a man of principle who provided thoughtful \nanalysis of every issue, but unlike some passionate statesmen, for Paul \nit was never personal. He respected differences in opinion though he \nwas unwavering in his own beliefs. And although I only served with him \nfor two years, I saw many times his warmth towards those around him \nregardless of political ideology.\n  A few weeks ago we were on the floor giving tribute to another of our \nMembers, Senator Jesse Helms, who will be retiring this year. Senator \nWellstone eloquently praised Senator Helms, who has been so often on \nthe other side of the ideological divide. At the conclusion of his \nremarks, he embraced Senator Helms.\n  Paul was a man of ideas, but also a man of the people. He will be \nsorely missed and our thoughts and prayers are with his sons, the \nWellstone staff, and the people of Minnesota during this difficult \ntime.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a man who is \ndeeply missed. He was a colleague, a leader and a friend: Senator Paul \nWellstone of Minnesota. Since joining the Senate in 1990, Paul earned \nhis reputation as a great leader and a man of the people. He had strong \nconvictions and an unparalleled passion for supporting the under-\nrepresented.\n  As a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nSenator Wellstone was a tireless advocate for the concerns of working \nAmericans. He pushed for expanded school funding and for improved \nteacher quality. He championed expanded financial aid to make sure that \nmoney was not an insurmountable hurdle for those who wanted to go to \ncollege. He fought for a higher minimum wage and better working \nconditions. He wanted to help the average American by working to \nprovide better, more affordable, more available health care. It was \nvisible to all who watched him that Paul truly loved his work, and the \npeople for whom he did that work.\n  Paul was a strong voice in the Senate and across the country in the \nbattle for human rights. For example, Paul and his wife Sheila crossed \nthe country fighting against domestic abuse. But his concern for the \ndignity of human beings did not stop at our country's borders. He \nchampioned a trade policy that would protect foreign workers from being \nexploited by multi-national corporations. He was a vigorous supporter \nfor peace in the Middle East and an advocate of foreign aid to help \nvulnerable children and the persecuted of all races and religions \naround the world. There wasn't an issue that affected human beings or \nour quality of life that Paul did not actively pursue; he fought for \nthe people, stood up for his beliefs and let the political chips fall \nwhere they might.\n  Senator Wellstone was also a leading proponent for American Veterans \nand their families. Year after year, in ways small and large, Paul \nWellstone fought to improve health care and other benefits for those \nwho had served their country. Many veterans disagreed with his views on \ndefense and foreign policy, but that did not matter to Senator \nWellstone. He understood that those who had put their lives on the line \nfor their country deserved special treatment and special respect \nwhether they supported him or opposed him.\n  People didn't always agree with his position, but he was always \nforthright. There was never a question of motives with Paul. Senator \nWellstone never let policy disagreements get personal; he always had a \nready wink or smile or joke to share when the debate had ended. And he \nhad a sense of humor that was downright infectious.\n  I worked most closely with Senator Wellstone on agriculture issues. \nPaul was a fighter. He worked tirelessly to improve policy for the \nfarmers in Minnesota and other rural states. Minnesota's dairy farmers \ncouldn't have asked for a more vigorous ambassador in the fight for a \nfairer dairy program; his efforts paid off in the 2002 farm bill, which \nmade great strides in leveling the playing field for Midwestern dairy \nfarmers. Paul worked on conservation issues, supported farm payment \nprograms to family farmers and worked to improve nutrition programs in \nthe farm bill. Senator Wellstone also understood the value of strong \ncommunities in rural areas and tirelessly pushed for rural economic \ndevelopment. As with everything else he worked on, Paul brought a \nunique passion and unceasing efforts to these battles.\n  Paul also worked side-by-side with me after the Red River flooded \nGrand Forks and East Grand Forks in one of the worst flood disasters in \nour history. His advocacy was invaluable as we secured disaster aid to \nrebuild the communities that had been devastated by flooding and fires. \nWhen a battle was truly important and people's livelihoods were on the \nline, there was no one who would fight harder than Paul Wellstone.\n  We also worked together on the issue of mental health parity. I can \nwell remember when Senator Wellstone took this issue to the Senate \nfloor during the debate on health insurance portability. The managers \nof the bill had crafted a delicately balanced bill and agreed to oppose \nall amendments in order to preserve their compromise. But that would \nnot stop Paul Wellstone. He offered his amendment, and gave a typically \npassionate, personal plea to put an end to the injustice that condemns \nthose with mental illnesses to inferior health care coverage. I was \nprivileged to join Senator Domenici and former Senator Alan Simpson in \nmaking the case for this amendment. And, despite the bipartisan \nopposition of the leadership on the bill, Paul's passion and the \npersonal stories shared by his allies carried the day overwhelmingly.\n  Paul's enthusiasm was infectious and deeply respected by his \ncolleagues. No loss on an amendment or other setback could keep Paul \ndown; he was always ready to rejoin the fight and perpetually \noptimistic that he would expand his coalition and find a way to win the \nbattle the next time. It is his character and good humor that we \nremember, and it is his unquenchable desire to help human beings of all \nkinds that will prove to be the greatest loss.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, Paul Wellstone was a committed and \neffective Senator who will be deeply missed by millions of often \nignored\n\n[[Page S10854]]\n\nAmericans, people who relied on him not only to fight their battles, \nbut to win important victories on their behalf.\n  I worked closely with Senator Wellstone for many years, in a number \nof areas important to both of us.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I know that \nhe was a tireless fighter for the men and women who had served in \nAmerica's armed forces, especially for ill and aging veterans, those \nleast able to fight for themselves, yet most in need of our help.\n  He fought for children, for their education and health care. And he \nworked to fashion a welfare system that encouraged work and protected \nchildren, without becoming punitive or unreasonable.\n  He also worked on behalf of the unskilled and unemployed, for a \nliving minimum wage, for job training, and for education benefits to \npromote workers' 21st century skills. And I knew I could always count \non his support for West Virginia's steelworkers and all workers \nthreatened by unfair practices in an increasingly complex economy.\n  Senator Wellstone's many battles earned him a reputation as an \nideologue and a firebrand. But I saw him reach across the aisle many \ntimes in his career. His first loyalty was to people, not to party, and \nhis work with Senator Domenici on the groundbreaking Mental Health \nParity Act stands as testimony to the strength of his priorities and \nthe effectiveness of his approach. I am proud to be able to continue \nhis work to bring equitable treatment to those who suffer from mental \nillness.\n  Paul Wellstone never believed that having principles and sticking to \nthem somehow meant you couldn't get things done in the United States \nSenate. Instead, he believed that you had to stick to your principles, \nor you couldn't get anything worthwhile done. It was an approach that \nmade him unique and won him unusual respect and admiration from every \nmember of this body.\n  Senator Wellstone's tragic death, along with the deaths of Sheila and \nMarcia Wellstone, staffers Tom Lapic, Mary McEvoy, and Will McLaughlin, \nand pilots Richard Conroy and Michael Guess, have left a void in the \nSenate and in our hearts.\n  But all of us who worked with him, or knew of the work he did, will \nfind some cheer in the memory of Minnesota's great voice for justice \nand opportunity.\n  Many will remember him for his fiery speeches and outspoken opinions.\n  But atomic veterans finally receiving treatment for their service-\nrelated disabilities, and homeless veterans with a new chance to find \ntheir way off the streets; parents whose children are learning from \nbetter teachers and enjoying better access to health care; activists \nwho found an ally in their struggle to end violence against women; \nworkers receiving job training; and entrepreneurs, especially women, \nminorities, and the urban poor, profiting from a changed and expanded \nfederal small business loan regime.\n  All these people will remember Paul Wellstone, as I will, not just \nfor what he said, but what he did.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10854-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, is the Senate in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the motion for \ncloture that will be voted on in about 15 minutes. This is a way to \nbegin bringing this debate on the creation of a Department of Homeland \nSecurity to a close and to allow our Government to begin the urgent \nbusiness of creating this new Department.\n  For those of us who have supported this idea for over a year now, \nthis moment is long overdue.\n  I am troubled by the draft of the substitute bill that began \ncirculating yesterday which, in my view, has not only a number of very \ngood parts in it which are quite similar to those contained in the \nbipartisan bill reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee but \nalso has a number of serious shortcomings that I hope to discuss when \nit comes to the floor either later today or tomorrow.\n  I am especially concerned that this new substitute bill creating a \nDepartment of Homeland Security also contains a number of special \ninterest provisions that are being sprung on the Senate without prior \nwarning or consideration. This is really not the time for that. We all \nought to be focusing on the terrorist threat, the need to create a \nDepartment of Homeland Security to meet that threat, and not on using a \nvehicle that is probably moving to passage to put into it a host of pet \npersonal projects. This is clearly not the time for that, and I hope \nthe President and members of the leadership will discourage Senators \nand Members of the House from using this homeland security debate as a \nvehicle for accomplishing those more special purposes.\n  More than 14 months have now passed since September 11, 2001, that \nday when terrorists viciously exploited our vulnerability and took the \nlives of 3,000 of our friends, family, and fellow Americans. Fifteen \nmonths have now passed since October of 2001, when Senator Specter and \nI initially proposed legislation creating a Department of Homeland \nSecurity to meet and beat the terrorist threat. This measure was not \njust bipartisan. It was, in fact, intended to be nonpartisan. Our \nproposal had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with \ngiving our Government the ability to protect the American people from \nanother terrorist attack. I point this out now, not out of pride but to \nmake clear how far we have come, in some ways in the wrong direction, \nand how much time we have taken before making this urgent \ntransformation.\n  In the beginning, the vision of a Homeland Security Department was a \nrecommendation and a report issued by a nonpartisan commission chaired \nby our former colleagues, Warren Rudman and Gary Hart. Then it was put \nforward in our committee bill. Then, as often happens to good ideas in \na democracy, it gained support and steam in Congress.\n  At the outset, President Bush and most Republicans in Congress \nresisted our legislation. I never took that resistance to be partisan, \nand I do not believe it was. The President argued that the coordinating \nOffice of Homeland Security within the White House led by Governor \nRidge would be strong enough to do this massive and complex job. So for \n8 months, the administration did oppose the creation of a Homeland \nSecurity Department.\n  In the meantime, the Governmental Affairs Committee held a total of \n18 hearings, exploring every possible aspect of our homeland defense \nvulnerabilities and how they should be fixed. On May 22 of this year, \nthe product of that work, a new version of the\n\n[[Page S10855]]\n\nbill, was reported out of our committee, unfortunately, on a party line \nvote with all Democrats voting in favor of a Department of Homeland \nSecurity and all Republicans opposed.\n\n  That partisan split did not last for long. A month or so later, last \nJune, I was very pleased when the President and most of our Republican \ncolleagues endorsed a proposal to create a Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Somebody once said it is common in Washington to see people change \ntheir positions but rare to see them change their minds. I like to \nbelieve that is exactly what happened in the White House. Based on \nexperience, the President and his assistants changed their minds about \nthe desirability of a Department of Homeland Security. We then worked \nwith the White House and Senate Republicans to build the greatest \npossible support for a bipartisan bill.\n  In July of this year, our committee sent such a bipartisan proposal \nto the Senate floor, which we began to debate in early September. We \nhad a good debate on this proposal. As was acknowledged by all people \non both sides, our committee legislation overlapped with the \nPresident's proposal and the House-passed bill on 90 or 95 percent of \nthe issues and decisions involved. Somehow, despite finding ourselves \non the same page, we could not find a way to turn the page together to \ncreate a more secure nation.\n  The major sticking point was civil service protections and collective \nbargaining rights for homeland security employees. We tried in good \nfaith to bridge that divide. We pushed repeatedly for a vote on a very \nreasonable bipartisan proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be given 5 additional minutes to speak \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. We pushed repeatedly for a vote on \na very reasonable bipartisan proposal crafted by Senators Breaux, \nNelson, and Chafee, to break the unnecessary logjam over the rights of \nFederal workers. But that was not to be had.\n  Our colleagues on the other side did not yield. Five times they \nrefused to allow a vote on their own bill, even though Democrats had \ntime and again given ground and simply wanted a vote on the compromise \namendment.\n  As will be remembered, mostly because of Senator Daschle's totally \njustified expression of anger on this floor, the Bush administration \neven began to question the patriotism of Democratic Senators rather \nthan joining us on this good-faith area of disagreement to try to come \nto an agreement.\n  In a new low in the tawdry business of political campaign \nadvertising, two of our colleagues, Senator Cleland and Senator \nCarnahan, were subjected to ads that took votes they cast out of \ncontext on homeland security and questioned their patriotism. That was \noutrageous and unacceptable. The fact is that these two Senators, \nCarnahan and Cleland, had been early supporters of a Department of \nHomeland Security. So what started out as a nonpartisan effort to \nprotect America's national security, unfortunately, became a very \npartisan effort to decide elections. Now the campaign is over. It is \ntime to turn the page once again.\n\n  Benjamin Franklin said, you may delay, but time will not. I say this \nafternoon we may delay, but the terrorists will not. Senators Hart and \nRudman issued another report within the last week or two and they have \npredicted another terrorist attack:\n\n       The next attack will result in even greater casualties and \n     widespread disruption to American lives and the American \n     economy. The need for immediate action is made more imminent \n     by the prospects of the United States going to war with Iraq \n     and the possibility that Saddam Hussein might threaten the \n     use of weapons of mass destruction in America.\n\n  Our vulnerabilities remain painfully serious, our disorganization in \nterms of our national apparatus to combat terrorism and protect \nnational security, homeland security, dangerously disorganized. That is \nwhy it is so critical to pass a bill creating a Department of Homeland \nSecurity, led by a strong and accountable Secretary. That will start to \nclose our vulnerabilities and improve our homeland defenses. Safety in \nthis new age is a civil right. When Americans live in fear, their \nrights are compromised. By invoking cloture and moving toward a \nresolution on a Department of Homeland Security today, we will be \nsaying loudly and clearly that we as a Nation do not succumb to fear. \nWe will face what threatens us with strength. We will not be shaken by \nthe voice that once again has threatened us on audiotape because we \nwill secure our own future by working together in Congress to better \norganize our government and thereby to secure more control of our own \ndestiny. Fear, uncertainty, and delay will be overcome by strength, \nunity, and American ingenuity. We will protect our friends, our family, \nand our children against the worst designs of our terrorist enemies by \ndrawing on the best in each of us and, hopefully, in the days ahead we \nwill do it together.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on this vital legislation. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think I have 5 minutes and then we have a \nvote, so I will try to be brief. It is fair to say at the beginning of \nthe process, no one conceived there could be partisanship on homeland \nsecurity. Neither party sought the partisanship, but yet in the process \nit came. We ended up as the session ended with a situation no one may \nhave chosen, but the reality was every Democrat except one was opposed \nto the President's program, and every Republican except one was for it. \nThe definition of partisanship is when you have an issue that produces \na division right down the middle aisle. That is what we had. We had an \nelection. I do think the American people spoke clearly on this issue. \nIf there was a dominant theme in the election, it was that the American \npeople were unhappy that we had not found our way to a bipartisan \nsolution to our homeland security dilemma.\n  Today we have an opportunity to fix that. We have the opportunity to \nfix it by the following procedure. We need to vote yes on cloture on \nthe Gramm amendment, which I intend to vote yes on. There will then be \na motion to table the Lieberman amendment which, if it is successful, \nand I hope it will be successful, will knock down the whole \nsuperstructure that has been piled on top of the underlying Homeland \nSecurity bill. That will give us an opportunity to offer a bipartisan \ncompromise that has been hammered out over the last 4 or 5 days. There \nis, at least in terms of what people have said in the reported media, a \nmajority of the membership that is in favor of that compromise. Even as \nwe speak, the House is debating a rule under which they will consider \nthat compromise. Tonight, about 6 p.m., it is my understanding they \nwill vote on that compromise. If they adopt it--and we have every \nreason to believe they will adopt it overwhelmingly--if we do the same, \nwe will have been successful in a bipartisan effort to provide for \nHomeland Security.\n  I conclude by simply noting when we have the kind of debate we had \nfor 6 weeks, it is easy to have hard feelings about it, it is easy to \nsay ``I want to prevail'' after all the effort. I hope now we have had \nan election, we have all had an opportunity to go home and tell our \nside of the story, we can now come together.\n  I do think we have a good agreement. It does not do everything I want \nto do. It does some things in ways that I would choose not to do. \nOverall, it has two redeeming qualities. One, it gives the President \nthe power he needs to get the job done, and the President and all those \nwho would be working with him to create and run this new Department say \nwith this compromise, they can get the job done.\n  Second, at least if everyone stays where they said they are, we have \na majority of Members willing to vote for it. No matter what you think, \nor no matter what perfection would be, if, after 6 weeks of very \ndifficult partisan debate, you have a proposal that will get the job \ndone, a proposal that is supported by the person who has the \nconstitutional responsibility for doing the job--the President--a \nproposal that those who would implement say they can make work, and a \nproposal the majority of Members have decided they are for, I am hoping \nwe can get a very big vote here and put this behind us.\n  Finally, in the waning days of a session, obviously any individual \nmember has extraordinary power. If someone\n\n[[Page S10856]]\n\ndecides they want to try to disrupt the process, they can. This is \nnot an extreme proposal. It is a compromise.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n4546, the Department of Defense authorization bill; that there be 75 \nminutes equally divided and controlled by Senators Levin and Warner or \ntheir designees; that upon the use or yielding back of the time with no \nintervening action or debate the Senate proceed to vote on the adoption \nof the conference report; that upon the adoption of the conference \nreport and the Senate resuming consideration of H.R. 5005, Senator \nThompson be recognized to offer a substitute amendment; that \nimmediately upon the reporting of the Thompson amendment Senator \nLieberman be recognized to offer an amendment to the Thompson \namendment; and, following that, Senator\n\n[[Page S10857]]\n\nFeingold be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. REID. I added to the unanimous consent request, which the \nminority leader did not have a chance to review, that Senator Feingold \nbe recognized following the Thompson amendment, which, as I understand \nit, deals with the cost-of-living increase.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, maybe something could be worked out, but \nthat was not part of the agreement that we had sent over. On that \nbasis, I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right. I only did that to get \napproval on our side, and I should have checked with the Senator first. \nI apologize.\n  Does the Senator from Texas only object to the Feingold part of the \nunanimous consent?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if the distinguished Democratic floor \nleader will yield, we had met and canvased our Members on the original \nagreement that we had reached. That agreement entailed bringing up the \nDefense authorization bill, having a 75-minute time limit on it, voting \non it, and then having Senator Thompson be recognized to offer the \nGramm-Miller substitute. Subsequently, the Senator from Nevada made a \nchange in that agreement which has not been canvased on my side. So I \nam required to object to the unanimous consent request as the Senator \nhas changed it. But the original one we would stand ready to accept.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right. Standard procedure around \nhere is to check with the other side. I did not do that. I apologize \nfor that.\n  Would the Senators agree that we could go do the first part of this \nunanimous consent request; that is, that we would go to the Department \nof Defense authorization conference report and have 75 minutes of \ndebate on that? And, of course, following the disposal of that, Senator \nDaschle or Senator Lott or the two managers of the bill would have the \nfirst right of recognition. I am sure that would accomplish the same \nthing anyway.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 4546, the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill; that there be 75 minutes of \ndebate equally divided and controlled between Senators Levin and \nWarner; that following disposition of that matter, the Senate proceed \nto vote on the adoption of the conference report; that upon adoption of \nthe conference report, we return to the consideration of H.R. 5005, \nwhich would be the regular order anyway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I shall \nnot--could we be more explicit as to whether or not we believe there \nshould be a recorded vote because that is a time element. At this \npoint, I think I would speak. We want to convenience the leadership in \nthe expediting of the matters before the Senate. I do not know if there \nhas been a request for a recorded vote because you are looking at 30 \nminutes for that probably. I just make that clarification.\n  Mr. REID. We have been told that on your side there is a vote \nrequired.\n  Mr. WARNER. OK.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Wisconsin, the Senator from \nWisconsin is not in any way jeopardized with anything in the first part \nof this unanimous consent request. If we can go to the Defense \nDepartment authorization conference report, H.R. 5005 reappears \nautomatically anyway.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I object to this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if there would be an understanding that \nmy amendment would follow this process as a separate agreement, I would \nbe happy to lift my objection.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I said to my friend from Wisconsin, I \nwill do what I can to make sure he has an opportunity to offer an \namendment. I cannot guarantee that. I can only do that with a unanimous \nconsent request.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4900\n\n(Purpose: To provide that Members of Congress shall not receive a cost \n          of living adjustment in pay during fiscal year 2003)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4900.\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following \n     sections:\n\n     SEC.   . COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no adjustment \n     shall be made under section 601(a) of the Legislative \n     Reorganization Act of 1946 (2 U.S.C. 31) (relating to cost of \n     living adjustments for Members of Congress) during fiscal \n     year 2003.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment is very straightforward. It \nwould eliminate the roughly $5,000 pay raise scheduled to go into \neffect next January for Members of Congress.\n  Put simply, this is the wrong time for Congress to give itself a pay \nhike.\n  Our economy is still recovering from the recent slowdown. The \nfinancial markets have been rocked, wiping out a chunk of the life \nsavings and retirement accounts of many families. Thousands of workers \nwho were laid off have not returned to work, and families face \nincreasing financial pressures.\n  Our budget is, once again, back in deficit. Even under the most \noptimistic scenarios, we are facing serious budget deficits for many \nyears to come. The on-budget deficit for the fiscal year that just \nended on September 30 is well over $300 billion, and the Office of \nManagement and Budget projects deficits totaling over one trillion \ndollars over the next five years.\n  In fact, the Federal Government is spending all of the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund surpluses, and then some, something we should do \nonly to meet the most critical national priorities.\n  A pay raise of nearly $5,000 for Members is not a critical national \npriority.\n  Nor can one argue that this pay raise is justified because Members \nhave not had one in a while. This is the fourth pay raise in as many \nyears. On January 1, 2000, Members received a $4,600 pay raise. On \nJanuary 1, 2001, Members received a $3,800 pay raise. On January 1, \n2002, Members received a $4,900 pay raise. And unless we stop it, this \ncoming January, Members will receive a $4,700 pay raise.\n  That will mean that, as of this coming January, Members will have \nreceived four consecutive pay hikes totaling $18,000--$18,000 per year.\n  That is more than the average annual Social Security benefit for a \nretired worker and spouse. It is more than the average annual Social \nSecurity benefit for a disabled worker, spouse, and child. It is more \nthan someone working minimum wage can make in a year and a half.\n  This automatic, stealth, pay raise system is absolutely wrong. It is \nan unusual thing to have the power to raise our own pay. Few people \nhave that ability. Most of our constituents do not have that power.\n  That this power is so unusual is a good reason for the Congress to \nexercise that power openly, and to exercise it subject to regular \nprocedures that include debate, amendment, and a vote on the record.\n  That is why this process of pay raises without accountability must \nend. It is offensive. It is wrong. And I believe it may be \nunconstitutional. The 27th Amendment to the Constitution states:\n\n       No law, varying the compensation for the services of the \n     senators and representatives, shall take effect, until an \n     election of representatives shall have intervened.\n\n  I recognize that some of our colleagues may feel they deserve a pay \nraise. I certainly respect that position. Last year, a colleague said \nto me that Members deserved a pay increase because of all that we had \nbeen through. Again, I strongly disagreed with that assessment last \nyear, but I understood the sentiment.\n  But even those who favor a pay hike should support voting for it on \nthe record. Certainly, having an open and public vote on the record for \na pay hike is better than the stealth pay raise that takes place with \nno action.\n  Standing up and making the case before the public is far better than \nquietly letting the pay raise take effect.\n\n[[Page S10858]]\n\n  We really should scrap the current stealth pay raise system, and I \nhave introduced legislation to stop this practice. But the amendment I \noffer today does not go that far. All it does is to stop the pay raise \nthat is scheduled to go into effect in January--the fourth pay raise in \nfour years.\n  Let's stop this backdoor pay raise, and then let's enact legislation \nto end this practice once and for all.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table the Feingold amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

To my knowledge, that request has been withdrawn.\n  For the information of our colleagues, it may well be possible to \npass the Department of Defense authorization bill by a voice vote.\n  Mr. REID. That sounds good. We have a number of Senators who have \nother things to do. That would be helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the conference report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the amendment of \n     the Senate to the bill (H.R. 5010), to authorize \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2003 for military activities \n     of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and \n     for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to \n     prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the \n     Armed Forces, and for other purposes, having met, have agreed \n     that the Senate recede from its disagreement to the amendment \n     of the House, and agree to the same with an amendment, signed \n     by a majority of the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report is printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nNovember 12, 2002.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we are pleased to bring to the floor the \nconference report on the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2003. The conference report would not have been \npossible without the dedicated work, over many months, of the members \nof our committee on both sides of the aisle, particularly our \nsubcommittee chairmen and ranking members who bore the brunt of the \nworkload in bringing this bill to this point.\n  I particularly thank my dear friend and colleague, Senator Warner, \nthe ranking minority member, soon to be chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, for the absolutely essential role he has played throughout \nthis process. Right up to the last minute, we were not sure we would \nget a bill. Senator Warner was able to help us accomplish that and get \nus to that goal line that we finally think we will cross. I thank him \nfor that.\n  Mr. WARNER. It was a team effort, Madam President. I thank my \ndistinguished chairman.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This conference report is named after Congressman Bob \nStump, who will be retiring, in honor of all the work he has done, for \nthe dedication of his entire congressional career supporting our men \nand women in uniform. The bill is deservedly named in his honor. Of \ncourse, Ike Skelton on the House side, the ranking member of the House \nArmed Services Committee, made an absolutely essential contribution as \nwell.\n  Last month, we passed H.J. Res. 114 that authorized the President to \nuse the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be \nnecessary and appropriate to defend the national security of the United \nStates against the continuing threat posed by Iraq and to enforce all \nrelevant U.N. Security Council resolutions in that regard.\n  It has been widely reported that the United States has already \nstarted the prepositioning of forces and supplies in anticipation of \npossible military action against Iraq in accordance with this \nresolution. As we stand poised on the brink of possible military \naction, hopefully action that will not be necessary but nonetheless \npossible military action, this bill will provide the men and women in \nuniform with the tools they need and the pay and benefits they deserve.\n\n[[Page S10859]]\n\n  For instance, this bill approves a significant military pay raise, \nincluding an across-the-board pay raise at 4.1 percent, with an \nadditional targeted pay raise for midcareer personnel that would result \nin pay raises ranging from 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent. The bill will \nauthorize a new assignment incentive pay of up to $1,500 per month to \nencourage service members to volunteer for hard-to-fill assignments. It \nwill authorize $10.4 billion for new construction of military \nfacilities and housing, which is an increase of about $740 million \nabove the requested level. The bill will add more than $900 million to \nthe Navy shipbuilding account. It will authorize an increase of $42 \nmillion in funding for the U.S. Special Operations Command. It provides \nan increase--and we are talking about increases above the requested \nbudget level from the administration, but when I make reference to \nincrease, that is the reference I am making. Here is a reference of \nmore than $100 million for defense against chemical and biological \nweapons, in addition to approving the budget request of $1.4 billion \nfor such efforts. We approved $2 billion which was requested for force \nprotection improvements to DOD installations around the world and in \norder to help address shortfalls in the Department's high-demand, low-\ndensity assets, including the EC-130 Commando Solo aircraft and the EA-\n6B electronic warfare aircraft fleet.\n  Depite all of these important provisions, we came very close to not \nhaving a conference report this year, because of the opposition of the \nWhite House to a single provision that was included in both the \nauthorization bills passed by both the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. This provision would permit retired members of the \nArmed Forces who have a service-connected disability to receive both \nmilitary retired pay earned through years of military service and \ndisability compensation from the Department of Veterans' Affairs based \non their disability. Currently, military retirees who receive VA \ndisability pay have their military retired pay offset by the amount of \ntheir VA disability pay.\n  Both the House and Senate versions of our bill included provisions \nphasing in the payment of both military retired pay and VA disability \npay to qualifying military retirees, although the Senate provision was \nmore generous and more expensive than the House version.\n  In June, the Office of Management and Budget issued a Statement of \nAdministration Position indicating their opposition to authorizing \nconcurrent receipt of military retired pay and VA disability pay. As a \nresult of this veto threat, the House conferees then decided that they \nwould not accept even their own concurrent receipt provision. The House \nconferees took this position despite the fact that the House voted 391 \nto 0 to instruct the conferees to agree to the Senate position on \ncurrent receipt in conference.\n  When it became clear that the President's veto threat would make it \nimpossible for us to achieve a conference report containing either the \nSenate concurrent receipt provision or the House concurrent receipt \nprovision, we had the choice of giving up on the defense bill for the \nyear, or finding an alternative that would be acceptable to the White \nHouse and the Republican leadership of the House of Representatives. \nWith the yeoman services and the extraordinary efforts of Senator \nWarner, we finally agreed to include a provision that would authorize \nan enhanced special compensation for certain military retirees with 20 \nyears of service equal to the amount of retired pay forfeited because \nof the receipt of veterans' disability compensation.\n  That is just a part of what we tried to accomplish. I commend Senator \nReid of Nevada and others who have fought so hard for this provision.\n  There are many members of our committee and many Members of this \nChamber who have really tried for years to address this concurrent \nreceipt problem. We moved the ball forward perhaps 20 yards this year. \nIt is, as I think Senator Warner has described, a beachhead. We are \nglad we were able to do this much. But it is disappointing that the \nveto threat that was hurled at us by the Office of Management and \nBudget made it impossible for us to do even more, despite all of our \nefforts.\n  Again, I thank Senator Warner. Without some provision on this \nsubject, frankly, this bill would not have been brought back to the \nfloor. We had to make some progress on this issue before we could, in \ngood conscience, bring a bill back to the floor.\n  But I emphasize it is just some progress. It is not anywhere near \nwhat the Senate did. It is not even close to what the House did. But it \nis clearly better than not making any progress at all.\n  The special compensation that is provided for in the bill would be \navailable to retirees who incur a disability attributable to an injury \nfor which a Purple Heart was awarded--that is one group--regardless of \nthe percent of disability, and the other group is a service-connected \ndisability rated at 60 percent or higher that was incurred as a result \nof any of four circumstances: Either the result of armed conflict, \nwhile engaged in hazardous service, in the performance of duty under \nconditions simulating war, or through an instrumentality of war. Any of \nthose four circumstances, if the disability is rated at 60 percent or \nhigher, will result in the special compensation being made available to \nour veterans.\n  These disabilities are sometimes called ``combat-related'' \ndisabilities for short. But that is really a misnomer. It is actually \nmisleading to call certain of them ``combat-related disabilities'' \nbecause the categories are far broader than simply combat-related.\n  I see Senator Reid on the floor. Again, I extend my thanks to him. \nWithout his driving concern on this issue of concurrent receipt, we \nwould not have been able to even advance the bill to the 20-yard line \nat which perhaps we are right now. It is progress--but minimal \nprogress. Again, it was the only way we could obtain this bill. We \nwould not have gotten to this point without the tenacity of Senator \nHarry Reid. There are others who joined with him over the years. But it \nis that persistence which has gotten us to this point.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will my friend yield? I know there is \nlimited time.\n  I want to say very briefly this compromise only affects up to 15,000 \nveterans. But having said that, 15,000 people deserve it as much as \nanyone deserves anything in the world. They are going to get help. That \nsays a lot. There are hundreds of thousands of other people which the \noriginal legislation would have helped. We are going to work on that \nlater.\n\n  I say to my friend, the chairman--and the soon-to-be chairman--how \nmuch I appreciate their tenacity. We have worked this bill over the \nyears. We have received, frankly, no help from the House in years past. \nI am happy. And I congratulate the President for easing off on his \nstatement that he was going to veto this legislation if there was \nanything in it for concurrent receipt. I appreciate the President \nbacking off. I wish he would have allowed us to have everything. He \ndidn't. But I take what we have gotten, and I am happy we have what we \nhave.\n  I say to those 15,000 veterans that I introduced the first \nlegislation. But this has been a team effort. We have worked very hard \nto get to this point. It is a large step forward.\n  I say for the third time this will help 15,000 people, most of whom \nare Korean and World War II veterans--and a sizable number of Vietnam \nveterans also, of course. But it is for mostly World War II veterans. I \nam so happy. I wish we had more.\n  But I want to say to my two friends who are here on the floor that \nthis is important legislation. It is landmark legislation.\n  I underline and underscore what I have said in the past about the two \nmanagers of this legislation. They could have caved in a month ago, and \nwe would have had a Defense authorization bill, and we could have \nshouted at the hilltops about this legislation. They did not do that \nbecause of this issue. I applaud and commend both of them for sticking \nto a matter of principle. That was correct. Words cannot adequately \nconvey how strongly I feel about the two of them for sticking with it. \nI am not on the committee. I couldn't comment. I couldn't be there to \ngive a speech. I didn't have an opportunity to issue a written \nstatement. That is how our conferences work. But the two of them did \nwhat they had to do. These 15,000 people owe it all to them.\n\n[[Page S10860]]\n\n  I have heard some people say we can't afford to take care of our \nveterans. We can afford to take care of our veterans. This is a \ntremendous step forward. We are taking care of our veterans.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I might again say how much the two of \nus--Chairman Levin and I--appreciate the strong support of Senator Reid \nthroughout particularly this year, building on what he did last year, \nto see that this issue was kept at the very forefront of our \nlegislative objectives with the annual authorization bill.\n  I say to my good friend that when the group of us gathered with the \nPresident's Chief of Staff at the White House, we were there with Mr. \nPrincipi, the chief of the Veterans Administration, the rough \ncalculation was that there are about 33,000 who will be embraced with \nthe formulation we have included in this bill. I think, as you say, and \nas I have said, it is a beachhead.\n  Mr. REID. That is even twice as good as I thought. That will amplify \nmy remarks, that 30,000 is twice as good as 15,000.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I can assure also the Senator from Nevada \nthat even though he might not physically be on the Armed Services \nCommittee, he was very much present every step of the way even when he \nwasn't present. Everyone is very much aware of his effort here, and of \nSenator Bob Smith's effort. Senator Hutchinson was extremely active, \ntoo. Senator Wellstone, of course, on this kind of veterans issue, was \ndeeply involved.\n  Mr. WARNER. We should include Senator Max Cleland. Very definitely, \nhe worked very hard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will also mention the role of Senator Cleland, Senator \nCarnahan, and others on this issue on the Armed Services Committee in a \nfew moments. Again, I thank the Senator for that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, Senator Reid and I and Senator Levin in \nour colloquy are discussing the importance of this bill including a \nprovision on concurrent receipts. Following the election, recognizing \nthat I would become chairman at the appropriate point in time when the \nchairmanships are established formally, that I make an effort to try \nand reconcile the differences and get a provision in this bill because, \ngive or take a few, I would think almost all 435 Members of the House \nof Representatives, in the course of their campaigns, had a colloquy \nwith their veterans on this subject.\n  I know from experience on the Senate side, those of us 30 plus who \nwere up for reelection this time and others seeking election had to \naddress this issue and respond to our veterans. Therefore, I felt it \nwas a matter of principle for the Congress of the United States not \njust to rely on campaign rhetoric, but to include in this very historic \nbill a provision directed at compensation for those veterans we deemed \nformed that category deserving of added funds.\n  I was privileged to work on drafts. I have showed them to our \ndistinguished chairman. While he had views that were somewhat different \non this issue in the course of the deliberations, without his final \nacknowledgment to agree with me that this was as much as we could \nachieve, we would not be here today. It was a joint effort, I say to \nthe chairman, and he encouraged his colleagues to sign the conference \nreport as I encouraged our colleagues.\n  I went to the White House with Congressman Duncan Hunter who was \nstanding in for Chairman Stump in the final days of the conference \nnegotiations. We were joined by Secretary Principi and the Deputy OMB \nDirector, Mrs. Dorn. We met with the President's chief of staff, and in \ndue course worked out what I felt was the best compromise we could \nachieve.\n  I wish to say I felt the White House was very cooperative--Mitch \nDaniels, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the chief \nof staff, and others. Mr. Principi was exceedingly helpful. I had \nseveral days before I joined him at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to \nread the names of those who bear witness to freedom and their \nsacrifices on that wall. It was interesting, as we were sitting there \non that cold twilight afternoon, I had a little piece of paper, and we \nwere sketching out the framework of what the two of us felt could be \nachieved. So I thank Mr. Principi for his efforts.\n  Duncan Hunter was just a tremendously strong working partner \nthroughout this entire deliberation. I thank those individuals, and \ncertainly Mr. Card, who is the President's chief of staff, for at some \npoint in the meeting saying: That's it, we're going to do it.\n  It is interesting, earlier that day Mr. Principi and I had attended \nan early meeting at the White House with the President when he \naddressed a number of veterans. I remember in the front row were a \nnumber of Congressional Medal of Honor veterans. We had some veterans \nfrom the United Kingdom, and the Chief of Staff of the Army, and the \nChief of Staff of the Air Force and others were present.\n  It was a very moving statement by our President acknowledging this \nNation's eternal gratitude to generations of veterans who made possible \nour life today in these United States, our quality of life, our \nfreedom.\n  It seemed to be an appropriate time to bring up with the President \nthis issue once again, and he said: We are going to take a good look at \nit, and that they did. So I am most grateful. Actually, it was not that \nday, for that day I left that meeting at the White House and went up to \nMaine to participate in the christening of a destroyer to honor John \nChafee, a United States Senator whom the Presiding Officer and I held \nin the greatest esteem and affection. It was the day following the \nWhite House meeting.\n\n  I refer to this as a beachhead, and I do so respectfully because \nthroughout this deliberation, in total fairness, we are faced with an \nextraordinary demand on the Department of Defense now, and particularly \nthe men and women who are currently in uniform, as well as the Guard \nand Reserve. We are in the course of transitioning in the roles and \nmissions, the equipment, and the training of our military departments \nto meet the threat of terrorism today. Therefore, the utilization of \ndollars from the United States taxpayers that go to the Department of \nDefense has to be prioritized against that threat today.\n  The dollars involved in this we estimate to be perhaps as much as $10 \nbillion over 10 years. That is a considerable factor to take into \nconsideration in the competition for these dollars.\n  I, speaking for myself, am ever mindful of the rising public debt \nnecessitated in large part by this war on terrorism.\n  So in fairness to the President and his advisers who looked at this \nissue and have looked at it for some period of time, there are other \nfactors that had to be considered. In the final analysis, I believe, \nwith the help of the chairman and others, we crafted the best possible \ncompromise we could get. I thank the distinguished chairman once again.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, how much time, may I ask the Chair, is \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Are 10 minutes exhausted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. I yield myself 5 additional minutes.\n  There are a number of other important initiatives in this bill we \nwill enact into law shortly. Here are just a few of them.\n  In the area of missile defense, the conference report, such as the \nSenate bill, authorizes the President to reallocate $814 million, \nshould he choose, from missile defense expenditures which, at least to \nsome of us, appears to be unjustified or duplicative in combating \nterrorism. And he can reallocate the $814 million to the effort to \ncombat terrorism. Again, that is left to his discretion. But this bill \ndoes, this year, require that he identify whether or not he has made \nthat choice.\n\n  The bill also would ensure better oversight and management of missile \ndefense programs in a number of ways. We are going to require \nprogrammatic information on ballistic missile defense programs with the \nbudget justification materials that come to Congress.\n  We are going to require the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, the \nso-called JROC, to perform a review of the cost, schedule, and \nperformance criteria for ballistic missile defense programs so that the \nvalidity of those criteria in relationship to military requirements can \nbe assessed.\n\n[[Page S10861]]\n\n  We are going to require the Department of Defense to establish a more \ndisciplined process for the evolutionary acquisition and spiral \ndevelopment of major defense acquisition programs, including missile \ndefense programs, by issuing guidance and instituting a process for the \napproval of acquisition plans.\n  Second, in the area of nuclear weapons, we have taken a number of \nsteps to ensure that the Department of Defense and the Department of \nEnergy do not take any precipitous actions to develop new nuclear \nweapons.\n  First, we rejected a House provision that would have repealed the \ncurrent law prohibiting the research, development, and production of \nlow-yield nuclear weapons.\n  Second, we included a Senate provision that would require the \nSecretary of Energy to specifically identify any funds requested for \nnew or modified nuclear weapons. If there is such a request, it cannot \nbe buried in some other subject. It has to be identified as such in the \nbudget material.\n  Third, we prohibited the Secretary of Energy from spending any funds \nfor the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator unless and until the Secretary \nof Defense submits a report setting forth the requirements for such a \nsystem and the employment policy behind such a system, as well as the \npotential for conventional alternatives to that Robust Nuclear Earth \nPenetrator.\n  And we prohibited the use of any funds authorized in the bill for \nnuclear-tipped missile defense interceptors.\n  We have a number of initiatives to ensure that the resources our \ntaxpayers provide for national defense are spent wisely. Some of these \ninitiatives include a major initiative based on the recommendations of \nthe Defense Science Board and the Department of Defense Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation to address budget shortfalls and \norganizational shortcomings in the Department's test and evaluation \ninfrastructure that have led to inadequate testing of major weapons \nsystems.\n  We have advanced last year's initiative by the committee to improve \nthe way in which the Department manages its $50 billion of services \ncontracts, which we anticipate will save $600 million.\n  We included a provision that will address the Department's inability \nto produce reliable financial information and to achieve $400 million \nof savings by deferring spending on new financial systems that would be \ninconsistent with a comprehensive financial management enterprise \narchitecture that is currently being developed by the Department.\n  We also have required, in this bill, that the Department establish \nnew internal controls to address recurring problems with the abuse of \npurchase cards and travel cards by military and civilian personnel.\n\n  In the area of efforts to combat terrorism and to lessen the danger \nposed by weapons of mass destruction, we have taken the following \ninitiatives:\n  A title of the bill sets aside $10 billion to fund ongoing operations \nin the war against international terrorism during fiscal year 2003. \nThis is a very important provision in the Senate bill. It was very \nimportant to the administration that we not use those funds for some \nother purpose. We did not. This will be the subject of the later \nappropriation, but, nonetheless, we set aside that $10 billion fund for \nthe ongoing operations in the war against terrorism.\n  Next, we fully funded the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram, including funding for the destruction of chemical weapons in \nRussia. And we fully funded the proliferation preventions at the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  We took an important step to give the President greater flexibility \nto waive any of the conditions precedent to carrying out that CTR \nprogram or the Freedom Support Act programs for three fiscal years. So \nnow the President can proceed with the Comprehensive Threat Reduction \nprograms even if they do not meet technical criteria for spending that \nmoney if it is in the national interest that he do so.\n  He has that waiver authority under this bill for 3 years. He has not \nhad it before. This is an important addition to the fight against \nproliferation, particularly of chemical and biological weapons.\n  In addition, and finally, we addressed a number of very difficult \nenvironmental issues. The conference report includes, first of all, \nsome environmentally sound provisions that we adopted in the Senate.\n  Two of these provisions would authorize the Department of Defense to \nenter into agreements with non-Federal entities to manage lands \nadjacent to military installations and to create buffer zones between \ntraining areas and the surrounding population. Those are two provisions \nwhich will help protect the environment.\n  A third one requires the Department to strengthen its program for the \nacquisition of procurement items that are environmentally preferable or \nare made with recycled materials.\n  We also, in the environmental area, succeeded in removing two ill-\nadvised House provisions. One would have exempted some DOD activities \nfrom the Endangered Species Act. That is not within the jurisdiction of \nour committee. We were able to obtain the removal of that provision. \nAnd the other provision which we were able to remove would have \nprovided special exemptions from environmental controls for the \ntraining range in Utah.\n  We were able to modify a House provision which authorized the \nexemption of certain Department of Defense activities from the \nprovisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. That was a highly \ncontroversial action on the part of the House. We were able to obtain \nsome important concessions in the conference relative to that \nprovision, including an agreement to structure the provisions so that \nthe Department of Interior will be required to exercise its regulatory \npowers over the Department of Defense activities impacting migratory \nbirds and to require appropriate actions to mitigate the impact of \nDepartment of Defense actions on migratory birds.\n  I hope and believe that the tradeoff that we made in dropping the \nendangered species provision and the Utah provision and getting a \nmodification of the migratory bird provision was a sound one. I believe \nthat we made some real progress, given the point that we were starting \nwith in the Senate, which was facing all this language on the House \nside, which we had to either remove or to modify, as well as preserving \nour own provisions which were very supportive of environmental \nprotection.\n\n  I was very disappointed that we were unable to include a Senate \nprovision that would repeal the statutory prohibitions on the use of \nDepartment of Defense facilities for legal abortions so that military \nwomen overseas could get a legal abortion, at their own expense, in a \nDOD medical facility overseas. This was a provision that, if we were \nable to maintain it, would have led to a veto of this bill.\n  Again, we faced the House conferees who were determined that there \nwould be no bill if this provision was in it. So now we continue for \nanother year what I consider to be the absurdity of forcing women who \nare obtaining a legal abortion to come home. These are women in the \nmilitary, committed to the service of their country, who are going to \nbe required, for another year, until we face this issue again next \nyear, to return home to obtain an abortion, which is legal, which they \nhave chosen to obtain.\n  I find this to be an unconscionable provision in our law. And we are \ngoing to continue to try, to the best of our ability, to change that \nprovision. But this year we did not prevail, did not succeed, and we \nwould have faced a veto of this bill. The Office of Management and \nBudget was very clear in a letter that they would recommend the veto of \nthis bill if the Senate provision, which removed this impediment to \nlegal abortions, at their own expense, by women who are serving this \nNation--if that, in fact, prevailed, there would have been a veto.\n  Madam President, our Armed Forces are ready to help keep the peace, \nto deter traditional and nontraditional threats to our security and our \nvital interests around the world. And they are prepared to win any \nconflict decisively. The success of our forces in Afghanistan is a \ntribute to the men and women of the Armed Forces and the investments in \nnational defense that Congress and the Department of Defense and \nadministrations over time have made for many years.\n  The investments in previous years, indeed in previous decades, in \nequipment, in treating our personnel properly, in raising morale, in \nreadiness--\n\n[[Page S10862]]\n\nthese investments by prior Congresses, by this and prior \nadministrations, have paid off. And future success on the battlefield \nwill likewise depend upon the success of Congress and the Department to \nprepare and to train and to equip our military for tomorrow's missions.\n  So as we stand on the brink of possible conflict in Iraq, the \nconference report builds on the considerable strengths of our military \nforces and their record of success by preserving a high quality of life \nfor U.S. forces and their families, by sustaining readiness, and by our \nefforts to transform the Armed Forces to meet the threats and the \nchallenges of tomorrow.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I, once again, thank the chairman for \nhis service. We have been together now for 24 years on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. And, given the results of the recent elections, we \nwill be here for another 6.\n  When I yielded the chairmanship 2 years ago, thereabouts, Senator \nLevin just moved one place over. Now I will just move back to that one \nplace. We have conducted the affairs of this committee in a very \nspirited way, but I think it reflects as high a degree of \nbipartisanship as can be achieved in this magnificent institution, the \nSenate.\n  I commend the chairman, and I commend him for this bill. He has \nworked long and hard on it, with me at his side, together with our \nrespective Members. It is a good bill, a very good bill.\n  (Mr. JEFFORDS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Virginia. I had \nno doubt he would be back. I am glad to see him back. We kept the chair \nwarm for him. The gavel will be handed over with--I will not say with \nunmixed feelings because, obviously, there are mixed feelings, but I \ncannot think of anyone I would rather hand the gavel to, if it is not \non our side of the aisle, than my dear friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, we, as a Nation, were astonished, once again, in the \npast few days to see the face of Osama bin Laden and hear the remarks \nhe (allegedly) made. I am not here to in any way lend credence to the \nvalidity of this, but nevertheless, those in the position to determine \nwill eventually determine the validity of that piece of tape. But it \ndid bring home to America the threats that this Nation faces and the \nfact that we, under the leadership of a brilliant President, are \nengaged in all-out war, together with our allies and others, in a war \non terrorism. This bill is an essential building block in that war.\n  Questions were raised in the course of our deliberations on this \nbill: Can we as a Nation afford, can the military take on the \nobligation to engage the enemy of terrorism in the worldwide effort \nand, at the same time, if it is necessary--and I repeat, if it is \nnecessary--to use force against Saddam Hussein and his regime--not the \npeople of Iraq, but Saddam Hussein and his regime? And I say this bill \nprovides that measure of support such that our President, in his role \nas Commander in Chief, can conduct the full range of options militarily \nnecessary to protect this Nation, be it from terrorism or the possible \nuse of force in Iraq.\n  That brings me to another point. As we all watch the developments in \nIraq and, indeed, today, very interesting developments, I stop to think \nwe would not as a free world be in the position of having this new \nresolution from the United Nations had it not been first and foremost \nfor the courageous leadership of our President who, over a period of a \nyear or more, has been constantly reminding the world, not just our \ncitizens, of the threats from Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass \ndestruction, and the need to address those threats.\n  Wisely, he sought to go to the United Nations where he put forth that \nhistoric speech. Had it not been for the vision, the foresight, and the \ncommitment of this President, we would not be seeing today the \nunfolding of what I hope will be a successful resolution of the \ndestruction of the weapons of mass destruction now possessed by Saddam \nHussein without the use of force.\n  The second factor in achieving the action by the United Nations was \nthe fact that the men and women in the U.S. military are trained, are \nready, and would respond to the Commander in Chief's order, if that \nwere necessary, to resolve this critical worldwide issue by the use of \nforce. They are ready. Saddam Hussein knows that. So I salute the men \nand women of our Armed Forces who are as much responsible for what we \nhope will be the successful resolution of this issue pursuant to the \nmost recent resolution of the U.N. It is just as important a factor as \nthe deliberations of the U.N. itself and indeed the valiant efforts of \nour President, and I wish to acknowledge that.\n  Congress also played an important role by passing a strong resolution \nin support of the President; a resolution authorizing the use of force \nagainst Iraq. The militaries of the U.S. and our allies stand by, ready \nto use force if necessary, pursuant to that authorization by the \nCongress.\n  I think this bill should remove any doubt of our commitment to fight \nterrorism, to use force if it becomes necessary in Iraq, and to defend \nthe interests of Americans and our allies throughout the world.\n  An undertaking of the magnitude of this bill is ultimately a \nbipartisan effort. Our committee has a long tradition of \nbipartisanship. Senator Levin and I have served under Chairman Stennis, \nSenator Goldwater, Senator Tower, Senator Nunn, and now the two of us \nare privileged to have that responsibility, I as ranking member, and \nChairman Strom Thurmond, who is now present on the floor, all of whom \ntried to have the highest possible bipartisanship in this committee. \nOur chairman and I have continued that tradition.\n  When it comes to the welfare of the men and women of the armed \nservices, when it comes to the importance of the security of this \nNation and the recognition by our allies that we stand to support them, \nwe should have, and do have, that degree of bipartisanship. \nConsequently, there are many people deserving of recognition and thanks \nwho have kept that tradition.\n  I especially want to thank my chairman for his leadership. I want to \nthank all of our subcommittee chairmen and ranking members for their \ntireless efforts in ensuring that our troops have the tools they need \nfor peace to accomplish such missions as they may have to undertake.\n  At this point, I would like to pay special tribute to three \nRepublican Members of our Committee who will not be returning next \nyear. Senator Strom Thurmond has proudly served as a Member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee since January 14, 1959, during the \nEisenhower Administration. During nine successive Administrations, \nSenator Thurmond has provided a steady hand, sage advice and strong \nsupport for our men and women in uniform. He also had a distinguished \nmilitary career, leading members of the ``Greatest Generation'' ashore \non the beaches in Normandy and rising to the rank of Major General in \nthe Army Reserve. He is a true American hero, and he will be missed in \nthe years ahead. Senator Bob Smith has been a Member of the Committee \nsince 1991, serving most recently as the Chairman of the Strategic \nSubcommittee from 1997-1999. A distinguished Navy veteran who served in \nVietnam, Senator Smith has been a champion of veterans issues, joining \nSenators Reid and Hutchinson in the efforts on concurrent receipt. And \nfinally, Senator Tim Hutchinson has made significant contributions \nduring his four years of service on the Committee. As the Chairman and \nthen Ranking Member of the Personnel Subcommittee, Senator Hutchinson \nhas been committed to improving the quality of life of our military \npersonnel. He joined me in crafting legislation--TRICARE for Life--to \nensure that we meet our commitment to our military retirees to provide \nthem with health care for life. In addition, he has been instrumental \nin ensuring significant pay raises for the military for four \nconsecutive years and major improvements in educational benefits. They \nhave all been valuable Members of the Committee and they will all be \nmissed.\n\n  No committee succeeds without a dedicated professional staff. I \nespecially want to recognize the unwavering leadership of Judy Ansley \nof the minority staff, who will soon be moving over to become chief of \nstaff of the\n\n[[Page S10863]]\n\nmajority, and of David Lyles who likewise will shift his desk a slight \ndistance and continue the partnership that these two magnificent \nprofessionals have, as well as the wonderful service they render to the \nSenate, and indeed our country.\n  I also want to thank Peter Levine, counsel to both sides. He is good, \nand we call on him. Fortunately, we do not have to pay his salary out \nof our allocation, but we get the full measure of his brilliance.\n  Each of them have a marvelous professional staff. I would like to \nrecognize each of them individually. On the Republican staff: Chuck \nAlsup, David Cherington, Marie Dickinson, Ed Edens, Brian Green, Bill \nGreenwalt, Gary Hall, Carolyn Hanna, Mary Alice Hayward, Bruce Hock, \nGeorge Lauffer, Patty Lewis, Tom MacKenzie, Ann Mittermeyer, Joe \nSixeas, Leslie Stone, Scott Stucky and Dick Walsh. On the Majority and \nnon-designated staff: Dara Alpert, Ken Barbee, Mike Berger, June \nBorawski, Leah Brewer, Chris Cowart, Dan Cox, Madelyn Creedon, Mitch \nCrosswait, Rick DeBobes, Brie Eisen, Evelyn Farkas, Richard Fieldhouse, \nDaniel Goldsmith, Creighton Greene, Jeremy Hekhuis, Gary Howard, Drew \nKent, Jennifer Key, Maren Leed, Gary Leeling, Mike McCord, Tom Moore, \nCindy Pearson, Arun Seraphin, Christina Still, Mary Louise Wagner, Nick \nWest, and Bridget Whalen. So I pay my respects, for they deserve credit \nand recognition.\n  The conference report before the Senate represents an important step \nforward in ensuring the readiness of our Armed Forces, protecting our \nhomeland, and ensuring success in the ongoing global war against \nterrorism. During this critical time in our history, with our Nation at \nwar and preparing, together with the United Nations, to meet the \nthreats posed by Iraq--I should say posed by Saddam Hussein, not posed \nby the people of Iraq--it is essential that we provide our President \nand the Armed Forces with the vital resources they need to defend our \nNation to fight the scourge of terrorism both at home and abroad, and \nto prepare for future threats.\n  I use the word ``home'' purposely because in my lifetime, I have seen \nincredible transition, the focal point being 9/11. I look upon the \narmed services of the United States as one of the greatest assets the \nAmerican people have, and we should constantly look for ways in which \nthey can, within the legal framework of our laws, be a full partner \nwith those who are entrusted with our homeland defense. I am not just \nspeaking of the Guard, the Reserve and others, but I am talking about \nthe security forces, the police, be they Federal, State or local, the \npeople who provide medical assistance, the people who provide all types \nof assistance in the event of a problem at home. We have to continue to \nstrengthen and move in that direction, again within the framework of \nthe laws.\n\n  As President George Washington stated in his first inaugural address \nto Congress on January 8, 1790, and I quote:\n\n       To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means \n     of preserving the peace.\n\n  That is what this bill is about, to be prepared. We can all take \npride in this legislation. It represents the bipartisan work of all \ncommittee members in both Chambers to support our men and women in \nuniform, and their families.\n  I want to commend Chairman Stump, ranking member Ike Skelton, and \nDuncan Hunter. They were marvelous working partners in the House for \nthe chairman and I to conclude this conference. This bill is named in \nhonor of Chairman Stump, a World War II veteran who lied about his age \nand joined the Navy when he was 15 years old and saw combat before his \n18th birthday. I guess that is one of the reasons that generation, of \nwhich I am a very small and modest part having come into the tail end, \nis referred to as the greatest generation.\n  Chairman Stump exemplifies that name: The greatest generation. The \nfact that this legislation is named in his honor is a fitting tribute \nto that true patriot.\n  I believe the Presiding Officer served in the House of \nRepresentatives at one time with Chairman Stump.\n  I also want to thank Duncan Hunter and Ike Skelton for their \nunwavering efforts.\n  Our President sent the first signal to strengthen defense by asking \nCongress to increase spending, a very considerable increase in this \nlegislation. This conference report sends a further signal to our \ncitizens and to nations around the world that the United States is \ncommitted to a strong national defense. More importantly, this \nconference report sends a clear signal to our men and women in uniform, \nfrom the newest private to the most senior flag or general officer, \nthat we are clearly behind them and we support their efforts around the \nworld, and we are behind their families.\n  We must always pause to remember that the men and women in the Armed \nForces rely first and foremost on the support they receive from their \nloved ones.\n  I want to thank the Department of Defense. I have had very cordial \nand strong working relations with Secretary Rumsfeld--we go way back \ntogether in the Nixon administration--as well as the Deputy Secretary \nof Defense and others. I think he has put together a good team. Yes, we \ndo battle with them. We did battle with them on concurrent receipts, \nbut in the end they swung in and gave us the technical advice to write \nthis particular section on concurrent receipts in a way that creates a \nvery special class of deserving career veterans, career military \nveterans.\n  To reiterate, I am proud to join Chairman Levin in recommending this \nconference report to the Senate. This has been a long and difficult \nconference; but, we have achieved our goal of providing for our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  An undertaking of this magnitude is ultimately a bipartisan team \neffort. Our Committee has a long tradition of bipartisanship. \nConsequently, there are many people deserving of recognition and \nthanks. I especially want to thank my friend and colleague of 24 years \nin this Chamber and on the committee, Chairman Carl Levin, for the \nleadership he has shown in bringing this conference to a successful \nconclusion. I also want to thank all of our subcommittee chairs and \nranking members for their tireless efforts in ensuring our troops have \nthe tools they need to accomplish their missions. No committee without \na dedicated, professional staff. I especially want to recognize the \nunwavering leadership efforts of David Lyles, Judy Ansley, and Peter \nLevine in bringing this process to a successful conclusion. They have \nled a great staff, all of whom deserve great credit and recognition.\n  The conference report before the Senate represents an important step \nforward in ensuring the readiness of our armed forces, protecting our \nhomeland, and ensuring success in the on-going global war against \nterrorism. During this critical time in our history, with our nation at \nwar and preparing--together with the United Nations--to meet the threat \nposed by Saddam Hussein, it is essential that we provide our President \nand our armed forces the vital resources they need to defend our \nNation, fight the scourge of terrorism at home and abroad, and prepare \nfor future threats.\n  As President George Washington stated in his first annual address to \nCongress on January 8, 1790:\n\n       To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means \n     of preserving the peace.\n\n  We can all take pride in this legislation. It represents the \nbipartisan work of all committee members--in both Chambers--working \ntogether to support our men and women in uniform, and their families. I \nespecially want to thank Chairman Bob Stump for his efforts this year \nand congratulate him for his outstanding work on behalf of our men and \nwomen in uniform for the 26 years he has served on the House Armed \nServices Committee. The fact that this legislation is named in his \nhonor is a fitting tribute to a true patriot. I also want to thank \nCongressmen Duncan Hunter and Ike Skelton for their unwavering efforts \nto ensure we have a strong defense authorization act for our nation.\n  Our President sent the first signal by asking Congress to increase \ndefense spending. This conference report sends a further signal to our \ncitizens, and to nations and around the world, that the United States \nis committed to a strong national defense. More importantly, this \nconference report sends a clear signal to our men and women in uniform, \nfrom the newest private to the most\n\n[[Page S10864]]\n\nsenior flag officers, that we are clearly behind them and we support \ntheir efforts around the world.\n  The conference report before us contains the largest defense increase \nin over 20 years--an increase of $45.0 billion over the fiscal year \n2002 appropriated level. The good news story associated with this much \nneeded increase is that it has the full, bipartisan support of the \nCongress. While there are always minor disagreements over how some of \nthe money in this bill should be allotted, there was no dissent about \nthe need for this significant increase in the top line for defense. \nThis is a remarkable display of unity behind our President, so \nimportant and fitting with our Nation at war.\n  In line with the request of the President, the conference report \nsignificantly increases the major defense accounts over the Fiscal Year \n2002 appropriated levels:\n  It increases spending on military personnel by over 14 percent \nincluding a 4.1 percent pay raise for our servicemen and women.\n  The bill increases the procurement account by over 20 percent. This \nwill enable our military departments to procure the equipment they need \nto replace aging and heavily used assets, as well as to buy the things \nthey need to protect our facilities, infrastructure and people in these \nincreasingly uncertain and dangerous times.\n  Additionally, the bill increases spending on research and development \nby almost 17 percent, ensuring that critical investment is being made \nto develop the capabilities we need in the future to deter and defeat \nemerging threats to our national security.\n  The bill also sets aside a $10.0 billion reserve fund, as requested \nby the President, to pay for ongoing and future military operations in \nthe global war on terrorism.\n  The threats to our nation and the ongoing war on terrorism demand \nthis increased investment in national security, both now and in the \nfuture.\n  The bill contains many key provisions which will improve the quality \nof life of our men and women in uniform, our military retirees, and \ntheir families. In addition to the 4.1 percent pay raise I mentioned \nearlier, additional funding is included for facilities and services \nthat will greatly improve the quality of life for our service personnel \nand their families, both at home and abroad. This legislation also \ncontains key provisions that will better organize the Department of \nDefense to support the critical homeland defense mission, including: \ncreation of an Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence; \nauthorization to add an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland \nDefense; and, a requirement that the Secretary of Defense establish at \nleast one Weapons of Mass Destruction-Civil Support Team within every \nstate and territory.\n  One of the most difficult issues facing the conference was how to \nensure that our military retirees, who have incurred disabilities, \nreceive a measure of military compensation.\n  Concurrent receipt of retired pay and disability pay is as complex an \nissue as I have dealt with in my 24 years on this committee. Here is \nhow I view this issue: success in certain military operations requires \nextensive planning, establishment of a ``beachhead,'' and then long \nterm effort to determine the equities and priorities for the future.\n  We have crafted such a ``beachhead'' in this conference report--I \ncall it ``Purple Heart-Plus-Others.'' The provision in this conference \nreport provides substantial recognition and compensation for those who \nwere injured in combat, that is, all those with disabilities resulting \nfrom injuries for which they received the Purple Heart. In addition, \nthose retirees most severely disabled in combat related operations, in \npreparation for combat, and in performing hazardous service, that is, \nthose with disabilities rated at 60 percent or greater, would receive \nadditional compensation. We will rely on the Secretary of Defense to \nexercise his discretion to further define the nature of this service. \nIn both cases, those career retirees who have a certain degree of \ndisability would receive the same amount of compensation--under a new, \nspecial compensation program--as if we had removed the prohibition on \nconcurrent receipt.\n  We all know that this is a complex issue and an emotional issue. \nInaction is not an option. We must establish our ``beachhead'' today. I \ncommit to holding early hearings next year to fully establish a body of \nfact on this issue. I see great merit in establishing a Presidential \ncommission that can objectively examine the many issues related to the \nadequacy of compensation provided to our disabled veterans. I await the \nviews of the veterans to be expressed at hearings.\n  It is important to note that this conference report supports and \nfully funds virtually all of the priorities established by the \nDepartment of Defense for the development and procurement of major \nweapons systems, including the Joint Strike Fighter, the F-22, the \nArmy's Future Combat System, and unmanned aerial vehicle programs. I \nremain committed to supporting investment in technologies that will \nenable us to field significant numbers of unmanned aerial and ground \ncombat vehicles, as soon as feasible.\n  In addition, I am pleased that the conference was able to add $229 \nmillion to the CVN(X) aircraft carrier to restore the original \ndevelopment and fielding schedule for this essential program. The \ncarrier has proved its worth again and again in the global war on \nterrorism--a war which has relied extensively on carrier-based assets. \nThis bill supports acceleration of this important program.\n  The world as we knew it changed forever on September 11. We lost not \nonly many lives and much property that day, but we also lost our \nuniquely American feeling of invulnerability. But, from our darkest \nhour, our nation has quickly emerged stronger and more united than \never. Our President has rallied our country and many nations around the \nworld to fight the evil of terrorism, and to confront those who \nthreaten peace and freedom around the world.\n  As we conclude the 107th Congress, our nation is at war. U.S. \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, together with their coalition \npartners, are engaged on the front lines in the global war against \nterrorism, with a mission to root out terrorism at its source in the \nhopes of preventing future attacks. We are now faced with the \npossibility of war with Iraq, if the current U.S. led U.N. efforts \nfail.\n  Our armed forces have responded to the call of duty in the finest \ntraditions of our nation, and they are prepared to protect our security \nin future conflicts. It is critical that the Congress keep faith with \nour troops by providing the resources and capabilities our President--\nour Commander-in-Chief--has requested.\n  Homeland security is now, without a doubt, our top priority. We have \na solemn obligation to protect our nation and our citizens from all \nknown and anticipated threats--whatever their source or means of \ndelivery. Our President, George W. Bush, has promised our nation that \nhomeland security is his most urgent priority. The fiscal year 2003 \nbudget the President submitted reflected this priority.\n  The conference report before us funds the urgent security needs of \nour nation by doubling the funding for combating terrorism at home and \nabroad, in supporting the President's request for missile defense, and \ninvesting in new technologies to detect weapons of mass destruction and \nto deter their development.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this conference report that upholds \nthe President's fundamental national security priorities and makes the \nright investments in future capabilities. It is imperative that we send \nour President, our fellow citizens and the world a message of resolve \nfrom the Congress--a National Defense Authorization Conference Report \nthat provides the resources and authorities our Nation's leaders and \nour armed forces require to protect our Nation and our vital interests \naround the world.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me again thank my dear friend from Virginia. I yield 5 \nminutes to the Senator from Hawaii. If the Senator needs additional \ntime, it will now be available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nconference report to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2003. I thank my ranking member, Senator Inhofe, for his support \nand cooperation. It is truly an honor to work\n\n[[Page S10865]]\n\nwith him as we both seek to advance the readiness of our armed forces. \nI also commend Senator Levin and Senator Warner for their tireless \nefforts during a challenging conference.\n  As the chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and \nManagement Support, I want to highlight a few provisions in the \nconference report which enhance the readiness of the men and women in \nour armed forces. The bill protects the $10 billion the President \nrequested for operating costs of the ongoing war on terrorism. Fully \nfunding this request reinforces our country's commitment to continuing \nthe war on terrorism, and it also means that in so doing we will not \nhave to rob funds from the operation and maintenance accounts needed to \nfund all of our other critical ongoing defense activities such as \ntraining and maintenance.\n  Conferees also took actions to ensure that our forces can continue to \nmake the most prudent use of existing training assets. To do this, we \nauthorized exemption of the Department of Defense from the Migratory \nBird Treaty Act when training events result in incidental takings, but \nrequired DOD to take appropriate actions to avoid any unnecessary \ntakings. We also authorized the Department of Defense to enter into \npartnerships to purchase land, or easements on land, that would protect \ntraining ranges, and provided $7.2 million for improvements to those \nranges.\n  While the conferees believed that this change to the Migratory Bird \nTreaty Act was necessary to protect readiness in light of recent court \nactions, the conferees did not believe the administration made the case \nthat the exemptions it sought from the Endangered Species Act for the \nDepartment of Defense were warranted. I continue to believe that when \nthe Department's training needs for land, sea and air space conflict \nwith other needs in our society, whether it is protecting the \nenvironment or accommodating the surrounding civilian populations, our \nfocus should be first and foremost on ensuring that all parties \ninvolved work together in a spirit of cooperation.\n  To help to address longer term readiness challenges, the conferees, \ncontinued our efforts from last year to enhance the Department of \nDefense's coordination of anti-corrosion programs. Studies estimate \nthat corrosion costs the Department up to $20 billion annually, and \nthat corrosion continues to be a serious maintenance challenge and \nmanpower drain. We therefore recommended that DOD designate a senior \nofficial to oversee anti-corrosion plans and policies, and added over \n$10 million to fund those efforts and other anti-corrosion testing, \nresearch, and product applications.\n  In an effort to continue efforts to improve the quality of life, \nconferees authorized the requested increases to improve the buildings \nwhere servicemembers live and work, and added an additional $740 \nmillion in military construction funding, which will be enough to \nmaintain the level of investment in our facilities at last year's \nlevel. Included in this amount is over $700 million in funding \nspecifically dedicated to enhancing the security of our installations.\n  To improve DOD management, the bill includes a number of provisions \nto expand DOD's authority to acquire major weapon systems more \nefficiently. With respect to services contracts, we built on last \nyear's legislation requiring improved management of the $50 billion DOD \nspends annually on services by establishing specific goals for the use \nof competitive contracts and performance-based contracting. These goals \nshould help ensure that the Department of Defense achieves contract \nservices savings through specific management improvements rather than \nthrough program reductions. The conference report also requires DOD to \ndevelop a comprehensive financial management enterprise architecture, \nand addresses recurring problems with the abuse of purchase cards and \ntravel cards by certain military and civilian personnel.\n  I also want to mention an issue of significant importance to the \npeople of Hawaii--the cleanup of the island of Kahoolawe. I commend the \nNavy and the State of Hawaii for working to resolve a number of \nchallenges. I am pleased about the Navy's commitment to continue \nclearance efforts until November 11, 2003, and its continued efforts to \nmeet the intent and goals of the memorandum of agreement between the \nNavy and the State of Hawaii signed in 1994.\n  While I am disappointed that the conference report does not include \nthe provisions passed by the Senate with respect to concurrent receipt, \nI believe the conference report strongly supports the readiness of our \nforces, both now and in the future. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Hawaii for his invaluable service \nto our committee as well as his statement. He has been the chairman of \nour Readiness Subcommittee and has done it with a wonderful spirit and \ngreat success. I thank him. We do not know what the subcommittee \nstructures will look like next year, but hopefully he will continue to \nbe a valuable part of our committee. I thank him for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time is allotted on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes is available.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am very pleased with this defense \nbill. I congratulate Chairman Levin. He is a master leader in the \nSenate. His skill at managing complex matters is very well known. He \nworks with all members of the committee, Republican and Democrat. We \nare able to reach agreements that sometimes would not be reached, and I \nbelieve he has guided us in a good way. I also appreciate the \nleadership of the ranking Republican, Senator John Warner, a man who \nhas given his life to the defense of this country, served it ably in so \nmany different capacities, and all the members of the committee and all \nthe staff. Particularly, I note Archie Galloway on my staff who has \nworked tirelessly on this effort, a retired colonel infantry combat \nveteran who does a great job for me.\n  Money will not tell us everything, but we have the largest increase \nin spending on this defense bill in over 10 years, nearly a $50 billion \nincrease. That is very healthy in light of the significant declines our \nDefense Department has suffered since the Gulf War in 1991. After the \nBerlin wall fell and after the Gulf War, we went into a significant \nreduction in our spending, virtually 40-percent reduction in personnel, \nand cuts in many different areas. After the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion, some reductions were appropriate. Most experts would say today \nwe went too far, that we forgot we needed to transform our military, \nand we forgot to meet the new challenges and to utilize the new \nequipment and technologies available to make our soldiers more \neffective, less at risk, able to target enemy troops and not hit enemy \ncivilians, as has happened in previous wars. I am afraid we did not \ninvest enough in the last decade in these efforts.\n  Within the last several years we moved aggressively forward. When I \ncame on the committee our defense budget was under $300 billion. This \nyear it will hit $393 billion, I believe, nearly $50 billion more than \njust last year. This allows us to continue to provide quality pay \nraises and personnel benefits for our men and women in uniform. These \nefforts have strengthened their ability to make a career of the armed \nservices. Moreover, we authorized incentive income pay of up to $1,500 \nper month to keep key personnel in key positions, the kind of thing we \nneed to do to maintain the most proficient military in the world.\n  I have been a critic of our spending habits, thinking we have cut our \ndefense too much. To the American people, let me say we need not \nunderestimate the strength and capability of today's military. Ours is \nclearly the greatest military in the history of the world. We are much \nmore technologically oriented and as a result, we need personnel who \nserve longer, who have trained with the newest equipment, who \nconstantly train with our best aircraft, weapons, night vision \nequipment, and communication systems--all the things that allow them to \nplace the maximum possible threat and force on the enemy, while \nprotecting the lives of our own soldiers\n\n[[Page S10866]]\n\nand innocent civilians as much as possible. We have done a tremendous \njob. They are exceptional military men and women. There is no Army, \nNavy, Air Force, or Marine unit in the world that can compete with \nours. They are the best there is, perhaps the best that have ever been. \nWe should be very proud of them.\n  It allows the President, in times like this, to talk plainly to the \nUnited Nations and talk firmly to the Taliban in Afghanistan. It allows \nthe President to speak directly to Saddam Hussein, and Saddam Hussein \nknows and the Nations around the world know his are not idle threats. \nWe have the capability to carry out any commitments we make in terms of \nmilitary force. I am pleased with where we are. We are making great \nprogress.\n  I mentioned a few things that are important in this budget. Progress \nwas made on concurrent receipt. In over 100 years we have not had \nadditional benefits, other than tax advantages, for disabled veterans. \nThis bill takes a big step forward with the ``Purple Heart Plus'' \ncompromise and will be the first step we have made in that direction. I \nam pleased with this first step.\n  This will be the fourth year in a row we have had a significant pay \nraise, a 4.1 percent across-the-board hike and higher for other pay \ngrades. I am pleased with that.\n  We have $10.4 billion for new military construction for facilities \nand housing for our personnel, many of which are below standard. \nFrankly, we can do a better job, in my view, of providing quality \nhousing. I visited military houses and found out what they cost. They \nspend almost as much on them as private housing in the suburbs in \nAlabama and other places that seem to cost less or no more. We need to \nimprove the quality of our construction as we go forward in the future.\n  We added $900 million to the Navy shipbuilding accounts. I was the \nranking Republican on the Ship Seapower Subcommittee, serving with \nSenator Ted Kennedy, the Chairman. We were pleased in the end that our \nNavy did not take hits. At one point, it looked like that might occur. \nWe are pleased that the shipbuilding account finally came in with a \nhealthy number. This allows us to move forward for such things as \nrefueling and nuclear submarine, refueling and developing nuclear \nsubmarines, providing additional advanced procurement for the CVN next \ngeneration of aircraft carrier, providing additional payments for prior \nincurred shipbuilding costs that we had obligated for the DDG-51 class \ndestroyer, and LPD-17 class amphibious ships. We made some real \nprogress there. We need to continue this transformation.\n\n  At one point or another, we may disagree with Secretary Rumsfeld's \nviews regarding one weapons systems or another weapons system. But I \nthink few of us can honestly disagree and ought to do nothing other \nthan support his firm and clear determination--supported by the \nPresident of the United States--to transform our military to move us \nfrom a cold war configuration to a configuration that helped us meet \nthe challenges we had in 1991 with Iraq, as we have had in Kosovo, as \nwe have had in Afghanistan, and as we might have in the future in Iraq. \nWe need to transform our military forces to do that.\n  We sometimes accuse the military of being stubborn, and slow to \nchange. I would say that is true of our institution, the Congress. It \nis also true of the military. But our military is the most \ntransformable, the most committed to change, and the most committed to \nthe introduction of new technology of any military in the history of \nthe world.\n  I am, all in all, very pleased with the leadership in our military \ntoday and their commitment to bring on board as soon as possible new \nways of conducting warfare that protect our people, that put threat on \nthe enemy, and that protect innocent civilians. I think we are doing \nwell. I am very pleased with that.\n  The President has made clear that this Nation--the strongest military \npower in the world--is the single power capable of protecting its own \nforces and that of its allies in the most difficult areas of the world. \nHow much more difficult could you find it to protect American forces \nthan in Afghanistan? He is committed to doing that.\n  Sometimes we may wish it were not so. But my own personal view is \nthat there will be continual challenges around the world and that the \nwise and proper surgical application of military power can save lives, \npromote peace, and promote economic prosperity around the world. \nIndeed, this Nation has the opportunity to help lead the world out of \nwhat could be a disintegrating chaos of independent states--many of \nthem rogue nations--and into a more stable environment, and promote \npeace and prosperity for everybody in the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will conclude by saying this budget \nmoves us in that direction.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Alabama have whatever time he may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will take a couple more minutes. I thank Chairman \nLevin for his courtesy as always.\n  But we are at a point where this Nation will have the need from time \nto time to utilize force around the world to protect our just and \nlegitimate national interests. We don't need to do that recklessly, or \narrogantly, or without careful thought. But at times we will be able to \nhelp defend our just national interests and at the same time promote \npeace and prosperity in the world. That is a high calling. I think it \nis falling to us at this time in history.\n  I am pleased that we are not only strengthening our defense budget, \nbut that we are strengthening it intelligently. We are strengthening it \nwith technology. We are training our personnel. We are keeping our good \nmen and women longer, so they can become even more proficient in \noperating our ships, our command centers, our missiles, and so forth.\n  I am also pleased that we did maintain the President's request for \nfunding for national missile defense. That is a key ingredient in our \nNation's defense in the decades to come. We made that commitment in \nthis bill also. I feel good about it.\n  Again, I would like to thank Senator Levin for his leadership, the \nstaff for their work, and Senator Warner for his leadership and \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my friend from \nAlabama for his very fine presentation as well as for his kind words \nabout me. I enjoy working on the committee with the Senator from \nAlabama. He has always been willing to listen and try to work out \nissues. There are all kinds of issues that come up--thank God, rarely \non a partisan basis--complicated issues that have to be worked out. He \nhas worked not only on the Seapower Subcommittee but on the full \ncommittee to address those issues. I am grateful for that \nparticipation.\n  Senator Thurmond was on the floor a few minutes ago. It reminded me \nthat this will be, of course, his last term. No Senator serving today \ncan appreciate what this body will be like when Strom Thurmond leaves \nthis year. He has served longer in this body than any other Senator in \nhistory. His 48 years in the Senate span the terms of 10 Presidents of \nthe United States. He keeps pictures of all 10 of those Presidents on \nhis wall in the office.\n  When I joined the Armed Services Committee in 1979, Senator Thurmond \nby then was on the committee already 20 years.\n  His love for and dedication to the U.S. military goes back even \nfurther, though, to his commission as an Army Reserve second lieutenant \nof infantry in 1924 at the age of 21. He served with distinction in \nboth the European and Pacific Theaters in the Second World War, \nreceiving numerous decorations that include the Legion of Merit, the \nBronze Star medal with ``V'' device, the Army Commendation Medal, the \nBelgian Order of the Crown, and the French Croix de Guerre. He landed \nin a glider on Normandy with the 82nd Airborne Division on D-Day and \nwent on to win 5 battle stars. In 1959--the year that he joined the \nSenate Armed Services Committee--Senator Thurmond was promoted to major \ngeneral in the U.S. Army Reserve.\n  During Senator Thurmond's tenure on the Armed Services Committee, our\n\n[[Page S10867]]\n\nArmed Forces have faced challenge after challenge in Western Europe, \nVietnam, the Middle East, the Caribbean basin, the Persian Gulf, the \nBalkans, and Afghanistan. Through it all, Senator Thurmond has \npersevered in his unwavering support for our men and women in uniform. \nHis steadfast commitment to our national defense has been a rock upon \nwhich they could all rely and has helped ensure that our military has \nalways been ready to answer the call whenever and wherever needed.\n  Senator Thurmond served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee in the 104th and 105th Congresses. I had the honor and \npleasure to serve as his ranking member in 1997 and 1998. I know from \npersonal experience how seriously Senator Thurmond treated his duties \nas chairman and how hard he worked to be fair and even-handed with \nevery member of the committee. I am sure that I speak for all of our \ncolleagues in saying just how much we appreciate not only the \ncommitment that Senator Thurmond brought to his duties as chairman, but \nalso his lifelong dedication to the defense of our Nation and to the \nwelfare of the men and women in uniform.\n  He came to the floor a few minutes ago just to check things out--\nbasically to satisfy himself that this Defense authorization bill was \nmoving along. So he made the effort to come to the floor just to see \nfor himself that things were OK.\n  I left the floor momentarily to just go out and thank him for coming \nover and to wish him well on behalf of the entire committee and the \nSenate, as we will not be seeing too much more of him because he is \ngoing to be moving on hopefully to other adventures.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I was going \nto add that Senator Thurmond, at the age of 99 and soon to be 100, was \nat the Republican Conference luncheon today. And here it is, a quarter \nto 6, and he just left the floor a few minutes ago. He has been fully \nengaged all day today. He is a true American.\n  I remember my first foreign trip with him to China. They respect age \nin China. So we were well respected. We went out to a Chinese Army \nmilitary base. They asked him to review the troops. I was standing \nthere--this Senator from rural Alabama--watching the famous Strom \nThurmond troop in front of a group of Chinese Communist troops. \nAfterwards, I told him, ``I never thought I would ever see that, \nStrom.'' I never thought I would have been there.\n  He is a remarkable man, a thorough expert in military affairs, and an \nabsolute patriot. I thank Senator Levin for recognizing his service to \nour country.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I could yield myself 5 additional \nminutes--if I am not taking the time of colleagues who are waiting to \nspeak--to ask unanimous consent to add a word or two.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Michigan will \nyield, I was hoping the chairman planned for further discussion because \nI would like a few moments myself to speak in favor of the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Why don't I finish with a comment about Senator Thurmond \nand then yield to the Senator from Connecticut. We are going to be here \nanyway.\n  I have one other comment about Senator Thurmond, and then I will \nyield the floor.\n  My first trip with Senator Thurmond wasn't to a foreign country. It \nwas to California. I will leave it at that.\n  (Laughter.) But he was only, I guess, 75 years old because it would \nhave been 24 years ago.\n\n  I remember we were staying at a military base. We were studying a \nnumber of issues. I had just joined the Armed Services Committee. And I \nheard somebody, at about 5:30 or 6 in the morning, below my window \nrunning. I was trying to figure out who was up at 5:30 in the morning \nrunning. I knew it was a military base, but still 5:30 is a little \nearly. That was Strom Thurmond running.\n  He was and is someone who really has put a lot of emphasis not just \non his own health but on the health of his colleagues. How many times \ndid he lean over to me, in the Armed Services Committee, and ask, are \nyou watching your diet or are you getting exercise?\n  Here is a man who is really concerned that his colleagues would take \ncare of themselves. I don't think any of us did the exercising he did \nand watched our diet quite the way he does, but, at any rate, he will \nbe missed for all kinds of reasons.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is ready to speak. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and my friend and colleague from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to support the Defense authorization bill \nand to thank the chairman of our committee, Senator Levin, for his \nleadership in this effort, obviously supported, in a very strong \npartnership, by Senator Warner, the ranking member, and other members \nof the committee of both parties.\n  It is particularly important we pass this bill now, not only because \nour forces are preparing for the possibility of combat to remove the \nthreat Saddam Hussein represents, but also because this proposal has \nimportant provisions that will lead to transforming our military to \nensure it is even more capable of protecting the American people in the \nuncertain and dangerous future ahead of us.\n  I do want to give credit to Senator Levin, who really has earned the \ngratitude of every American for his dedication and commitment not only \nto our national security in general but to the men and women in our \nArmed Forces. He has certainly ably explained the important provisions \nin this bill.\n  Obviously, there will soon be a transition in the leadership of the \ncommittee. Senator Warner, I presume, will return as chairman. The fact \nthese two colleagues have worked so well and so productively across \nparty lines should give us all a sense of encouragement and hope about \nthe work of this committee in the future.\n  I have been particularly proud to have been able to have worked on \nsome provisions I believe will improve the readiness of our military in \nthe years to come, and that will help our military become a more \nimportant part of the national homeland security team.\n\n  It has been a great honor to serve on the Armed Services Committee \nand to have worked with Senator Levin and Senator Warner in the actions \nthey have taken, particularly to improve the compensation and quality \nof life of our military.\n  I have also had the privilege, for the last year and a half--and I \nshould say thanks to the occupant of the chair--to have served as the \nchair of the Airland Subcommittee, working very closely with Senator \nSantorum of Pennsylvania as my ranking member. We have now spent two \nsessions of Congress, as chair and ranking member, alternating our \nroles. I am particularly proud of the work our subcommittee has done \nwith the full committee in providing additional resources to accelerate \nthe Army's future force and to fully resource the combat aircraft that \nwill serve as the backbone of our air forces and ensure our continued \ndominance of the air far into the future.\n  It has also been good to work with Senator Santorum and others on \nprovisions that will permit more timely transition of promising leap-\nahead technologies from research to full utilization, and to require \nthe Department of Defense to fully assess its role in homeland \nsecurity, each of which are parts of the Defense authorization \nlegislation that is now before the Senate.\n  I worked with fellow members of both parties on the committee on a \ncontroversial matter that has reached resolution. It is a resolution \nthat is unsatisfactory, but I know we have to move ahead with it; that \nis, the efforts to redress this longstanding inequity of a double \nstandard that has allowed all Government retirees except our military \nretirees to receive both their full retirement pay and the disability \ncompensation they are entitled to. Our original provision would have \nallowed all military retirees to draw both full-retired pay and any \ndisability compensation they are entitled to.\n  To me, this is an issue of fundamental fairness. As Senator Levin has \nexplained, we were forced by administration opposition to scale back \nthe provision with regard to military retirees.\n  The compromise now in this conference report greatly reduces the \nnumber of retirees who will be able to draw both benefits I have \ndescribed and\n\n[[Page S10868]]\n\nthat they are entitled to. It does authorize an enhanced special \ncompensation only for military retirees with 20 or more years of \nservice who incurred a qualifying combat-related disability. That means \nany rate of disability attributable to an injury for which the retiree \nwas awarded the Purple Heart, or a service-connected disability rated \nat 60 percent or higher incurred as a direct result of armed conflict, \nwhile engaged in hazardous service, in the performance of duty under \nconditions simulating war, or through an instrumentality of war.\n  This, unfortunately, does not cover all the retirees who should be \neligible. It greatly reduces the number who will be covered. It is a \nstep forward, and a significant step forward, for those who will \nbenefit, but I hope--and I would guess that members of both parties on \nthe Armed Services Committee join in the hope--in the years ahead, \nbeginning next year, we continue to extend the number of retirees who \nare entitled to receive both retirement pay and disability compensation \nbut do not, and to reach the point where all of them, in fact, receive \nit. That seems to be our moral responsibility in this case, and we are \nnot yet fully meeting it.\n  Bottom line, this is a critically important, otherwise not just \nadequate but adequate to the special needs of the moment, authorization \nbill. We are, after all, a nation at war. We forget that sometimes \nbecause our enemy does not have the normal attributes of enemies in \nwar. They are not able to be seen on a battlefield massing their \ntroops. They are not in ships at sea that we can observe. They \ncertainly are not in the conventional military aircraft. But they are \nout there. They are plotting. They are planning. They are arming in \nconventional and unconventional ways to do us damage.\n  This authorization bill will continue to provide the men and women \nwho serve us in uniform, and those civilians who support them, the \nresources they need to keep us not only defended but the mightiest \nNation in the history of the world.\n  I thank Senator Levin, Senator Warner, and all the members of the \ncommittee for the work they have done on this legislation. I look \nforward to supporting this conference report.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                            customs service\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to engage in a colloquy with Senator \nBaucus on provisions in the homeland security bill pertaining to \ncommercial operations of the Customs Service.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is a very important topic. As my good friend will \nrecall, the Finance Committee held a hearing on this issue last July, \nwhich we followed up with a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Committee on Governmental Affairs. We stressed the importance of \npreserving the revenue collection and trade facilitation functions of \nthe U.S. Customs Service, even as that agency moves into a Department \nwith a national security focus. I would be pleased to engage in a \ncolloquy on this topic with the Senator form Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate the Senator's recalling our hearing of \nlast July. I would note that following the hearing and our letter to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs, we worked closely with that \nCommittee and with the Administration to develop text that would keep \nintact the commercial functions of the Customs Service. That text has \nevolved. I note that the bill now before the Senate provides, as a \ngeneral matter, for the transfer of Customs Service functions and \npersonnel to the new Department of Homeland Security. Notwithstanding \nthat, authorities vested in the Secretary of the Treasury relating to \ncustoms revenue functions are to remain with the Secretary of the \nTreasury unless delegated to the Secretary of Homeland Security. My \nunderstanding is that this exclusion from transfer pertains to \nauthorities now exercised by the Secretary of the Treasury to issue \nrevenue regulations developed by the Customs Service, and authority to \nprovide oversight and supervision of the Customs Service in this area, \nespecially with regard to policy matters.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I share the Senator's understanding on this point.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I note that, technically, the bill allows even revenue-\nrelated authorities to be delegated. However, it is my understanding \nthat a wholesale--or even a large-scale--delegation of such authorities \nis not contemplated by this legislation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with the Senator from Iowa. This bill should not \nbe read as permission for the Secretary of the Treasury to undertake a \nwholesale or large-scale transfer of revenue-related authorities to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. That would be an abdication of the \nresponsibility that this bill assigns to the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Montana. I also would note \nthat the issue of Customs' revenue functions is dealt with differently \nin this bill than in the draft bill originally sent to Congress by the \nAdministration. In the Administration's draft bill, all Customs \nfunctions would have been transferred to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity without any further action by any government official. That \nis, no Customs-related authorities would have been retained by the \nSecretary of the Treasury. Would the Senator from Montana agree that \nthis contrast further supports the point that the bill now before the \nSenate is not intended to give the Secretary of the Treasury blanket \npermission to engage in a wholesale or large-scale transfer of revenue-\nrelated authorities to the Secretary of Homeland Security?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I fully agree with the Senator's observation. The \nCongress has taken a different approach from the one originally \nproposed by the Administration. Under the approach in this bill, \nsignificant revenue-related authorities remain at the Treasury \nDepartment. It would not make sense to take this different approach if \nthe result would be a wholesale delegation of these authorities after \nenactment. Accordingly, the bill should be interpreted as establishing \na presumption that those authorities should not be delegated in the \nabsence of a compelling reason for their delegation. Moreover, while \ndelegations in this area are indeed allowable under the legislation, it \nis fair to conclude that they will be scrutinized closely by those of \nus responsible for these provisions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate this colloquy, and I thank the Senator for \nengaging in this colloquy on a very important topic.\n\n\n                       migratory bird treaty act\n\n  Mr. JEFFORD. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague \nChairman Levin of the Armed Services Committee, in a colloquy on a \nprovision relating to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.\n  The Migratory Bird Treaty Act is one of our nation's oldest wildlife \nprotection laws. Before this law was passed in 1918, many migratory \nbirds were on the brink of extinction. However through international \ncoordination and domestic conservation programs, the MBTA has succeeded \nin restoring many species of migratory birds. This law is within the \njurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee which I \nchair.\n  As the Chairman is aware, the conference report before us today \ncontains an exemption for the Department of Defense from incidental \ntakings of Migratory Birds related to military readiness activities. I \nthink it is unfortunate that this provision was included, however, I \nknow Chairman Levin worked tirelessly on this and many other difficult \ntissues in conference, and I thank him for his efforts.\n  While I am concerned that these provisions were never subjected to \nscrutiny in the committee of jurisdiction, I have yet to agree that \nthese provisions, or any other provisions affording special treatment \nto the Department of Defense, are necessary. For years our military has \nefficiently and effectively trained for conflict in full compliance \nwith environmental laws. Our defense agencies have taken pride in their \nstewardship of the environment. I applaud Chairman Levin for rightly \ninsisting that these provisions not be included in the Senate DoD \nAuthorization bill.\n  I would like to confirm my understanding of these provisions with \nChairman Levin who was a principal negotiator of this legislation. \nFirst, it is clear in Subsection (d) that the authority of the \nSecretary of the Interior to prescribe regulations for the incidental \ntaking of migratory birds during military readiness activities is \nlimited to the Secretary's authority under section 3(a) of the \nMigratory Bird Treaty Act.\n\n[[Page S10869]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct. This authority must be consistent with \nthe authority in section 3(a) of the Act, and in no way changes our \nobligations under the Migratory Bird Treaties.\n  Mr. JEFFORD. I would also like to point out that the Department of \nInterior has a mandatory obligation to promulgate regulations to permit \nthe incidental taking of migratory birds by DOD within one year of the \nenactment of this Act. Subsection (d) of the provision clearly provides \nthat ``not later than the expiration of the one-year period beginning \non the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Interior \nshall exercise the authority . . . to prescribe regulations to exempt \nthe Armed Forces for the incidental taking of migratory birds during \nmilitary readiness activities.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes, it is quite clear that the Department of Interior has \na statutory obligation to promulgate regulations within one year.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Also, according to subsection (b), in the one-year time \nperiod between the enactment of this Act and the promulgation of \nregulations by the Department of Interior, the Secretary of Defense \nmust, ``identify measures to minimize and mitigate . . . any adverse \nimpacts of authorized military readiness activities on affected species \nof migratory birds.'' Is it the Chairman's understanding that DOD has a \nmandatory obligation to implement these measures?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct, the Secretary of Defense must not only \ntake measures to minimize and mitigate adverse impacts on migratory \nbirds, they must also ensure that such measures are implemented.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Finally, according to subsection (b), in the time \nperiod in which the regulations promulgated pursuant to subsection (d) \nare in effect, the Secretary of Defense must, ``identify measures to \nminimize and mitigate . . . any adverse impacts of authorized military \nreadiness activities on affected species of migratory birds'' and \n``monitor the impacts of such military readiness activities on affected \nspecies of migratory birds.'' Is it the Chairman's understanding that \nthese minimization and monitoring measures must be addressed in the \nregulations promulgated pursuant to subsection (d), to ensure that \nthose regulations are consistent with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct, the regulations must prescribe measures \nto minimize, mitigate and monitor impacts of military training \nactivities on migratory birds, so that the regulations are consistent \nwith section 3(a) of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The two key changes \nmade by the conferees to the House provisions: (1) require the \nDepartment of the Interior to exercise its regulatory authority over \nDOD activities impacting migratory birds and (2) require appropriate \nactions to mitigate the impact of DOD actions on migratory birds. The \nSenate conferees agreed to accept the provision only because of these \nchanges.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 4546, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003. Overall, the \nHouse and Senate Armed Services Committee Conferees have produced a \nbill which is deserving of approval and is generally supportive of the \nbrave servicemen and women in our armed forces, in terms of training, \npay, family quality-of-life benefits, and providing modern equipment \nand weapon systems.\n  Building upon evaluations and recommendations regarding growing \nreadiness and modernization problems throughout the services, the \nConference Committee has done an admirable job of addressing some of \nthe more pressing issues contributing to the multiple problems that \nhave been brought to Congress' attention over the past several years.\n  Unfortunately, there are areas that the Conference Committee did not \nadequately address. First and foremost is Concurrent Receipt. It was \ntremendously important to me that the Senate version of the defense \nauthorization bill and report would authorize, at a minimum, payment of \nretired pay and disability pay for all military retirees with \ndisabilities, a practice known as Concurrent Receipt. For the past \neleven years, I have offered legislation on this issue. This matter is \nof great significance to many of our country's military retirees, \nbecause it would reverse existing, unfair regulations that strip \nretirement pay from military retirees who are also disabled, and costs \nthem any realistic opportunity for post-service earnings.\n  While I commend the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Armed Service \nCommittees for going further in addressing a longstanding inequity in \nthe compensation of military retirees' pay, this bill does not go far \nenough and falls far short of the much broader provision that was \nincluded in the Senate, or even the House. However, it was important \nthat a compromise was reached with regards to Concurrent Receipt. The \ndefense authorization bill provides many critical quality-of-life and \npay benefits for our servicemen and women. Foregoing a defense \nauthorization bill because full Concurrent Receipt was not included \nwould be wrong because I believe we would be hurting an even greater \nnumber of servicemembers who are currently serving, reservists who have \nbeen mobilized in support of Operations Noble Eagle and Enduring \nFreedom, and their families who endure long periods without a spouse or \nparent during periods of training or deployment. More must be done on \nConcurrent Receipt. More will be done.\n  The compromise legislation, in effect, de facto Concurrent Receipt \nwould increase payments under legislation I previously introduced in \n1999, Special Compensation for Severely Disabled Military Retirees, in \nan amount equaling the monthly disability compensation prescribed by \nthe VA for disabling conditions of that percentage.\n  Eligible recipients would include those military retirees with 20-\nyears military service who have a disability, 10 to 100 percent, that \nis a result of an injury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart; or have a 60 percent or more combat-related disability to \ninclude disabling conditions incurred as a result of armed conflict, \nincluding, PTSD, Agent Orange, and Persian Gulf War disease; while \nengaged in hazardous service such as atomic veterans; under conditions \nsimulating war such as military training; or caused by an \ninstrumentality of war like accidents involving military equipment.\n  Again, while this legislative compromise will provide critical help \nto an additional 35,000 disabled military retirees, it is not good \nenough to only correct this injustice for a select few no matter how \ndeserving.\n  We must do more to restore retirement pay for those military retirees \nwho are disabled. I have stated this before, and I am compelled to \nreiterate now; retirement pay and disability pay are distinct types of \npay. Retirement pay is for service rendered through 20 years of \nmilitary service. Disability pay is for physical or mental pain or \nsuffering that occurs during and as a result of military service. In \nthis case, members with decades of military service receive the same \ncompensation as similarly disabled members who served only a few years. \nThis practice fails to recognize their extended, more demanding careers \nof service to our country.\n  This is patently unfair, and I will continue to work diligently to \ncorrect this inequity for all career military servicemembers who are \ndisabled.\n  Fully enacting concurrent receipt, for all who deserve it, is the \nnext step to ensuring that we recognize the military service of those \nmilitary retirees who by no fault of their own become disabled during \ntheir career military service.\n  Another disappointing action was the removal of language I sponsored, \nmodifying the calculation of back pay for persons who were approved for \npromotion as members of the Navy and Marine Corps while interned as \nprisoners of war during World War II. Last year's Defense authorization \nbill authorized back pay to World War II veterans who were not promoted \non time due to the arcane Navy Department rules of the early 1900s. \nUnfortunately, when the law was changed, an adjustment for inflation \nwas not taken into account. While these men received the back pay they \ndeserved, it was not adjusted for inflation. A simple fix to this \nproblem would be to take into account changes in the Consumer Price \nIndex. Though included in the original version of this year's Defense \nAuthorization Act, the language was removed from the final version of \nthe legislation.\n\n[[Page S10870]]\n\n  I also am disappointed that the Conferees dropped the Senate Armed \nServices Committee's recommendation submitted by the Administration to \nwaive certain buy America restrictions. The Senate authorized the \nSecretary of Defense to waive domestic source or content requirements \nfor close defense allies that provide reciprocal treatment for our \ndefense products. ``Buy America'' restrictions divert necessary funds \nto ensure our military is properly equipped. An additional $5 billion \ncan be saved per year by eliminating ``Buy America'' restrictions that \nare protected by the Berry amendment that only undermine U.S. \ncompetitiveness overseas. Every dollar we spend on archaic procurement \npolicies, such as ``Buy America,'' is a dollar we cannot spend on \ntraining our troops, keeping personnel quality of life at an \nappropriate level, paying full concurrent receipt, maintaining force \nstructure, replacing old weapons systems, and advancing our military \ntechnology.\n  Although I have shown that there are numerous examples of why this \nbill is far from perfect, I am putting my reservations aside to support \nthe final passage of the Fiscal Year 2003 National Defense \nAuthorization Act Conference Report. I feel that taken as a whole this \nlegislation represents a step forward for our Nation's military.\n  The bill contains a package of benefits for servicemembers and their \nfamilies that would go a long way toward addressing the readiness \nproblems facing all the services. It includes a 4.1 percent across-the-\nboard pay raise for all active and reserve servicemembers, with an \nadditional targeted pay raise ranging from 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent \nfor sergeants, petty officers and chiefs.\n  Military pay, by almost all accounts, has fallen considerably behind \ncivilian pay. Arguments can be made as to the precise pay differential, \nand at which pay grades and mission areas the gap is greatest, but \nthere is no credible argument as to whether or not we need to address \nthe issue of compensation.\n  Additionally, the Committee approved a provision that would authorize \na new assignment incentive pay of up to $1,500 per month to encourage \nservicemembers to serve in difficult-to-fill assignments, like Korea or \nthe Persian Gulf region.\n  The Committee approved a significant legislative provision directing \nthe Secretary of Defense to review personnel compensation laws and \npolicies, including the Reserve retirement system, to determine how \nwell they address the needs of Guard and Reserve servicemembers. This \nprovision is particularly noteworthy since the Secretary of Defense \nrecalled nearly 95,000 Reserve Component servicemembers for Operations \nEnduring Freedom and Noble Eagle. Oftentimes the collective memory of \nour active duty, including active duty reserve servicemembers, is short \nand a comprehensive examination of reserve force policies, if done \nright, will help address waning retention of reservists and continued \nsupport by employers of reservists.\n  I forcefully endorse the Conference Committee's inclusion of an \namendment that will direct the Secretary of the Air Force to obtain \nspecific authorization and appropriation to lease 100 Boeing 767 tanker \naircraft that was previously approved by the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act of Fiscal Year 2002.\n  Many Senate Armed Services Committee Members expressed concern that \nthe payment of leasing of major weapon systems, aircraft, vessels, and \ncombat vehicles, should not come from critical funds providing for \nreadiness spending, such as training, spare parts, flying hours, and \nmaintenance of weapons systems and barracks. There appeared to be a \nsense of agreement that any lease for major weapon systems should \ninstead be funded from the procurement accounts.\n  During posture hearings, the Service Secretaries and Chiefs confirmed \nthat readiness unfunded requirements still exist and submitted lists to \nmeet their readiness requirements. Robbing ``Peter to pay Paul'' so \nthat Air Force Secretary Jim Roche can modernize the tanker fleet is \nquestionable at best and several reports by the GAO, OMB and CBO bear \nthis out. I will not take the time of this body today to again \narticulate the reasons why Secretary Roche's and the Appropriations' \nCommittee Boeing 767 leasing scheme is a rip-off of the taxpayers as I \nhave stated on the floor of the Senate in the past. However, servicemen \nand women will someday look at this lease of aerial tankers and wonder \nhow Congress was duped into agreeing to a provision that was so costly \nand in the end irresponsible.\n  I fully support the Conference Committee's inclusion of the \n``National Call to Service Act,'' which provides for strong incentives \nto encourage young Americans to enlist in the Armed Services.\n  The Committee adopted provision is the military component of the \n``Call to Service Act,'' introduced by Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN) and \nmyself, which also expands civilian service opportunities in AmeriCorps \nand SeniorCorps and in other service organizations.\n  This is a very significant boost to a bill that will give Americans \nconcrete opportunities to serve in causes greater than self interest. \nBy encouraging more military enlistments, this legislation could \ngreatly assist our war against terror.\n  Under the ``National Call to Service Act,'' individuals who volunteer \nto serve under this new program would be required to serve on active \nduty for 15 months in the Armed Services after completion of initial \nentry training and could complete the remainder of their military \nservice obligation by choosing service on active duty, in the Selected \nReserve or in the Individual Ready Reserve. The reserve obligation \ncould also be fulfilled by serving in a civilian national service \nprogram such as the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps.\n  In return for service, the legislation provides the choice of \nincentives including a $5,000 bonus, repayment of a student loan up to \n$18,000, an educational allowance under the Montgomery GI Bill.\n  At this time of national challenge, Americans are yearning for \nopportunities to serve. I hope Congress will expeditiously take action \non this entire legislation to create more options in both the areas of \nmilitary and civilian service.\n  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my belief in the importance \nof enacting meaningful improvements for active duty and Reserve service \nmembers. They risk their lives in Afghanistan and elsewhere to defend \nour shores and preserve democracy, and we cannot thank them enough for \ntheir service. But, we can and should pay them more, improve the \nbenefits for their families, and support the Reserve Components in a \nmanner similar to the active forces. Our service members past, present, \nand future need these improvements. We also cannot continue with this \n``business as usual'' mindset. We must reform the Department of Defense \nand not fall prey to the special interest groups that attempt to warp \nour perspective and misdirect our spending. We owe so much more to our \nmen and women in uniform who defend our country. They are our greatest \nresource, and I believe they are woefully underrepresented. We must \ncontinue to do better.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Fiscal Year 2003 Defense authorization \nbill was in conference for nearly 16 weeks. This bill, which creates \nthe policies and programs that will guide the Department of Defense \nduring this fiscal year, is the counterpart to the defense \nappropriations bill, which was passed by Congress and signed into law \nlast month. After the President challenged Congress to make the defense \nbudget a priority, why did it take so long for Congress to complete \naction on the defense authorization bill?\n  This bill has wide support in the Senate, having originally been \npassed on June 27, 2002, by a vote of 97 to 2. So the bill is not so \ndivisive that controversy among Members of the Senate could have \ndelayed its completion.\n  The chairman and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Levin and Senator Warner, worked diligently during this \nextended period of time to be able to produce a defense authorization \nbill for this year. They cannot be blamed for it taking so long to \ncompleting conference on the bill.\n  The true reason for the delay was the myopic veto threats that \nemanated from the White House over provisions in the Senate- and House-\npassed bills that would have expanded benefits to disabled veterans. \nThe reason the White House opposed these benefits is clear: the \nPresident's advisors were\n\n[[Page S10871]]\n\nonly looking at the bottom line. It just does not make sense that we \ncan pass a defense budget that will spend a billion dollars a day \nduring the next 12 months, and we can spend more than a billion dollars \na month on military operations in Afghanistan, but when it comes to \nproviding benefits to disabled veterans, suddenly we do not have the \nmoney.\n  The veterans' benefit that was proposed in the Senate version of the \nDefense authorization bill would allow an individual with a disability \nwho retired from the military after 20 years of service to receive the \nfull amount of his military retirement pay and his veterans' disability \npay, without reduction from either. Under current law, these two \npayments are offset, in effect forcing these individuals to pay for \ntheir own disability checks.\n  The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, has authored a bill to correct \nthis situation. I am one of 82 cosponsors of that bill. The House \nversion of this bill has 403 cosponsors. These bills are of the highest \npriority to a great number of veterans' groups and of great importance \nto thousands of disabled veterans around the country. Despite such \nbroad support, the White House veto threats torpedoed the full \nexpansion of these benefits in the Defense authorization bill.\n  The conference report to the Fiscal Year 2003 Defense authorization \nbill that we will soon vote on contains a limited expansion of benefits \nto some veterans, depending on their level of disability and how their \ninjuries were inflicted. It is well short of what veterans deserve.\n  I will vote in favor of the conference report, however, because the \nbill makes improvements to a number of other programs that are \nimportant to the men and women who serve our country in uniform. The \nDefense authorization bill provides for an across the board pay \nincrease, creates new bonus payments for hardship assignments, and \nreduces housing costs for military families. The bill also authorizes \n$10.4 billion for military construction, which includes funding to \nreplace dilapidated housing at military bases throughout the United \nStates. This bill will help to improve the quality of life of those who \nnow serve in the military.\n  Although this bill does not make enough progress in getting veterans \nthe benefits that they have earned, the passage of this Defense \nauthorization bill will not be an end to that issue. There is strong \nsupport in Congress to allow disabled veterans to receive the full \namount of their military retired pay and their disability compensation, \nand I am certain that this issue will be raised again.\n  In the meantime, I urge the thousands of veterans who contacted me in \nsupport of expanding these benefits to let the President know how \nimportant this issue is to you. No veteran should doubt who is \nresponsible for killing this proposal. Veterans and their families \nshould hold the President accountable for his stand against benefits \nfor disabled veterans.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment that the Murray/Snowe amendment was dropped, once again, \nin conference.\n  The Murray/Snowe amendment would guarantee that women serving in our \nmilitary overseas have access to safe, affordable and legal abortions. \nThis amendment passed the Senate on a 52 to 40 vote. A similar \namendment also passed in 1996 and was dropped in conference. Once \nagain, reproductive health care needs of women were abandoned behind \nclosed doors.\n  The DOD authorization bill before us today will ensure that our men \nand women in the armed forces have the equipment and resources they \nneed to protect us. Every day our service men and women work overtime, \noften in hostile, dangerous environments to protect our citizens and to \nsecure the freedoms and values we cherish. They deserve our full \nsupport.\n  Suprisingly, as the women of our military, fight for our freedoms \noverseas, they are actually denied some of these freedoms during their \nservice. Here at home, women have the right to chose. They have \nconstitutionally-protected access to safe and legal reproductive health \nservices. But, this is not the case for women serving overseas. The \nMurray/Snowe amendment would have ensured that women serving in the \nmilitary are not forced to check their rights at the U.S. border.\n  Under current restrictions, women who have volunteered to serve their \ncountry are not allowed to exercise their legally guaranteed right to \nmake their own reproductive health decisions simply because they are \nserving overseas.\n  These women are committed to protecting our rights as free citizens, \nyet they are denied one of the most basic rights afforded women in this \ncountry. Our amendment would not, and let me stress does not require \nany direct federal funding of abortion related services. The amendment \nwould have required women to pay for any direct costs associated with \nan abortion in a military facility. The Murray/Snowe amendment does \nnot, and again let me stress does not, compel a medical provider to \nperform abortions. All branches of the military allow medical personnel \nwho have religious or ethical objections to abortion not to \nparticipate. Finally, this amendment would not have changed or altered \nconscience clauses for military medical personnel. This is an important \nand critical women's health issue. Women should be able to depend on \ntheir base hospital and military health care providers to meet all of \ntheir health care needs, including reproductive health. To single out \nabortion-related services could jeopardize a woman's health.\n  Opponents of this amendment have argued that the military does ensure \naccess for women. Under current practices, a woman who requires \nabortion related services can seek the approval of her commanding \nofficer for transport back to the U.S. as unscheduled leave: not \nmedical leave, but unscheduled leave.\n  In addition to the serious risk posed by delaying an abortion, this \npolicy compromises a woman's privacy rights by forcing her to release \nher medical condition and needs to her superiors. This policy also \nforces women to seek abortions outside of the military establishment in \nforeign countries. Many women have little or no understanding of the \nlaws or restrictions in the host country and may have significant \nlanguage and cultural barriers as well.\n  In this country, we take for granted the safety of our health care \nservices. When we seek care in a doctor's office or clinic, we assume \nthat all safety and health standards are adhered to. Unfortunately, \nthis is not the case in many other countries.\n  In addition, many of our military personnel serve in areas that are \nhostile to women's reproductive rights and choices. In some countries, \nwomen can be severely punished for seeking abortion-related services or \nfamily planning. This is the environment that many women face.\n  Regardless of one's view on abortion, it is simply wrong to place \nwomen at risk. This amendment would have required the women to pay the \nfull cost associated with the abortion. It would prohibit any direct \nfederal funding.\n  Ensuring that women have access to safe, legal and timely abortion \nrelated services is an important health guarantee. It is not a \npolitical statement. It is essential that women have access to a full \nrange of reproductive health care services. That's why the Murray/Snowe \namendment was endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, the Americans Medical Women's Association, Physicians \nfor Reproductive Choice and Health, Planned Parenthood of America, \nNational Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, and the \nNational Partnership for Women and Families.\n  As we send out troops into the war on terrorism to protect our safety \nand freedoms, we should ensure that female military personnel are not \nasked to sacrifice their rights and protections as well. Allowing \nextreme ideology to dictate military health care policy is simply \nwrong. Women have suffered a major set back today. Dropping the Murray/\nSnowe amendment sends the wrong message to our military servicewomen. \nIt is simply wrong to deny women their basic rights behind closed \ndoors.\n  I will not give up. I will be back again to fight for this important \nreproductive health care protection. Eventually, we will do the right \nthing and enact the Murray/Snowe amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this week our Nation honored our veterans; \nthe men and women who have served\n\n[[Page S10872]]\n\nthe United States with distinction. Although we take one day of the \nyear to recognize what veterans have done for us, it is understood that \nwe are in constant debt to those who defended our country's liberty. It \nis said that ``Freedom is not free''. There is a cost, and this cost \nhas been paid by America's veterans. They have sacrificed for our \ncountry, and increasingly for our world. Around the globe, from Asia to \nEurope to the Middle East to right here at home, the millions of men \nand women who have served in our armed forces deserve as much honor and \nrespect as we can give them.\n  Knowing this, there is not one member of this body who would not want \nour veterans to receive benefits that they have earned. Unfortunately, \nthe House and the Senate have chosen not to give full concurrent \nreceipt to our veterans, and for this reason I did not sign the \nConference Report to the Defense Authorization. While I applaud the \ninclusion of a special compensation for some categories of war \nveterans, I believe that more work needs to be done and I will continue \nto push for these benefits in the future.\n  The withholding of my signature to the Conference Report should not, \nhowever, be seen as my disapproval for the entire bill. In fact, \noverall I am very pleased with the outcome of the defense authorization \nfor this year. I believe that the work we have done will continue to \nensure that our men and women in the armed forces have access to the \ntools they need to perform their critical missions across the globe. \nAlso, we should not overlook the impact that increasing basic pay will \nhave on our military personnel, any commitment that Congress shows to \nour armed services in this regard is a positive gain for the American \npeople.\n  As I have stated on this floor many times before, it is abundantly \nclear more and more each day how important missile defense is to our \ncountry. The development of this program is central to homeland defense \nand the protection of our friends, allies and deployed forces against \nthreats that are serious and growing. The authorized levels of funding \nfor critical ballistic missile defense systems and their components is \nan outstanding accomplishment for this Congress. As the ranking member \nof the Strategic Subcommittee, ensuring full support of missile defense \nis my most important priority and it will continue to be as we begin \nwork in the 108th Congress.\n  The Defense authorization conference also provided for a number of \ndevelopmental programs critical to space-based systems and \ntechnologies. The Network, Information, and Space Security Center will \nfacilitate cooperation for protecting information and information \nsystems, which is becoming increasingly important in the face of \ncyberterrorism threats from around the world. The Center for \nGeosciences is a leading-edge environmental research center \ncontinuously improving weather forecasts for our military forces around \nthe world. TechSat 21 will demonstrate the technical and operational \nfeasibility of microsatellites, a truly transformational approach to \nspace-based systems. And finally, the GPS Jammer Detection and location \nSystem will enable our military commanders to rely on GPS and GPS-\nsupported systems such without the threat of interference or jamming by \nthe enemy.\n  One of my particular interests for several years has been the use of \ncommercial imagery to help meet the Nation's geospatial and imagery \nrequirements. I do not believe that the Department of Defense has been \naggressive enough either in crafting a strategy or in providing funding \nfor this purpose. I am gratified that we have included a substantial \nincrease for commercial imagery acquisition, and some very helpful \nwords in report language that I expect will drive the Department toward \nestablishing a sound relationship with the commercial imagery industry.\n  Closer to home, I know that my constituents in Colorado are pleased \nthat we not only fully funded the Rocky Flats Environment Technology \nSite and its cleanup activities but also added an extra $18 million for \nincluded security costs at the site. I also appreciate the support of \nthe new Department of Energy environmental cleanup reform initiative \nthat will incentivize cleanup sites to do their important work faster \nand more efficiently. The accelerated cleanup initiative will reduce \nrisk to the workers, communities and the environment, shorten the \nschedule by decades, and save tens of billions of dollars over the life \nof the cleanup.\n  Let me make it very clear that I chose not to sign the Defense \nAuthorization Conference Report because of our failure to include the \nfull Senate provision for concurrent receipt, but I strongly support \nthe bill for providing the technology and resources our military men \nand women need to protect our national security.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to address a number of \nissues in the Defense authorization bill. I am voting for this bill \nbecause it contains many provisions critical to fighting the war on \nterror and it provides pay raises for the men and women of our \nmilitary. But it fails to rectify a longstanding inequity for disabled \nmilitary retirees. It's wrong that disabled retirees are forced to pay \nfor their own disability benefits. While this bill ends the penalty for \nsome 30,000 retirees, there are more than half a million veterans out \nthere who still are forced to pay for their own disability benefits.\n  For the many good things we have in this bill, I'd like to thank \nleadership of our Chairman, Senator Levin, and Ranking Member, Senator \nWarner. Americans can be assured of their devotion to the security of \nour nation and the welfare of the men and women in uniform around the \nworld today serving in harm's way.\n  I would also like to say I am grateful for the opportunity to have \nserved on this committee for two years with the Senior Senator from \nGeorgia, Max Cleland.\n  Max Cleland has been an inspiration making countless sacrifices \nduring his lifetime of service to our Nation. I have turned to Senator \nCleland again and again over the years on the most challenging issues \nconfronting us--from the war on terror to the welfare of our service \nmembers and their families, our military retirees and our veterans.\n  Deep within the chest of Senator Max Cleland beats the heart of an \nAmerican Soldier, an American who has given much in the defense of \nfreedom; an American who has much, much more to give. I know that I \nwill call upon my friend and colleague again and again, no matter where \nhe is, when I need the clear insight and straightforward counsel of a \nsoldier.\n  This has been a very important year in American history. We have \nlearned much about the dangers that confront our Nation at home and \naround the world. We have learned much about the capability of our \nArmed Forces to confront and defeat these dangers. I am confident we \nwill win the war on terror, there can be no question among the American \npeople, or in the minds of our friends and enemies.\n  This bill goes beyond the President's request and beefs up our \narsenal with additional warships, better fighting aircraft and improved \nsecurity at our military bases.\n  This is a strong bill for our service members and their families. \nThis bill provides for important increases in pay, bonuses, special \npays, medicare care and family housing.\n  This is a major piece of legislation that lays the foundation for how \nthis Nation will prosecute the war on terror at home and abroad; how \nthis Nation will transfer its military for the dangers that may \nconfront us in the future; and, how this Nation will care for the \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, and their families, that put \nthemselves in harms way everyday.\n  I would like to highlight two provisions in this bill, for which I am \ngrateful for the support of my colleagues in the Senate and the House's \nconferees.\n  Earlier this year, the Defense Department acknowledgement that Navy \nship defense and vulnerability experimentation during the Cold War, \nknown as Shipboard Hazard and Defense or Project SHAD, used chemical \nand biological agents that exposed sailors unwittingly to potentially \nlethal toxins.\n  While the military necessity of anticipating, understanding, and \nmitigating the vulnerability of our fleet to gas attack is \nindisputable, using our sailors, intentionally or not, as human guinea \npigs is reprehensible.\n  A provision that I sponsored and included in this bill (Section 709) \ndirects\n\n[[Page S10873]]\n\nthe Department of Defense to submit to the Congress, within 90 days, a \ncomprehensive plan for the review, declassification and submission to \nthe Veterans Administration all medical records and information \nrelating to the SHAD project. Subsequent reports are required every six \nmonths allowing the Congress to evaluate the Defense Department's \nprogress in executing the plan.\n  We owe this level of effort to the sailors that may have been exposed \nto potentially toxic agents and get them the medical care to which they \nare entitled.\n  I also sponsored a provision included in this bill, Section 583, that \nrequires the Department of Defense to provide the Congress a report, \nclassified and unclassified, on their progress toward resolving the \nfate of Navy Captain Michael Scott Speicher. Captain Speicher is the \nonly American still unaccounted for from our war with Iraq nearly \ntwelve years ago. In that time, the Defense Department has painfully \nmismanaged the search for and subsequent classification of Captain \nSpeicher.\n  Section 583 of the bill requires the Defense Department to report to \nCongress not later than 90 days of enactment, and every 120 days \nthereafter, providing specific details on their efforts to resolve the \nfate of Captain Speicher. We need to give American service members the \ncertain knowledge that we are not a nation that casually or negligently \nabandons its military men and women during or after a conflict.\n  I share the hope of so many of Captain Speicher's shipments, friends \nand family that we will one day know his fate. I am proud to have \nsponsored this provision and expect that the Defense Department's \nefforts will reflect the Nation's interest in bringing peace and \ncomfort to all.\n  There is also heartbreak in what we were not able to do in this bill, \nespecially for our military retirees. This bill fails to repeal the \nprohibition on the concurrent receipt of retired pay and disability \ncompensation, as we had provided in our Senate version of the bill.\n  Instead we have a compromise acceptable to the President who is \nunwilling to pay the cost of correcting the injustice of requiring our \nmilitary retirees to pay for their own disability compensation.\n  This is an intolerable disappointment for the hundreds of thousands \nof military retirees and their families hurt by the policy. We failed \nthem again and I am deeply disappointed.\n  It has been clear to all that President Bush has worked hard against \nthe interests of our military retirees in this instance. And, with the \nhelp of the civilian leadership in the Department of Defense and the \nRepublican leadership in the House of Representatives, he's got what he \nwanted, controlling federal spending on the backs of our retired \nveterans.\n  I would have preferred that we as a Congress had done the right thing \nand passed the Senate version of the bill giving our retired military \nauthority to receive their full pay and disability compensation.\n  I would have preferred that we had passed full concurrent receipt as \neighty-two Senators and 403 members of the House have already agreed to \nsupport as cosponsors on separate legislation.\n  I would have preferred that we had passed full concurrent receipt and \nforced the President's veto. I would have proudly voted to override a \nveto and fix the injustice once and for all. And, I believe an override \ncould have been easily achieved.\n  Sadly, this effort was lost in the partisan, election engineering of \nthis Administration, the civilian leadership in the Defense Department, \nand the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives. For \nweeks we have delayed resolution of this issue in this bill in order to \navoid forcing the President to take an action contrary to the interests \nof veterans.\n  Hopefully, veterans will quickly learn that there are those of us who \ntruly care about meeting our obligations to them; and, they do have a \nplace to go where their voices will be heard, where America's promises \nwill be kept, and where their needs will be met.\n  I am ready to take up this fight in our next session. I am proud to \nrepresent the interests of our veterans and our military retirees. I am \nalso proud to represent the interests of our retirees' surviving \nspouses, military widows, and their children. We have a lot of work to \ndo correcting some of the injustices created over the years with \nconflicting and inconsistent benefits policies that seem to be \nconcentrated in our Armed Services and Veterans programs. I look \nforward to taking up these challenges and working with my colleagues to \nrationalize and simplify our benefits systems so that we keep our \npromises to those who have given their all to the Nation.\n  I would like to close with a quintessentially American expression of \nwhat we need to do by President Teddy Roosevelt, ``A man who is good \nenough to shed his blood for his country is good enough to be given a \nsquare deal afterward.'' I believe that there should be at least \neighty-two of my colleagues in this chamber who will agree with this \nand be willing to make it a reality next session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that all time has \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The chairman of the committee wishes to enter a statement \nin the Record that will take less than 5 minutes. I would only state \nthere are a number of Senators who wish to attend the service for \nSenator Wellstone and his wife, which begins at 7 o'clock, so I would \nhope everyone can keep that in mind and we can move forward with this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My understanding is there is no need for a rollcall vote \non this bill.\n  Mr. President, just two additional moments I appreciate taking here. \nOne relates to Senator Cleland.\n  Senator Cleland has been a true champion of the men and women who \nserve our country in uniform. He is directly responsible for a great \ndeal of important legislation, including the transferability of GI bill \nbenefits to a military member's spouse and children. This was a major \nretention initiative.\n  Secondly, this year he led the effort for a new special assignment \nincentive pay to encourage military members to serve in hard-to-fill \npositions.\n  This year he warned us that our military services are too small to \nmeet our ongoing and growing commitments, and he is proving to be \nprescient in that regard because of the needs we see for our military \nservices in the way in which they are involved in so many parts of the \nworld.\n  But in addition to his role on the Personnel Subcommittee, Senator \nCleland continually reminded us of the pitfalls of committing U.S. \nArmed Forces to conflict without clearly defined objectives supported \nby the Congress and the American people.\n  Senator Cleland's careful and thoughtful approach to national \nsecurity has been appreciated by every member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, every Member of this body. His advice and his judgment are \ngoing to continue to be needed by us individually, and we will be \ncalling upon him. His indomitable spirit has inspired us, and it will \ncontinue to do so.\n  Senator Carnahan has been a valued member of the Armed Services \nCommittee for the last 2 years. She was able to quickly get up to \nspeed. She played an important role in the committee's deliberations on \na wide array of issues.\n  She had a particular interest, and had a significant impact, in a \nnumber of areas, including Reserve health care and counterproliferation \nprograms.\n  In the area of Reserve health care, Senator Carnahan played a key \nrole in extending the period during which Reservists remain eligible \nfor military health care after being released from active duty, and in \ninitiating a review of alternative means for providing health care to \nthe Reserves.\n  In the area of counterproliferation, Senator Carnahan played a key \nrole in developing legislation to improve our nonproliferation programs \nto address the problem of radiological weapons and so-called ``dirty \nbombs.''\n  She has always been a strong advocate of efforts to expand these \nprograms to countries outside of the former Soviet Union. Her \nthoughtful,\n\n[[Page S10874]]\n\nbalanced approach to legislation will be missed on our committee, and \nher good and gentle nature will be missed by every Member of this body.\n  Finally, Senator Bob Smith and Senator Tim Hutchinson were key \nmembers of our committee.\n  I take this opportunity to recognize the contribution that Senator \nBob Smith has made to the work of the Armed Services Committee and the \nnational security of this country over his 12 years of service on this \nCommittee.\n  Most recently Senator Smith has served as both the Chairman and \nRanking Member of our Strategic Subcommittee where he was a strong \nadvocate of national security space programs, ballistic missile defense \nprograms, and the modernization of our strategic nuclear triad. He did \nnot limit his work on the Committee to the work of one or two \nsubcommittees, however. He made it a point to involve himself in the \nwhole range of issues that came before the Committee and the \nCommittee's deliberations and conclusions were always improved by his \ninvolvement. This past year for example, he worked very hard on the \nissue of concurrent receipt for our deserving veterans.\n  Every member of the Armed Services Committee will miss Senator \nSmith's thoughtful advice and collegial approach to national security \nissues in the next Congress.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize and thank \nSenator Hutchinson for his service on the Armed Services Committee for \nthe last 6 years. In particular, I would like to recognize his service \nas Chairman and Ranking Member of the Personnel Subcommittee.\n  Senator Hutchinson demonstrated great leadership in helping our \nmilitary recruiters. He was a major player in enacting TRICARE for \nLife, significantly increasing the pay of our troops, and reducing the \nout-of-pocket housing expenses for military personnel not able to live \non a military installation. In response to requests for help from \nenlisted recruiters, he initiated legislation that ensures that \nmilitary recruiters have the same access to secondary school students \nas is provided to colleges, universities, and other potential \nemployers.\n  Our service members and our Nation have greatly benefitted from \nSenator Tim Hutchinson's service here in the Senate on the Armed \nServices Committee. We thank him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to make a few \nremarks about Senators Smith and Hutchinson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I join with Senator Levin in his high compliments of \nSenators Cleland and Carnahan. Both have served this committee \nexceedingly well.\n  Bob Smith is a true American patriot. He loves his country. He served \nin the Navy. He was a history teacher. He came down here with a ``Mr. \nSmith Comes to Washington'' view of the highest possible values he \ncould bring to bear. He loved the Defense Department. He gave it \nextraordinary interest. He was a top leader in national missile defense \nand high technology defense. He was a leader on the Strategic \nSubcommittee and chaired it for a number of years.\n  He was a champion for lost POWs. No Senator in this body spent more \ntime and effort fighting to make sure every single prisoner of war of \nthe United States was recovered or we knew about. He led on the Mike \nSpeicher case, the missing pilot in Iraq.\n  Tim Hutchinson came in with me. I love Tim and watched him lead in \nthis body year after year. He was a tremendous contributor to the Armed \nServices Committee. He chaired the Personnel Subcommittee. In that \nsubcommittee, he fought hard to improve the pay, benefits, and living \nconditions of our men and women in uniform. He also fought successfully \nto break down the barriers where some of our colleges would not let \nmilitary recruiters come on campus to recruit. He led a tough battle to \nchange some of those laws.\n  He was a leader, as was Senator Smith, in the concurrent receipt \nbattle to make sure our veterans who have been injured and disabled \nreceived better compensation.\n  I thank Senator Levin for mentioning these Senators at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as Senator Warner did, I add my thanks to \nour staffs: David Lyles, chief of staff on the Democratic side; Judy \nAnsley, taking the same responsibility on the Republican side. We are \ndeeply in debt to them and to their entire crew which works with them.\n  Without our staffs, needless to say, we could not even come close, \nnot just procedurally, not just mechanically, to accomplishing this \ngoal of a conference report, but also for the wisdom, the advice they \ngive us on substantive issues as well which is so important to us.\n  I don't know of anybody else who wants to speak. I don't know of a \nrequest for a roll call. I yield the floor and hope we can adopt the \nconference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the conference \nreport?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the conference report.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, the legislation Senator Lieberman and I \nintroduced last year to create an independent commission to investigate \nthe September 11 attacks passed the Senate as an amendment to the \nhomeland security bill by a vote of 90 to 8 in September. Days before \nthe vote, the administration issued a letter supporting the creation of \nan independent commission. But Congress is about to adjourn without \nhaving done so, to get it done.\n  The agreement that was reached on the homeland security bill is a \nwelcome development and will make our Nation more secure. But the \nagreed text does not include our independent commission proposal, \ndespite an overwhelming Senate vote in September and despite its \nprevious inclusion in both the Lieberman and Gramm-Miller bills.\n  I believe President bush and his team have responded admirably and \nwith a sense of purpose to the terrorist attacks, and the joint \nintelligence committee investigation into the associated intelligence \nfailings has added to our understanding of what went wrong. But neither \nthe administration nor Congress is alone capable of conducting a \nthorough, nonpartisan, independent inquiry into what happened on \nSeptember 11, or to propose far-reaching measures to protect our people \nand our institutions against such assault in the future.\n  To this day, we have little information on how 19 men armed with \nboxcutters could have so effectively struck America. After every other \nsuch tragedy in our Nation's history, like Pearl Harbor and President \nKennedy's assassination, independent investigations were immediately \nappointed to examine what went wrong and recommend needed reforms to \nprevent such tragedies from happening again. There has been no such \nreview since September 11.\n  This is what our proposed commission would do. Its goal would be to \nmake a full accounting of the circumstances surrounding the attacks, \nincluding how prepared we were, and how well we responded to this \nunprecedented assault. The commission would also make comprehensive \nrecommendations on how to protect our homeland in the future. It would \nexamine not just intelligence but the range of Government agencies and \npolicies, from border control to aviation security to diplomacy.\n  Learning the lessons of September 11 will require asking hard \nquestions. It will require digging deep into the resources of the full \nrange of Government agencies. It will demand objective judgment into \nwhat went wrong, what we did right, and what else we need to do to \ndeter and defeat depraved assaults by our enemies in the future.\n  No such review has occurred to date. Passage of the homeland security \nlegislation is a good start to making needed reforms, but to some \nextent we are flying blind in our efforts to reform our approach to \nhomeland defense because we still do not know what parts and policies \nof the Government failed the American people last September 11.\n  We do know, thanks to press leaks and the work of the joint \nintelligence committee, that significant failures occurred.\n  The chairman and ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nhave suggested we might have prevented the September 11 attacks had we \nproperly analyzed available information. They strongly support our \nindependent commission legislation to carry on the work their joint \nintelligence investigation started. Together with Senators Bob Graham \nand Dick Shelby, we have been negotiating intensively with the White \nHouse and remain hopeful we might reach an agreement with them to \ncreate a commission, but we believe Congress must speak on this issue.\n  The families of September 11 will not rest until they have answers \nabout how their Government let them down and what we can do to make \nsure such tragedy never strikes America again. This is not a witch \nhunt. It is a search for the answers that will enable us to\n\n[[Page S10876]]\n\nbetter protect our Nation against future attack by terrorists. It is \nabout the future, not the past. It is worthy of the strong bipartisan \nsupport it has already received. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  I want to thank my friend from Connecticut for his efforts on behalf \nof this commission. I want to thank him for his efforts on behalf of \nthe families, and I want to thank the White House for their continued \nnegotiations. It is time we wrapped up these negotiations so this \ncommission can be part of the Homeland Security bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend from Arizona for \nhis strong statement, for joining me in introducing this amendment, and \nfor his characteristic steadfastness in pursuit of an important cause \nregardless of the opposition and where it comes from.\n  He and I introduced legislation last December. We are approaching a \nyear ago. It was a few months after the tragic attacks of September 11. \nWe felt there should be an independent citizen commission, nonpartisan, \nwith full powers of subpoena and adequate resources to investigate how \ncould September 11 have happened, because clearly the fact it did \nhappen said we were not adequately protecting the American people. We \nwere insistent that this kind of investigation occur so we could learn \nhow to prevent it from ever happening again.\n  There have been roadblocks along the way, but we have continued to \nstate, and we state again, we are not going to give up this fight until \nsuch an independent commission is created because we cannot rest until \nthe truth and the whole truth, so help us God, as best as anyone is \nable to find it, is determined about September 11. Because without that \nunlimited, unvarnished, uninhibited truth, we are not going to be able \nto inform this new Department of Homeland Security adequately.\n  This measure of ours passed the Senate earlier this year when we were \nconsidering the Homeland Security measure. It passed overwhelmingly \nwith bipartisan support. In fact, the so-called Gramm-Miller substitute \nincorporated this provision, which I was very grateful to Senator Gramm \nand Senator Miller for doing, and Senator McCain was a great advocate \nfor that cause.\n\n  In the substitute introduced by Senator Thompson, in coordination \nwith the White House and the House, the commission proposal is not in \nit, and that is not acceptable. Senator McCain has said happily we \ncontinue to negotiate with the White House up until this moment, \nhopeful that an agreement can be secured that will create the \naggressive, independent, nonpolitical commission this tragedy requires. \nBut if it is not, and we have not reached an agreement yet, we are \ngoing to do everything we can to reinsert this commission into this \nHomeland Security bill where it belongs.\n  I think I can say for my friend from Arizona and myself if for some \nreason that does not work, we are going to keep introducing it wherever \nand whenever we think we can get a vote that will make it law. We owe \nthis to the families of the September 11 victims.\n  I have met with them, as Senator McCain has, several times. Their \ndesire for this commission is in some ways the strongest and most \ncompelling argument anyone can make on its behalf, because they asked \nus and they asked America, having lost loved ones, how could September \n11 have happened? We owe them an answer to that question, and we have \nnot given it to them yet.\n  As Senator McCain said, the work by the Joint Intelligence Committee \nhas revealed information, media investigations have revealed \ninformation, that only increases our understanding of how much more we \nneed to know. The Senate coleaders of the Intelligence Committee, \nSenator Graham and Senator Shelby, are now strong supporters of this \ncommission idea.\n  Going back to the families of the September 11 victims, I do want to \nsay the persistent advocacy of these families, led by Steve Push, \nKristen Breitweiser, Mary Fetchet, Beverly Eckert, and so many others, \ndespite their great personal loss, has inspired not only my deep \nadmiration but our continuing commitment to fight for this commission \nuntil it comes to fruition. We are not interested in pointing fingers. \nThis is all about our common security, and improving it is our common \nresponsibility.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting this amendment to \nthe Homeland Security bill and restoring this provision to create an \nindependent commission on September 11.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator agree it is a bit surprising we have not \nbeen able to make greater progress on this commission since there was a \nrecorded vote in the Senate of 90 to 8, and it was included in the \nHomeland Security bills prior to this latest iteration?\n  Again, I want to thank the White House for their active \nparticipation, but I hope that mandate would be felt by one and all. A \n90-to-8 vote usually does not seem to have difficulty, at least from \nthe Senate side, in becoming a part of legislation.\n  Interestingly, we do not find it in the Homeland Security bill. In \nthe interest of straight talk, if there is a cloture vote and it is not \nin there at that time, then the amendment for a commission will fall \nbecause of nongermaneness, a situation which I do not think is really \nwhat was intended when we had a 90-to-8 vote on this issue in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from Arizona is quite right. He remembers \nthe numbers exactly. It was a 90-to-8 vote--very strong bipartisan \nsupport for this idea. That support ought not be frustrated.\n  I have seen public opinion surveys that say it represents the desire \nand opinion, quite naturally, not just of the families of September 11 \nvictims but of the American people. So while I join my friend from \nArizona in expressing my gratitude that the White House has again today \nrestarted negotiations to try to reach an agreement, I must say leaving \nthis proposal for a commission out of this substitute that is now put \nin to create a Department of Homeland Security is inexplicable. I hope \nwe can explain it by either putting it back in or coming to an \nagreement with the White House. It is that critical.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it not true, from conversations with the families, \nthat the families do not want this commission created by executive \norder because then it would not have the input of the legislative \nbranch? And second of all, that other commissions in the past have all \nbeen created by acts of Congress, not by executive order? Is that the \nSenator's understanding?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from Arizona again is correct. There have \nbeen some commissions created by other bodies. But the ones in the most \nimportant cases have been created by Congress. On the first point, \nwhich is a powerful point, it is the clear desire of the families of \nthe victims of September 11 that this commission be created by \nCongress. We ought to create it. This was a national catastrophe.\n\n  As we create a Department of Homeland Security to protect the \nAmerican people from that ever happening again, we ought to, as the \nrepresentatives of all the people of this country, all of them in this \nterrible new era we have entered, potentially victims of terrorism--we, \nas their representatives, ought to say loudly and together, hopefully \ntogether with the administration, we can never know too much about how \nSeptember 11 happened. We do not know enough now how September 11 \nhappened. The one best way to know as much as we can of the truth about \nSeptember 11 is to create a strong, nonpolitical commission with full \nresources and powers of subpoena to get to the truth.\n  The day for this commission will come. The arguments for it are \nirresistible. Let us hope that day is sooner than later. I thank my \nfriend from Arizona for his persistence and advocacy. Also, it is an \nhonor to work with him. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with a lot \nof other Members, of both parties, of this body to get this commission \ncreated.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S10877]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton).

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has \nconfirmed Johnny Mack Brown to be United States Marshal for the \nDistrict of South Carolina. Johnny Mack Brown is a man of outstanding \ncharacter and is highly qualified to serve as a United States Marshal. \nHe will serve our Nation well.\n  Johnny Mack has over 30 years' experience in law enforcement. In \n1966, he went to work for the South Carolina Department of Probation, \nParole & Pardon, serving as a probation officer. From there, he joined \nthe Thirteenth Circuit Solicitor's Office and worked as an investigator \nfor four years.\n  Mr. Brown's success soon provided him with opportunities to showcase \nhis substantial leadership skills. In 1973, he became the director of \nthe Municipal Offender Program at the Greenville City Municipal Court \nin Greenville, SC. From 1974 to 1976, he served as Director of the Pre-\nTrial Diversion Program in the Thirteenth Circuit Solicitor's Office.\n  After his time at the Solicitor's office, Johnny Mack decided to run \nfor office himself. He was elected in 1976 as the Sheriff of Greenville \nCounty, SC. He was subsequently re-elected five times and served a \ntotal of 24 years as Greenville's beloved sheriff.\n  As sheriff, Johnny Mack Brown served with distinction. He proved \nhimself to be a strong leader, and it is no wonder that he was elected \nto a total of six terms. There is no doubt that Johnny Mack Brown's \nconstituents felt secure with him as their sheriff. The voters' \nrepeated endorsement of Johnny Mack is a tribute to his skill and \nprofessionalism.\n  During his time as sheriff, Johnny Mack contributed to the State and \nnational law enforcement community in various ways. For example, he has \nwritten numerous articles for law enforcement publications. These \nwritings have dealt with topics such as the professionalizing of \nsheriff's offices, the use of information technologies, and the \nimplementation of community programs for crime prevention.\n  Mr. Brown has also served in prominent leadership positions at both \nthe state and national levels. In 1983, he served as President of the \nSouth Carolina Sheriffs' Association. Ten years later, he was elected \nPresident of the National Sheriff's Association. Johnny Mack's \nselection to these prestigious positions is a testament to his capacity \nto lead others.\n  Johnny Mack Brown has also been the recipient of numerous awards. In \n1990, the Lion's Club of Greenville awarded Johnny Mack the \nDistinguished Citizen Award, and in 1998, the Blue Ridge Council of the \nBoy Scouts of America awarded him another Distinguished Citizen Award. \nIn 1999, the Pleasantburg Lion's Club named him as its Citizen of the \nYear. Johnny Mack Brown is also a 1993 recipient of the Order of the \nPalmetto, South Carolina's highest civilian award.\n  Johnny Mack Brown's law enforcement credentials and his leadership \nskills will serve him well as United States Marshal in the District of \nSouth Carolina. He is truly a deserving man who has striven to serve \nthe public with honor and integrity for many years. He will be a very \nsuccessful United States Marshal, and I am proud to see him confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10877-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JESSE HELMS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I take this opportunity to recognize the \ndistinguished career of one of our retiring colleagues, the senior \nSenator from North Carolina, Senator Helms.\n  Senator Helms began his service in the U.S. Senate in January of \n1973. When he retires at the end of this year, at the conclusion of his \nfifth term, he will have served the public as a U.S. Senator for a full \n30 years. Those of us who have had the privilege of being a member of \nthis institution understand well the commitment, hard work, dedication, \nand personal sacrifice that make such a record possible.\n  Senator Helms' lengthy career in the Senate actually represented the \ncontinuation of an already notable and varied public life that \nincluded, among other things, service in the U.S. Navy from 1942 to \n1945, senior staff positions under two U.S. Senators, two terms on the \nRaleigh, NC, City Council, and a host of leadership positions with \ncivic, business, and educational organizations.\n  During our time in the Senate, I have come to know Senator Helms best \nas a fellow member of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry. While on the Committee, he proved to be an outspoken and \nvigorous defender of those commodities, such as peanuts and tobacco, \nthat are important to North Carolina's vital agricultural sector. But \nhe has also shown himself to be a leader for all of U.S. agriculture, \nas when he chaired the Agriculture Committee during the period when \nCongress wrote the Food Security Act of 1985, otherwise known as the \n1985 farm bill. That legislation is recognized even today for its \ngroundbreaking commitment to keeping U.S. agriculture competitive in \nthe international marketplace through such programs as the Export \nEnhancement Program and the Targeted Export Assistance program--now the \nMarket Access Program--and for its landmark provisions in support of \nnatural resource conservation, such as the Conservation Reserve \nProgram.\n  When I think of Senator Helms as a person, two characteristics stand \nout. First and foremost, I think of him as a gentleman always, one who \ngives current meaning to an old-fashioned term: courtly. Refined in his \nmanners and respectful toward others, he brings a Southern charm and \ngrace to all that he does, and a civility to political discourse that \nsadly is too often lacking today.\n  Second, he has displayed even in the twilight of his career an \nopenness and a tolerance toward others who hold views that he may not \nalways have shared. In that respect, he has displayed a capacity for \ngrowth and understanding that should serve as an inspiration to the \nrest of us.\n  I know that I am joined by all of my colleagues in wishing Senator \nHelms and his wife Dorothy a long restful, and fulfilling retirement \ntogether in North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10877-4", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10877-S10879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PASSAGE OF S. 1868\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate passed S. 1868 by \nunanimous consent on October 17, along with a Biden-Thurmond \nsubstitute. Enactment of this measure will make our children safer, and \nI rise today to explain several of the bill's provisions.\n  Today, 87 million of our children are involved in activities provided \nby child and youth organizations which depend heavily on volunteers to \ndeliver their services. Millions more elderly and disabled adults are \nserved by public and private service organizations. Organizations \nacross the country, like the Boys and Girls Clubs, often rely solely on \nvolunteers to make these safe havens for kids a place where they can \nlearn. The Boys and Girls Clubs and others don't just provide services \nto kids, their work reverberates throughout our communities, as the \nafter-school programs they provide help keep kids out of trouble. This \nis juvenile crime prevention at its best, and I salute the volunteers \nwho help make these programs work.\n  Unfortunately, some of these volunteers and employees come to their \njobs with less than the best of intentions. According to the National \nMentoring Partnership, incidents of child sexual abuse in child care \nsettings, foster homes and schools ranges from 1 to 7 percent. \nOrganizations have tried to weed out bad apples, and today most conduct \nbackground checks on applicants who seek to work with children. \nUnfortunately, these checks can often take months to complete, can be \nexpensive, and many organizations do not have access to the FBI's \nnational fingerprint database. These time delays\n\n[[Page S10878]]\n\nand scope limitations are dangerous: a prospective volunteer could pass \na name-based background check in one State, only to have a past felony \ncommitted in another jurisdiction go undetected.\n  The intent of S. 1868 and the substitute, the Biden-Thurmond National \nChild Protection and Volunteers for Children Improvement Act, are to \nstreamline the process for organizations to check the backgrounds of \npotential volunteers and employees. A review of the statutory \nbackground in this area is appropriate.\n  Effective December 20, 1993, the National Child Protection Act, \n``NCPA,'' P.L. 103-209, encouraged States to adopt legislation to \nauthorize a national criminal history background check to determine an \nemployee's or volunteer's fitness to care for the safety and well-being \nof children. On September 13, 1994, the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994, P.L. 103-322, expanded the scope of the NCPA \nto include the elderly and individuals with disabilities.\n  As envisioned by Congress, the NCPA was to encourage States to have \nin effect national background check procedures that enable a \n``qualified entity'' to determine whether an individual applicant is \nfit to care for the safety and well-being of children, the elderly, or \nindividuals with disabilities. The procedures permit this entity to ask \nan authorized State agency to request that the Attorney General run a \nnationwide criminal history background check on an applicant provider. \n``Qualified entity'' is defined at 42 U.S.C. 5119c as ``a business or \norganization, whether public, private, for-profit, not-for-profit, or \nvoluntary, that provides care or care placement services, including a \nbusiness or organization that licenses or certifies others to provide \ncare or care placement services....''. The authorized agency should \naccess and review State and Federal criminal history records through \nthe national criminal history background check system and make \nreasonable efforts to respond to an inquiry within 15 business days.\n\n  Congress addressed this issue again in 1998 through enactment of the \nVolunteers for Children Act, Sections 221 and 222 of P.L. 105-251, \n``VCA''. The VCA amended the NCPA to permit child care, elder care, and \nvolunteer organizations to request background checks through State \nagencies in the absence of state laws implementing the NCPA.\n  Thus, the NCPA, as amended by the VCA, authorizes national \nfingerprint-based criminal history background checks of volunteers and \nemployees, including applicants for employment, of qualified entities \nwho provide care for children, the elderly, or individuals with \ndisabilities, and those who have unsupervised access to such \npopulations, regardless of employment or volunteer status, for the \npurpose of determining whether they have been convicted of crimes that \nbear upon their fitness to have responsibility for the safety and well-\nbeing of children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities.\n  Two years ago, organizations seeking to conduct background checks on \ntheir employees and volunteers made me aware of serious problems with \nthe current background check system, problems that were jeopardizing \nthe safety of children. Groups like the Boys and Girls Clubs of America \nalerted me that, despite the authorities provided in the NCPA and the \nVCA, national check requests were often delayed, in some jurisdictions \nthey were never processed, and that the prohibitive costs of some of \nthese checks were discouraging entities from seeking the reviews.\n  Under current law, whether they want a State or national criminal \nbackground check, organizations must apply through their state-\nauthorized agency. The State agency then performs the State check and \nforwards the request to the FBI for a national check. The FBI responds \nback to the State agency, which then forwards the information back to \nthe volunteer organization. In Delaware, the State Police Bureau of \nIdentification works with groups to fingerprint prospective workers and \ncheck their backgrounds.\n  A patchwork of statutes and regulations govern background checks at \nthe State level; there are currently over 1,200 State statutes \nconcerning criminal record checks. This has led to widely different \nsituations in each State: different agencies are authorized to perform \nthe checks for different types of organizations, distinct forms and \ninformation are required, and the results are returned in various \nformats that can be difficult to interpret. States have not been \nconsistent in their interpretation of the NCPA and VCA. Put simply, the \ncurrent system is extremely cumbersome, particularly for those \norganizations that must check criminal records in multiple States, and \nfor those groups employing seasonal workers, such as summer camps, for \nwhom time is of the essence when seeking the results of background \nchecks.\n  After careful study of this issue it became clear to me that the \nconcerns of groups such as the National mentoring Partnership and the \nBoys and Girls Clubs are not merely anecdotal. In 1998, the FBI's \nCriminal Justice Information Services, ``CJIS'', Division performed an \nanalysis of fingerprints submitted for civil applicant purposes. CJIS \nfound that the average transmission time from the point of fingerprint \nto the State bureau was 51.0 days, and from the State bureau to the FBI \nwas another 66.6 days, for a total of 117.6 days from fingerprinting to \nreceipt by the FBI. The worst performing jurisdiction took 544.8 days \nfrom fingerprinting to receipt by the FBI. In a survey conducted by the \nNational mentoring Partnership, mentoring organizations on average \nwaited 6 weeks for the results of a national criminal background check \nto be returned.\n\n  The danger these delays pose to mentoring groups and others cannot be \noverstated. Suppose a group seeks to hire a volunteer who grew up in a \nneighboring jurisdiction to work with children. The group has the \nvolunteer fingerprinted at their local police department, forwards \nthose prints along to the agency designated by State statute or \nprocedure to receive such requests, and then waits for the national \nresults. FBI data indicates they will wait close to four months, on \naverage, for the final results of the background check. That's too \nlong. It forces groups to choose between taking a risk on someone's \nbackground, not making the hire at all, or seeking out only candidates \nfrom their jurisdiction for whom a full national background check may \nnot be necessary.\n  Delay is not the only problem with the current system. The NCPA/VCA \ncaps the fees the FBI can charge for national background checks at $24 \nfor employees. For State fees, the NMCPA/VCA requires States to \n``establish fee systems that insure that fees to nonprofit entities for \nbackground checks do not discourage volunteers from participating in \nchild care programs.'' In a survey of mentoring organizations, the \nNational mentoring Partnership found that organizations were paying on \naverage $10 for a State records check, plus the fee for a national \ncheck. For organizations utilizing hundreds of volunteers and \nemployees, the costs of conducting through background checks can be \nexorbitant. Small, community-based organizations with limited funding \noften must choose between funding services to children or checking the \ncriminal history records of prospective volunteers.\n  In an attempt at addressing some of these concerns with the current \nNCPA/VCA system, at the conclusion of the 106th Congress I introduced \nS. 3252. I reintroduced the same bill as S. 1868 in this Congress, and \nI am proud to have Senator Thurmond as a cosponsor. As introduced, S. \n1868 would have permitted qualified entities like the Boys and Girls \nClubs to apply to a clearinghouse within the Justice Department for \nnational criminal history background checks. Checks would have been \naffordable and results would have been quickly returned to the \nqualified entities. The Judiciary Committee took up and passed the \nbill, along with a Biden/Thurmond/DeWine amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute.\n  On June 18, 2002, the Justice Department sent me a letter outlining \ntheir views on the legislation as reported by the Committee. In its \nletter, the Department noted that the bill's goal of providing \neffective, efficient national criminal history background checks will \n``help to protect children and other vulnerable segments of the \nnation's population, [and will] promote volunteerism in the United \nStates, which is one of the President's priorities.''\n  The Department went on to raise several concerns with the \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S10879]]\n\nFirst, they noted that the funds authorized by the bill to perform the \nchecks and operate a new clearinghouse within the Department may be \nprohibitive. The Biden-Thurmond substitute the Senate considers today \naddresses those concerns. In a change from the measure reported by \nthe committee, the substitute authorizes the Attorney General to charge \na modest fee $5 for volunteer checks. In addition, the substitute \ndramatically scales back the duties of the clearinghouse, now labeled \nthe ``Office for Volunteer and Provider Screening.'' Where the bill as \nreported charged the clearinghouse with developing model fitness \nstandards and applying standards against each applicant utilizing the \nresources of the clearinghouse, the version we consider today \neliminates this fitness determination requirement. While I still feel \nit would be preferable for the Department to assist qualified entities \nin making these fitness determinations, the substitute provides that \nmodel standards will be developed and envisions qualified entities then \nusing these standards to make their own fitness determinations. S. 1868 \nas reported by committee authorized $180 million over five years to \ncover the costs of volunteer checks and to establish the clearinghouse. \nThe vision we consider today has scaled this authorization back to $100 \nmillion.\n\n  Second, the Department expressed concerns with language in S. 1868, \nadded in Committee at the behest of Senator DeWine and drawn directly \nfrom his S. 1830, which made amendments to the National Criminal \nHistory Access an Child Protection Act. There is a difference of \nopinion between the Justice Department and SEARCH, a group created by \nthe States to improve the criminal justice system and the quality of \njustice, as to the impact of this language. Resolution has not been \nreached on the matter, and because I do not believe the issue raised by \nlanguage drawn from S. 1830 to be directly related to the issue at hand \nof providing quick and effective background check results to qualified \nentities, the substitute the Senate considers today deletes the \nlanguage objected to by the Justice Department.\n  Third, the Department expressed administrative and constitutional \nconcerns with the makeup and operations of the clearinghouse described \nin the bill reported out of Committee. I have reviewed the Department's \nconcerns and find them to be valid. The language objected to by the \nDepartment is not a part of the substitute amendment considered today.\n  Since introduction of S. 1868, through the Committee markup process, \nand stemming from extensive discussions regarding this measure over the \npast several months, I have agreed to modify the impact of the bill in \nseveral critical ways. Raised first in Committee by Senator DeWine, and \nthen later by SEARCH and other groups, arguments were made to me that \nS. 1868 could unintentionally undercut the work done in many States to \nprocess background check requests. Senator DeWine rightfully pointed \nout to me that in some States, the system that the Congress put in \nplace after enactment of the National Child Protection Act in 1993 and \nthe Volunteers for Children Act in 1998 is working. In those cases, we \nshould not uproot a system that is effective. The substitute we \nconsider today acknowledges this concern. Upon enactment, the clock \nwill toll on a one-year period during which the Attorney General will \nreview the extent to which States have participated in the NCPA/VCA \nsystem. At the conclusion of that one year period, the Attorney General \nis charged with designating states as having ``qualified state \nprograms''. The substitute lays out several objective criteria designed \nto guide the Attorney General's decision. States that are quickly, \ncheaply, and reliably processing background checks will be recognized \nas having a ``qualified State program'' by the Attorney General and \nwill continue to process background check requests as under current \nlaw. But if the Attorney General determines that a State does not have \na qualified State program, based upon the criteria delineated in the \nversion of S. 1868 we consider today, qualified entities in those \njurisdictions are permitted to apply directly to the Justice Department \nfor background checks. This legislation thus creates a separate track \nfor qualified entities seeking national criminal history background \nchecks. This track will only be available, however, to qualified \nentities doing business in States without a qualified State program, as \ndetermined by the Attorney General.\n\n  A concern has been raised during drafting of this measure that the \nsubstitute does not give the Attorney General the discretion to label a \nState's program as qualified for one category of qualified entities, \nbut not qualified for another. The intention of the authors of S. 1868 \nis to give the Attorney General that discretion. The language of the \nsubstitute considered by the Senate today does not require the Attorney \nGeneral to make a blanket determination for a State's entire universe \nof qualified entities. The substitute should be interpreted by the \nAttorney General to permit States to be qualified for some categories \nof qualified entities but not all categories if necessary.\n  Other provisions of the version of S. 1868 we consider today deserve \nmention. SEARCH and others have suggested to me that one of the main \nimpediments States face in fully implementing the NCPA/VCA is that \ncurrent law does not authorize the Attorney General and States to \ndeliver criminal history records information directly to qualified \nentities. S. 1868 changes this and makes clear that the Attorney \nGeneral and States may provide this information to qualified entities \nshould they desire to do so.\n  Also, we have authorized in this measure grants to the States so they \ncan purchase so-called Live-Scan fingerprint technology. These devices \npermit prints to be electronically transmitted, obviating the need for \nfingerprint cards. Wide dissemination of this technology would \nfacilitate nationwide background checks, and I am hopeful this grant \nprogram will be adequately funded so that this equipment can be \ninstalled throughout the country.\n  I would like to thank Robbie Callaway and Steve Salem of the Boys and \nGirls Clubs of America, Margo Pedroso of the National Mentoring \nPartnership, and Abby Shannon of the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children for their tireless advocacy on behalf of S. 1868. \nCaptain David Deputy of the Delaware State Police and Director of \nDelaware's State Bureau of Identification offered invaluable comments \nthroughout the drafting of this measure, and I thank him for his \nassistance. Thanks also to Bob Belair, General Counsel of SEARCH, for \nhis helpful suggestions. I would like to pay a special tribute to \nSenator Thurmond, as well as to his Judiciary Committee counsel Scott \nFrick, for their dedication to this bill. I appreciate the assistance \nof Chairman Leahy  and Senator Hatch for agreeing to report S. 1868 out \nof Committee last spring. I am also appreciative of the efforts made by \nSenator DeWine and his staff to move this legislation along. Finally, I \nthank Congressman Mark Foley, the author of the Volunteers for Children \nAct, as well as Elizabeth Nicolson and Bradley Schreiber of his staff, \nfor agreeing to introduce this legislation as H.R. 5556 in the other \nbody.\n  I remain hopeful that S. 1868 can be taken up by the other body and \nsent to the President for signature this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10879-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10879-S10880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Madam President, on Monday I was privileged to stand with \nthousands upon thousands of veterans and their families who traveled to \nWashington to visit the Vietnam Wall for its 20th anniversary, to \nreconnect with those with whom we had served, and above all to honor \nour fallen brothers and sisters.\n  These veterans, some of whom traveled for days and all at their own \nexpense, proved something I think every American knows deep down in \ntheir heart--something that cuts to the quick of what we as Americans \nstand for--that part of being an American means keeping faith with our \ncitizens and those heroes who gave so much to our country. That \nresponsibility extends to those of us who have the honor to serve here \nin the Chambers of Congress.\n  Today, my friends, after another Veterans Day where words of praise \nfor America's veterans were spoken, at a time when it is an \nincreasingly real possibility that more Americans will be sent into \nharm's way for their Nation, we must keep faith--in deeds and not just \nwords--with the veterans of our country. We must do the duty we were \nsent here to do, as they did their duty wearing the uniform of our \ncountry.\n  Because of a 111 year-old law, when our soldiers have returned from \ncombat wounded, debilitated by illness, missing limbs, confined to \nwheelchairs--disabled for life these veterans have been told that their \nretired pay would be reduced dollar-for-dollar for any VA disability \nbenefits they received. Yesterday the House and Senate reached a \ncompromise on the issue of concurrent receipt in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. The authorization act has been held up for weeks \nbecause the administration has threatened a veto if concurrent receipt \nlanguage was included in this bill. The compromise that was reached \nyesterday begins to correct the injustice created by this archaic law \nbut it does not go nearly far enough.\n  The compromise language applies only to veterans injured during \ncombat, combat-oriented training, or certain other hazardous \nactivities, with a disability rating of 60 percent or greater, and \nthose with a rating of at least 10 percent if they received a Purple \nHeart. This compromise leaves a bitter taste in the mouths of anyone \nwho believes we have a faith to keep with our veterans. On October 10, \nthe House passed overwhelmingly a motion to instruct their conferees to \naccept the far more comprehensive Senate-passed concurrent receipt \nlanguage--which would have provided all disabled veterans the full \namount of their disability benefits and their retirement pay. There is \nstrong bipartisan support for full concurrent receipt in both Chambers \nof Congress, yet because of the considerable pressure from this \nadministration we have been forced to accept a compromise that will \nleave hundreds of thousands of our veterans behind.\n  I cannot believe that this administration is willing to tell a \nveteran who, through service to his country, has suffered an injury \nleaving him 50 percent disabled, that he is not entitled to both \ndisability compensation and retirement pay earned for 20 years of \nservice. Military retirees are the only category of federal employees \nwho are required to relinquish a portion of their retirement pay when \nthey receive VA disability benefits. Not only does this practice \nunjustly penalize our disabled career soldiers--it weakens our military \nby effectively encouraging injured servicemembers to leave the military \nearly in their careers. We have been working for years to right this \nwrong. This change in law is a beginning, but much remains to be done.\n\n  The issue of compensation for our disabled veterans is only one \naspect of a much larger problem--we are failing to meet our promises to \nthe people who have so courageously served our country. Nothing \npunctuates this fact more than the ongoing financial crisis facing the \nveterans health care system.\n  We must address simple mathematics. From 1996 to the present, the \nnumber of veterans seeking health care from the VA has grown from 2.9 \nmillion to 4.5 million, while the VA's health care staff has decreased \nfrom 195,000 to 183,000--forcing many veterans to wait 6 months or \nlonger for care. But this administration's continued refusal to fully \nfund our VA has done nothing to help them hire new staff, let alone \noffer better care to our Nation's veterans.\n  The overall thrust of their approach to this funding crisis has been \nto push reforms aimed at reducing enrollment in the veterans health \nsystem rather than providing the funds necessary to ensure that every \nveteran gets the best health care we have to offer. Even VA Secretary \nPrincipi identified a $400 million shortfall in the fiscal year 2002 \nbudget of the VA health care system. But the administration requested \nonly $142 million to compensate for this shortfall, and plans to make \nup much of the remainder of the shortfall by imposing ``efficiencies'' \non a system that's already reached a crashing point.\n  In July Congress passed $417 million for veterans health care as part \nof the fiscal year 2002 emergency supplemental--to reduce waiting times \nfor health care, keep clinics open, and establish new Community Based \nOut-patient Clinics. But in August the President blocked $275 million \nof the amount provided by Congress, announcing the administration would \nonly spend the $142 million it requested for VA health care.\n  This is not the way to keep faith with our veterans. They are aging \nand in need of medicine and health care, they are sitting in our \nwaiting rooms, and struggling to pay hefty bills and still afford rent \nand food. Many are homeless--in fact, nearly one quarter of all \nhomeless Americans are veterans. By any measure, we are not doing \nenough for those who have done so much for us.\n  That is why I am asking the Congress to provide full funding for \nveterans medical care in the fiscal year 2003 VA/HUD Appropriations \nbill. The committee reported bills in the Senate and House both provide \n$25.3 billion for the VA health system, an increase of $3.3 billion \nover the fiscal year 2002 level, and $1.8 billion more than the \nadministration's request for 2003.\n  Because we are not doing enough for our veterans, I am asking the \nSenate to reject the President's proposed $1,500 health care deductible \nfor Priority 7 veterans included in his fiscal year 2003 VA/HUD budget. \nSo far the House and the Senate have rejected the President's request \nto include this deductible in the VA/HUD Appropriations bill.\n  I am also asking this body to join me in urging the administration to \nrescind the VA memo dated July 18, 2002 that ordered the directors of \nevery veterans health care network in the country to cease outreach \nactivities such as health fairs, open houses, newsletters, and public \nservice announcements.\n\n  And I ask the Senate to call on the VA to rescind its new regulations \nwhich require the rationing of health care. These regulations--which \ngive priority for health care to veterans with service-connected \nconditions, without taking into account the medical needs of patients--\ncould add to the VA's red tape, making the already long waiting times \nat many VA facilities even longer.\n  I believe it is also important the Senate join in supporting Senator \nJohnson's Veterans Health Care Funding Guarantee Act, which would \nassure adequate funding of these important priorities.\n  Regrettably, this administration has launched an assault on Priority \n7 veterans, those who lack a service-connected disability and whose \nincome is higher than the current VA eligibility standard--$24,500 for \na single person. Priority 7 veterans have grown from 2 percent of VA \npatients in 1995 to about 33 percent currently--a total of 1.6 million \nveterans. Although this increase coincides with the 1996 law that \nchanged the VA's eligibility system, veterans have turned to the VA \nmainly because they have nowhere else to go for affordable prescription \ndrugs. These are the same people who would benefit most from a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit--their incomes are too high for Medicaid, but \ntoo low to handle the health system's growing reliance on expensive \nprescription drugs.\n\n[[Page S10881]]\n\nWhere are our priorities when we are content with not passing a \nprescription benefit plan for our seniors--including these honorable \nmen and women--and then say that we will not fight for adequate funding \nfor our VA hospitals? I find these misplaced priorities disturbing and \nI think it high time we finally did something about it.\n  We should remember the words of George Washington: ``The willingness \nwith which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter \nhow justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive the \nveterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their \nnation.'' Today, after one of the most meaningful days in our year, it \nis time for us to show our commitment to our veterans and, by doing so, \nshow our soldiers that their service means something to this country \nand to this government--that we won't just send them into harms way and \nforget about them when they come home. We will remember their service \nand always keep faith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10881-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AMERICA'S POWER\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I join my colleagues today to \ncommemorate September 11, 2002, and the Special Joint Session of \nCongress held in New York City. Americans are a generous people, with \nboth our time and our money. We are a people committed to our religious \nbeliefs. We are a people who place great value on education and the \nindividual. We seek opportunity at every turn for our children, and we \nstrive to take care of those who are elderly, infirm, and less \nfortunate.\n  We are also a people who take great pride in the protections we \ncollectively offer one another through a common defense. We wear most \nhumbly the mantle of ``Super Power.''\n  Last September 11, our collective vulnerability in securing the \nborders of our nation was made known to all. In those initial chaotic \nhours, we watched the opening battle of what is now called the ``War on \nTerror.''\n  Like many states, Alabama lost sons and daughters that day. Indeed, \nfive Alabamians died in the Pentagon. Families were broken and great \nsymbols of our might and entrepreneurial achievement made waste. We \nfelt, and I believe we still feel, a collective pain in our hearts that \nwill never heal. But the world has witnessed the development of a new \nresolve among Americans. A resolve too quiet for too long.\n  In the past year, we have taken a long and hard look at our defense \nposture. We have found great problems that must be fixed. We have found \nstrength. We have committed our uniform services to battle, and we must \ngive our President tools and the authority to get the job done.\n  Nearly a year has elapsed. Our emotions still run high.\n  America is demanding much from itself and its governmental leaders. \nThe creation of the Department of Homeland Security has resulted in a \nvigorous and healthy debate and a strong interest in making our \nhomeland safer and improving our intelligence gathering capabilities.\n  Fundamentally, the homeland defense debate is about change. \nSpecifically, it is about protection of American citizens.\n  I am proud of this country and how we have reacted. Everything has \nnot been perfect, but great progress has been made. Noted columnist Mr. \nCharles Krauthammer recently wrote, ``National character does not \nchange in a day. September 11 did not alter the American character, it \nmerely revealed it.'' I could not agree more.\n  The American character displayed ``courage, resolve, resourcefulness \nand above all resilience'' Krauthammer wrote and I agree. We are a \ngreat power and indeed a super power.\n  We are a nation that believes in freedom and progress and are \nforgiving and slow to anger, but when aroused we have proven once again \nwe can be a terrible force.\n  Our President is leading us with strength and resolve. Homeland \ndefense is but a part--an important part--of that resolve. Foreign \npolicy initiatives, social policy changes and prosecution of the War on \nTerror are other aspects as well. Of the latter, winning is no simple \nmatter. Patience, superior planning, and the support of the military \nare all required to complete the tasks which lie ahead.\n  The nation has met the challenge this year. Now we must work hard as \nthe memories of the horror of September 11 fade, to finish the job of \nmaking our homeland safe and ensuring that our magnificent military \ncontinues to expand its capabilities and world leadership. We must not \nsleep.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10881-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CLARENCE MILLER POST OFFICE\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Through determination \nand hard work he eventually earned a position of electrical engineer. \nWhile employed full time at Ohio Fuel, he joined his family in opening \na small electric wiring business in Lancaster and worked there during \nhis ``off'' hours.\n  At Ohio Fuel, Clarence was introduced to politics when he \nparticipated in a civics course offered to help employees better \nunderstand government. Clarence was enthralled by the subject and soon \nbegan teaching the course.\n  He was able to put into practice all he learned when he was appointed \nto fill a vacancy on the Lancaster City Council. Subsequently, he was \nelected to a full term and then was elected mayor. Following his term \nas mayor, Clarence served the people of 10th District of Ohio in the \nU.S. House of Representatives for 27 years, from 1966-1993. \nRepresentative Miller served for 6 years on the House Agriculture \nCommittee and the Public Works and Transportation Committee, and then \nhe was selected to serve on the Appropriations Committee, where he \nserved for 20 years, and fought hard to reduce Federal spending during \ntimes of skyrocketing deficits.\n  Mr. Miller's achievements did not go unrecognized by his fellow \nOhioans. His many awards include honorary doctorate degrees from \nMarietta College and Rio Grande College, and the Phillips Medal of \nPublic Service from Ohio University.\n  I thank my colleagues for their consideration of this matter \nimportant to the people of Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10881-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10881-S10882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  CHANDLER RAYMOND KELLER: IN MEMORIAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

He \nwas born in Manhattan Beach, California. Chad mostly grew up there, \nwith the exception of some time spent in Hong Kong, New York and \nSydney, Australia due to his father's work assignments with Security \nPacific Corporation.\n  As a child, Chad enjoyed a great love of rocketry and an avid \ninterest in space. As a young boy he had an innate ability to \nunderstand machines and how to make them work. In 1993, Chad graduated \nfrom the University of Colorado's aerospace engineering program and \npursued his career at Hughes/Boeing, working in their satellite \nlaunching program.\n  Chad and his wife, Lisa Hurley Keller, were married on July 22, 2000 \nat the Old Mission in Santa Barbara. During their brief time together \nChad and Lisa enjoyed travel, outdoor activities, and most of all, \nbeing with one another.\n  Chad Keller enjoyed surfing, skiing and snowboarding. He loved to \ncook\n\n[[Page S10882]]\n\nand possessed a wonderful sense of humor. ``He had the ability to bond \nwith people, and he touched many lives during his short life. He lived \nhis life to its fullest,'' says his father, Dick Keller.\n  In celebration of his life, the Keller family established the \nChandler Keller Memorial Scholarship at the University of Colorado.

Yamnicky, Sr., of \nWaldorf, Maryland, who lost his life on September 11, 2001. He was a \npassenger on American Airlines Flight 77. As we all know, that flight \nwas hijacked by terrorists and crashed into the Pentagon, killing \neveryone on board. Captain Yamnicky was a 71-year-old retired naval \naviator who, since his retirement from the United States Navy in 1979, \ncontinued to work as a defense contractor for Veridian Engineering.\n  Captain Yamnicky was a gentleman and a scholar. He graduated from the \nNaval Academy in 1952, and devoted a 26-year career in service to this \ncountry. He served a combat tour in Korea and served two tours in \nSoutheast Asia flying from aircraft carriers. He earned several \nmilitary honors, including the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n  After graduating from the Naval Test Pilot School at Patuxent River, \nMaryland, in 1961, one of his first assignments was to determine the \nminimum acceptable airspeed for the A-4 aircraft after a catapult \nlaunch from an aircraft carrier. He was inducted into the Society of \nExperimental Test Pilots in recognition of his contributions. In 1963, \nafter that honor, Captain Yamnicky reported to VA-146 at NAS in \nLemoore, California.\n  Captain Yamnicky met his wife, Jann, while she was working as a nurse \nat Jacksonville Naval Hospital. They married in 1959 and had four \nchildren. Their son John David, of California, said of his father, \n``This guy was the head of the family, he made everyone feel safe. If \nhe ever talked about accomplishing something, it was as a group or a \nteam. He was a modest man.''\n  Friend and colleague, Dennis Plautz, commented that, ``John Yamnicky \nemphasized teamwork. His style was never to leave a teammate \nstraggling, rather work with them, help them, encourage them to \nmaximize their potential.''\n  He applied this attitude in all areas of his life, including his \ncommunity contributions. Captain Yamnicky served on the Board of \nDirectors at his daughter Lorraine's high school, St. Mary's Academy, \nwas a member of the Knights of Columbus, and the Elks Lodge. He was \nproud of his volunteer contributions to the De La Brooke Foxhounds Hunt \nClub, where he and Jann were members for 25 years.\n  His best times were spent away from the office, riding on a tractor \nthrough the fields of his Waldorf horse farm. ``He loved being out \nthere. His nature was not to stand around. He was always out in the \nfields, always working on something,'' remembers his son, John.\n  Captain Yamnicky is survived by his wife Jann and their four \nchildren, John, Jr., Lorraine, Mark and Jennifer.\n  Mr. President, none of us is untouched by the terror of September \n11th, and many Californians were part of each tragic moment of that \ntragic day.

She retired in 1979 and returned to the University as a student, \nearning her Bachelor's Degree in Fine Art. During her retirement, Mrs. \ndeAraujo traveled extensively and pursued her passion for watercolor \npainting. She was a talented artist, and her paintings won several \nprizes in various competitions.\n\n[[Page S10883]]\n\n  During the 1970's Dorothy successfully overcame breast cancer.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to share \nwith my colleagues the memory of one of my constituents, Alan Beaven, \nwho lost his life on September 11, 2001. Mr. Beaven was a 48-year-old \nenvironmental lawyer when the flight he was on, United Airlines Flight \n93, was hijacked by terrorists. As we all know, that plane crashed in a \nPennsylvania field, killing everyone on board.\n  Mr. Beaven was born in New Zealand and was educated at the University \nof Auckland, New Zealand where he was a recipient of the Butterworth \nPrize. He taught law and practiced in the areas of securities, class \nactions and environmental law in New Zealand, England, New York and \nCalifornia.\n  Considered one of our nation's leading environmental lawyers, over \nthe past nine years Mr. Beaven prosecuted nearly 100 clean water cases. \nHis law firm partner, Joe Tabbacco, observes, ``This is an absolutely \nremarkable record. Alan's efforts had almost single-handedly cleaned up \nthe waters in Northern California through his aggressive \nprosecutions.''\n  California lost an environmental champion, and Mr. Beaven's family \nlost a loving and devoted husband and father. His proudest achievement \nwas his family. His wife, Kimi Beaven, recalls, ``He would do anything \nfor his children and spent hour after hour reading to Sonali, playing \nball with John and scuba diving with Chris.''\n  Mr. Beaven was flying back to California to prosecute one more water \npollution case before taking a sabbatical in India where he was to \nvolunteer his services as an environmental lawyer. Alan Beaven was one \nof many heroes on Flight 93 who, aware of the terrorist attacks on the \nWorld Trade Center and the Pentagon, chose to fight back against the \nhijacking terrorists. His voice was recognized by his family on the \ncockpit voice recorder, and his remains were found in the wreckage of \nthe cockpit.\n  His son John perhaps describes Alan Beaven best when he writes, ``His \nlove for simplicity and genuine appreciation for the happiness he held \nwithin was not lost on others; friends would always leave his company \nwith uplifted spirits.''\n  Mr. President, none of us is untouched by the terror of September \n11th, and many Californians were part of each tragic moment of that \ntragic day.

Madam President, I rise today to ask my colleagues \nto join me in paying tribute to a dedicated member of the Montana \nDepartment of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, FWP, as he concludes over 30 \nyears of service to his State and Nation. We are proud that much of \nthis Montanan's working life has been dedicated to serving the citizens \nof and visitors to our great State.\n  Mr. Doug Denler deserves this honor. We owe our gratitude for his \ncontributions to the conservation of Montana's wildlife and natural \nresources, as well as preserving the outdoor heritage in the Rocky \nMountain west.\n  Doug Denler's personal and professional career accomplishments truly \nreflect the values of rural life under the big sky. His loyal service \nwith our military forces, followed by public service in several Montana \nState agencies are a testament to all who find value in outdoor \nexperiences. I would like to take a moment to reflect upon Doug's \ncareer as he embarks on a new phase of life beyond government service.\n  Doug was born and raised in Boise, ID and attended college at Montana \nState University in Bozeman. Following graduation he was commissioned \nas a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army and shortly thereafter received \norders to join a unit deployed to South Viet Nam. During that \nassignment Doug was highly decorated for service in combat, receiving \nthe Air Medal and Bronze Star. Subsequently he continued uniformed \nservice, and having completed 10 years on active duty he then elected \nto resign his commission and move his family to Montana.\n  Doug's first job in State government was as human resource manager \nwith the Department of Administration where he was instrumental in \ncrafting legislation to enable hiring temporary workers in State \ngovernment. His approach for quickly and efficiently engaging short-\nterm workers continues today as a foundation for many State agencies \nwhose missions include part-time and seasonal tasks. He then spent two \nyears at the Department of Highways before being selected in 1989 to be \nthe Human Resource Bureau Chief at FWP.\n  Bringing diverse experience and unbounded enthusiasm to his \nassignment Doug embarked on innovative ventures in pay plans, safety, \ntraining, labor relations, recruitment, and retention. Among his first \nachievements was crafting a comprehensive Policy Manual that is now \nwidely used by FWP managers and is an essential component of new \nemployee orientation.\n  Turning his attention toward safe operating practices, he created an \nFWP statewide safety program that incorporated management oversight, \ndocumentation of mishap statistics and costs, and funding generated by \nsavings from lowered accident rates. Demonstrating leadership ability \nand dedication, Doug volunteered to chair the new safety committee. A \nmeasure of his success is reflected in the fact that during the past \nthree years FWP has twice received Governor's Award recognition for \nsurpassing accident prevention goals.\n  In 1999 Doug took the lead to initiate an Alternative Pay Plan for \nthe Department's employees. This effort required his team to analyze \nmarket data, establish performance standards, initiate agency wide \ncompetencies, and obtain funding. Among the first of such plans \napproved by the Legislature and implemented the next year, the pay plan \nin use at FWP today typifies Doug's tireless efforts to find common \nground and craft sensible solutions for both management and rank and \nfile employees.\n  Over the past year Doug stepped up yet again when asked to take on \nadditional duties following the unexpected retirement of an executive \nmanager. For eight months Doug served as the acting Chief of \nAdministration and Finance. Along with performing his normal duties he \nprovided oversight for a troubled $8 million computer development \nproject, assisted with the preparations for a special session of the \nLegislature, and finalized a $62 million biennium budget.\n  Doug Denler is highly regarded among his peers and the public for his \ndevotion to resource conservation and his unmatched appreciation for \nMontana's hunting and fishing lifestyle. Embracing the FWP mission both \nin and outside the office makes Doug a consummate professional, and his \nretirement will leave a gap in knowledge and ability that FWP will find \ndifficult to replace.\n  It is a great honor for me to present these credentials of Doug \nDenler before the Senate today. It is clear through his many \naccomplishments that Doug\n\n[[Page S10884]]\n\nhas dedicated himself to public service, in and out of uniform, and to \nfurther the many benefits we enjoy as Americans. His actions \nconsistently reflect a true leader who has served with courage and \ncommitment.\n  As Doug departs from public service I ask my colleagues to join with \nme in delivering an appreciative tribute from a grateful State and \nNation, along with our best wishes for a rewarding retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10884-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO REX ROBLEY\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I rise today among my fellow \ncolleagues to honor and pay tribute to Kentucky's last surviving World \nWar I veteran. Of the 84,000 Kentuckians who were sent to fight in \nWorld War I, Rex Robley, 91 years young from Louisville, KY, is \nbelieved to be the only one still alive. This man has sacrificed and \naccomplished so much in just one lifetime. He truly exemplifies the \nAmerican spirit.\n  Monday, we as a Nation came together to celebrate Veterans Day. On \nthis very important day, every American has the opportunity and the \nobligation to thank and honor those who so valiantly fought for our \nfreedoms, rights and liberties in the trenches of France, the beaches \nof Normandy, the jungles of Korea and Vietnam and the deserts of Iraq. \nThese men and women fought so that future generations would be able to \nlive under a blanket of freedom that reaches from coast to coast.\n  Sadly, thousands of these veterans are dying off in large numbers \nevery year. During the 1990s, the number of World War II veterans in \nKentucky decreased by nearly 54,000. The Kentucky Department of Veteran \nAffairs calculates that, on an average day, Kentucky loses 22 military \nveterans, of whom 17 were in World War II. To ensure that this country \ncontinues to build and prosper, we must make a promise to ourselves to \nnever forget the sacrifices these individuals have made. It is their \nmemory that will guide us in the right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10884-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BILL CAPPEL\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I rise today to honor Bill \nCappel of Covington, KY for his years of dedicated and selfless service \nto this nation and to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Yesterday, Mr. \nCappel celebrated his 90th birthday.\n  In honor of this event, city officials in Covington presented Mr. \nCappel with a key to the city, read a proclamation in his honor and \neven provided him with a special police escort as they officially named \nthe Bill Cappel Youth Sports Complex after him.\n  Bill Cappel is one of those rare individuals in life who has the \ninnate ability to put a positive spin on every situation. The only \nthing harder than getting him out in a softball game is getting him to \ntake that permanent smile off his face. As a soldier in World War II, \nnot only did Bill Cappel earn the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star \nfor his courageous military service, he also organized baseball and \nsoftball games for the soldiers while on tours of duty in Africa and \nEurope as a way for the men to escape the darkness that surrounds war. \nIt is this type of service that has led many to think of Bill Cappel as \na saint.\n  In 1933, Mr. Cappel organized a women's softball league in Covington \nas way to get more women involved in the sporting world. Nearly 30 \nyears later, he founded the Covington Major Girls League at Meinken \nField. Three of the teams from the Covington Major Girls League won \nnational championships. Bill learned that when you treat people like \nchampions, they play and act like champions.\n  Throughout his life, Bill Cappel has given much to his country and \nthe people of Northern Kentucky. He has always found a way to give back \nto the local community. In his mind, his actions do not merit any sort \nof special attention. He is simply trying to do for others what they \nhave done for him. Whether it has been as a soldier, umpire, coach, \nplayer or friend, Bill Cappel has managed to make the world around him \na better place for people to live. It truly is amazing how the actions \nof one man could positively affect so many.\n  I believe we all can take something away from the life Bill Cappel \nhas lived. In politics, we each took an oath to serve the people and \nuphold the Constitution of the United States of America. While Mr. \nCappel never swore an oath, he has demonstrated to thousands of people \nhow far the human spirit can travel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10884-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF DOCTOR IRVING GUTTENBERG\n\n Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise today to honor a constituent \nof mine, Dr. Irving Guttenberg, on the occasion of his retirement.\n  For 35 years, Dr. Guttenberg has specialized in ear, nose, and throat \nmedicine in Meriden, CT. Over the course of his career, he treated and \ncured virtually thousands of neighbors in Meriden and surrounding \ncommunities, gradually earning the trust and admiration of an entire \nregion.\n  I had the pleasure of having Dr. Guttenberg's daughter, Lisa \nGuttenberg Weiss, on my Connecticut staff for many years. Last month, I \nwas deeply touched by an affectionate letter Lisa wrote to the Meriden \nRecord Journal describing her father's dedication to his patients and \nchosen profession. I would like that letter printed in the \nCongressional Record following my remarks.\n  I know that the people of Meriden and central Connecticut will truly \nmiss Dr. Guttenberg. Once again, I commend Dr. Guttenberg on the \noccasion of his retirement, and I wish him success in all of his future \nendeavors.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                  An End of an Era for Dr. Guttenberg\n\n       It is with a sense of pride and a few tears that I write to \n     mark the end of an era and the retirement of Dr. Irving \n     Guttenberg, my father. With my mother's help, he opened his \n     medical office, now known as Ear, Nose and Throat \n     Specialists, P.C. in 1967 at 219 West Main Street in Meriden. \n     He officially retired September 30.\n       I imagine he has treated at least half the people in town, \n     not to mention Wallingford and Cheshire. I cannot even guess \n     how many tonsils he has removed or strep throats and sinus \n     infections he has treated. But, I know that he has performed \n     well over 50,000 pressure-equalizing tubes procedures \n     (because he told me so). I also know that he is greatly \n     admired, if not beloved, by his patients. My knowledge comes \n     from the school vacations I spent working in his offices when \n     I would schedule patient appointments, often triple-booking \n     his days because so many patients wanted to see ``Dr. G''. As \n     a young girl and now as an adult in my late thirties, I have \n     seen Dad's patients' come up to him at the movies, at \n     restaurants, at the grocery store, everywhere to thank him \n     for all his good work and kindness. People still come up to \n     me and tell me how great and dedicated and smart my father \n     is. I know and I agree.\n       My father has always taken his responsibilities for his \n     patients seriously. Even after he purchased his first pager \n     and cell phone, it seemed like he would not leave the house \n     if he were ``on call''. Forget about going to the movies. Do \n     not even think about asking him to change his schedule to go \n     away for some occasion. If he was on call, he was staying \n     home, close to the phone and close to the hospital.\n       When I was growing up, my father left early in the morning \n     and returned home relatively late, often eating dinner well \n     after the rest of the family had finished. During weekends \n     Dad had early morning and late afternoon ``rounds'' at \n     Meriden's two hospitals. Sometimes he brought my brother and \n     me with him and we would wait for an eternity in the doctor's \n     lounge or near the nurses' station. (We are rumored to have \n     been wheelchair racers, but there is no proof.) Other times, \n     when we awoke Mom told us that Dad went to the hospital in \n     the middle of the night to operate on someone.\n       Now, after 35 years in practice and after having served as \n     Chief of Surgery and Chief of Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) at \n     WWII Veterans' Memorial Hospital and Chief of ENT at MidState \n     Medical Center and as a clinical instructor at Yale School of \n     Medicine, my father is retiring. I do not know what he will \n     do next. He told me he would sleep for a week and then baby-\n     sit for my kids. I think there is some talk about travel too. \n     Was that Dad or was that Mom? Whatever they do, I hope they \n     both enjoy Dad's retirement. It is well deserved. Best wishes \n     from me and everyone who knows and appreciates you.\n           Your daughter,\n     Lisa Guttenberg Weiss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10884-4", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10884-S10885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BENEFICIARY ACCESS AND MEDICARE PAYMENT EQUITY\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, today I urge the \nSenate to act on the Beneficiary Access and Medicare Payment Equity \npackage before the end of the session. Nebraska's health care providers \nare hurting financially. They need help from Congress to stop these \nMedicare reimbursement cuts or many will not be able to provide \ntreatment to Medicare patients. Our 40 million seniors who depend on \nthe Medicare system for their\n\n[[Page S10885]]\n\nhealth care coverage need to know they have access to quality, \naffordable care. The bill addresses a number of Medicare inequities \nincluding cuts to hospitals, home health care providers, physical \ntherapists, physicians, and skilled nursing facilities.\n  The Nebraska Hospital Association estimates that in this bill \nNebraska hospitals would receive approximately $56 million in \nadditional revenue for one year and $120 million over three years. the \nhospitals in my State need this funding to survive financially.\n  This legislation would have a tremendous impact on Nebraska's \nteaching hospitals. Teaching hospitals receive indirect medical \neducation (IME) payments because they have higher patient care costs \nthan non-teaching hospitals due to the extra costs incurred for \nteaching. The Balanced Budget Act, BBA, of 1997 cut these payments, and \na provision in this bill would provide for additional relief. Nebraska \nhas two academic medical centers--the University of Nebraska Medical \nCenter and Creighton University Medical Center--and both would benefit \nfrom this legislation. Other hospitals in my State would also benefit \nincluding: Alegent Bergan Mercy in Omaha, Alegent Immanuel in Omaha, \nNebraska Methodist in Omaha, BryanLGH Medical Center in Lincoln, St. \nElizabeth Regional Medical Center in Lincoln, Good Samaritan in \nKearney, and St. Francis in Grand Island.\n  The legislation also increases the Federal Medicaid disproportionate \nshare hospital, DSH, allotment in extremely low-DSH States, such as \nNebraska, from 1 percent to 3 percent of program costs. Even though the \nallotment percentage would be tripled, it is still far less than the \nnational average. The DSH program provides relief to safety net \nhospitals that provide critical health care access to 42 million \nuninsured people in our country. Nebraska and 14 other States receive \nfar less funding through the Medicaid DSH program per Medicaid and \nuninsured resident than the rest of the Nation and this lack of funding \nthreatens the viability of many safety net hospitals.\n  A number of other important provisions are included that would help \nNebraska's hospitals including: equalizing the standardized amount for \nrural and other urban hospitals; adjusting the wage index rate; \nincreasing Medicare DSH payments to rural hospitals; extending the hold \nharmless provision for rural hospitals for outpatient services for an \nother year; and improving the Critical Access Hospital program by \nallowing more flexibility in allocating swing and inpatient acute care \nbeds.\n  In addition to providing much-needed relief to hospitals, the bill \nalso eliminates the 15 percent reduction in home health payments. This \ncut would reduce payments to home health care providers in my State by \nnearly $2 million per year. Nebraska providers cannot afford this cut. \nThe legislation also recognizes the additional costs incurred by rural \nhome health care providers and give them an addition 10 percent in \npayments.\n  I am also pleased that the bill eliminates the $1500 outpatient \ntherapy cap for two years. This arbitrary limit discriminates against \nMedicare beneficiaries who desperately need outpatient therapy to help \nthem recuperate from surgery, a stroke, or other medical condition.\n  As I mentioned last month, we also need to rectify the physician \npayment cut. Under current law, Medicare's physician payment rates are \nprojected to fall by 12 percent over the next three years. Nebraska \nphysicians' losses due to the 2003-2005 cuts will total about $63 \nmillion or $17,230 per physician. This comes on top of a 5.4 percent \npayment cut which cost Nebraska doctors a total of $12.9 million or \nabout $3,875 per physician in 2002.\n  I also spoke of the need to help skilled nursing facilities which are \nexperiencing severe financial difficulty. If action isn't taken, \nNebraska's facilities will lose $28..48 per patient per day next year \nfor a total of $10 million.\n  Finally, I have spoken many times about providing fiscal relief to \nour States. This legislation also includes $5 billion in fiscal relief \nto States by increasing the Federal Medicaid matching rate and by \nproviding a temporary social services block grant. This provision, that \nI helped author, would give Governors some needed flexibility in \nassessing the needs of their States. States would be eligible for the \nMedicaid funding increase as long as the eligibility levels they had in \nplace on January 2, 2002 are maintained. Unfortunately, the Nebraska \nLegislature made Medicaid eligibility cuts in the recent special \nsession, and these cuts would prevent our State from receiving the full \nfunding available. However, I crafted a provision that would allow \nNebraska to receive the funding if they reinstate these Medicaid cuts \nin the future.\n  We need to pass this legislation before the session ends. Our \nNation's seniors need to know that they can depend on the Medicare \nsystem for their health care needs. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in addressing these important issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10885-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IDAHO'S TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I rise today to salute a very \nspecial teacher in my State, Patti Perry, who was recently named as \nIdaho's Teacher of the Year.\n  Patti Perry teaches first grade at Skyway Elementary School in Coeur \nd'Alene. She has taught in Coeur d'Alene for 30 years, and there are \nmany people in the community who look back fondly on the lessons they \nlearned from her. In fact, one of her former students said that she has \n``been in my heart since the first day of first grade.'' I'm sure this \nis a sentiment shared by many.\n  I come from a family of teachers, so I know how much a good teacher \ncan affect the life of a student. What that teacher imparts in a \nclassroom can stay with a student for the rest of his or her life. It's \nobvious that Mrs. Perry has had such an impact. She assesses every \nstudent individually and tailors her lessons to them. She is a leader \nin the school and a mentor to other teachers. And, most important of \nall, she inspires her students to strive for their highest possible \nperformance, academically and otherwise.\n  It's not really a surprise that Mrs. Perry won this award. What is \nremarkable, though, is that she's Coeur d'Alene School District's third \nteacher in five years to be named as Idaho's Teacher of the Year. It's \nclear that the Coeur d'Alene District is doing something right. \nKootenai County, which has Coeur d'Alene as its county seat, is one of \nthe fastest growing counties in Idaho, and I suspect this might have \nsomething to do with the outstanding quality of schools in the county. \nI'm very proud of Mrs. Perry, and I'm also very proud of the Coeur \nD'Alene School District. They are both setting a great example for the \nrest of Idaho, and the rest of the Nation, to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10885-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10885-S10886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:04 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 4546) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2003 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes.\n  At 2:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to authorize negotiation of free trade agreements \nwith Turkey, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n      By Mr. GRAMM:\n  S. 3151. A bill to authorize negotiation of free trade agreements \nwith Afghanistan, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nauthorize the President to negotiate free trade agreements with the \ncountries of Turkey and Afghanistan. Trade is a powerful engine in the \npromotion of prosperity and in the strengthening of freedom. The more \nwe promote trade, the more we benefit and the more our trading partners \nbenefit.\n  The legislation builds upon the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority \nAct of 2002, enacted earlier in the year. Within the structure of that \nAct, each of these bills would give the sanction of the Congress to \nundertaking free trade negotiations with Turkey and with Afghanistan. \nThat sanction would remain in place for five years, ample time to \nconclude these important agreements.\n  Turkey has correctly been called the eastern anchor of NATO, an ally \nof the United States across some five decades in the effort to keep the \nworld free. Turkey is a secular nation with a predominantly Muslim \npopulation and historic ties to the United States. For nearly one \nhundred years Turkey has served as an important force for modernization \nin the eastern Mediterranean and central Asian area.\n  Turkey's successes have provided important examples to many of the \nnew nations of the former Soviet union located on the southern border \nof Russia. As these nations map out their future, they do so with \nfrequent reference to the experience of Turkey. A free trade agreement \nwith Turkey would mean that we would be a lasting, positive part of \nthat future, contributing to Turkey's continued growth and democratic \ndevelopment, and influence that would be sure to have a beneficial \neffect on Turkey's neighbors. Such an agreement would operate well in \nlight of our existing free trade agreements with Israel and with \nJordan.\n  Afghanistan is at an historical turning point. What better way to \nrebuild the Afghan economy and set the Afghan people firmly on the road \nto prosperity than with a free trade agreement with the United States?\n  In addition, history has shown the powerful effect of trade and other \neconomic freedoms in creating a stable basis for the growth and \nmaintenance of political freedom. In Germany, Italy, Japan, Taiwan, \nSouth Korea, Chile, and elsewhere, we have seen authoritarian regimes \nreplaced by stable, free societies preceded by the growth of trade and \neconomic freedom. A free trade agreement between the United States and \nAfghanistan can and should be a powerful tool in our efforts to bring \npeace and prosperity to a land that has known little of either.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the two bills be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3150\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A report issue this year by the General Accounting \nOffice concluded that foreign language skills are critical to the \nsuccess of our diplomatic and intelligence agencies and that the \nshortage of skilled personnel has adversely affected American law \nenforcement, intelligence, counter-terrorism, diplomatic and military \nefforts.\n  The end of the Cold War and the rise of terrorism have exacerbated \nthis problem because the most serious shortages involved those \nlanguages found in Asia and the Middle East. In fact, we have received \nwarning signals. For example, the disclosure that intercepts of \nsuspected terrorists were translated long after the events they \ndiscussed had taken place should be viewed with alarm.\n  Even before 9/11, Senator Cochran referred to a ``crisis in federal \nlanguage capabilities'' when the intelligence community disclosed that \nthe United States could be faced with a ``technical surprise'' because \nthousands of foreign scientific papers could not be translated due to \nthe lack of skilled translators.\n  Our governments has experienced this shortage of skilled personnel \ngoing back to the beginning of the Cold War. Intermittent attempts to \nsolve the problem over the years have left us with an accumulation of \npatchwork fixes. As the recent GAO report demonstrates clearly, this \napproach has not succeeded. It is time to take a fresh approach and \nseek a broader, long-term solution.\n  This bill will establish a national program in our academic \ninstitutions that encourages students to pursue critical language \nskills, supports their academic careers and provides a clear employment \npath to Federal agencies. It does so by making maximum use of existing \nacademic programs and facilities with minimal additional resources.\n  Students enrolled in this program would be required to meet certain \nacademic standards for which they would receive reasonable stipends, \nequivalent to those provided under the ROTC program.\n  During the academic summers, under this legislation, participants \nwould receive specialized training at underutilization Federal and \nacademic facilities, instructed by a faculty composed of both Federal \nGovernment and civilian instructors. The participants could also travel \nto overseas posts for so-called ``immersion'' training in foreign \nlanguages and cultures at U.S. diplomatic and military facilities.\n  At the beginning of their senior year, participants would receive \noffers of employment from interests Federal agencies which they must \naccept or reject within 30 days. This would allow their processing to \nbe completed by the time they graduate, allowing them to enter the \nFederal workforce without the current delays attributable to security \nclearances and administrative processing.\n  The program would be embodied in an Institute. This Institute would \nnot\n\n[[Page S10892]]\n\nbe composed of bricks and mortar but of a nationwide enrollment of \nstudents at colleges and universities who would receive specialized \ntraining during their academic summers. The Institute would be run by a \nChairman of the Board, appointed by the President. The Chairman would \nbe supported by a Board composed of representatives from each of the \nparticipating Federal agencies. Staff would be minimal and provided by \nthe participating agencies.\n  Each agency would still be able to set its own qualifications issue \nits own employment offers and maintain its own security requirements. \nBut it could do so in a manner that is competitive with private \nindustry employment opportunities that are available to graduates, \nafter an opportunity to evaluate potential employees throughout the \ncourse of their involvement in the Institute and with the added benefit \nof the financial incentive that the Institute would provide.\n  This program will broaden the pool of available candidates for \nFederal employment, allow Federal agencies to compete efficiently for \nthese skilled language specialists and make Federal employment more \nattractive.\n  So far, we have avoided serious consequences from the lack of \nlanguage skills in the Federal Government. This bill constitutes a new \napproach to this problem. It is long overdue and desperately needed. I \nask that each of my colleagues give it prompt and serious \nconsideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3155\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Language Mastery Support Act \n     of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish a program of study \n     and overseas training in critical foreign languages and \n     cultures, including the establishment of a Foreign Language \n     and Cultural Institute, in order to--\n       (1) increase in Federal Government service the number of \n     persons possessing critical skills that are in short supply;\n       (2) create a pool of prospective candidates for employment \n     in those agencies of the Federal Government that rely on \n     significant levels of overseas assignments;\n       (3) provide monetary and employment incentives for \n     candidates to participate in the program;\n       (4) facilitate the identification of potential Federal \n     Government employees with the pool of prospective candidates;\n       (5) provide additional opportunities for candidate \n     development and evaluation;\n       (6) substantially shorten the delay between identification \n     of a desirable candidate and entry upon service by the \n     candidate;\n       (7) minimize the necessity for training during the initial \n     period of employment;\n       (8) provide for ``cross-fertilization'' through the \n     incorporation of both private sector and Government \n     instructors in the faculty of the Institute;\n       (9) reduce the underutilization of existing Government and \n     educational facilities; and\n       (10) achieve these objectives for a minimal cost, that \n     would be partially offset by a reduction in the amount of \n     initial training provided by participating agencies for new \n     employees.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 157\n\n       Whereas there are numerous cases in which citizens of the \n     United States are prevented from leaving Saudi Arabia against \n     their will or in violation of United States law;\n       Whereas Amjad Radwan and Rasheed Radwan, 2 United States \n     citizens, were prevented from leaving Saudi Arabia by their \n     Saudi-national father in 1985;\n       Whereas Monica Stowers, the mother of Amjad Radwan and \n     Rasheed Radwan and a United States citizen, traveled to Saudi \n     Arabia in November 1990 and heard directly from her children \n     of the physical and sexual abuse they had endured there;\n       Whereas upon learning of the abuse, Ms. Stowers brought her \n     children to the United States Embassy in Riyadh, displayed \n     their United States passports, and sought the protection of \n     the Embassy and assistance in returning home to the United \n     States;\n       Whereas personnel from the Department of State told Ms. \n     Stowers and her children that\n\n[[Page S10894]]\n\n     the Embassy was ``not a hotel'' and urged them to leave;\n       Whereas personnel from the Department of State informed Ms. \n     Stowers' ex-husband, without her permission and in total \n     disregard for her safety, that she and her children were in \n     the Embassy;\n       Whereas personnel from the Department of State ordered \n     United States Marines to physically eject Ms. Stowers and her \n     children from the Embassy;\n       Whereas following her ejection, Ms. Stowers was arrested \n     for refusing to leave Saudi Arabia without her children and \n     sent to a women's prison;\n       Whereas the current Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Robert W. \n     Jordan, has pledged that no United States citizen will be \n     similarly removed from the Embassy while he is ambassador;\n       Whereas American women in Saudi Arabia have directly \n     informed Members of Congress of the physical abuse inflicted \n     upon them by their Saudi husbands, the lack of support or \n     protection for battered women in Saudi society, and the \n     inability to leave Saudi Arabia with their children unless \n     their husbands give permission;\n       Whereas these women and personnel from the Department of \n     State estimate that there are hundreds of abused American \n     women in Saudi Arabia who do not report their cases due to \n     fear and hopelessness;\n       Whereas many of these abused American women do not attempt \n     to escape for fear that failure would result in death or \n     serious bodily injury to them and their children;\n       Whereas abused American women in Saudi Arabia are \n     discouraged from seeking assistance from the United States \n     Embassy or consulate in escaping with their children and are \n     told that nothing can be done for them;\n       Whereas many of these women and their children are denied \n     religious freedoms and other basic human rights while \n     detained in Saudi Arabia;\n       Whereas a primary purpose of United States diplomatic \n     missions is to protect the interests of United States \n     citizens;\n       Whereas international law recognizes certain privileges and \n     immunities for United States embassies, ambassadors' \n     residences, and consulates; and\n       Whereas such privileges and immunities enable United States \n     diplomatic personnel to provide sanctuary to United States \n     citizens abroad: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that United \n     States diplomatic and counselor missions should provide the \n     full and complete protection of the United States to citizens \n     of the United States who--\n       (1) are living or traveling abroad;\n       (2) are victims of international child abduction, domestic \n     violence, or sexual abuse; and\n       (3) seek sanctuary in a United States diplomatic or \n     counselor mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10894-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4898.

The substantive law for \n     decision in any such action shall be derived from the law, \n     including choice of law principles, of the State in which \n     such acts of terrorism occurred, unless such law is \n     inconsistent with or preempted by Federal law. Such Federal \n     cause of action shall be brought only for claims for injuries \n     that are proximately caused by sellers that provide qualified \n     anti-terrorism technology to Federal and non-Federal \n     government customers.\n       (2) Jurisdiction.--Such appropriate district court of the \n     United States shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction \n     over all actions for any claim for loss of property, personal \n     injury, or death arising out of, relating to, or resulting \n     from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism \n     technologies have been deployed in defense against or \n     response or recovery from such act and such claims result or \n     may result in loss to the Seller.\n       (b) Special Rules.--In an action brought under this section \n     for damages the following provisions apply:\n       (1) Punitive damages.--No punitive damages intended to \n     punish or deter, exemplary damages, or other damages not \n     intended to compensate a plaintiff for actual losses may be \n     awarded, nor shall any party be liable for interest prior to \n     the judgment.\n       (2) Noneconomic damages.--\n       (A) In general.--Noneconomic damages may be awarded against \n     a defendant only in an amount directly proportional to the \n     percentage of responsibility of such defendant for the harm \n     to the plaintiff, and no plaintiff may recover noneconomic \n     damages unless the plaintiff suffered physical harm.\n       (B) Definition.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term \n     ``noneconomic damages'' means damages for losses for physical \n     and emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical \n     impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment \n     of life, loss of society and companionship, loss of \n     consortium, hedonic damages, injury to reputation, and any \n     other nonpecuniary losses.\n       (c) Collateral Sources.--Any recovery by a plaintiff in an \n     action under this section shall be reduced by the amount of \n     collateral source compensation, if any, that the plaintiff \n     has received or is entitled to receive as a result of such \n     acts of terrorism that result or may result in loss to the \n     Seller.\n       (d) Government Contractor Defense.--\n       (1) In general.--Should a product liability or other \n     lawsuit be filed for claims arising out of, relating to, or \n     resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-\n     terrorism technologies approved by the Secretary, as provided \n     in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, have been \n     deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such \n     act and such claims result or may result in loss to the \n     Seller, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the \n     government contractor defense applies in such lawsuit. This \n     presumption shall only be overcome by evidence showing that \n     the Seller acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct in \n     submitting information to the Secretary during the course of \n     the Secretary's consideration of such technology under this \n     subsection. This presumption of the government contractor \n     defense shall apply regardless of whether the claim against \n     the Seller arises from a sale of the product to Federal \n     Government or non-Federal Government customers.\n       (2) Exclusive responsibility.--The Secretary will be \n     exclusively responsible for the review and approval of anti-\n     terrorism technology for purposes of establishing a \n     government contractor defense in any product liability \n     lawsuit for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting \n     from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism \n     technologies approved by the Secretary, as provided in this \n     paragraph and paragraph (3),\n\n[[Page S10926]]\n\n     have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery \n     from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to \n     the Seller. Upon the Seller's submission to the Secretary for \n     approval of anti-terrorism technology, the Secretary will \n     conduct a comprehensive review of the design of such \n     technology and determine whether it will perform as intended, \n     conforms to the Seller's specifications, and is safe for use \n     as intended. The Seller will conduct safety and hazard \n     analyses on such technology and will supply the Secretary \n     with all such information.\n       (3) Certificate.--For anti-terrorism technology reviewed \n     and approved by the Secretary, the Secretary will issue a \n     certificate of conformance to the Seller and place the anti-\n     terrorism technology on an Approved Product List for Homeland \n     Security.\n       (e) Exclusion.--Nothing in this section shall in any way \n     limit the ability of any person to seek any form of recovery \n     from any person, government, or other entity that--\n       (1) attempts to commit, knowingly participates in, aids and \n     abets, or commits any act of terrorism, or any criminal act \n     related to or resulting from such act of terrorism; or\n       (2) participates in a conspiracy to commit any such act of \n     terrorism or any such criminal act.\n\n     SEC. 864.

FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING CENTER.\n\n       (a) In General.--The transfer of an authority or an agency \n     under this Act to the Department of Homeland Security does \n     not affect training agreements already entered into with the \n     Federal Law Enforcement Training Center with respect to the \n     training of personnel to carry out that authority or the \n     duties of that transferred agency.\n       (b) Continuity of Operations.--All activities of the \n     Federal Law Enforcement Training Center transferred to the \n     Department of Homeland Security under this Act shall continue \n     to be carried out at the locations such activities were \n     carried out before such transfer.\n\n     SEC. 885.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REAFFIRMING THE CONTINUED \n                   IMPORTANCE AND APPLICABILITY OF THE POSSE \n                   COMITATUS ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Section 1385 of title 18, United States Code (commonly \n     known as the ``Posse Comitatus Act''), prohibits the use of \n     the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to execute the laws \n     except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized \n     by the Constitution or Act of Congress.\n       (2) Enacted in 1878, the Posse Comitatus Act was expressly \n     intended to prevent United States Marshals, on their own \n     initiative, from calling on the Army for assistance in \n     enforcing Federal law.\n       (3) The Posse Comitatus Act has served the Nation well in \n     limiting the use of the Armed Forces to enforce the law.\n       (4) Nevertheless, by its express terms, the Posse Comitatus \n     Act is not a complete barrier to the use of the Armed Forces \n     for a range of domestic purposes, including law enforcement \n     functions, when the use of the Armed Forces is authorized by \n     Act of Congress or the President determines that the use of \n     the Armed Forces is required to fulfill the President's \n     obligations under the Constitution to respond promptly in \n     time of war, insurrection, or other serious emergency.\n       (5) Existing laws, including chapter 15 of title 10, United \n     States Code (commonly known as the ``Insurrection Act''), and \n     the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), grant the President \n     broad powers that may be invoked in the event of domestic \n     emergencies, including an attack against the Nation using \n     weapons of mass destruction, and these laws specifically \n     authorize the President to use the Armed Forces to help \n     restore public order.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress reaffirms the continued \n     importance of section 1385 of title 18, United States Code, \n     and it is the sense of Congress that nothing in this Act \n     should be construed to alter the applicability of such \n     section to any use of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus \n     to execute the laws.\n\n     SEC. 887.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the \n     ``Homeland Security Information Sharing Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Government is required by the Constitution \n     to provide for the common defense, which includes terrorist \n     attack.\n       (2) The Federal Government relies on State and local \n     personnel to protect against terrorist attack.\n       (3) The Federal Government collects, creates, manages, and \n     protects classified and sensitive but unclassified \n     information to enhance homeland security.\n       (4) Some homeland security information is needed by the \n     State and local personnel to prevent and prepare for \n     terrorist attack.\n       (5) The needs of State and local personnel to have access \n     to relevant homeland security information to combat terrorism \n     must be reconciled with the need to preserve the protected \n     status of such information and to protect the sources and \n     methods used to acquire such information.\n       (6) Granting security clearances to certain State and local \n     personnel is one way to facilitate the sharing of information \n     regarding specific terrorist threats among Federal, State, \n     and local levels of government.\n       (7) Methods exist to declassify, redact, or otherwise adapt \n     classified information so it may be shared with State and \n     local personnel without the need for granting additional \n     security clearances.\n       (8) State and local personnel have capabilities and \n     opportunities to gather information on suspicious activities \n     and terrorist threats not possessed by Federal agencies.\n       (9) The Federal Government and State and local governments \n     and agencies in other jurisdictions may benefit from such \n     information.\n       (10) Federal, State, and local governments and \n     intelligence, law enforcement, and other emergency \n     preparation and response agencies must act in partnership to \n     maximize the benefits of information gathering and analysis \n     to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.\n       (11) Information systems, including the National Law \n     Enforcement Telecommunications System and the Terrorist \n     Threat Warning System, have been established for rapid \n     sharing of classified and sensitive but unclassified \n     information among Federal, State, and local entities.\n       (12) Increased efforts to share homeland security \n     information should avoid duplicating existing information \n     systems.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Federal, State, and local entities should share homeland \n     security information to the maximum extent practicable, with \n     special emphasis on hard-to-reach urban and rural \n     communities.\n\n     SEC. 892. FACILITATING HOMELAND SECURITY INFORMATION SHARING \n                   PROCEDURES.\n\n       (a) Procedures for Determining Extent of Sharing of \n     Homeland Security Information.--\n       (1) The President shall prescribe and implement procedures \n     under which relevant Federal agencies--\n       (A) share relevant and appropriate homeland security \n     information with other Federal agencies, including the \n     Department, and appropriate State and local personnel;\n       (B) identify and safeguard homeland security information \n     that is sensitive but unclassified; and\n       (C) to the extent such information is in classified form, \n     determine whether, how, and to what extent to remove \n     classified information, as appropriate, and with which such \n     personnel it may be shared after such information is removed.\n       (2) The President shall ensure that such procedures apply \n     to all agencies of the Federal Government.\n       (3) Such procedures shall not change the substantive \n     requirements for the classification and safeguarding of \n     classified information.\n       (4) Such procedures shall not change the requirements and \n     authorities to protect sources and methods.\n       (b) Procedures for Sharing of Homeland Security \n     Information.--\n       (1) Under procedures prescribed by the President, all \n     appropriate agencies, including the intelligence community, \n     shall, through information sharing systems, share homeland \n     security information with Federal agencies and appropriate \n     State and local personnel to the extent such information may \n     be shared, as determined in accordance with subsection (a), \n     together with assessments of the credibility of such \n     information.\n       (2) Each information sharing system through which \n     information is shared under paragraph (1) shall--\n       (A) have the capability to transmit unclassified or \n     classified information, though the procedures and recipients \n     for each capability may differ;\n       (B) have the capability to restrict delivery of information \n     to specified subgroups by geographic location, type of \n     organization, position of a recipient within an organization, \n     or a recipient's need to know such information;\n       (C) be configured to allow the efficient and effective \n     sharing of information;

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the World Wide Web presents a stimulating and \n     entertaining opportunity for children to learn, grow, and \n     develop educationally and intellectually;\n       (2) Internet technology also makes available an extensive \n     amount of information that is harmful to children, as studies \n     indicate that a significant portion of all material available \n     on the Internet is related to pornography;\n       (3) young children, when trying to use the World Wide Web \n     for positive purposes, are often presented--either mistakenly \n     or intentionally--with material that is inappropriate for \n     their age, which can be extremely frustrating for children, \n     parents, and educators;\n       (4) exposure of children to material that is inappropriate \n     for them, including pornography, can distort the education \n     and development of the Nation's youth and represents a \n     serious harm to American families that can lead to a host of \n     other problems for children, including appropriate use of \n     chat rooms, physical molestation, harassment, and legal and \n     financial difficulties;\n       (5) young boys and girls, older teens, troubled youth, \n     frequent Internet users, chat room participants, online risk \n     takers, and those who communicate online with strangers are \n     at greater risk for receiving unwanted sexual solication on \n     the Internet;\n       (6) studies have shown that 19 percent of youth (ages 10 to \n     17) who used the Internet regularly were the targets of \n     unwanted sexual solicitation, but less than 10 percent of the \n     solicitations were reported to the police;\n       (7) children who come across illegal content should report \n     it to the congressionally authorized CyberTipline, an online \n     mechanism developed by the National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children, for citizens to report sexual crimes \n     against children;\n       (8) the CyberTipline has received more than 64,400 reports, \n     including reports of child pornography, online enticement for \n     sexual acts, child molestation (outside the family), and \n     child prostitution;\n       (9) although the computer software and hardware industries, \n     and other related industries, have developed innovative ways \n     to help parents and educators restrict material that is \n     harmful to minors through parental control protections and \n     self-regulation, to date such efforts have not provided a \n     national solution to the problem of minors accessing harmful \n     material on the World Wide Web;\n       (10) the creation of a ``green-light'' area within the \n     United States country code Internet domain, that will contain \n     only content that is appropriate for children under the age \n     of 13, is analogous to the creation of a children's section \n     within a library and will promote the positive experiences of \n     children and families in the United States; and\n       (11) while custody, care, and nurture of the child reside \n     first with the parent, the protection of the physical and \n     psychological well-being of minors by shielding them from \n     material that is harmful to them is a compelling governmental \n     interest.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to facilitate the creation of a second-level domain \n     within the United States country code Internet domain for the \n     location of material that is suitable for minors and not \n     harmful to minors; and\n       (2) to ensure that the National Telecommunications and \n     Information Administration oversees the creation of such a \n     second-level domain and ensures the effective and efficient \n     establishment and operation of the new domain.\n\n     SEC. 3. NTIA AUTHORITY.\n\n       Section 103(b)(3) of the National Telecommunications and \n     Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C \n     902(b)(3)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) shall assign to the NTIA responsibility for providing \n     for the establishment, and overseeing operation, of a second-\n     level Internet domain within the United States country code \n     domain in accordance with section 157.''.\n\n     SEC. 4 CHILD-FRIENDLY SECOND-LEVEL INTERNET DOMAIN.\n\n       The National Telecommunications and Information \n     Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) is \n     amended in part C by adding at the end the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``SEC. 157.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee substitute amendment be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be \nread the third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate; that any \nstatements related thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 4073), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10964-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10964-S10966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DOT KIDS IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFICIENCY ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommerce Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n3833 and the Senate proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3833) to facilitate the creation of a new \n     second-level Internet domain within the United States country \n     code domain that will be a haven for material that promotes \n     positive experiences for children and families using the \n     Internet, provides a safe online environment for children, \n     and helps to prevent children from being exposed to harmful \n     material on the Internet, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise in support of H.R. 3833, the Dot \nKids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002. Earlier this year \nSenator Ensign and I introduced the companion legislation, S. 2537, in \nthe Senate and today I am pleased to offer an amendment in the nature \nof a substitute along with my colleagues Senators Ensign, Hollings, and \nAllen.\n  As anyone who has surfed online knows, the development of the \nInternet has been a mixed blessing. On the one hand the Internet has \nbrought enormous benefits to adults and children alike as it gives us \nnew options for reading the news, researching school\n\n[[Page S10965]]\n\npapers, shopping, conducting business, and communicating with each \nother. But, on the other hand, the Internet also poses great risks to \nour children because there is no perfect way to protect them from the \nmountains of material that is inappropriate for their eyes.\n  Just after we had introduced this bill in the Senate a seventh grade \ngirl at Erik Ramstad Middle School in North Dakota reported she had \nbeen solicited for a sexual encounter online. In a school assembly the \nsame day 30 other students revealed that they have been threatened \nonline.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has charted \n5,700 reported cases of online enticement in the past four years, and \nthose are only cases that were intercepted by parents. And while there \nis not yet any way to compile Federal, State, and local cases involving \nsex, children, and the Internet, experts estimate that there are 4,000-\n5,000 each year.\n  The most recent study available ``Online Victimization: A Report on \nthe Nation's Youth'' found that ``almost one out of five young people \nwho use the Internet regularly were exposed to unwanted sexual \nsolicitations or approaches'' and ``twenty-five percent had been \nexposed to unwanted online pornography'' in the previous year.\n  This is a frightening situation. Computers have become an open door \nfor predators into the homes of children. It is necessary to create a \nsafe haven online for children to surf.\n  Today we have before us a bill called the Dot Kids Implementation and \nEfficiency Act that will help this situation by creating a safe haven \non the Internet for kids.\n  Introduced in the Senate by myself and Senator Ensign, after it was \nsuccessfully shepherded through the House by Representatives Shimkus, \nUpton, and Markey, the idea behind the ``dot kids'' domain is very \nsimple--to create a space on the web that can be a cyber-sanctuary for \nkids. A place where parents and kids can be confident that every site \non the ``dot-kids'' domain contains materials that are suitable for \nchildren under the age of thirteen.\n  The bill calls for the creation of a sub-domain under our Nation's \ncountry code ``.us'' called ``.kids.us'' which will only host content \nthat is age appropriate for children. A number of safeguards were also \nput in this bill. ``Dot-kids-dot-us'' will be monitored for content and \nsafety; and should objectionable material appear, it will be taken down \nimmediately.\n  One of those safeguards is a restriction on peer-to-peer \ncommunication unless the entity hosting the site certifies that it will \nbe done safely. And further, hyperlinks, which would take children out \nof the safe ``dot-kids'' domain are expressly prohibited to help insure \nthat parents can be confident that when their children visit sites in \n``dot-kids'' they will stay within the dot-kids domain.\n  Last October the Department of Commerce awarded the contract to \nhandle the management and commercialization of the ``dot-us'' domain. \nAnd while this bill is careful to not change the terms of the existing \ncontract it would condition the next contract on the creation of the \n``dot-kids-dot-us'' domain.\n  So, under this bill, participation in ``dot-kids'' would be \ncompletely voluntary. Not only will whomever accepts the next contract \nknow what they will be getting into, parents will choose to use it, and \nwebsite operators will choose to be located within it.\n  The only requirement will be that site operators on the ``dot-kids'' \ndomain agree to keep their sites full of material that is suitable for \nminors. Personally, I think the idea of using our country's Top-Level-\nDomain to create a cyber-sanctuary for children makes a great deal of \nsense and I want to thank all of my colleagues and the many \nstakeholders who have been involved in this legislation for all their \nhard work and cooperation in making this bill a reality today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Dot Kids Implementation and \nEfficiency Act.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. \n3833, the Dot Kids bill of 2002. Senator Dorgan and I introduced this \nbipartisan bill earlier this year to protect children on the Internet, \nand I am gratified that the Senate will act on it today.\n  It is estimated today that over 140 million Americans use the \nInternet, many of them children. Most schools are equipped with \ncomputers, where our children learn to navigate the Internet; in most \ncases children do so with better skill than parents. No longer do our \nchildren have to go to the library and sift through voluminous card \ncatalogues for their research projects. No longer do our children need \nto be in school to communicate with their teachers and fellow \nclassmates--they can do it from home by using e-mail and instant \nmessaging. Families simply need a computer with an Internet connection \nto provide children with access to a greater breadth of information \nthan the Library of Congress. The educational opportunities are \nlimitless.\n  However, the Internet can also be used as a tool for evil. Many young \nchildren have tragically fallen victim to on-line predators. They have \nbeen stalked by pedophiles masquerading as other children. Many more \nyoung children on the Internet are routinely exposed to graphic \nviolence, drugs and inappropriate sexual content despite parents' \nefforts at restricting such content.\n  Congress first acted to protect children on the Internet in 1996 with \npassage of the Communications Decency Act, CDA. This legislation \ncriminalized engaging in indecent or patently offensive speech on \ncomputer networks if the speech could be viewed by anyone 18 years of \nage or younger, but it did not survive constitutional challenges. The \nU.S. Supreme Court held in Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union that \nthe CDA violated First Amendment free-speech protections. Congress \nsubsequently responded in 1998 with passage of the Children's Online \nProtection Act, COPA, legislation that prohibited communication of \nmaterial that is harmful to minors on for-profit websites. The U.S. \nSupreme Court, however, in American Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, \nupheld an injunction by U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on \nconstitutional grounds and remanded the case for further review.\n  Another attempt was made to strike the careful balance between the \nfirst amendment and protecting children on the Internet with passage of \nthe Children's Internet Protection Act of 2000, CIPA. This legislation \nrequired schools and libraries that receive Federal funding to install \nfiltering software to block from minors Internet content that contains \nchild pornography, or other obscene and indecent material that is \nharmful to minors. Moreover, this legislation required federally funded \nlibraries to block adults from accessing websites containing obscene \nmaterial or child pornography. However, the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania unanimously held in American Library \nAssociation v. United States that CIPA was unconstitutional.\n  The bill before us today represents the most recent effort by \nCongress to craft legislation that can both protect children on the \nInternet and withstand constitutional scrutiny.\n  The Dot Kids bill establishes a children's section of the Internet, \nmuch like a children's section of the library, where children will be \nsafe from pedophiles, pornography, and violence. We worked to craft the \nDot Kids bill to withstand first amendment challenges by not imposing a \nburden on free speech to adults; the use of the Dot Kids subdomain is \ncompletely voluntary. As such, it recognizes and protects the rights of \nthose who wish to view content not suitable for minors outside of the \nDot Kids subdomain. Content within the Dot Kids subdomain must be \nsuitable for children under 13 years of age. Dot Kids also protects \nchildren from accessing websites outside the Dot Kids subdomain or \nengaging in uncertified interactive services. This is a major victory \nfor children and families. Chat rooms and instant messaging is a key \ncomponent in allowing pedophiles to stalk children over the Internet. \nLiability protection was also provided for the domain administrator by \nutilizing the ``Good Samaritan'' provision in the Communications Act of \n1934. This provision will ensure that the Dot Kids administrator will \nnot be held liable for actions voluntarily taken in good faith to \nrestrict access to, or availability of, obscene, harassing, violent or \nother objectionable material.\n\n[[Page S10966]]\n\n  I am pleased that the Family Research Council, the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children, the American Center for Law and \nJustice, a Safer America for Everyone, SAFE, and the National Law \nCenter for Children and Families have joined our effort in supporting \nthis proposal.\n  The U.S. House of Representatives previously passed this measure by \nan overwhelming majority vote with the hard work of many dedicated \nMembers of Congress including Congressman Shimkus, Congressman Tauzin, \nCongressman Upton, Congressman Markey and Congressman Dingell.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nsubstitute amendment to H.R. 3833, the Dot Kids Implementation and \nEfficiency Act of 2002. I am proud to co-sponsor this amendment with \nSenators Dorgan, Ensign, and Allen. This bipartisan legislation is a \nresult of compromise and hard work by interested parties including \nSenators Dorgan, Ensign, Allen, and McCain. I also want to thank \nRepresentatives Shimkus, Markey, and Upton for their efforts in the \nHouse on the companion legislation. They have all demonstrated their \ncommitment to making the Internet safe for children.\n  In short, H.R. 3833 will create a safe haven for children on the \nInternet. It creates a domain designated strictly for minors--\n``.kids.us''. This new domain will allow parents to be confident that \ntheir child can experience the Internet, at least in part, without \nbeing exposed to objectionable material. Only content producers who can \nmeet the standard of providing material suitable for minors will be \nallowed to register a .kids domain.\n  Really, this bill is just a next step of sorts for me. After all, I \nhave been a strong advocate for a safe harbor for television to ensure \nthat children are protected from objectionable material. I am happy to \nsee that we are now able to extend such protections online, ensuring \nthat children can safely surf the Internet without being bombarded with \nimages of sex, violence, and drugs or being lured by child predators.\n  I am pleased that we have been able to reach an agreeable compromise \non this bill and look forward to working with the Department of \nCommerce and the administrator for the U.S country code domain to \nimplement this legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Senators Dorgan, Ensign, Hollings, and Allen have a \nsubstitute amendment at the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be considered and agreed to and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; that the bill, as amended, be read three times and \npassed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that \nany statements relating thereto be printed in the Record, without \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4903) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (H.R. 3833), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/13/senate-section/article/S10966-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10966-S10967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION TO ENHANCE SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommerce Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n3609 and the Senate proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3609) to amend title 49, to enhance the \n     security and safety of pipelines.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, Congressional action to send \ncomprehensive pipeline safety legislation to the President is long \noverdue. The Senate has worked long and hard during both the 106th and \nthe 107th Congresses on this important issue and we should not let any \nmore time pass without taking needed action to improve pipeline safety. \nI am hopeful we will finally achieve final passage on this issue before \nadjournment.\n  The Office of Pipeline Safety, OPS, within the Department of \nTransportation's Research and Special Programs Administration, RSPA, \noversees the transportation of about 65 percent of the petroleum and \nmost of the natural gas transported in the United States. OPS regulates \nthe day-to-day safety of 3,000 gas pipeline operators with more than \n1.6 million miles of pipeline. It also regulates more than 200 \nhazardous liquid operators with 155,000 miles of pipelines. Given the \nimmense array of pipelines that traverse our nation, reauthorization of \nour pipeline safety programs is critical to the safety and security of \nthousands of communities and millions of Americans nationwide.\n  As my colleagues know, the Senate has approved pipeline safety \nlegislation three times in the last three years. Twice we passed stand \nalone bills, in 2000 and again in 2001. Beginning in the 106th \nCongress, we worked on a bipartisan basis to develop and approve \nlegislation to promote both public and environmental safety by \nreauthorizing and strengthening our Federal pipeline safety programs \nwhich expired in September 2000. In particular, the efforts of Senators \nSlade Gorton and Patty Murray were instrumental to the Senate's efforts \nto address this important safety issue.\n  In our protracted effort to enact pipeline safety legislation--the \nHouse had not approved its version of a related measure--we resorted to \nadding the pipeline safety bill to the Energy bill during its floor \nconsideration last March. Subsequently, the House approved its pipeline \nsafety legislation in July. While the House-passed energy bill did not \ninclude pipeline safety provisions, the House agreed to try to reach a \nconsensus on the important issue in the context of the energy \nconference. As a result, the measure before us today is the sound, pro-\nsafety agreement that was achieved during the energy conference \ndeliberations.\n  The members of the energy conference are to be commended for their \ncommitment to this important issue. They developed a consensus pipeline \nsafety title that includes the best provisions from both the Senate- \nand House-passed bills. Although I did not serve as a formal member of \nthat conference, we shared a goal of enacting comprehensive legislation \nto promote pipeline safety for the public, the environment, and the \neconomy.\n  I want to commend Representatives Billy Tauzin, John Dingell, and Don \nYoung and Senators Jeff Bingaman and Frank Murkowski for their \nleadership and hard work on this issue and their courtesies to ensure \nthe Senate authorizing committee was fully consulted during the \nprocess. Given that a consensus on a comprehensive energy package will \nnot be achieved during this Congress, it is time to move forward and \napprove the agreement that was reached regarding pipeline safety.\n  In large part, the legislation before us is the result of several \ntragic pipeline accidents that have occurred in recent years. Since \n1999, pipeline accidents have resulted in 78 fatalities. In June 1999, \na fatal accident occurred in Bellingham, Washington, when gasoline \nleaked from an underground pipeline and was subsequently ignited. That \naccident resulted in three deaths, a number of injuries, and severe \nenvironmental damage to the area. On August 19, 2000, a natural gas \ntransmission line ruptured in Carlsbad, New Mexico, killing 12 members \nof two families. These were two very serious accidents and they helped \nspur the Senate's action to address identified safety shortcomings.\n  As I mentioned, the Senate has worked at length to improve pipeline \nsafety and reduce the risk of future accidents. During the last \nCongress, with the assistance of a bipartisan group of Senators, the \nSenate passed the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000. Since the \nHouse failed to approve pipeline safety legislation, we were never able \nto send a measure to the President.\n  When the 107th Congress convened, one of the first legislative \nactions taken by the Senate was to consider and pass S. 235, the \nPipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2001, a measure nearly identical to \nwhat we passed in the prior Congress. Early attention by the Senate \ndemonstrated our firm commitment to improving pipeline safety. Although \nit has taken far longer than I\n\n[[Page S10967]]\n\nwould have hoped, it is important that we are taking this action today \nas we work to finish our legislative activities for the year.\n  Despite the tragic accidents I highlighted earlier, the safety record \nof the pipeline industry has generally improved significantly and \ncompares favorably to other forms of transportation. According to the \nDepartment of Transportation, pipeline related incidents dropped nearly \n80 percent between 1975 and 1998, and the loss of product due to \naccidental ruptures has been cut in half. From 1989 through 2001, \npipeline accidents resulted in about 24 fatalities per year, far fewer \nthan the number of fatal accidents experienced among other modes of \ntransportation. But this record must not be used as an excuse for \ninaction on legislation to strengthen pipeline safety.\n  The pipeline safety program expired more than two years ago. It is \nessential that the Congress take final action on this critical public \nand environmental safety issue. This legislation reauthorizes and \nstrengthens Federal pipeline safety programs, providing additional \nfunding for safety enforcement and research and development efforts. It \nalso provides for increased State oversight authority and facilitates \ngreater public education efforts at the local community level.\n  This pending pipeline safety legislation includes many important \nprovisions. I urge my colleagues to support final passage of this \ncritical safety improvement legislation.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I rise in support of H.R. 3609, the \nPipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, which will improve the safety \nand security of our Nation's pipeline systems through important reforms \nwithin our Federal safety regulatory program. This idea is not new. The \nSenate passed this legislation in the 106th Congress, and again in \nFebruary 2001 as one of the first orders of business of the 107th \nCongress. The Senate also passed the same language as part of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2002. This bill is the product of good-faith \ncompromise over three years of work, including compromise with the \nHouse of Representatives, and I ask my colleagues to join me in its \nsupport.\n  Both liquid and natural gas pipelines provide transportation of vital \nenergy resources to many parts of our country. In my State, pipelines \nsupport what was recently determined to be a $92 billion oil and gas \nindustry. Louisiana is the third leading producer of natural gas and \nfourth leading producer of crude oil in the country. These products \nmust be transported to the rest of the country for consumption, and \npipelines are a key part of this infrastructure. In Louisiana alone, \nthere are over 40,000 miles of gas pipelines, some of which pass \nthrough towns, residential areas, schools, churches, and other high-\nconsequence areas. Oil and other product pipelines also number in the \nthousands of miles in my State.\n  In recent years, we have experienced at least two major pipeline \naccidents: one in Bellingham, WA, and the other near Carlsbad, NM. I am \ndeeply sympathetic to the families of the victims of these tragedies. \nNothing can possibly replace their losses. What we have endeavored to \ndo here is take steps to ensure that we as a government address the \nrisks of such accidents in the best possible manner. I think that this \nlegislation will increase the tools available to the Secretary of \nTransportation to ensure that our pipeline system is as safe as \npossible. I would ask that the Secretary use the tools that we provide \nto ensure the aggressive oversight of pipeline safety practices, and \ninvolve and protect the affected communities to the greatest possible \nextent.\n  Passage of this bill will help to ensure the safety and security of \nnatural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines and will take strides to \nincrease the safety of our network of oil and natural gas pipelines. I \nappreciate the considerable number of hours that went into creating \nthis bill by all of the parties. I am also satisfied with the spirit of \ncompromise that accompanied the parties' diligent efforts. As a result \nof their cooperative work we have a bill that reaffirms our efforts to \nregulate gas and hazardous liquid pipelines safety and effectively \nwithout interfering with the pipeline gas and hazardous liquid \npipelines safely and effectively without interfering with the pipeline \noperators' and owners' ability to provide service to our Nation and \nwithout compromising national security.\n  While there were many who worked arduously to ensure passage of \nlegislation in this area, Senator Murray, Senator Bingaman, and Senator \nMcCain should be recognized for their important contributions. Senator \nMurray vigorously pursued changes to increase the level of safety and \npublic participation in pipeline safety, and she worked closely with \nother Commerce Committee members to ensure a reasonable and fair \ncompromise. Senator Bingaman was instrumental in helping bolster the \nbill's provisions on research and development. We also added provisions \nhe authored to focus our research on progressive areas that will help \nus develop better systems of early detection, and to ensure that we can \navoid accidents such as those that occurred in Bellingham, WA, and near \nCarlsbad, NM. Senator McCain is to be recognized for his continuing \nefforts to get this legislation passed. He first initiated this effort \nyears ago as Chairman of the Committee. Last, I would like to thank the \nefforts of my dedicated staff and all those staff members who helped \nreach this agreement.\n  Clearly, this measure is a compromise, and as such, not every group \ngot exactly what they wanted, but this measure will advance the \nprograms and system regulating the safety of our pipeline system. It \nwill require our regulators to finalize a number of overdue \nregulations. The bill also updates the penalties that would be levied \nfor misconduct and provides whistle blower protection for employees who \nreveal misconduct. Further, the bill helps us focus on long-term \nresearch needs so as to make our future pipeline system even safer. \nInvestment today in research will help us be more efficient and \neffective in providing a safer and more secure system. While I was for \nthe most part pleased with the final product that we negotiated in this \nbill, I was concerned that we did not include provisions that would \nhave outlined what sort of pipeline safety information should be made \navailable to the public. Concerns were raised that public disclosure of \ncertain pipeline safety information could jeopardize security. We need \nto take a look at how we get safety information to the people who need \nit, but protect that information from those who wish to do harm if it \nis security-sensitive.\n  Overall, this is good legislation. It will improve the safety of our \npipelines and communities through which pipelines run, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I understand Senators McCain and Hollings have a \nsubstitute amendment at the desk. I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be considered and agreed to; the motion to reconsider by laid \nupon the table; the bill, as amended, be read three times and passed \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
