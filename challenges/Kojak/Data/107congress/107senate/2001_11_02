Your fresh supply of strength gives us courage to live \nfearlessly today. You replenish our diminished strength with \nintellectual creativity, emotional stability, and physical resiliency. \nThe tension of these frightening days on red alert have made us all \nmuch more alert to Your presence and power. The more we place our trust \nin You, the more the springs of tension within us are released and \nunwind until we feel a profound peace inside. As this workweek draws to \na close, we thank You for Your protection and we renew our commitment \nto live by faith and not be beset by fear. Your perfect love casts out \nfear. We relinquish our worries to You and our anxiety is drained away. \nWe say with the Psalmist, ``But as for me, I trust You, O Lord; I say, \n`You are my God. My times are in Your hand.'

EDMUNDS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, for the last week, I have been trying to \nfigure out how to pay tribute to a young man from Wyoming whose funeral \nI attended last Saturday. I am pleased to have the opportunity this \nmorning to\n\n[[Page S11400]]\n\naddress his life and our country as well.\n  Last Saturday, it was evident to many people in Cheyenne, WY, that \nground zero had come to our State. Jonn Edmunds--that is spelled J-o-n-\nn; he is named after his dad who is Donn, D-o-n-n--was killed in \nPakistan. He was a member of the Rangers, the 3rd Battalion, 75th \nRegiment, and he was killed in a helicopter crash. Suddenly, the war \ngot closer to all of us in Wyoming.\n  During Desert Storm, there were not very many people killed, but one \nof them was from Gillette, WY, Manuel Davilla, and we remember him.\n  In this war, not many have been killed: Two, one from Montana, one \nfrom Wyoming. Again, Wyoming, according to its population, has given an \ninordinate number, but if you are the parents of anyone killed as a \nresult of the terrorist attacks and in the military, for you that is a \n100-percent loss. It is a much greater loss. It was not just the \nparents who lost in this instance, it was also a wife.\n  One of the things that struck me at the funeral, which was attended \nby Army Rangers who helped with the funeral--it was a grand ceremony \nwith all the military honors--what struck me was the youth of these \nsoldiers. I remember one time watching a show put on by Channel 1. It \nwas called ``The Kids Who Saved the World.'' It was designed to show \ntoday's generation that the people who fought in World War II were \nkids. It took some of the people attending reunions, which is what most \nof the people see of the military, and went back to the picture of them \nas they participated in D-Day, to emphasize that it is kids who are out \nthere saving us.\n  Jonn Edmunds would have had his 21st birthday on January 3. He would \nhave had his second wedding anniversary on December 27. The first song \nthey played as a part of the service was the song that he and his wife \nwere going to play at their anniversary. Next to the podium, next to \nthe picture of Jonn was a white board, a message communicator they used \nin their home. Jonn left his last message to his wife on that white \nboard. It said:\n\n       Anne, I will be OK. I'm going to come back to you. I love \n     you, and I will think about you all the time. Be strong while \n     I'm gone and never forget that I love you.\n\n  And then he paid the ultimate price. He left a family and a wife and \nan emphasis in Wyoming. We appreciate the sacrifice that he made and \nthat his family made. It is important we remember that.\n  The service was extremely patriotic, thanks to the help of his fellow \nsoldiers. Something that was read during that service I want to read \nhere. It gives us an idea of the dedication, the focus, the goals, and \nthe understanding that these young men have when they go into battle. \nIt is called the Ranger Creed. The Rangers are a special group of young \npeople.\n  The Ranger Creed:\n\n       Recognizing that I volunteered as a Ranger, fully knowing \n     the hazards of my chosen profession, I will always endeavor \n     to uphold the prestige, honor and high esprit de corps of my \n     Ranger Regiment.\n       Acknowledging the fact that a Ranger is a more elite \n     soldier who arrives at the cutting edge of battle by land, \n     sea or air, I accept the fact that as a Ranger my country \n     expects me to move further, faster and fight harder than any \n     other soldier.\n       Never shall I fail my comrades. I will always keep myself \n     mentally alert, physically strong and morally straight and I \n     will shoulder more than my share of the task whatever it may \n     be. One hundred percent and then some.\n       Gallantly will I show the world that I'm a specially \n     selected and well trained soldier. My courtesy to superior \n     officers, neatness of dress and care of equipment shall set \n     the example for others to follow.\n       Energetically will I meet the enemies of my country. I \n     shall defeat them on the field of battle for I am better \n     trained and will fight with all my might. Surrender is not a \n     Ranger word. I will never leave a fallen comrade to fall into \n     the hands of the enemy and under no circumstances will I ever \n     embarrass my country.\n       Readily will I display the intestinal fortitude required to \n     fight onto the Ranger objective and complete the mission, \n     though I be the lone survivor.\n       Rangers lead the way.\n\n  That is a creed they live by and they recite as they go into battle.\n  I also want to share a poem. The poem was written by Jonn Edmunds' \nEnglish teacher and was dedicated to his memory at the funeral.\n  The title of it is: ``So This Is How It Feels.''\n\n       So this is how it feels to know the pain of war, the \n     ineffable sorrow deep in your gut, beyond tears, beyond \n     consciousness.\n       Elements of disgust, horror and anger, and finally fear, \n     all mixed and meshed inside.\n       So this is how it feels to mourn native sons, the \n     inscrutable sadness for one so young, their future laid bare, \n     barren yet not futile.\n       Elements of patriotism, pride, honor and heroism, and the \n     thoughtful thankfulness for their service, all conglomerate \n     there.\n       So this is how it feels to know the dark of evil, the vague \n     uncertainty of its source made real in the shed blood of our \n     own.\n       Elements of emptiness, apprehension and instability rocking \n     our faith, and finally that fear again.\n       Yet the good will out, our fears will form into faith, \n     history will record how America, though humbled now, held its \n     course as she has through other wars when she knew all too \n     well how it felt.\n\n  About a week after the September 11 events, my wife and I had an \nopportunity to attend a dinner. There happened to be a number of \nambassadors from other countries at the dinner. It was very reassuring \nto talk to them. Their message involved the spirit of the American \npeople.\n  There were a lot of people from a lot of countries around the world \nwho thought a major tragedy hit the United States that had been caused \nby somebody else and we would go to pieces. Instead, what they saw was \nthe American people in a new form of unity and spirit that they had not \nseen for decades--people coming together, volunteering, helping out, \nthe spirit of America alive again.\n  It is that spirit of America that these young people in our service \nalready know, already recognize. It is the reason they volunteered, \nthat they have put their life on the line to serve our country. Thank \ngoodness we have them. Let us always remember those who have given all.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the newspaper articles referring to Jonn \nEdmunds be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Wyoming Tribune-Eagle, Oct. 28, 2001]\n\n                       Cheyenne Son Laid to Rest\n\n                            (By Ilene Olson)\n\n       Cheyenne.--Before going overseas to help fight in Operation \n     Enduring Freedom, Spc. Jonn J. Edmunds left a simple note for \n     his wife Anne on a memo board:\n       ``Anne, I will be OK. I am going to come back to you. I \n     love you and I will think about you all the time. Be strong \n     while I am gone, and never forget that I love you.''\n       Those words, framed and displayed at his memorial Saturday, \n     tell their own story of a young life lost and a young love \n     cut tragically short.\n       Edmunds, 20, was an Army Ranger in the 3rd Battalion of the \n     75th Ranger Regiment. He was killed in a helicopter crash in \n     Pakistan on Oct. 19 while providing rescue relief for \n     American troops in Afghanistan.\n       Thirteen Army Rangers from the 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, marched in slowly and somberly. Six stopped at the \n     left side of the gym and lined up in two rows of three, \n     remaining there motionless for more than an hour until their \n     services as casket bearers were needed. The other seven lined \n     up diagonally on the right side, rifles ready for a 21-gun \n     salute.\n       Edmunds was remembered by those who knew him as an intense, \n     competitive youth, a loving and devoted husband, and a \n     dedicated soldier.\n       The Rev. Janet Forbes told the story of Edmunds' life, \n     based on her conversations with his family.\n       Forbes said Edmunds met Anne Costello when the two were \n     paired on a bowling lane. After a second bowling date, the \n     two were inseparable.\n       ``Jonn and his dad took a long walk together just before \n     Jonn left Cheyenne for basic training,'' Forbes said. ``He \n     told Donn about his intentions concerning Anne:\n       ``Dad, I really love her, and I want to marry her.''\n       ``Jonn, you're too young.''\n       ``No, Dad, I'm not.''\n       ``This went on for several rounds,'' Forbes said.\n       ``And then Donn reflected, and he looked at his son \n     closely, remembering his intelligence, clarity of purpose and \n     maturity, and said, `No, son. You're not.'''\n       The couple married Dec. 27, 1999, before a justice of the \n     peace.\n       ``Jonn's life began when he met her,'' Mary Edmunds told \n     Forbes. ``He was never happier.''\n       Forbes said Anne remembers Jonn for the strength of his \n     character: strong, concerned, hard-working, dedicated, \n     loving; for the beauty of his person: good-looking, \n     physically fit; and for his lively sense of humor: funny, \n     light-hearted and easy to talk to.\n       Jonn and Anne Edmunds planned to renew their vows at a \n     wedding on Dec. 15. ``It's Your Love,'' the song they planned \n     to be the\n\n[[Page S11401]]\n\n     first number at their wedding dance, was played for his \n     funeral instead.\n       Edmunds and his father, Donn, shared ``an alphabetical \n     connection'' of double Ns in the spelling of their first \n     names--and the frustration of never having them spelled \n     correctly, Forbes said.\n       Mary Edmunds told Forbes that her son began training for \n     his life's vocation at the age of 3. ``He was all action--\n     running, running, running.''\n       ``He had what we call older brother's syndrome,'' Forbes \n     added. ``He was always picking up his younger brother Seth, \n     carrying him on his shoulders and dragging him around.\n       ``Their play began with squirt guns, then moved to laser \n     tag. Seth, always the youngest competitor would take refuge \n     in the house.''\n       Paintball was the favorite, and Jonn was always victorious.\n       ``One time, Dad joined the game,'' Forbes continued. ``He \n     lifted his head slightly above his hiding place and Jonn got \n     him--right across the top of his head.''\n       Forbes said Edmunds enjoyed playing and coaching soccer.\n       ``He liked coaching because he got to yell,'' she said. \n     ``It seems one of the things he hated about basic training in \n     the Army was getting yelled at. He liked the leadership role \n     better--being the yeller instead of the yellee.''\n       Forbes said Edmunds' younger sister Alyssa remembers her \n     brother as a tease who loved to chase her and put June \n     beetles in her hair.\n       Alyssa, as introspective as her brother was, had confided, \n     ``Jonn would have hated all this attention.''\n       Forbes said one teenager in her congregation read Edmunds' \n     obituary, finishing with the survivors, ``all of Cheyenne.''\n       ``She interpreted this statement to mean that all of \n     Cheyenne are indeed survivors,'' Forbes said. ``It was \n     touching, comforting and reassuring that John gave his life \n     so that all of the citizens of Cheyenne may survive.''\n       Chaplain Capt. Paul Lasley of the 75th Ranger Regiment in \n     Fort Lewis, Wash., said Edmunds personified the Ranger Creed \n     every day.\n       ``Living the creed is a way of life. One must struggle to \n     balance a devotion to duty with a corresponding devotion to \n     one's family,'' Lasley said.\n       ``It is the essential uniqueness of the Ranger Creed that \n     turns a drab, black and white understanding of a ranger's \n     life into a colorful masterpiece.''\n       Staff Sgt. William Bader of the 3rd Batallion, 75th Ranger \n     Regiment in Fort Benning, Ga., worked directly with Edmunds.\n       ``When I think of Jonn, I think of all the little things,'' \n     Bader said. ``Jonn never let me down.''\n       Once, after a difficult operation, ``I looked at the rest \n     of my boys. I could see that they were tired. Then I looked \n     at Jonn. He still had that intense look on his face.\n       ``That is the way I choose to remember Jonn.''\n       The song, ``I'm Proud to Be an American,'' played near the \n     end of the memorial. It had a powerful effect on the \n     audience, which stood in a spontaneous salute of Edmunds and \n     the country he served. Several joined hands over their heads \n     in a show of unity. Applause burst forth at the song's \n     conclusion.\n       Sen. Craig Thomas R-Wyo., read a statement from Wyoming \n     native Vice President Cheney.\n       ``I will not presume to offer comfort,'' Cheney had \n     written. Instead, he thanked the Edmundses for their son's \n     patriotism and courage.\n       Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., presented President Bush's \n     statement to Anne Edmunds.\n       ``I am deeply saddened by the loss of your husband,'' Bush \n     had said. ``I hope you will find solace in the knowledge that \n     his sacrifice will not be forgotten. The nation is grateful \n     for Jonn's service to our country. We pray for comfort and \n     healing in this difficult time.''\n       At the end of the service, an intense silence fell in the \n     facility as the waiting rangers removed the flag from the \n     casket, folded it ceremoniously and presented it to Edmunds \n     family.\n       During the flag ceremony, people in the audience stood \n     quietly, barely breathing. Many dabbed at their eyes, and \n     their grief was palpable.\n       The intensity of the silence was broken by two bugles \n     playing ``Taps,'' then countered by the equally loud 21-gun \n     salute.\n       A startled child cried, and the audience seemed to take a \n     collective breath.\n       Following the memorial, family members were escorted \n     quietly from the room while people in the audience stood \n     reverently. The family's grief was reflected in many of their \n     faces.\n       Lasley summed up the purpose of the memorial: ``Jonn \n     Edmunds is not honored today exclusively for how he died.''\n       ``We honor Jonn Edmunds for how he lived.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Wyoming Tribute--Eagle, October 23, 2001]\n\n                         Ground Zero in Wyoming\n\n                            (By Ilene Olson)\n\n       Cheyenne.--A grieving Donn and Mary Edmunds stood in their \n     driveway Monday to give Americans--and the world--a glimpse \n     of their son and the tragedy of his death.\n       Spc. Jonn J. Edmunds, was a member of Company B, 3rd \n     Battalion, 75th Rangers. He died Friday in a helicopter crash \n     in Pakistan while providing rescue backup for U.S. troops \n     entering Afghanistan.\n       Donn Edmunds, occasionally fighting tears, spoke for the \n     family during the news conference:\n       ``Jonn decided in his senior year of high school to join \n     the Rangers because they were an elite force, because he felt \n     he was up to the challenge and because he wanted to join the \n     military for their college benefits.\n       ``He was extremely proud of his achievements as was the \n     rest of his family. He was a tough, determined, competitive \n     young man who only accepted the best of himself and wanted to \n     give his best for his country.''\n       Donn Edmunds read an excerpt from a paper his son wrote \n     while in high school:\n       ``In 10 years I see myself still in the Army. I believe I \n     will make a career out of the Army, which would mean staying \n     in for 20 to 25 years. I will be contributing to myself as \n     well as the defense of this country and the betterment of the \n     world.''\n       Despite his short time in the Rangers, Jonn Edmunds was the \n     leader of a four- to five-member team, supervising half of \n     his squad of 10 to 11 members, Lt. Col. Scott Keller of the \n     Army Headquarters in Denver said Monday.\n       Donn Edmunds, who characterized his home as ``ground zero \n     in Wyoming,'' said while their son's death has hit them hard, \n     it hasn't changed his family's attitude toward the current \n     war on terrorism.\n       ``Even in this time of loss, our family wants to express \n     our continued support for our president and his policies \n     regarding the actions in Operation Enduring Freedom,'' he \n     said.\n       The Edmunds family also expressed sympathy for the family \n     of Pfc. Kristofor Stonesifer, 28, of Missoula, Mont., the \n     other Ranger killed in Friday's crash.\n       In a news release Monday, Gov. Jim Geringer added his \n     condolences to those offered Sunday by other political \n     leaders.\n       ``Jonn Edmunds symbolizes the thousands of young men and \n     women who wear the military uniform,'' he said. ``He was a \n     model high school student who voluntarily chose to serve his \n     country through service in the military.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It was a very moving event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/02/senate-section/article/S11401-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11401-S11402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I want to talk a moment about a couple \nof subjects that I think are current certainly. One of them is the \nsubject of energy. Energy has been with us for a long time. We have \nbeen talking about a policy on energy. We have been talking about doing \nsomething to strengthen our domestic production so that we become less \ndependent on imports particularly from the Middle East.\n  We have talked about the need to do something to help our economy, \nand energy has something to do with it. So it is an issue of security. \nWe are now nearly 60 percent dependent on foreign oil.\n  Oil, of course, causes the movement and transportation not only in \nour economy but in defense, so it becomes even more important we deal \nwith that issue as we talk about a stimulus for the economy. And we \nwill be coming up with a number of proposals we hope will have an \nimpact on the economy. Energy, of course, probably has one of the \ngreatest impacts on the economy. The idea we could move into doing some \ndevelopment of facilities, we could do some new efforts to produce oil, \nwould all have some impact on jobs and on our economy.\n  We have been talking about it for months now. We have had a number of \nmeetings out in the swamp that were attended and supported by the \nadministration, by the President, by the Secretary of Energy, by the \nSecretary of Interior, to move forward with something. The House, of \ncourse, has already passed an energy bill.\n  We have been supported by groups of seniors, and I think \nunderstandably so. When utility rates go up, seniors on fixed incomes \nare the ones who suffer the most, and that is an experience we have all \nbeen through. Certainly, we have had also the support at these various \nmeetings from labor unions, particularly the teamsters who have been \nthere time after time.\n  We have been joined by Native Americans from Alaska who are dealing \nwith that portion of energy. So we have had support from a great many \npeople.\n\n[[Page S11402]]\n\n  Yesterday there was a two-page ad in the Hill newspaper of all the \npeople who are supporting doing something with energy policy. So there \nis very wide support for it.\n  We have not, however, gotten support from the majority leader to \nbring it to the floor. We believe that is one of the legislative \nefforts that should have a high priority before we can finish our work, \nwhich I hope we will do relatively soon.\n  So there is much that needs to be done. A policy in energy, of \ncourse, has to do with conservation, how we in our homes and in our \ncars can do more to conserve energy. It has to do with renewables. We \nneed to put an emphasis on renewables so we can strengthen that aspect \nof production. We certainly need to do more on research so that we can \nfind, for instance, ways to even more cleanly use coal and other kinds \nof volume resources.\n  We have to talk about production. We have to talk about access to \npublic lands. We can have production. We have shown that in Wyoming one \ncan go into an area and have production without destroying the \nenvironment, and we should do it in a very careful way, and indeed we \nwill.\n  So despite the need for both the economic boost and for the defense \nand security aspect of it, we have not been able to cause the majority \nto bring this before the Senate. We urge it be done and done quickly. \nWe need to bring this bill forward and deal with it. Perhaps we will \ndeal with the House bill, but we need to bring it up and make some \njudgments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/02/senate-section/article/S11402-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AIRLINE SECURITY PERSONNEL: FEDERAL OR PRIVATE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, on another item I want to comment on \nthat I have heard quite a bit about, the House passed last night the \nairport security bill, and I am glad they finally did. Of course, the \nbig controversial issue was whether or not those personnel that are in \nairports would be Federal employees or whether they would be civilians \noverseen by a Federal agency.\n  First of all, often, particularly in the media, there has been the \nimpression that we either have Federal employees or continue to do it \nthe way it is being done.\n  That is not the case. What is being talked about, if it is done \nwithout Federal employees, is the Federal Government would have \noversight and the authority to authorize these kinds of activities; \nthey would be overseen by a Federal agency, hopefully a law enforcement \nagency. There would be criteria for employees, there would be tests for \nemployees, there would be measurements to be taken, all enforced by the \nFederal Government. The idea that would continue to be what it is, \nunless it is Federal employees, is not true.\n\n  The other interesting point is there has been a lot of reference, \nboth by the media and also by the Members in the House pushing for \nFederal employees, to it passing 100-0 in the Senate. It did, indeed, \nbut the reason is there are lots of things in that bill in addition to \nthe matter of what kind of employees we have for airport security. Many \nMembers would have preferred to have seen what the House put in, but we \nknew we did not have the votes. We wanted to pass the bill because of \nwhat it contained. The idea that it passed 100-0 does not mean there \nare not people in the Senate who would like to see this done in the \nmanner as passed by the House.\n  As we go to a conference, I hope we can do that quickly. That is one \nof the most important and timely things to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/02/senate-section/article/S11402-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               APPRECIATION FOR EFFORT OF SENATOR THOMAS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I take this opportunity to thank the senior Senator from \nWyoming, Mr. Thomas, for all of the efforts he has made in three areas, \nas well as a lot of other areas, but particularly in three areas.\n  Energy, of course, of which he spoke, he has been one of the Members \npushing for an energy policy for this country since I have known him, \nwhich has been quite a while. It looks as if we have the opportunity to \nget that done soon. It will be largely due to his efforts on the \ncommittee and on the floor.\n  I also thank him for the effort he is making in the agricultural \narea. Our State is very dependent on agriculture. He serves on the \nAgriculture Committee. I think he is the first person from Wyoming to \nserve in 40 years. He got in it at a particularly crucial time, as we \nwere redoing the farm bill. I know that is extremely difficult work. \nWhen there are 10 Senators together, they offer 20 opinions. Trying to \nmold those into one bill can be extremely difficult.\n  Of course, the Senator serves on the Finance Committee, as well. That \nis from where the stimulus package is coming. Again, there are multiple \nopinions regarding that package.\n  I appreciate the efforts and leadership of the Senator in all of \nthose areas. I look forward to the great packages we will have as a \nresult.\n\n\n                           Race for the Cure\n\n  I also mention another effort led by his wife, the Race for the Cure, \nthe breast cancer effort in our State. The four honorary chairs are his \nwife--definitely not an honorary chair; she spends a great deal of time \nall year working to raise funds to make people more aware of the need \nfor breast cancer testing, treatment, and early detection. She is an \nhonorary chair, along with our Governor's wife, Sherri Geringer, my \nwife, Diana, and Congresswoman Barbara Cubin's husband, Fritz. They all \nwork a lot of time during the year.\n\n  Last weekend, we were at a function that kicks off the next year's \nRace for the Cure. It is well underway. It is a great effort. It saves \nlife, both men's and women's lives. That evening we were in Rock \nSprings, WY, for a different function called Cowboys Against Cancer. \nThis event is not limited to any particular type of cancer. Rock \nSprings puts on an annual fundraising event where anyone in the \ncommunity with cancer receives funds from this foundation, up to \n$1,000, to help offset some of their expenses during the year. It is a \ngreat community effort to help out neighbors.\n  They asked me to emphasize that, even though we have this focus in \nthe United States on terrorism, anybody who comes down with cancer has \na form of terrorism. It is important we keep giving the ways we have \nbeen giving, as well as giving in new ways. The American people are the \nmost giving people in the world. This is a time when we need to give in \nnew ways, but we need to continue the old ways, as well.\n  When somebody in your family comes down with cancer, you have ground \nzero in your home, too. That is the potential for a total loss. I hope \neverybody keeps up all of those efforts, as well as the new emphasis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Madam President, these are, for all Americans, \ntroubling times. While we are defending our Nation at home and abroad, \nwe find ourselves with conflicting emotions. We are by nature a \npeaceful people but a people of enormous resolve, with a great love of \nour Nation, our culture, and each other. We respect each other's \nfaiths. We respect the faiths and cultures of those of other nations.\n  This mix of emotions has placed us in an extraordinary position. Two \nprincipal issues arise from this dilemma. First, in the midst of a \nmilitary campaign in Afghanistan, we now find the religious holidays of \nthe Muslim faith upon us, the celebration of Ramadan. It is a central \ndate on the Islamic calendar.\n  The second issue is the extent to which our military operations in \nAfghanistan involve the inevitability and the tragedy of civilian \ncasualties. I\n\n[[Page S11403]]\n\nwould like to address both of these concerns for a moment.\n  It speaks well of the American people that we would have a concern \nabout engaging in military activities during the religious holidays of \nsome of our own citizens, and more important, those of other nations. \nIn a nation that is overwhelmingly Christian but with large Jewish and \nIslamic populations, it is a tremendous statement about America that \neven in the waging of conflict we want to be deferential to the \nreligions of others. Indeed, it speaks well of our President that there \nis even a consideration of the postponement of military activities in \nour air campaign in Afghanistan during Ramadan.\n  I strongly urge the President, despite his best instincts, that the \nbombing campaign should not be postponed--not for a minute, not for a \nday. What happened on September 11 and the motivation of those who \nmight have orchestrated this campaign from Afghanistan is all the \nevidence that is required that bin Laden, al-Qaida, even the Taliban \nare not practicing Islam.\n  The massive loss of life at the Pentagon and the World Trade Center \nin the name of that faith is not only not in keeping with the teachings \nof Islam, it is blasphemy. It is blasphemy against the teachings of \nMohammad and the Koran. It is an insult to every person of Islamic \nfaith in the world.\n  For the United States to hesitate or suspend our military operations \nagainst al-Qaida because of Ramadan is to suggest that these people are \nactually legitimately practicing their faith or even, in fact, are of \nthe Islamic faith. Their practice of Islam that engages in terrorism, \nthe massive loss of life, the use of assassination and terror against \ntheir own people and the United States, their declaration of war \nagainst people simply because they hold a different religious faith or \nlive in a different culture, is not the legitimate practice of Islam. \nIt is against everything written in the Koran.\n  Not only should this bombing campaign not be suspended in deference \nto Ramadan, indeed--it is the policy of our Government that bin Laden \nand al-Qaida are not practicing the faith at all--suspension would be \nto give a cloak of legitimacy that indeed they are practicing a \nreligion rather than that they are an aberration. They are a cult, \nmindlessly pursuing some horrible vision of exercising personal power, \nthe teachings of which are not legitimately accepted by any faith.\n  No, the bombing campaign should not be suspended. Indeed, it must \ncontinue to underscore that this is not a war against Islam, and the \npeople we are fighting are not practicing Islam.\n  Second is the issue of civilian casualties. It is a wonderful \nstatement about our people that even in the face of horror and the \nmassive loss of life of Americans, that there is a concern that people \nin another nation, as we seek justice, might inadvertently and \ntragically lose their lives as we pursue al-Qaida and bin Laden. It is \nright we should have this concern, but it cannot deter us.\n  I hope my comments are not misunderstood. I do not want them to seem \noverly harsh. But there is something missing from this debate, from \nthose abroad, and those within our own Nation who are understandably \nconcerned about this loss of life. There is not a question that there \nis going to be a loss of civilian life. That happened on September 11. \nIf you want to see civilian casualties, come to New York. We have \nthousands of bodies still not recovered.\n  Concerning the issue of whether there is going to be an innocent loss \nof life, that already happened. We want nothing but the best for the \npeople of Afghanistan. But it is impossible to engage in large scale \nmilitary hostilities, to find thousands of al-Qaida fighters where they \nare being shielded, without some loss of Afghan life. Every loss of \nlife of an Afghan citizen is regrettable but unavoidable. We can \nminimize it, but we cannot avoid it.\n  We have responsibilities. Our first responsibility is to bring to \njustice those who killed our people and attacked our Nation. An equally \ngreat responsibility is to ensure that if American soldiers enter \nAfghanistan to find bin Laden, we minimize the loss of American lives. \nAnything that is done that avoids the possibility of the loss of an \nAmerican soldier is our highest priority. If we can do that while \nminimizing the loss of Afghan citizens, it is the right thing to do.\n  I speak, now, directly and bluntly. The people of every nation bear \nsome responsibility for those who govern it. That is obviously true in \na democratic society, where governments rule with the consent of the \ngoverned. But, indeed, it is true in all societies.\n  I know the Afghan people are powerless. I know the Taliban rules \nagainst the wishes of many Afghans. But, nevertheless, as a historic \nprinciple, they are accountable for their government. It is a fact that \ntheir government has harbored terrorists who have attacked our greatest \ncity, declared war on our Nation, and killed thousands of our citizens. \nThis is not to suggest that I believe that we, by design, would ever \ntake their innocent lives. But it is to put in context the fact that, \nif inadvertently, against our policies and our desires and our prayers, \nAfghan lives are lost in the hunt for bin Laden and the search for \njustice, it may be regrettable, but it is historically and legally and \nmorally defensible.\n  By historic parallels, a third of the German people voted for the \nNazi Party.\n  Virtually none of the Japanese people as a matter of right could have \nbeen held accountable because they were directly responsible for Tojo's \ngovernment in Tokyo. But I don't believe it would have been legitimate \nthen any more than it would be legitimate now to have said somehow the \npeople of those countries do not bear responsibility for their \ngovernment no matter how they came to power. The innocent Afghan people \nwho regrettably now lose their lives, as the people of all nations, \nbear some responsibility for those who govern them--by the ballot box \nwherever it is possible, by force of arms where it is necessary, or by \nwhatever means that might be required to free themselves, or to ensure \nthat their governments are either not engaged in actions against other \npeople or harbor those who would harm other people. Responsibility \nrests on all of us who are citizens of nations.\n  I hope the loss of civilian life is minimal. But our Nation is at \nwar. This is not some gentlemanly understanding between the government \nof the United States and the Taliban government of Afghanistan. This is \nnot a problem of languages or cultures. This is a fundamental judgment \nby the government of Afghanistan to harbor a terrorist element that has \ncome to the judgment that they cannot coexist with Western society.\n  Either their government falls or ours falls. There is not something \nhere to be negotiated. It is not some misunderstanding that we \nreconcile. There is nothing to be discussed. Their government falls or \nours does. We are vulnerable to them or they are vulnerable to us. Bin \nLaden lives or some of our people die.\n  Sometimes, even in a complex world which has seemingly advanced so \nfar, some things are so simple. That is the nature of this conflict.\n  It has been called a war on terrorism. It isn't a war on terrorism. \nTerrorism is a methodology of warfare. Had they attacked the World \nTrade Center with fighter planes or used the most modern technology \navailable, we would be grieved nonetheless. They used terrorism. But it \nisn't their methodology that we are fighting. It is them.\n  This is a small group in a remote place that has come to the \nextraordinary conclusion that they cannot coexist with Western society. \nAs a matter of our faith, our culture, and the means by which we choose \nto live our lives, they have come to a judgment that they cannot share \nthis planet with us because of who we are and what we believe.\n  None of us wants any loss of life. There is a wonderful strength of \nour country. We can fight an enemy and still worry about his wounds.\n  I leave you with a simple reminder as our country debates whether to \npursue this war during Ramadan and whether we lose our nerve because of \nloss of life of Afghan citizens. It has been a long time since this \ncountry fought a war seeking an unconditional result. Indeed, it has \nbeen more than half a century. War is different. It is different than a \nmisunderstanding. It is different than a military action. It is \ndifferent than a police action. It is different than the Persian Gulf \nor Vietnam or even Korea that had limited objectives.\n\n[[Page S11404]]\n\n This has no limited objective. This is unconditional.\n  Those people will not stand. We don't want to talk to them. We don't \nwant to negotiate with them. We don't want to work out a \nmisunderstanding with them. They will not stand.\n  The judgment about whether to fight during Ramadan and pay them the \nrespect that they are actually of the Islamic faith should be debated \nin that context because they are not Islamic. They are not exercising \ntheir faith. They are blasphemists of their own alleged religion.\n\n  Civilian casualties need to be debated in this context because, \nthough regrettable, they are inevitable and a part of unconditional war \nin a threshold that was already crossed, and then finally all of us \ncoming to recognition of what it is we fight--terrorism, bin Laden. We \nfight against people whose weapons are not the principal concern. Their \nmethodology is not our principal concern. Our concern is the profound \njudgment that they reached: that our presence and our lives are somehow \na central threat.\n  Before the Senate left for this week, I wanted to share these \nthoughts knowing that we will revisit these issues again and again in \nwhat promises to be, unfortunately, a long and difficult engagement in \nAfghanistan, knowing that among the many strengths of our people, \npatience is not the greatest of American virtues. But we did not seek \nthis war. We did not want it. We would have done anything to avoid it, \nbut it was not our choice. It was thrust upon us. The decision to take \nlives was made by others. We only have one thing to do--no decisions, \nno choices, no judgments--just to win. That takes time. It takes \nsacrifice. Sacrifices we have made before. Now we will make them again.\n  I hope our country simply can steady its nerves and muster the \npatience to see this to the end. That will involve a great price, but \nthere is no choice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

Madam President, it is only on a Friday that we can \nmake sense. That is my attempt here this morning with respect to the \nupcoming stimulus bill. We have more than enough deficit stimulus \nalready in the pipeline, almost, without a stimulus bill.\n  The point is that, yes, we are going to have to spend, as the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia has pointed out, for home \nsecurity. The Senator has outlined our spending on homeland defense to \nthe tune of some $20 billion, including airport security; Amtrak \nsecurity; Federal, State, and local antiterrorism enforcement; \ninfrastructure security; highway security; clean and safe drinking \nwater; bioterrorism response; border security. Actually, we have to \nadd, necessarily, unemployment compensation and health care.\n  So let's say definitely all of us will be supporting--and should--\ndeficit stimulus; otherwise, it makes no difference to the economy. It \nmust be spent for home security with respect to the initiative of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  For starters, we are beginning this fiscal year with a horrendous \ndeficit. I think of Mark Twain who once said that the truth is such a \nprecious thing, it should be used very sparingly. That is the credo \nwhen we come to Government finance here in Washington. Specifically, we \ncount Social Security revenues--I want to be specific in my limited \ntime--twice. Sure, the government receives the well over $500 billion \nthat payroll tax payers pay in to the Social Security Trust Fund. The \nAmerican people paid that amount in fiscal year 2001 for a surplus of--\nother than paying out the regular benefits, $163 billion. But the \nSocial Security law, section 201, says, wait a minute, we don't want \nthat money to languish and sit there, we want to gain interest on it.\n  So we issue T-bills, you and I buy the T-bills--the money comes into \nthe Government, and what do they do? They count that again as revenues. \nSo you count the money first as it comes in from the payroll tax \npayers, and you count it a second time from the purchase of the \nTreasury bills, in compliance with section 201.\n  Now, let's understand it. We ended the fiscal year with a $133 \nbillion deficit. I encourage my fellow Senators and the American public \nto view the public debt to the penny as issued by the Secretary of the \nTreasury on September 28, 2001 at: http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/\nopdpenny.htm.\n  Madam President, you can see that the national debt went up from the \nend of fiscal year 2000--the end of September in the year 2000--from 5 \ntrillion 674 billion some odd dollars to 5 trillion 806 billion some \nodd dollars. It will show on the chart a $133 billion deficit. That is \nverified in the final monthly Treasury statement made for fiscal year \n2001. You can access this report at: http://www.treasury.gov.\n  Madam President, immediately it highlights a half truth because they \nshow a surplus, and that is how they talk about the surplus and how it \nis diminishing. But don't bother with that. Go down to page 20, the \nparticular culmination of all their moneys, and you find out how much \nrevenue the Government took in and how much was spent. Every year since \nLyndon Johnson's day, we have ended up with a deficit. Not just the \n$133 billion deficit as of the last fiscal year, only a month ago. I \nwill ask unanimous consent to have this particular document printed in \nthe Record, the budget realities.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

Government FY 1998; Beginning in 1962 CBO's 2001 Economic and Budget Outlook. March 14, 2001.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The document takes us from President Harry Truman right \non up to the Johnson Administration. You can see that, in 1968-69, when \nI had the privilege of serving here and worked on that with George \nMahon over on the House side, the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee at that time. We cut it back again another $5 \nbillion. We called over to Marvin Watson in December of 1968 because \nPresident Johnson was very sensitive about guns and butter--paying for \nthe war in Vietnam and the Great Society. So we cut it back another $5 \nbillion, and we ended up with a true surplus that particular year, a \n$2.9 billion surplus. But you can see the minus marks coming through.\n  This particular chart shows that the Congressional Budget Office \nprojected by March 14 of this year that we would have a $26.2 billion \nsurplus. Truth: We ended up with a $133 billion deficit.\n  Where do you find that truth out? Turn to page 20 of `Final Monthly \nTreasury Statement,' and you will see that at the beginning of fiscal \nyear, 2001, we had a debt of $5,674,178,000,000.\n  By the close of the fiscal year last month, the debt had already gone \nup to $5,807,463. So it has gone up some $133 billion. We ended up with \na deficit of $133 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that page 20 of the ``Final Monthly Treasury \nStatement'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               TABLE 6.--MEANS OF FINANCING THE DEFICIT OR DISPOSITION OF SURPLUS BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, SEPTEMBER 2001 AND OTHER PERIODS\n

Madam President, you can see we are already in the red \n$8.5 billion. The debt is on the way up.\n  What had happened in August was the Congressional Budget Office came \nover to the Budget Committee and Mr. Crippin projected a $104 billion \ndeficit for fiscal year 2002. In the last couple of weeks, he has come \nback and amended that to some $140 billion more. He said the downturn \nhas been far more extreme than he ever expected. So he adds another \n$140 billion to the $104 billion, which is $244 billion. We start off \nwith $244 billion, without the stimulus, without the moneys for defense \nthat we are bound to pass before we leave in the next few weeks, \nwithout the moneys for education that we are bound to spend, without \nthe moneys for agriculture for the farm bill that we are prepared to \nprovide. I am looking at all of that, and I made this comment at the \nCabinet table just last week to the Vice President--the President had \nto excuse himself to receive a head of state--but I said: Mr. Vice \nPresident, we are starting off now knowing at the very beginning of \nfiscal year 2002 that we have over some $300 billion in the pipeline of \nstimulus that people are not looking at.\n  I will bet anybody any amount of money anytime--give me whatever odds \nyou want--that the deficit for fiscal year 2002 will exceed $300 \nbillion. I want to see my colleagues in the Senate take me up on that \nbet. We are still talking surpluses, is my point, and we know the truth \nis that we are going to have at least a $300 billion deficit.\n  Yes, let us take care of home security, if it is $20 billion, $25 \nbillion, $30 billion--whatever it is. But none of\n\n[[Page S11407]]\n\nthese fast forward tax cuts and calling it stimulus, because it is a \npolitical opportunity: We will give you what spending we want, and we \nwill take what tax cuts we want. That game has to stop.\n  The cold sobriety of the moment is, this country is at war. We have \nto sacrifice, and we will sacrifice in the context of the economy, \ntrying to hold the line as much as we can; specifically, let's not take \nanymore loss of revenues and call it stimulus. Let us go forward with \nstrengthening home security and appreciate the reality that we are in \ntrouble. The ox is in the ditch. We have fooled ourselves all year \nlong. I pointed it out time and again.\n  I have such a high regard for our distinguished chairman in the \nSenate, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, who is doing an outstanding job as \nour chairman, that I hate to appear as the dog in the manger constantly \nbringing up the record, the record, the record, showing the deficit, \nthe deficit, the deficit. But we have had a deficit. We ended up with \none, as I said we would, as of last year of $133 billion. We are \nalready going into the red, and we have not even started the level of \nspending that will be required. Let us hold tight to home security, \nunemployment compensation, and health care, and stop right there to \nhold down the long-term interest rates. That is what is stultifying any \nkind of economic comeback from the recession we are in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise this morning to speak to an \namendment which I believe is the pending business before the Senate, \nand that is the Daschle amendment No. 2044 relating to collective \nbargaining of public safety employees. This is an amendment that has \nbeen offered to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill which is the pending \nbusiness of the Senate. I understand a cloture vote will be scheduled \nfor next Tuesday on this particular amendment.\n  I want to speak to this issue for a moment because I think this is an \nunfortunate time to be bringing this amendment forward, especially \nsince it has nothing whatsoever to do with the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill. I regret an effort has been made to inject this rather \nemotionally charged issue into the appropriations bill we are going to \nbe asked to vote on early next week.\n  I also think the timing is unfortunate. I understand why, at a time \nwhen all of America is willing to and desirous of expressing its \nappreciation to our firefighters and other rescue workers, especially \nas they have worked day and night, literally, at the site of the World \nTrade Center in New York City, to find ways of recognizing their \ncontribution to our country and to the people of New York. I do not \nthink this particular amendment is the way to do that because the \namendment seeks to, for the first time, force the U.S. Government's \nheavy hand into State and local government labor relations with police, \nfire, and a whole host of other workers--first responders, ambulance, \nparamedics, EMTs, and a whole group of other people who, for the first \ntime, would be required to comply with Federal procedures regarding \ncollective bargaining rather than the traditional approach, which has \nbeen for the State and local governments to make their own \ndeterminations as to how to deal with their various employees, \nincluding fire, police, and other first responders to emergencies.\n  The timing is unfortunate, as I say. I think there are many better \nways for the United States to express its appreciation to these \nemployees than to have a very partisan and contentious issue of labor \nrelations inserted into the appropriations bill under the guise of \nfinding a way to support our police and firefighters. This is not the \nway to support our police and firefighters.\n  This is an item that has been on the agenda of some people for a long \ntime. To try to insert it into the debate on an appropriations bill at \nthis time I think is most unfortunate.\n  Let me say parenthetically, there are some wonderful police and fire \nfolks in Arizona with whom I have worked over the years. They have been \ntremendously helpful to me. Arizonans went back to New York City to \nhelp in that effort. There is not anybody who appreciates more the work \nthat our police, firefighters, and other first responders do than I.\n  As I say, in particular, the folks in the various organizations that \nprovide police services in Arizona have helped me in more ways than I \ncan tell, but I really do not think this collective bargaining bill, as \nan amendment to the appropriations process, is the way to recognize \ntheir efforts. Here is why.\n  This amendment would require the State and local governments to \nimplement collective bargaining for this group of employees, and it is \nnot limited to paid employees. Volunteer firemen, for example, would be \njust as subject to this collective bargaining requirement as would the \nemployees of the towns' or counties' police or fire department, for \nexample, because it applies to either paid or unpaid law enforcement \nofficers, firefighters, rescue squads, ambulance crews, as well as \nparamedics, EMTs, rescue workers, ambulance personnel, hazardous \nmaterials workers, first responders, and individuals providing out-of-\nhospital emergency medical care, both on a paid or voluntary basis.\n\n  It mandates many categories of individuals that would now be subject \nto collective bargaining for the first time under Federal rules because \nunder this amendment, within 180 days of enactment, the Federal Labor \nRelations Authority must determine whether a State provides the \nfollowing rights--and there is a whole long list: The right to form and \njoin a labor organization; to recognize employees' labor organizations; \ncommit agreements to writing; bargaining over hours, wages, terms of \nemployment, arbitration, enforcement through State courts, and so on.\n  This is obviously an arbitrary list of rights that would be imposed \nunder the authority of the Federal Government. If the FLRA determines \nthat a State does not substantially provide for these rights--and over \nhalf of the States do not, by the way, they are right-to-work States \nthat do not mandate collective bargaining--then the FLRA, under this \nlegislation, shall establish collective bargaining procedures for these \ncovered individuals. That has to be done within 1 year of the date of \nenactment.\n  So the bottom line is it imposes on States, even those which do not \ncurrently have collective bargaining laws, a new set of Federal \nrequirements for collective bargaining for these people, including, as \nI said, even voluntary firemen. It would force this Federal system on \nthose States.\n  It is not just an unfunded mandate, although there is obviously a \ncost associated with this as well, but it would override all of the \nlocal and State laws that currently apply. Twenty-one States do not \ncurrently require this kind of collective bargaining. It would \nliterally force upon those governments collective bargaining over these \npublic safety officers, who are nonunion members, to accept the union \nas their official bargaining agent.\n  This is such a total break from all of the tradition in this country. \nSome States are right-to-work States. Some States are not right-to-work \nStates. Some States have options for collective bargaining for local \njurisdictions, for example, such as my State of Arizona. We have never \nfelt it was appropriate to mandate from the Federal Government how each \nof these municipalities and States would conduct their labor relations.\n  The bill has a provision that says if you have less than 25 full-time \nemployees, then your police department or fire department would not be \ncovered. Stop and think about all of the towns and the counties \nthroughout our country that may have 26 or 27 or 28 employees. They \nwould be covered. For the first time, the heavy hand of the Federal \nGovernment would come down and tell them what to do.\n  It is no wonder that county sheriffs in Arizona and some mayors in \nsome relatively small towns have contacted my office and said: Do not \nimpose this on us. We are getting along fine. We have great relations \nwith our employees, and for the Federal Government to step in is not \nonly going to increase our costs but, frankly, create some bad \nrelationships. We do not need that. We have enough trouble responding \nto all\n\n[[Page S11408]]\n\nof the problems that have resulted from September 11 to have to deal \nwith this.\n  This is not an appropriate response to the events of September 11 for \nus to force this on our State and local communities.\n  In my own State of Arizona, for example, our law provides that public \nsafety employees can present their proposals to their employers but \ndoes not require as an obligation that collective bargaining be the \nresult. This, of course, would require the State agencies and local \ngovernments to bargain with labor unions on behalf of the public safety \nemployees. This is why the sheriffs as well as some police chiefs have \ncontacted me and said it interferes with their ability. The Arizona \nsheriffs and police chiefs, the league of cities and towns, all of them \nhave expressed their opposition to this legislation.\n  I think the problem is in opposing it, there is somehow a notion we \nare therefore against police and firemen. That is what bothers me the \nmost. There is a big difference between the Federal Government \nmandating labor policies on our towns and counties on the one hand and \nexpressing our support for police and firefighters on the other. We \nhave done that in the Senate in resolutions we have passed.\n  I hope in many other ways to show support for the police and firemen \nin my State with whom, again, I have had such a great relationship. \nThey have helped me, and I hope I have been able to help them. In fact, \nI know I have through several appropriations that we have received to \nhelp them in fighting drugs, for example. It has been a great \nrelationship, and I hope I do not have to prove my loyalty to these \nfolks by supporting an amendment which has no place in this bill, which \nis a very political amendment, which creates huge problems with respect \nto federalism and forcing for the first time this new Federal mandate \non these local communities, at a huge cost.\n  By the way, the cost is estimated at $44 million by CBO over the next \n4 years. CBO says it will cost $3 million just to set up the FLRA to \ndevelop the regulations to determine State compliance and enforce those \ncompliances.\n  This is simply not the right response to the events of September 11. \nI regret this issue has been infused into the Labor-HHS bill.\n  So I say to my friends in the volunteer fire departments in the small \ntowns throughout Arizona and even in the larger communities, which of \ncourse do have these collective bargaining arrangements, for the most \npart, the best way we can respond to the incident of September 11 is to \nkeep focused on the job ahead of us, and that is to train up and be \nready to respond as first responders to any emergency within our local \ncommunities; to support our local firefighters and police so that in \nthe myriad false alarms they are now responding to we provide them the \nresources necessary for them to do their job; to support them in any \nissues they have with respect to the Federal Government in terms of \ngetting funding for programs and the like; but not to respond by \ncreating a new Federal mandate on every community in our States that \nnow they are going to have to be required to engage in collective \nbargaining when that has been a matter of local option in the past.\n  It seems to me this is the wrong approach, and I hope we can find \nother ways of supporting our local fire and police than by this \nparticular amendment.\n  I intend to vote no if the question of cloture comes up. To explain \nthat very briefly, the point is: Should we be taking up this amendment \non this unrelated bill? Sixty Senators will have to say yes before we \nwill be permitted to do that next Tuesday. I hope at least 40 Senators \nwill say, no, this is not the place to do it, this is not the way for \nus to express our support for fire and police. There are more practical \nways we could do that given the events of September 11.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/02/senate-section/article/S11408-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Madam President, today I rise to discuss a critical need \nfor our Nation to unite in what I think is an immediate effort to \nstrengthen our economy. This morning you probably saw that our Nation's \nunemployment rate jumped a full half of 1 percent to 5.4 percent--one \nof the largest increases in any given month in history. We lost 415,000 \njobs over the last month. Within that context, there are many more \nlayoffs in the offing, that have been announced by companies, yet to be \nexecuted.\n  GDP has declined. Consumer prices, actually, within the GDP numbers, \ndeclined for one of the first times since the 1950s. Manufacturing \nindices and other statistics indicate that we are in a recession.\n  Over 40 years ago, the brother of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, President John Kennedy, issued a dramatic and now \nimmortalized challenge to all Americans. He said: ``Ask not what your \ncountry can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.''\n  We are now having a debate about an economic stimulus program, about \nthe state of our economy, and what we should do next. Four decades \nlater, it is again time to ask Americans to come to the support of our \ncountry in a practical sense. This is particularly true for those of us \nin the Congress.\n  Today, we have not one but two great challenges. First, of course, we \nneed to win the war against terrorism at home and abroad. To this end, \nwe are remarkably united. Most Americans are on the same page in \nresponding to the Nation's needs.\n  But at the same time, we need to reinvigorate our slumping economy, \nan economy profoundly impacted by the cowardly acts of September 11, \nand the subsequent uncertainty surrounding bioterrorism events. Here \nAmerica's response is not quite so clear. To this challenge, we still \nappear focused on something more than the Nation's real needs.\n  Let me be clear: My views of stimulus are premised on the near \ncertainty that we are in the midst of a serious national recession and \nI think also, importantly, a global one. Increasingly, we see our \nneighbors across the globe suffering from much of the same kind of \nweakness we see in America. This view is shared by most economic \nanalysts and political leaders. Today's report only reinforces that \nview.\n  For all of us, the primary risks from this point forward are how \ndeep, how much further will this economic erosion go? The signs, \nstatistically and anecdotally, are everywhere that this will be a long \nand deep slowdown.\n  Therefore, we need an immediate and substantial fiscal response. We \nneed an insurance policy, and we need to put it in place now.\n  I agree with what the President says: It is time for us to go to \nwork. The question is, How should we organize that work?\n  This economic challenge will require the same type of bipartisan \ncooperation, the same sense of resolve, the same sense of national \nunity that we have enjoyed in the war effort. In truth, that should not \nbe all that hard. After all, when it comes to designing an economic \nstimulus package there is broad consensus among economists about the \nprinciples we should follow. Chairman Greenspan agrees. Bob Rubin \nagrees. And the chairs and ranking members of the Senate and House \nBudget Committees--Democrat and Republican alike--agree. We should \nfollow those straightforward principles and get on with working out the \ndetails. This should not be a political argument but an objective \npursuit of the most certain actions to reinvigorate our economy.\n\n  In the short term, we need actions that quickly generate real \neconomic activity, real economic growth. For the long term, we need \nactions that promote fiscal discipline. It is a simple formula, very \nsimple: Short-term stimulus, long-term discipline.\n  It should not be that hard if we are willing to move beyond \nideological debates and special interests. In fact, as I have said, \nthere is a fairly broad consensus among economists about how to\n\n[[Page S11409]]\n\nachieve these goals. For example, to maintain fiscal discipline, any \nstimulus package should include items where costs are primarily \ntemporary; otherwise, the incremental benefit of new spending or tax \ncuts could be more than offset by higher interest rates which undermine \nhousing, business investment, all kinds of activity in the real \neconomy.\n  Permanent tax or spending programs undermine our long-term fiscal \nhealth. And we already face a serious erosion in our budget baseline \nand long-run risks because of the demographic sea change that is coming \nin the next decade.\n  Another point that would be obvious to most economists is that \ntargeting benefits to those with modest incomes will be more powerful \nin stimulating the economy than benefits targeted to those with high \nincomes. This isn't a matter of ideology or politics; it is really just \ncommon sense. It is basic economics, particularly in the short run. \nPeople with lower incomes have an objectively measurable higher \nmarginal propensity to consume.\n  If we give a dollar to those who are stretched financially, they are \nlikely to spend it. By contrast, if we give a dollar to those with \nsignificant wealth and assets, they are likely to save it, particularly \nin uncertain times. So if we want to generate economic activity now--\nthe whole point of a stimulus package--the most efficient approach is \nto target aid to those who need it most.\n  There are several ways to offer tax breaks for those with modest \nincomes. Frankly, I am skeptical about the policy that seems most \npopular in Washington--maybe on both sides of the aisle--and that is \ngiving out rebates.\n  Most economists will tell you that one-time rebates do not work that \nwell because people tend to save their checks, unless they are \nunemployed. This certainly was the case this summer when only 20 cents \non the dollar was spent of the first round of rebates. That is not \ngetting much bang for our buck, but it is consistent with past \nexperience. And I think it should guide us today as we put together our \nstimulus package.\n  Clearly, there are more effective ways to stimulate the economy and \nbenefit those with low and moderate incomes. I think the principle \nought to be: How do you get one dollar of benefit flowing from one \ndollar of tax activity?\n  In my view, a better approach would be to reduce payroll taxes for a \nshort period, perhaps a year or two--what I would call a payroll tax \nholiday, or a partial holiday. This would target working Americans and \npromote needed consumption by increasing take-home pay. And we should \noffset any reductions in trust fund revenues with a commitment to \nreplenish those funds from the general fund once the economy gets back \non track and budget surpluses return.\n\n  Changing a person's income stream over a period of time changes how \nthey think about their spending patterns and what their budgets are \nabout. It tends to lead to greater expenditures than one-time shots.\n  Similarly, we could expand the 10-percent rate bracket to apply to a \nwider range of incomes. Right now we stop it at $12,000 for a married \ncouple. I think we should move it up to $20,000. This also would \nincrease take-home pay for a broad range of low- and moderate- and \nmiddle-income families, and would provide the kind of stimulus that \nwould change how people budget. Senator Bob Graham and I have advocated \nthis change since the first of this year, and I think it is an idea \nthat still should fit in a stimulus package. At a minimum, we could \nbring forward the full 10-percent bracket that still has some facets \nyet to be implemented.\n  Another way to stimulate consumption would be to establish a sales \ntax holiday, as some of my colleagues have proposed. This approach has \na lot of merit and could be effective in promoting economic activity--\nagain: one dollar of expenditure will lead to one dollar of activity--\nif it is limited to a short duration, and if we can overcome the \nsignificant administrative hurdles and uneven application of sales \ntaxes across the Nation. Certainly, sales taxes weigh most heavily on \nlow- and moderate-income Americans. In fact, I think sales taxes define \nthe idea of regressive taxation.\n  Beyond providing tax cuts for those who have modest incomes, most \neconomists would tell you that to inject money into the economy most \nrapidly, the best approach--contrary to a lot of political hype--is for \nGovernment to spend money directly, as long as we are able to implement \nsuch plans quickly. Can we get the shovel in the ground in the short \nrun or are we going to have debates? Are we going to have long-term \nplanning? If we could, we could get the real bang for our buck: one \ndollar spent, having real stimulus in the economy now. I especially \nthink this is a far more attractive way to stimulate the economy than \nhaving additional tax cuts for the wealthy--sort of a trickle-down \nview. Savings is an admirable process for the long-term objective. It \nleads to growth in the capacity of the economy. But we have a shortrun \nneed, with a very weak economy today. Programs that will promote \nsavings over some long period of time will not strengthen our economy \ntoday. It can really run contrary to what we need to accomplish today--\nstimulus. The Government can make, though, investments that can put \nmoney into the economy immediately.\n\n  Unlike a dollar in tax cuts, a dollar of investment, as I said, can \nyield a full dollar's worth of economic activity now. If those \ninvestments are wisely targeted, they can also expand America's long-\nterm capacity and productivity and have a multiplier effect, if you \nwill, through job creation through the exporting and purchases that are \nnecessary to implement the programs. A very straightforward, simple \nconcept is that if we put money into the economy, it will generate jobs \nand generate activity and lead to growth in the economy. We need to do \nthat.\n  If you look at the productivity growth of America after we \nimplemented our national highway program in the 1950s, we went on for \nabout 20 years and we had the highest productivity rates at any time in \nAmerica's history other than in the last 5 years. So there is no \nautomatic correlation of Government spending leading to a decline in \nproductivity or growth in the economy. We had one of the healthiest \nperiods in our history, and I think we need to follow that concept in \nthe current environment.\n  These investments can be made to happen quickly. They can be \nimplemented quickly. If we ask our young men and women to stand tall in \nAfghanistan, if we want to celebrate the heroism of our first \nresponders climbing the stairs in the World Trade Center, we also ought \nto get it together so that we can move quickly on those investments, \nthose actions that will benefit our Nation now.\n  There are many ways to use Government spending to stimulate the \neconomy. The most important in today's wartime environment is to make \ninvestments that increase our Nation's security, particularly our \nhomeland security. We need to make a major commitment to fight \nbioterrorism by strengthening our public health system, buying \nvaccines, and investing in laboratory testing and research. We need to \nbeef up security for our Nation's airports, rail systems, and ports. We \nneed to provide substantial new resources to our law enforcement \nagencies and our firefighters. There has been a bill circulating in \nCongress for the last 4 years called the FIRE bill--$3.5 billion worth \nof requests for fire equipment for our Nation's first responders. And \nwe have appropriated a mere $100 million once in that period of time.\n\n  There are enormous needs for us to follow. In New Jersey, we have \nliterally hundreds of millions of dollars of requests for resources in \nthese public security, public safety, public health arenas. Let me be \nclear. These are not porkbarrel projects. They meet real needs and \nserve the public beyond the current economic situation. So we are not \nonly stimulating the economy today, but we are setting up a stronger \nsociety for a long period of time to come; and these are investments, \njust as investments in the private sector, and can have high rates of \nreturn. We can have high rates of return in public sector investment. I \nthink we need to do that.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, and \nthe distinguished assistant majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, for \ntheir leadership in putting together a package of investments that \nought to be a part of any stimulus program. Frankly, I\n\n[[Page S11410]]\n\nthink it ought to be a bigger part. Their proposal provides for $1.6 \nbillion for local police and firefighters, $1.7 billion for Federal law \nenforcement, $2.4 billion for airport, mass transit, and Amtrak \nsecurity, and additional funds for nutrition and other programs.\n  In fact, I personally really do believe we should have gone larger \nwith that program. I might have slightly rearranged it. But this is the \ndirection we should be taking as a nation if we want to make sure we \nstimulate our economy now and provide for the public safety and \nsecurity. This initiative will provide that real stimulus, and I hope \nwe all will come together on this program and get out of this dogma of \ncomplaining and denigrating the idea that public investment doesn't \nhave real public return. These dollars can be spent now, and they can \nbe spent on very important projects that will serve our Nation.\n  Beyond the types of investments proposed by Senators Byrd and Reid, \nanother effective way to use Government spending to boost the economy \nwould be to expand our system of unemployment insurance. For example, \nmany States now fail to provide benefits for those seeking part-time \nwork, such as working mothers who need to spend part of their days with \ntheir children. Today's unemployment report shows that over the \nlast year, those who work part time have lost those opportunities. It \nhas grown to over a million persons, most of whom are women. This \ndiscrimination against working moms, by leaving them out of the \nunemployment system, is both bad social policy and foolish economic \npolicy. We ought to do something about it.\n\n  Similarly, we should increase the level of unemployment benefits if \nwe want to make sure that those who are temporarily out of the job \nforce have the ability to continue to function. The unemployed are \nalmost certain to spend money we offer them. Again, $1 expended gets $1 \nof input into the economy. So beefing up their benefits is just good \nstimulative economic policy. This is where we should be helping out, \nnot focusing on those who have already done well and are well situated \nin the economy.\n  Unemployment expenditures also have the advantage of when the economy \ngrows, they go away; they are temporary. They meet a need, but when \nthey are no longer necessary because people go back to work, they end. \nWe really should be focusing on making sure that our unemployment \ncompensation system is updated for the 21st century, brings more folks \nin and is more appropriate for the circumstances of today. It is a real \nstimulus program. We have supported corporate America through any \nnumber of tax and safety net programs. It is time to focus on people. \nUnder current circumstances, this is a classic win-win.\n  Another way to use Government spending to improve the economy is to \nhelp the unemployed, or other Americans, afford health care. That is \nwhy I support proposals to increase support for those who lose their \njobs and who should buy health care through COBRA extension also. It is \ngood health care policy and good economics. It will certainly avoid the \nrunup of expenditures on uninsured at hospitals, charity care that will \nfollow if we don't have these systems in place.\n  After all, when people lose their jobs, they should not be forced to \nchoose between basic needs such as housing, education, health care, and \nsenior support at home. They should confidently be seeking future \nemployment, and this program should be robust, in my mind. I believe \nstrongly that we ought to be offering a 75-percent payment in support \nof COBRA premiums. Again, this is money spent today that goes into the \neconomy and will be stimulative as we go forward.\n  Beyond tax cuts for those with modest incomes, and direct Government \nspending--and I see the two leaders of that concept on the floor today, \nand I want to make sure they know I compliment them on their \nsuggestions--there are tax breaks for businesses that can help, \nprovided that they are well-designed and they produce an immediate \ncorporate response.\n  In particular, I support providing tax credits to encourage \nbusinesses to make investments in the short-term. Recently, Bill Gale \nof the Brookings Institution suggested that we provide the most \nbenefits to those who make such investments in the very short term--\nsay, by the end of the first quarter of 2002--and then gradually phase \nout the benefits over the remainder of the year. This is a very simple \nconcept. If you are going to have a sale, you want to encourage people \nto use it now. I think this makes great sense.\n  It is an encouragement to businesses to speed up investments in the \npublic sector. It would target benefits to many businesses that already \nhave plans on the table. They are just holding them off because of the \nuncertainty of the environment and the times.\n\n  I also make clear that this is a one-time benefit and would reduce \npolitical pressure to turn the Tax Code into a permanent support \nprogram that may be unneeded in the long run.\n  The final approach to economic stimulus I want to mention is the \ncritical need to address the fiscal problems facing our States. There \nis an article in the paper today that shows across this Nation our \nStates are moving into budget deficits, maybe out of poor economic \nplanning, but the reality is that many of the steps they will be taking \ncan be countervailing to the steps we may take at the Federal level.\n  It does no good if the Federal Government provides significant \nstimulus and the States move in just the opposite direction; they \noffset each other. We may very well be moving into one of those \nsituations.\n  Unfortunately, because of the rigid balanced budget requirements, \nmany States are looking at significant spending cuts and/or tax \nincreases. We need to consider ways to prevent this conundrum.\n  I would support establishing targeted revenue sharing to States in \nneed--and I do mean targeted--so that this money is not used for \nfurther tax cuts. They would be serving the particular needs that \nCongress may have mandated in other areas, and we ought to be very \nclear about it.\n  Ideally, such a system could work both ways: Shifting money to States \nduring times of economic slowdown and shifting money back during \nperiods of economic growth.\n  Having said that, given the need to act quickly, it may be the more \npractical way of accomplishing this is through the Medicaid match \nprovided to the States. This would use an existing regulatory structure \nand could be implemented very rapidly where a revenue-sharing program \nmight take longer to be implemented.\n  In any case, we cannot ignore this conflict that may very well negate \nthe efforts we take here and having the States be a drag on our economy \njust when we need most to lift up the economy.\n  All the proposals I have outlined today would provide real help to \nour economy, and most economists would agree, I believe, we should \nstructure a program that errs on the side of being aggressive as \nopposed to wondering whether we are dealing with serious downside \nrisks.\n  We need an insurance program against the kinds of actions that we \nmeasure, that were reported today in the unemployment statistics, and \nwe see across the Nation. I believe we ought to make our mistakes by \nbeing certain that we have a strong economy, as opposed to being \ninsecure about that. I hope we will take that into consideration, and \nif there are choices to be made, I believe we ought to do those on the \nstimulative side now.\n  While I believe we should pursue those stimulative short-term \npolicies, we should take affirmative steps to address fiscal imbalances \nin the long term--again, the basic formula I talked about: short-term \nstimulus, long-term discipline. In particular, it is critical that we \nrevisit--and I truly believe we must revisit--the tax cut that was \nenacted earlier this year. If left fully in place, this legislation \nwill drain significant revenue from the Treasury and, in the long-term \ncontext, substantially weaken our financial condition just as the baby \nboomers are about to retire.\n  I know many of my colleagues believe these tax cuts were affordable \nwhen we debated them earlier this year. We can have a debate about \nwhether they were or were not at that point in time, but the times have \nchanged and they have changed dramatically. We now face a substantially \nweakened economy, dramatically lower productivity in our economy, and \nhuge\n\n[[Page S11411]]\n\ncosts for a long-term war against terrorism.\n  Given these changed conditions, I hope some of my colleagues will \nreconsider their views on the full tax-cut package and recognize the \nneed to suspend some of the provisions that are set to be implemented \nin the future.\n  By the way, 65 percent of those cuts come after year 5 because, as \nmost economists would agree, maintaining fiscal discipline in the long \nterm is just as important as stimulating the economy in the shortrun.\n  Unfortunately, while there is broad, if not universal, consensus \namong economists about the principles that should guide fiscal policy, \nmany in Washington think they know better, and they are pushing \nproposals that, in my mind, simply make no sense and really do \nchallenge whether we are all working together in an economic sense to \nstrengthen this country the way we are working in our war on terrorism.\n  The House of Representatives and Senate Republicans are promoting a \nstimulus package that would do very little to immediately stimulate the \neconomy. The House and Senate Republican bills masquerade the stimulus, \nbut they are both little more than an ideological repetition of \nprograms designed to help those who need it least and favor special \ninterests--a giveaway with limited economic benefits.\n  According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities, the House bill would provide between 80 and 90 \npercent of its tax cuts to higher income taxpayers and corporations. It \nis just the opposite of how we get stimulus into the economy today.\n  The bill eliminates the corporate alternative minimum tax, or AMT. \nAMT is designed to prevent corporations from avoiding taxes entirely \nthrough the use of deductions and various other tax benefits. Repealing \nthe AMT will not generate real economic activity. There is no guarantee \nit will do anything other than change the bottom line of the \ncorporations.\n  Many corporations may well apply some of these savings to reducing \ndebts, mergers, acquisitions, or increasing their bottom line, but \nthere is no guarantee they will invest. That might benefit the \nshareholders, but it will not stimulate the economy.\n  The House and Senate Republican bills would also reduce capital gains \ntaxes. Reasonable people can and do disagree about the effect of such a \nreduction on long-term economic growth but, regardless of one's view \nabout the ultimate merits of reducing capital gains taxes, I do not \nknow a single economist who would argue that it is a powerful way to \nstimulate economic activity in the short term, at least compared with \nany of the other possible approaches.\n  This same analysis applies to other provisions in the House and \nSenate Republican bills. It would accelerate a reduction in tax rates \nfor those with higher incomes, just the opposite of where we should be \nfor our long-term economic stability. We need to focus on how we are \ngoing to manage our fiscal affairs when these baby boomers start \nretiring.\n  Accelerating a reduction in tax rates is going to exacerbate a \nproblem we already put in place with this previous tax cut.\n  In any case, regardless of one's view about the merits of cutting \ntaxes for those with higher incomes, it is simply not credible to argue \nthat of all the possible approaches to stimulating the economy, these \nare the most beneficial, and one cannot argue these are the most \npowerful. Such a claim is just not credible and does not relate to \nobjective facts.\n  I also emphasize the provisions in the House bill are not temporary \nmeasures; they are permanent tax cuts with huge long-term costs, just \nexactly what the budget chairmen in both Houses and the ranking members \nargued we should not do, and as such they undermine the fiscal \ndiscipline and almost certainly will put pressure on long-term interest \nrates over some period of time.\n  I have spent most of my life as a business person and as a bond \ntrader, someone who worked in financial markets looking at these kinds \nof policies as they worked their way through the marketplace. I can \nassure my colleagues that fiscally irresponsible tax cuts, such as the \nones that are on the table in the House of Representatives, will affect \ninvestors and will undermine the long-term health of our financial \nsystem, if not our economic system broadly. The end result will be \nhigher mortgage rates, less business investment, and a weaker economy.\n  Meanwhile, the House stimulus bill puts very little money into the \neconomy directly.\n  There is no investment in our infrastructure, no investment in our \nNation's security, only tax cuts for those who are already doing well--\nmostly for corporations and mostly for those that are doing well.\n  To be blunt about it, I think this is wrong-headed economic policy. \nPerhaps because of my private sector background, I find it especially \nalarming.\n  Our Nation faces an economic emergency. We need to be addressing it \nin an objective and legitimate way so we do not turn our backs on a \nneed that is very obvious to everyone and get into political debates. \nWe need to deal with it directly.\n  I think we are fiddling while Rome is burning. We simply cannot \nafford to continue business as usual. We have to pull things together, \nminimize differences and focus on what is important to get the job \ndone. Our economy is at stake. We are all in this together. We cannot \nlet the events of September 11 get us off the track of this great \nNation, this great economy-- doing those things which were done \nthroughout the 1990s and continued as we started this century.\n  We need to move with a bipartisan, objective package that will lead \nto real economic growth, and we need to do it now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to speak on my amendment \nthat would express the sense of the Senate regarding the release of \nemergency funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. I \nthank the administration for the significant release of LIHEAP funds 2 \nweeks ago. As OMB Director Mitch Daniels and I discussed just before \nthe funds were released, this money is critical to Maine and the \nNation. I thank both Mr. Daniels and the President for releasing $750 \nmillion in fiscal year 2002 LIHEAP funds to help low-income American \nfamilies heat their homes this winter.\n  While I am grateful for the release of these funds, I also call upon \nthe administration to release the $300 million in fiscal year 2001 \nemergency funds provided in the Supplemental Appropriations Act of \n2001. This amount was $150 million greater than the administration's \nrequest. The report language specifically directed that at least $150 \nmillion of these funds were to be used to address unmet needs resulting \nfrom last winter's high energy prices. The other half of the money was \ndirected to be used to meet the most critical needs arising from energy \ncosts increases, significant increases in arrearages and \ndisconnections, and increases in unemployment, among other things. \nDespite this direction, the money still has not been released.\n  Let me explain why those extra funds are necessary. Last winter was a \nvery difficult winter. The price of home heating oil was $1.56 last \nwinter, compared to $1.03 the winter before and just 78 cents the \nwinter before that. In short, heating oil prices jumped 100 percent in \njust 2 years. In many cases we saw even worse spikes in the price of \nnatural gas.\n  At the same time, the average LIHEAP benefit fell by over $100, from \n$488 in 1999 to $350 in 2000. Because so many people were in need of \nassistance, the CAP agencies simply didn't have enough money to provide \nthe same benefit that they had in prior years. The result was that the \naverage LIHEAP benefit bought less than half the oil in 2000 than it \ndid in 1999.\n  That made for a very difficult winter for many people. In fact, many \npeople are still trying to recover last winter's high energy prices. \nThis past summer, some families had their power cut off because they \nwere unable to pay back their high wintertime heating bills. In Maine, \n26,000 people received disconnect notices in the month of July alone.\n  While I am grateful for the administration's recent release of LIHEAP \nfunds, that money will do little to help people recover from last \nwinter. In the State of Maine, regular year fiscal year 2002 LIHEAP \nmoney cannot be used to address arrearages or disconnections that \noccurred prior to October 1, 2001. That is one of the reasons we put an \nextra $150 million in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, and included \nlanguage in the conference report directing that the money be spent on \narrearages, disconnections, and unmet energy needs resulting from the \nhigh price of energy last winter.\n  Some States allow fiscal year 2002 funds to be spent on prior year \nexpenses. While that may provide short-term assistance, spending this \nyear's funds on last year's winter is likely to lead to a shortage of \nfunds this winter as well. It is not a real solution.\n  I am also concerned that States will be able to provide less \nweatherization assistance this year. Since an ounce of prevention is \nworth a pound of cure, Maine typically spends the maximum allowable \namount of LIHEAP funds to weatherize homes. But when we are still \nstruggling to recover from the prior winter, less money is available \nfor weatherization.\n  My amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the President \nshould immediately release the $300 million in emergency LIHEAP funding \nprovided by the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2001. I am very \npleased that Senators Chafee, Kerry, Snowe, Wellstone, and Sarbanes \nhave also joined me on this amendment. This money was intended to help \npeople recover from the high energy prices of last winter. It will help \nmany of those families most in need of assistance. In these difficult \neconomic times, there is just no reason not to release money that has \nalready been appropriated that will help people get through the winter. \nI would like to thank the managers of the bill, Senator Harkin and \nSenator Specter, for accepting this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/02/senate-section/article/S11412-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nthis year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred November 5, \n1997 in Hollywood, CA. Two male transvestites were accosted by two men \nwho attacked them and used anti-gay epithets. Joshua Urena, 21, was \nsentenced to 180 days in jail and David Miller, 20, was sentenced to \n220 days in jail.

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na Kentuckian who recently passed away after a long-battle with cancer. \nMs. Gloria Margaret Gillespie was a friend to many on Capitol Hill. She \nworked as a hairdresser in the United States Senate, cutting the hair \nof many Members of Congress and staff, including a few of my own. You \ncould always count on Gloria being in a good mood. Her great smile and \nsouthern charm lit up the halls of the Russell Senate Office Building. \nDuring her years on the Hill, she made many friends, including her \nfellow colleagues in the Senate Barber Shop who have many fond memories \nof Gloria. We all grew to love her, and she will be missed.\n  For 29 years, Gloria worked as a hairdresser in the beauty salon that \nserved the Senate. My staff loved going to see her because they said \nshe had magic scissors, great stories, and a wonderful southern accent. \nI loved to hear about their conversations with Gloria, and how she \nloved Kentucky and her family and friends back home in Berea. She made \nmy staff feel right at home in her barber chair. Gloria kept them \ninformed on what was going on back home. She enjoyed talking about \nBerea, and her true love, the University of Kentucky Wildcats. Gloria \nwas one of the biggest Wildcat fans on Capitol Hill, and it was always \na treat to hear her stories the day after a big game. Gloria loved the \nCats, and if you\n\n[[Page S11413]]\n\never wanted to know anything about them, she was the one to ask.\n  Before moving to Capitol Hill, Gloria attended Eastern Kentucky \nUniversity in Richmond, KY, and eventually she ended up in beauty \nschool. After finishing beauty school, she decided to pack her bags and \nleave Kentucky for the Nation's Capitol. Once arriving in Washington, \nshe landed a job in the U.S. Senate beauty salon where she cut the hair \nof Senators and their staffs.\n  Gloria is survived by her parents C.H. and Mary Frances Gillespie of \nBerea, and many family and friends in Kentucky and here in Washington, \nDC. I ask that my colleagues in the Senate, many of whom spent a lot of \ntime in her chair, join me in honoring the memory of Gloria Margaret \nGillespie. She was an outstanding Kentuckian, and she will be \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/02/senate-section/article/S11413-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CURTIS HAGE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

A bill to strengthen the safety net for agricultural \nproducers, to enhance resource conservation and rural development, to \nprovide for farm credit, agricultural research, nutrition, and related \nprograms, to ensure consumers abundant food and fiber, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nAgriculture, Conservation and Rural Enhancement Act of 2001. The \nlegislation is a solid starting point for the next farm bill. This bill \nrepresents a comprehensive, balanced approached that protects farm \nincome, promotes conservation, expands production of farm-based \nrenewable energy and creates new economic opportunities in\n\n[[Page S11414]]\n\nrural communities. The bill is the right approach to farm policy in the \n21st Century because it builds on successful core farm programs and \ncharts a new, conservation-oriented agriculture policy for the future.\n  My legislation uses a four-pronged approach to make good on our \ncommitments to American farmers and rural communities. These four \ncomponents--promoting conservation, protecting and boosting farm \nincome, expanding jobs and economic opportunities in rural communities \nand increasing renewable energy production--provide the solid \nfoundation we need to help ensure our farm families and rural areas \nprosper.\n  First, conservation is a cornerstone of the bill, including the \ncreation of the Conservation Security Act, (CSA). This program provides \nflexible incentives for farmers to engage in new conservation practices \non working agriculture land and rewards farmers who already employ \nthem. In addition to CSA, the bill increases acreage for the \nConservation Reserve Program and Wetlands Reserve Program. It also \nincreases the funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program \nas well as the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program. The bill also \nexpands the farm land protection program, enacts a new grassland \nreserve program and permanently authorizes the Resource Conservation \nand Development program.\n  While rewarding farmers for conservation practices that benefit all \nof society is an important way to meet our commitment to farmers, \nproviding solid income protection is equally important. The bill will \nimprove farm income by increasing loan rates for most commodities, \nsetting a floor on those rates, continuing fixed direct payments and \ncreating a new counter-cyclical income protection system.\n  As all of my colleagues are aware, the farm bill must address the \nneeds of others in addition to farmers and ranchers. This legislation \nwill improve the quality of life for all of America's rural communities \nby creating jobs and economic growth in rural areas. The Rural \nDevelopment title of this bill provides grants and loan programs to \nhelp create and expand businesses to provide jobs and assists \ncommunities by helping improve their community facilities. The title \nalso expands grants for farmer-based groups, to help them add value to \ntheir production, helping to boost farm income and create jobs, it \nprovides funding to expand broadband access for rural Americans, and \nprovides grants to improve firefighter and first responder training.\n  The fourth prong of the my approach is increasing renewable energy \nproduction. This proposal provides a full range of initiatives designed \nto help and encourage farmers and ranchers to develop renewable energy \nprojects including wind, solar, biomass and geothermal sources. These \nprojects will help boost farm and rural incomes, improve air quality \nand promote the nation's energy security.\n  While the bill emphasizes a four-pronged approach, it is \ncomprehensive in nature. The bill also includes important titles on \nnutrition, research, forestry, credit, competition, and trade that when \ntaken together form a proposal that moves farm policy in the right \ndirection in the 21st century.\n  I hope the Senate will be able to move quickly on this legislation. I \nwill continue to work with members of the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition and Forestry in an open process to help meet our commitments \nto farm families and all members of rural communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a summary of the \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               A Summary\n\n     TITLE I--Commodity Programs\n       The bill authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts \n     with producers of wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, \n     rice, soybeans, minor oilseeds, and upland cotton that \n     entitle producers to receive direct payments on eligible \n     cropland for the 2003 through 2006 fiscal years and counter-\n     cyclical payments on eligible cropland for the 2002 through \n     2006 crop years. The bill establishes the direct payment rate \n     and a target revenue per crop acre for each of the covered \n     commodities. Producers will report their crop acreage and \n     yields during the base period of 1998 to 2001 to determine \n     updated base acres and payment yields.\n       Nonrecourse loans are available for all covered commodities \n     plus extra long staple cotton, wool, mohair, honey, dry peas, \n     lentils and chickpeas. Loan rates are increased from current \n     levels for all covered commodities except oilseeds. The \n     soybean loan rate is decreased by 6 cents per bushel and the \n     loan rates for minor oilseeds are fixed at current rates. The \n     marketing loan provisions and loan deficiency payments of \n     current law are continued. The bill limits loan eligibility \n     across all loan commodities by establishing a maximum number \n     of units eligible for the loan.\n       To be eligible for contract payments or loan benefits \n     producers must meet conservation compliance and wetlands \n     protection. Further, contract acreage must use the land for \n     an agricultural or conserving use and can be planted to any \n     crop except most fruits and vegetables.\n       The bill extends the milk price support program at $9.90 \n     per hundredweight through 2006. It eliminates the marketing \n     assessment on sugar and authorizes the Secretary to implement \n     allotments on domestic sugar production. The bill extends the \n     current peanut program.\n\n\n                         title ii--Conservation\n\n       The Conservation title provides a comprehensive, national \n     approach to voluntary conservation. For the first time, all \n     farmers and ranchers and livestock owners will have the full \n     range of options for employing conservation practices on \n     their lands in production and for lands taken out of \n     production. The title enhances the existing proven \n     conservation programs by increasing funding and including \n     important policy changes. Two new programs, a broad-based \n     incentive program for all land-based production and a \n     grasslands easement program, complete the array of \n     agricultural conservation programs.\n       The centerpiece of the new conservation title is the \n     Conservation Security Act (CSA), a broad-based voluntary \n     locally-driven incentives program for conservation on working \n     land. Farmers receive payments for maintaining or adopting \n     conservation practices. Providing incentive payments to \n     farmers to maintain conservation practices ensures retaining \n     the important environmentally successful accomplishments \n     already occurring on farms and ranches. Using the CSA, \n     farmers and ranchers will have the tools to enhance wildlife \n     habitat and implement environmentally-sound practices on land \n     in production leading to improved water, air and soil quality \n     and increased wildlife populations.\n       The bill also increases funding for current conservation \n     programs with a proven record of enhancing natural resources. \n     The bill increases acreage for the Conservation Reserve \n     Program (CRP) to 40 million acres from the current 36.4 \n     million acre limit and reserves 4 million acres for the \n     Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program and lands enrolled \n     through the continuous program. The Secretary had the \n     discretion to enroll up to 3 million acres as permanent \n     easements. The lands removed from production and enrolled in \n     CRP have helped to create important habitat for wildlife, \n     improve water quality and reduce soil erosion.\n       Through the bill, the up to 250,000 acres of valuable \n     wetlands may be enrolled annually in the Wetlands Reserve \n     Program (WRP) for a 10 year total of 2.5 million acres. WRP \n     has helped to restore over a million acres of wetlands which \n     provide critical wildlife habitat and improve water quality.\n       Funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program \n     (EQIP) is increased up to $950 million a year, by the fourth \n     year of implementation. These funds includes a $100 million \n     annual fund for livestock operations to obtain loans for the \n     construction of livestock manure management facilities.\n       Funding for the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program ramps \n     up to $100 million annually. In addition to the current \n     provisions to provide cost-share assistance for restoration \n     of wildlife habitat, the Secretary will have the discretion \n     to enroll lands under long-term and permanent easements.\n       The Agricultural Land Protection Program (formerly the \n     Farmland Protection Program) is expanded to include the \n     purchase of non-development easements on prairie and ranch \n     land. Over four years, the annual funding ramps to $250 \n     million.\n       A new grassland reserve program to purchase permanent and \n     long-term easements on up to 1 million acres of grass and \n     prairie lands is created.\n       The bill further permanently authorizes the Resource \n     Conservation and Development program to encourage stronger \n     local-federal partnerships for increased conservation and \n     resource-based programs to enhance rural economies and \n     increases access and funding for technical assistance to help \n     farmers implement the conservation programs on agricultural \n     lands.\n       Creates the first comprehensive, voluntary approach to \n     conservation incentive payments that provides income to \n     producers who adopt or maintain conservation practices on \n     working lands, including rewarding good actors and open to \n     crop and livestock producers for land-based practices.\n\n\n                            TITLE III--Trade\n\n       The trade title meets the objectives that Senator Lugar and \n     I agreed to last month--to help develop new export \n     opportunities abroad in commercial markets, and improve the \n     operation and capacity of U.S. food aid programs. The title \n     spends about $2.1 billion over the ten-year period, roughly \n     split between the commercial export programs and food aid \n     programs.\n\n[[Page S11415]]\n\n       While we have seen in recent years that export markets do \n     not serve as a reliable safety net, trade is and will \n     continue to be a key outlet for U.S. agricultural products. \n     Our export programs, such as the export credit programs and \n     the Market Access Program, which we expand and improve in \n     this bill, play an important role in our ability to compete \n     internationally. We also put additional resources into the \n     Cooperator program, which helps our agricultural groups \n     service customers in overseas markets.\n       Over the last several decades, the United States has been \n     the world's leading donor in international food aid programs. \n     I firmly believe that our humanitarian activities throughout \n     the developing world must be an important component of our \n     long-term effort to combat terrorism.\n       Toward that end, the bill establishes the International \n     Food for Education and Child Nutrition program for a four-\n     year period. This proposal was introduced last year by George \n     McGovern and Bob Dole, our former colleagues who once sat in \n     this very chamber. It is based on the simple yet powerful \n     notion that a well-nourished child is more likely to learn, \n     and that the availability of food is more likely to bring \n     that child of a poor family into school in the first place, \n     and out of the factories, fields, and sweat shops of the \n     Third World. The UN's World Food Program estimates that there \n     are 300 million children worldwide in such a situation.\n       The trade title provides more resources for the existing \n     Food for Progress program. It also reforms and streamlines \n     the operations of all food aid programs run by the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Agency for \n     International Development. These changes should allow the \n     private voluntary organizations who conduct these projects to \n     devote their energy to helping people on the ground rather \n     than to pushing papers through bureaucracies.\n\n\n                          TITLE IV--Nutrition\n\n       Title IV includes nutrition provisions. Representing the \n     largest of the Federal nutrition programs and up for \n     reauthorization in 2002, the Food Stamp Program is the \n     primary focus of the title. The program mainly assists \n     children (50%), older Americans (10%), and Americans with \n     disabilities (10%). Most of the other participants are \n     individuals in working families. The Food Stamp Program is \n     essential to transition from welfare to work. However, data \n     show that reforms to the program are needed. These include \n     simplifying the program, ensuring a more smooth transition \n     from welfare to work, reforming the quality control system \n     used to evaluate a state's performance, improving outreach \n     efforts to make sure that people who qualify for the program \n     are able to participate, and extending benefits to certain \n     groups made ineligible by welfare reform. Between 1994-98 the \n     number of people who were eligible for the program but did \n     not participate increased by 12 percentage points, while the \n     reliance in emergency feeding sites like soup kitchens and \n     food pantries increased dramatically.\n       Some of the provisions that aim to simplify the Food Stamp \n     Program include: allowing the states to conform Food Stamp \n     income rules with those in TANF cash assistance or Medicaid \n     and resource rules with those of TANF; simplifying the way in \n     which housing costs are calculated; encouraging the states to \n     adopt standard deductions, including ones for utility \n     allowances and for people who live in certain group living \n     arrangements; amending the procedure for determining earned \n     income; extending semi-annual reporting to all households, \n     and not just those who have earnings; better conforming to \n     recertification rules in Medicaid, SSI, and SCHIP by allowing \n     periodic redetermination.\n       Provisions that will help participants to more successfully \n     transition from welfare to work include: an increase in the \n     standard deduction to adjust for family size and will provide \n     larger families with additional benefits and increasing the \n     length of time that a household can receive transitional \n     benefits when they stop receiving TANF cash assistance. The \n     title also includes provisions that help us to reach out to \n     other people with needs. For example, the bill prohibits \n     cutting off benefits for participants, like the elderly, who \n     tend to be eligible for a small amount of benefits and may \n     want to save them up for up to 6 months before using them. It \n     also allows able-bodied adults without dependents to \n     participate in the Food Stamp Program for 6 out of 24 months, \n     rather than the current 3 out of 36 months, to give them more \n     time to successfully find employment but the bill \n     also eliminates the provision that 80% of all education \n     and training funds made available through the program be \n     made available for this population only. Pilot programs to \n     improve on outreach and access are also included in the \n     bill.\n       The quality control system used to assess the states' \n     performance is revamped to be less punitive. The bill does \n     institute new sanction procedures and rewards based on low \n     error rates, compliance with a number of deadlines, and a \n     state's enrollment of working families. Other provisions in \n     the Food Stamp subtitle include expanding the definition of \n     food products to include vitamin-mineral supplements, \n     eliminating federal cost-neutrality rules for Electronic \n     Benefits Transfer (EBT) systems, and several administrative \n     provisions.\n       The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of \n     1996 eliminated the ability of most legal aliens to \n     participate in the Food Stamp Programs. Over time, a number \n     of bills have restored some of these benefits to some \n     children, older adults, and disabled adults who were in the \n     United States prior to August 22, 1996. This bill \n     concentrates on particularly vulnerable groups by restoring \n     benefits to all legal alien children and the disabled. It \n     also removes a 7 year cap on the ability of refugees/asylees \n     to participate in the program. Finally, it reduces, from 40 \n     to 16 quarters, the length of time that individuals have to \n     work in this country before they are eligible to participate \n     in the Food Stamp Program.\n       The title also reauthorizes a number of programs like the \n     Food Distribution on Indian Reservations, the Commodity \n     Supplemental Food Program, the Community Food Projects, it \n     consolidates the American Samoa block grant and the Puerto \n     Rico Nutrition Assistance Programs and reauthorizes them, and \n     it reauthorizes and increases the funding by $40 million per \n     year, for the Emergency Food Assistance Program. A \n     Congressional Hunger Fellowship is established, a pilot \n     program through which some schoolchildren will receive free \n     fruits and vegetables is conducted. A separate title includes \n     funding for the Senior Farmers' Market Program as well as for \n     additional commodities for the School Lunch Program.\n\n\n                            TITLE V--Credit\n\n       The credit title reauthorizes all USDA farm direct and \n     guaranteed loan programs and increases the loan authorization \n     levels: $3.75 billion for each fiscal year; with $750 million \n     for direct loans annually--$200 million for farm ownership \n     (FO) loans and $550 million for farm operating (OL) loans; \n     and $3 billion for guaranteed loans--$1 billion for FO loans \n     and $2 billion for OL loans.\n       The main emphasis of the title is to make credit more \n     accessible to beginning farmers and ranchers. Among other \n     things, the title broadens the eligibility for direct \n     ownership loans to those who have participated in the \n     business operations of a farm operation for at least three \n     years, as opposed to being the sole manager of the \n     operation. The title provides the Secretary the authority \n     to refinance ``bridge loans'' made by a commercial lender \n     to a beginning farmer or rancher who has been approved for \n     a USDA farm ownership loan but is awaiting funding. The \n     title increases the limit on direct farm ownership debt \n     for a beginning farmer or rancher from $200,000 to \n     $250,000 and indexes the amount to inflation. The title \n     provides that as part of the down payment program for \n     beginning farmers and ranchers, USDA shall finance 40 \n     percent of the loan (current law is 30 percent) and \n     provide a repayment term of 20 years (current law is 10 \n     years). The title directs the Secretary to create a pilot \n     program in which the Secretary will guarantee loans made \n     by a private seller of a farm or ranch to a qualified \n     beginning farmer on a contract land sale basis. The title \n     provides that beginning farmers and ranchers receive an \n     additional 1 percent interest rate subsidy (capped at 4 \n     percent) over non-beginning farmers (capped at 3 percent) \n     who participate in the program and increases the maximum \n     amount of funds for this program to $750 million and \n     provides that 25 percent of the program's subsidized funds \n     are reserved for assisting beginning farmers and ranchers \n     until April 1 of each fiscal year.\n       The title also makes other changes to provisions of the \n     Consolidate Farm and Rural Development Act to improve the \n     USDA farm lending programs. Among other things, the title \n     allows the Secretary to waive term limits for a farmer or \n     rancher, one time only, for a period of two years. The title \n     allows the Secretary to waive term limitations for Native \n     American farm operations on tribal lands if she determines \n     that commercial credit is not generally available for such \n     operations. The title expands USDA's authority to allow the \n     interest rate on a direct loan that is being rewritten to be \n     the rate in effect on the date that a borrower applies for \n     servicing. The title reduces paperwork requirements by \n     raising the low documentation loan amount for a guaranteed \n     loan from $50,000 to $100,000. The title makes permanent the \n     interest rate reduction program. The title provides that the \n     Secretary work with the State Conservationists to consider \n     selling or granting easements on inventory land for the \n     purpose of farmland preservation. The title also provides \n     those who owe recapture amounts on shared appreciation \n     agreements or those who have amortized the recapture amounts, \n     the option of providing farmland protection and conservation \n     use easements on their land in return for forgiveness of the \n     recapture amount.\n       Finally, the title amends the authorities provided to \n     Farmer Mac and the Farm Credit System. The title increases \n     the number of Farmer MAC Board of Directors from 15 to 17 and \n     provides that the chairperson of the board will be elected by \n     the board. The title provides the Farm Credit System \n     authority to finance agriculturally related equipment and \n     goods overseas irrespective of whether these goods will be \n     used on the farm in the importing country. The title provides \n     the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation the ability to \n     recognize the lower risk associated with the certain \n     guaranteed loans and to adjust premiums charged to the Farm \n     Credit System accordingly. The title also eliminates \n     certain ``territorial concurrence'' requirements on Farm \n     Credit System lenders so that the lenders can participate \n     in syndicated or ``participation'' loans in other\n\n[[Page S11416]]\n\n     Farm Credit System geographic territories without seeking \n     the permission of the Farm Credit System lender in that \n     territory.\n\n\n                      title vi--rural development\n\n       The Rural Development Title focuses on need to improve the \n     ability of rural businesses to acquire capital, particularly \n     equity capital. It provides considerable assistance to help \n     communities develop and economic development strategies and \n     it provides for improved facilities, particularly to make \n     broadband access far more available in Rural America. I am \n     particularly pleased to include a provision to provide for \n     training for fire fighters and first responders.\n       The limited availability of equity capital is a significant \n     obstacle to business development and growth in rural \n     communities. The Rural Development Title addresses this \n     problem by establishing two new programs to spur equity \n     investment in rural America. First, the National Rural \n     Cooperative and Business Equity Fund provides up to $150 \n     million in federal funds, to be matched by funds from private \n     investors. The Secretary of Agriculture will guarantee 50% of \n     the investments by private investors up to a total guarantee \n     of $300 million. The Fund will make equity and semi-equity \n     investments in a variety of rural businesses, with a \n     significant share of those being smaller enterprises.\n       Second, the Rural Business Investment Program is modeled on \n     the Small Business Administration's Small Business Investment \n     Program. It creates Rural Business Investment Companies. It \n     also provides grants for technical assistance.\n       Both new equity investment programs are based on business \n     development programs administered by SBA, which have been \n     successful in spurring economic growth but have not \n     adequately addressed the needs of rural communities. Both new \n     programs make use of SBA expertise by requiring the Secretary \n     of Agriculture to work with SBA to administer the programs.\n       The Rural Development Title expands eligibility for Value-\n     Added Agricultural Market Development Grants and provides $75 \n     million a year in funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation \n     to carry out the grant program. It also creates a 5% reserve \n     within the program for certified organic agricultural \n     products. It broadens the business and industry loan \n     guarantee program. It funds a new microloan program to assist \n     rural entrepreneurs in starting new businesses with small \n     loans and continuing technical assistance. It establishes \n     a simplified ``low documentation'' application process for \n     certain rural development loan and grant programs to \n     reduce administrative burdens for participants. It insures \n     continued funding for the Rural Economic Development Loan \n     and Grant Program, which provides loans and grants to \n     Rural Electric Cooperatives, through fees on guarantees of \n     RUS qualified bonds. It authorizes grants to \n     multigovernmental organizations to provide assistance to \n     local governments.\n       This Title also promotes improvements in rural \n     infrastructure and emergency response capabilities by: \n     providing $100 million a year in funding for loans and grants \n     to improve access to broadband in rural areas, and $75 \n     million over the life of the bill to improve access to local \n     television in rural areas; providing full funding to \n     eliminate the backlog in pending applications for certain \n     rural development loan and grants; creating a Rural Endowment \n     Program that provides initial planning and development grants \n     to rural areas that develop long-range, comprehensive \n     community development strategies to improve infrastructure \n     and promote economic development; reserving funds within the \n     community facilities program for day care and senior care \n     facilities; authorizing grants to regional development \n     organizations; and providing $30 million a year in funding \n     for training of firefighters and emergency medical personnel.\n\n\n                          title vii--research\n\n       The Research Title extends existing research authorizations \n     until 2006. Examples of these programs include: grants and \n     fellowships for food and agricultural sciences education, \n     education grants programs for Hispanic-serving institutions, \n     funding for policy research centers, and research equipment \n     grants. The special authorization for biosecurity planning \n     and response is amended to create a special account for \n     appropriations for agricultural research, education, and \n     extension activities for biosecurity planning and response. \n     Under this section funds may be used under any authority \n     available to the Secretary in order to reduce the \n     vulnerability of the United States food and agricultural \n     system to chemical or biological attack.\n       The Research Title increases funding for the Initiative for \n     Future Food and Agriculture Systems. This program directs \n     research funding to agriculture priority areas through a \n     competitive grant system.\n       The Research Title creates a new program for Rural Research \n     funded at $15 million a year. The program authorizes a fund \n     for rural policy research on topics such as: rural \n     sociology, effects of demographic change, needs of groups \n     of rural citizens, rural community development, rural \n     infrastructure, rural business development, rural \n     education and extension programs, and rural health. These \n     programs will help discover the policy tools necessary to \n     create a solid foundation within rural communities which \n     will sustain long-term growth.\n       The Research Title creates a new program for beginning \n     farmers and ranchers at a level of $15 million a year. The \n     program will provide competitive grants to support new and \n     established local and regional training, education, outreach, \n     and technical assistance initiatives aimed at beginning \n     farmers or ranchers. Among other advantages, this program \n     will allow new farmers or ranchers to acquire \n     entrepreneurial, financial, and other business skills; \n     conservation assistance; risk management education; \n     innovative farm and ranch transfer strategies; and basic \n     livestock and crop farming practices. In addition, 25 percent \n     of the funds are set aside to be used to support programs and \n     services that address the needs of limited resource and \n     socially disadvantaged beginning farmers or ranchers.\n\n\n                          TITLE VIII--Forestry\n\n       Federal forestry assistance for non-federal landowners has \n     been a part of US Department of Agriculture programs for more \n     than a century. We continue the Department's longstanding \n     commitment to provide important forestry assistance to \n     private landowners in the forestry title of the farm bill.\n       With over nine million non-industrial private forest \n     landowners owning over 330 million acres nationwide, their \n     ability to have access to technical, financial, and \n     educational assistance from government sources will largely \n     determine the quality of those forests and associated public \n     benefits such as clean water and watersheds, wildlife \n     preservation, recreational resources, soil quality, reduced \n     erosion, and forest health and productivity.\n       There are several new programs to address a wide array of \n     private forest land issues. The sustainable forest management \n     program will provide cost-share assistance to non-industrial \n     private forest landowners around the country. The program is \n     administered by the Secretary, acting through the State \n     foresters, and in coordination with the State stewardship \n     committees. The program affords states flexibility to address \n     a variety of multiple resource objectives, including soil, \n     air and water quality, soil erosion, agroforestry, fish and \n     wildlife habitat, the control of invasive species, forest \n     health and productivity and the threat of forest \n     fragmentation and catastrophic wildfire.\n       There is also a new program to assist in the development of \n     sustainable forestry cooperatives at least 50% farmer or \n     rancher owned. The program will create new income streams for \n     farmers or ranchers by allowing them to pool their limited \n     forest resources, and sell value added forest products.\n       Other important initiatives include a community and private \n     land fire assistance program to focus federal efforts in \n     firefighting at the Federal, State and local levels and a \n     watershed forestry assistance program to prevent water \n     quality degradation, and address watershed issues on non-\n     federal forest land.\n\n\n                            TITLE IX--Energy\n\n       Today we face major national problems of low farm income, \n     energy shortages and price spikes, and environmental problems \n     of air pollution and global warming. Renewable energy from \n     farms will play a major role in solving all three problems. \n     Moreover, renewable energy and energy efficiency programs \n     will enhance the nation's energy security, reduce our \n     dependence on foreign oil supplies, and promote rural \n     economic development across the country.\n       The federal government has a major role to play in the \n     transformation to reliance on domestic farm and rural based \n     alternative energy. The energy title establishes several new \n     programs providing incentives to farmers, ranchers and rural \n     small businesses to develop renewable energy and biomass \n     energy supplies on their lands and to increase energy \n     efficiency.\n       A competitive grant program is established to have eligible \n     entities provide farmers, ranchers, and rural small \n     businesses energy audits which will provide cost-effective \n     recommendations for energy savings and to examine the \n     potential for renewable energy development.\n       A complementary grant and loan program is also established \n     so that farmers, ranchers, and rural small businesses can \n     purchase renewable energy systems and make energy efficiency \n     improvements. Energy savings of 30% or more can often be \n     achieved through implementing energy audit recommendations, \n     and renewable energy systems, such as wind turbines, \n     photovoltaic systems and methane digesters can significantly \n     reduce energy costs and help clean up the environment.\n       The title includes a federal agency biobased products \n     purchasing requirement if they are comparable in price, \n     performance, and availability to traditional products. In \n     addition, the Agriculture Department will develop a labeling \n     program for biobased products based on the successful Energy \n     Star program for energy efficiency. This initiative will \n     stimulate the demand for biobased products, such as soybeans, \n     corn, and other commodities and at the same time provide \n     environmental benefits.\n       A competitive grant program is also established to support \n     the commercialization of new and emerging technologies for \n     the conversion of biomass into petroleum substitutes. Just as \n     we refine petroleum into gasoline, diesel, propane, and other \n     products, we can refine agricultural wastes into ethanol, \n     plastics, hydrogen fuel, and perhaps products not yet \n     invented.\n       A new research and development program to promote \n     understanding of carbon sequestration in agriculture and \n     forestry is also a\n\n[[Page S11417]]\n\n     part of the title. It includes plans to establish benchmarks \n     and best measurement techniques, and includes funding for \n     demonstration projects for monitoring carbon sequestration. \n     This will allow farmers and others to better understand how \n     to store dangerous greenhouse gases, perhaps earning extra \n     income to provide this public benefit.\n\n\n                          TITLE X--COMPETITION\n\n       The Competition Title amends the Agricultural Fair \n     Practices Act of 1967, the Packers and Stockyards Act of \n     1921, and the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946.\n       The Competition Title includes a subtitle that makes a \n     number of amendments to the Agricultural Fair Practices Act \n     (AFPA) to address unfair and deceptive practices in \n     agricultural commerce. The subtitle establishes the Office of \n     Special Counsel for Competition Matters within the USDA to \n     investigate, prosecute, and promulgate regulations under the \n     AFPA and any other Act the Secretary deems appropriate. The \n     subtitle requires covered persons with annual sales of over \n     $100,000,000 to annually file with the Secretary a report \n     that describes strategic alliances, ownership, joint \n     ventures, subsidiaries, brand names, and interlocking boards \n     of directors in other covered persons. The subtitle defines \n     ``covered persons'' to include a dealer, handler, contractor, \n     processor, or commission merchant of agricultural commodities \n     with sales of over $10,000,000 per year. The subtitle \n     prohibits unfair and deceptive practices on the part of \n     covered persons in the marketing, purchasing, and contracting \n     of agricultural commodities. The subtitle prohibits covered \n     persons from engaging in specific practices in bargaining \n     with producers and producer associations, such as \n     restraining, coercing, retaliating against, or refusing to \n     deal with any producer who exercises his or her right to join \n     and participate in a producer association. The subtitle \n     provides minimum standards in agricultural \n     contracting, including: a requirement to act in good faith \n     in the performance and enforcement of agricultural \n     contracts, and a requirement to include a cover sheet that \n     discloses provisions of the contract including, among \n     other things, duration, factors in payment, renewal and \n     renegotiation standards, and responsibility for \n     environmental liability. The subtitle provides \n     requirements specific to production contracting, \n     including: the right to cancel a production contract \n     within three business days after the date at which the \n     production contract is executed; allowing contract \n     producers to file production contract liens and to receive \n     a security interest in the agricultural commodity or other \n     property of the covered person as allowed in the \n     applicable State law provisions based on Article 9 of the \n     Uniform Commercial Code; requiring the contract producer \n     who made at least a $100,000 investment because of the \n     production contract receive at least 90 days for the \n     contract producer to cure an alleged breach before the \n     covered person terminates the contract, and prohibiting a \n     contractor from requiring additional investments during \n     the term of the contract unless the additional investments \n     are offset by additional consideration and the contract \n     producer agrees in writing that there is an acceptable and \n     satisfactory consideration. The subtitle provides that any \n     aggrieved person may seek injunctions for acts or \n     practices prohibited by the Act; allows any person injured \n     in the business or property of the person by reason of any \n     violation of this Act may sue for a violation to recover \n     damages and recover an additional penalty of up to $1000 \n     per violation. The court allows the court to provide \n     reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing party, and \n     sets the statute of limitation at two years. The subtitle \n     provides that when the Secretary has reasonable cause to \n     believe that any covered person has engaged in any act or \n     practice that violates the Act, she may bring a civil \n     action in the U.S. district court to request preventative \n     relief. The subtitle provides that a producer of an \n     agricultural product or service may execute, as a clause \n     in an agricultural contract, an assignment of dues or fees \n     to an association of producers authorized by contract and \n     requires the covered person to deduct the portion from the \n     contract and make a payment to the producer association on \n     behalf of the producer.\n       The Title amends the Packers and Stockyards Act to provide \n     the Secretary with jurisdiction over live poultry dealers who \n     deal in all types of poultry, not just poultry for slaughter \n     and provide the Secretary the authority to bring \n     administrative actions against live poultry dealers. The \n     title also allows the Secretary to seek outside counsel in \n     the enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act.\n       The Title includes a subtitle to amend the Agricultural \n     Marketing Act of 1946 to require that retailers notify \n     consumers at the final point of sale of the country of origin \n     for beef, pork, lamb, ground beef, ground pork, ground lamb, \n     perishable agricultural commodities, and whole farm-raised \n     fish. The subtitle provides that the Secretary may require \n     that any person that prepares, stores, handles, or \n     distributes a covered commodity for retail sale maintain a \n     verifiable recordkeeping audit trail that will permit the \n     Secretary to ensure compliance with regulations promulgated \n     by the Secretary. The subtitle provides that section 253 of \n     the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 shall be the \n     enforcement provision of the subtitle.\n       The Title also requires the Secretary to conduct a \n     referendum among persons covered by an order in effect under \n     a commodity promotion law to determine whether the persons \n     favor the termination of the order at least once every five \n     years. The referenda would be conducted in accord with the \n     terms and conditions of the applicable order and commodity \n     promotion law consistent with this section. The title allows \n     eligible persons to vote in a referendum by mail ballot or by \n     such other method, instead of in-person voting, prescribed by \n     the Secretary as will reduce the burden on voters and ensure \n     the integrity of the referendum.\n       The Title also amends the Perishable Agricultural \n     Commodities Act to allow the Secretary to initiate \n     investigations of alleged violations of PACA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S.J.
