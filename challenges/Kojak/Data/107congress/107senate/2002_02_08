The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself and \n     Mr. Crapo, proposes an amendment numbered 2836.\n\n\n[[Page S514]]\n\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I am pleased to offer this amendment on \nbehalf of myself and the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to provide a predictable, \ntransparent, and equitable formula for the Department of Agriculture to \nuse in establishing beet sugar marketing allotments in the future. This \nis an amendment that enjoys widespread support within the sugar beet \nindustry. Producers in that industry recall, as I do, the very \ndifficult and contentious period just a few years ago when the \nDepartment of Agriculture last attempted to establish beet sugar \nallotments with very little direction in the law.\n  That experience left us all believing that there must be a better \nway, that we should seek a method for establishing allotments that is \nfair and open and provides some certainty and predictability to the \nindustry. On that basis, I urged members of the industry to work \ntogether to see if they could agree on a reasonable formula.\n  I am pleased to say the amendment I am offering today with the \nSenator from Idaho reflects producers' efforts to forge that consensus. \nIt provides that any future allotments will be based on each \nprocessor's weighted-average production during the years 1998 through \n2000, with authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to make \nadjustments in the formula if an individual processor experienced \ndisaster-related losses during that period or opened or closed a \nprocessing facility or increased processing capacity through improved \ntechnology to extract more sugar from beets.\n  In addition, the formula allows for adjustments in the reallocation \nof beet sugar allotments to account for such industry events as the \npermanent termination of operations by a processor, the sale of a \nprocessor's assets to another processor, the entry of new processors, \nand so on.\n  Taken together, these provisions offer the predictability, fairness, \nand transparency we all agree is much needed in the sugar beet \nindustry.\n  I should emphasize that this amendment applies only to producers of \nbeet sugar. It is not in any way directed at producers of cane sugar.\n  Again, I thank Senator Crapo for his work in support of the \namendment. I urge its adoption.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also thank the industry. This was not \neasy for them to do. As one who was centrally involved in 1995, when we \nlast faced this problem, I can tell the Senate, this is a better way of \ndealing with the problem. Instead of waiting for the problem to develop \nand then having a chaotic situation on our hands when there was no \nformula, no agreement, this provides the means of a reasonable and fair \ndistribution of allocation in the future.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2835\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, my understanding is there is an \namendment that my colleague from Idaho has introduced, or will \nintroduce--my understanding is he has introduced it--which deals with a \nban on packer ownership, an amendment which was passed by this body on \nDecember 13. This was a Johnson/Grassley/Wellstone bipartisan \namendment. It had the support of the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas, \nas well.\n  My understanding is my colleague Senator Harkin will soon do a \nsecond-degree amendment to the Craig amendment. I was concerned I may \nnot be present when that happens, so I wanted to speak about this.\n  What the Craig amendment would do is nullify this packer ownership \namendment and replace it with a study. The intent of this packer \nownership amendment is clear. It restricts the major meatpacking firms \nfrom owning livestock in a 14-day period before taking livestock to \nslaughter. What we are talking about is a a tactic used by some \npackers. It is really their own form of supply management to reduce \ncompetition. This is an amendment intended to increase competition and \nthe bargaining power of the independent producers.\n  This amendment has the support of the Nation's two largest farm and \nranch organizations: the National Farmers Union and the Farm Bureau \nFederation. They have both expressed strong support for a ban on packer \nownership of livestock, as have many other agricultural organizations \nacross the country.\n  The meatpacking industry is busily working the Halls of the Congress \nto kill our amendment because, unfortunately, some of these firms want \nto give preference to their own livestock so they do not have to pay \nthe farmers and the ranchers a fair price. What they do is they buy \nwhen prices are low, and then when prices start to go up for the \nindependent livestock producers, they dump on the market to keep prices \ndown. They are like a cartel.\n  A lot of the independent livestock producers in Minnesota and the \ncountry are sick and tired of these conglomerates muscling their way to \nthe dinner table and using their raw economic and political power to \npush the independent producers out of existence. As a matter of fact, a \nlot of taxpayers are sick of it as well. That is why this amendment, \nwhich puts some limit on payments, passed yesterday. It was a very \nimportant reform amendment.\n  Some of these packers have even taken out attack ads against some of \nus who have supported this amendment. There is a dramatic attack ad by \nSmithfield in South Dakota--I am listed with Senator Grassley, but it \nis aimed at Senator Johnson--where they basically say if this amendment \nstays in, they are not going to do any more investment in South Dakota \nor hint that they are even going to leave. I do not know whether one \ncalls that blackmail or whitemail or threat of capital strike. I am not \nsure.\n  The major question surrounding the intent of our amendment concerns \nthe meaning of the word ``control'' and whether the inclusion of that \nword in our language prohibits forward contracts or contractural \nmarketing arrangements. While all the sponsors of this amendment have \nmade it clear that the word ``control'' in the context of the ownership \nrestriction does not prohibit such arrangements, Senator Harkin's \namendment today should leave no doubt. The amendment of the Senator \nfrom Iowa makes clear that forward contracts and other marketing \narrangements do not give a packer operational control of the production \nprocess and makes it crystal clear what control is all about. We are \nnot saying you cannot have contractual arrangements with other \nproducers. We are talking about direct ownership.\n  I will discuss again the ``why'' of this amendment that passed in \nDecember. I have been having fun with this debate because it is serious \nbut you have to have a twinkle in your eye. I believe the battleground \nis to call for more free enterprise in the free enterprise system. I am \nthe conservative here calling for more competition in the food \nindustry; the independent livestock producers want a fair shake. The \npackers have their own style of supply management. Again, they act as a \ncartel and jack the independent producers around. They buy when prices \nare low. When prices go up, they dump on the market to keep prices low. \nIt is simply unacceptable.\n  We have had formal agriculture committee hearings in the State of \nMinnesota. This has been an issue for a number of years. Usually the \nprocessors with all of their power win the debate. Yesterday's vote in \nthe Senate says, when it comes to income support in government \npayments, there have to be payment limitations. We are tired of it \nbeing in such inverse relation to need. That was a reform vote.\n  Country-of-origin labeling was a reform vote. The environmental \ncredits in this bill that Senator Harkin has\n\n[[Page S515]]\n\nworked on is a reform vote. A strong energy section in this bill is a \nreform vote. Rural economic development is a reform vote. Getting the \nloan rate up, at least somewhat, is a reform vote. And this is a reform \nvote.\n  I join my colleague, Senator Harkin, who will be introducing the \nsecond-degree amendment. I say to all Senators, this is a blatant \neffort on the part of these big packers, of these big processors, to go \nafter the independent producers. They always think, because they have \nso much economic power and political power, that they will win these \nvotes.\n  I like my colleague from Idaho. It is my nature to like people. With \nall due respect, the amendment of the Senator from Idaho does not \nrepresent a step forward; it represents a great leap sideways.\n  The independent producers are being squeezed out of existence. These \nbig conglomerates are not interested in a study. They are interested in \nwhether or not we are on their side. As a Senator from Minnesota, I can \nsay with a great deal of good feeling and glee that I am on the side of \nthe independent producers. I am on the side of our family farmers. I am \nnot on the side of these big packers and these big conglomerates. They \nwill not be able to muscle their way to the dinner table and push \nfamily farmers out of existence. They will not be able to muscle their \nway to the floor of the Senate to try to reverse a vote. We are not \ngoing to let them do it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am pleased the Senator is pointing out what is \nhappening. I specifically thank the Senator for pointing out the ad run \nin the Sioux Falls Argus Leader Editor, newspaper on Sunday, February \n3. This is a paid advertisement, quite a big ad from Smithfield Foods, \nsigned by Joseph Luter III, chairman and chief executive officer of \nSmithfield Foods. It is quite a lengthy ad. They are going after \nSenator Johnson for offering this amendment. I guess they are angry \nthat his amendment passed.\n  In line with what the Senator from Minnesota said, this smacks of a \npowerful firm trying to use its economic power to blackmail. I have not \nseen in recent times a more blatant example of that than this ad put \nout by Smithfield Foods and Joseph Luter III. But let me read the last \nparagraph:\n\n       If the Johnson Amendment becomes law, Smithfield Foods will \n     neither rebuild the Sioux Falls plant, or build a new plant \n     in South Dakota, nor will we make any further investment in \n     South Dakota, or for that matter in any other state whose \n     public officials are hostile to our ongoing operations and \n     our industry.\n\n  Signed by Joseph Luter.\n  Now, that is economic blackmail.\n  We have more concentration in the meatpacking industry today than we \nhad 100 years ago when this Congress began to break up the packers; \nthey had too much economic power, too much concentration. We have more \ntoday than we did then.\n  This is economic blackmail. They are saying they will not do anything \n``in any State whose public officials are hostile to our ongoing \noperations and our industry.''\n  Well, they have plants in Iowa, too. But I can tell you that I am not \nhostile to their industry. We need the meatpacking industry in this \ncountry. We would like to have another meatpacking plant in the State \nof Iowa, in fact. However, what we do not want to see is the vertical \nintegration where the packers own the livestock and they are able to \ndictate to a farmer what that price will be for the cattle. It used to \nbe in my State a cattleman would get, two, three, or four bids for his \nlivestock. Now, with this kind of economic concentration, what happens \nis a packer goes out and says, this is what I will pay you. Take it or \nleave it. If they leave it, the packer says, that is all right, I have \nenough cattle of my own; I don't need your cattle. I have a captive \nsupply.\n  That is what happens. They drive more and more of our cattlemen out \nof business. I am upset at some of the entities that are supporting \nthis position, saying the packers should own this livestock.\n  This amendment is very simple. It says that the packers, prior to 14 \ndays, cannot engage in ownership or control. As the Senator said, we \nwill shortly have a second-degree amendment to the Craig amendment \nwhich undoes that, to specifically point out what control is and is not \nso it would not prohibit, for example, forward contracting. If they are \nhung up on the word ``control,'' we have an amendment that Senator \nGrassley and I are working together on to make crystal clear what we \nmean so there will not be any ambiguity. I don't think there is in the \npresent one, but we will make it even clearer.\n  I say to my friend from Minnesota, we ought to get even more votes \nnow because of this kind of economic blackmail.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask my colleague if he will yield for a question. I \nsay to my colleague from Pennsylvania, it won't be a 2-hour colloquy; \nmaybe an hour and 50 minutes but not 2 hours. I say to the Senator from \nIowa, I saw this last paragraph, too. It is worth reading again.\n\n       If the Johnson Amendment becomes law, Smithfield Foods will \n     neither rebuild the Sioux Falls plant, or build a new plant \n     in South Dakota, nor will we make further investment in South \n     Dakota, or for that matter in any other state whose public \n     officials are hostile to our ongoing operations and our \n     industry.\n\n  Earlier I was lucky enough--I don't consider it the price you pay. I \nthink it is a privilege you earn, to be in small print. It says \n``Johnson-Grassley-Wellstone,'' so I get included in this. But this is \naimed at Senator Johnson.\n  This is like threatening a capital strike. That is what this is all \nabout. This is absolutely unbelievable. I say to colleagues, now that \nwe are going to have your language--and I want to be included as an \noriginal cosponsor as to the second-degree amendment, which makes it \ncrystal clear what control means--we should get an even stronger vote \nfor our amendment. Every Senator ought to stand up to this kind of \nblatant blackmail or whitemail or threats.\n  The processors and meatpacking companies in Minnesota have not \nengaged in these kinds of threats. But I tell you what, with all due \nrespect for Smithfield, you are going to get fewer votes, Smithfield, \nbecause this is blatant. Everybody knows exactly what you are trying to \ndo. You have a lot of power, you have a lot of muscle, you have been \npushing a lot of our independent producers around for a long time, and \nwe are now saying to you that you are not going to be able to do it in \nthe same way. And you know what, you are not going to be able to push \nU.S. Senators around. We are going to get a strong vote for the second-\ndegree amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment and modification I just \nsent to the desk is an amendment that is referred to as the Puppy \nProtection Act that Senator Durbin and I have introduced. The reason I \nbrought this up is because of my continuing concern, and I know Senator \nDurbin's continuing concern, about the treatment of dogs and puppies in \nsome of the breeding facilities across the country. There are literally \nabout 3,000 such commercial breeding establishments that breed puppies \nfor sale into homes as pets.\n  There are, unfortunately, numerous reports and evidence of very bad \nconditions in these puppy mills. I have had an ongoing concern about \nit. We have been working for quite some time with USDA to improve \nenforcement. They have some 80 people to enforce the existing Animal \nWelfare Act. They simply are understaffed. The problem we are seeing is \nnot only are they understaffed but there are some holes in the animal \nwelfare law.\n  A lot of my colleagues have come to me because they have been hearing \nfrom some of their constituents who are saying: Why is Rick Santorum \ntrying to expand the reach of the Federal Government to take care of \nbreeding dogs? This doesn't seem to be something in which the Federal \nGovernment should be involved.\n  First off, the Federal Government is involved. In 1966, we passed the \nAnimal Welfare Act. We have had several amendments to it since--I think \nfour or five times throughout the 1970s or 1980s. Because these are \ncommercial breeding establishments that breed animals, we, the USDA and \nthe Congress, have seen fit to have the Department of Agriculture \nregulate these large facilities. We do regulate in the area of \nhandling, housing, sanitation, feeding, watering, ventilation, shelter, \nadequate veterinary care, and exercise. Those are provisions already in \nthe existing veterinary law here in Washington, DC, which the USDA is \nresponsible for regulating.\n\n  But there are some areas we believe lead directly to not just the \nhealth of the dog but the suitability of the dog as a pet that results \nfrom, we believe, some bad practices.\n  Before I go into detail about what my bill does, I want to be very \nclear about what my bill doesn't do. One thing my bill does not do--and \nthe amendment of Senator Durbin and myself does not do--is expand who \nis covered under the Animal Welfare Act. We have heard from the \nAmerican Kennel Club and some members calling my office, and I know \nother Members have gotten calls from AKC members within their States, \nsaying this is a great expansion of reach; you are going to have all \nthese breeders who are going to run afoul of the Federal Government now \nif this legislation passes.\n  According to AKC's own records from 1997, which are the most recent \nones we have, 97 percent of their breeders are not covered under the \nexisting Animal Welfare Act. And our act does not amend who is covered. \nIt just says what will be looked at upon inspection. Ninety-seven \npercent of their members will not be covered. Why? Because the Animal \nWelfare Act only covers breeders who breed four or more females. If you \nbreed less than four females, you are not covered under the Animal \nWelfare Act and you are not covered under this proposed amendment to \nthe Animal Welfare Act.\n  Again, from their own numbers, only .04 percent of their members \nregistered\n\n[[Page S517]]\n\nmore than three litters in a year. So I say as to a lot of these calls \ncoming in, saying: You are going to be harming the mom-and-pop breeder \nhere, the folks who have a female dog they want to breed for a little \nextra income as part of their experience with their animal, you are \ngoing to be affecting them, the answer is no, we are not. What we are \ntalking about here are facilities that are in the commercial breeding. \nWe want to make sure these puppies that are bred, when they go into the \nhome, go into the home healthy, No. 1-- I mean from disease and genetic \nmaladies, but that they also go in properly socialized so they can be \ngood pets.\n\n  The areas we have focused in on are really three. No. 1 is the area \nof socialization or interaction. It requires that the puppies in these \nbreeding facilities have interaction with other dogs and with humans.\n  Can you imagine the situation where a dog is bred and put in a cage, \nbasically isolated from human contact for several weeks and having no \ninteraction with human beings and having no interaction with other \ndogs, and then placed in a home maybe with little children? The impact \ncould be severe. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that that is one \narea.\n  We just require some interaction. It is not particularly an onerous \nstandard. We think it is a rather commonsense standard. I find it \ndifficult for anyone to find a problem with that.\n  The second area has to do with breeding. There is a lot of concern. \nOne of the sponsors of my amendment is one of the two veterinarians in \nthe Senate. There are two Senators who are veterinarians. But one of \nthem dealt with small animals; that is, Senator Ensign from Nevada. He \nis a cosponsor of my amendment. He personally told me stories of the \nproblems with large commercial breeders in overbreeding females and \nconstantly breeding more than is healthy for the female. It has an \nimpact, obviously, on the litter and the health of the litter with \ndiseases and other complications.\n  Here we are talking about a standard, it is my understanding, \naccording to all reputable breeders which they adhere to already. It is \na standard that puts in place what we believe are sound breeding \npractices based on evidence of producing a line of healthy puppies.\n  I know Senator Ensign is planning on coming in next week to talk \nabout this legislation. He will probably give many more good examples \nwith a lot more technical expertise than I can possibly offer. But I \nwanted to make it clear that this is a problem.\n  It is a problem when you have a very excited family that brings a new \npuppy into the home. They find out that this puppy, because of improper \nbreeding, tends to have a lot of problems, gets ill, and maybe dies. \nThat is obviously terrible for the puppy, but it is also very traumatic \nfor the family.\n  The last provision has to do with enforcement. Before I talk about \nthis provision, let me make it clear that if the USDA goes in and finds \na bad situation, they have the ability to revoke the license. These \nfacilities are licensed by USDA. They have the ability to go in and \nimmediately revoke the license if there is one severe infraction of the \nAnimal Welfare Act. We don't change that. But we say under this \nlegislation, if you have three such infractions within an 8-year period \nof time, USDA must automatically revoke the license. You can appeal and \ndo all the things about the specific instances to get your license \nreinstated. But this ``three strikes and you are out'' provision really \ntries to suggest to USDA that when you have a pattern of mistreatment \nand violation of the law, that action should be taken.\n  Again, let me remind everybody that USDA can do it right now. They \nhave the discretion to do it with one infraction. We are saying that \nupon three, the license will be revoked. We are talking about \ncommercial breeders. We are not talking about breeders that breed fewer \nthan four animals.\n  This is an amendment that has very broad support from over 800 animal \nwelfare organizations, including the Humane Society and the American \nSociety for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\n\n  Of course, this legislation is, frankly, a very modest amendment. I \ncannot tell you how many changes I have made. I think this is the \nfourth change I have filed with this legislation in an attempt to try \nto deal with the research community that is concerned about certain \naspects of this legislation and their application. We have dealt with \nthe small breeders, even though, frankly, they are not covered by it. \nBut we have tried to ameliorate some of the concerns from the American \nKennel Club.\n  We have really worked very hard to try to make sure that no one who \nis serious about the healthy breeding of puppies has a concern. It is \nnot my intention to bring the dog police into every home in America \nthat breeds puppies. The fact of the matter is there are large \ncommercial establishments that, frankly, need to do a better job in \nbreeding puppies for homes.\n  I am hopeful that we can have very broad support. I have been working \nwith Senator Helms. Senator Helms has been very helpful. I appreciate \nthis morning his suggesting that we can now be supportive of this \nlegislation as we have made the additional change in the legislation.\n  We are trying to work through all of these matters. I would be very \nhappy if we could get this in the managers' amendment. If not, I am \ncertainly happy to take this to a vote. I think it will have very \nstrong support from both sides of the aisle.\n  Who wants to have puppies in the home that are not socialized or that \nhave diseases or that are not in the best position to be good pets for \nour families across America?\n  I thank the Chair for the time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2835\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition to \nthe amendment offered by Senator Craig last evening which would \neliminate a bipartisan provision in this farm bill that restores \nfairness, competition, and free enterprise into livestock markets.\n  In December, the Senate adopted an amendment to the farm bill based \nupon legislation I introduced 3 years ago which strengthens the Packers \nand Stockyards Act of 1921, by prohibiting large meatpackers from \nowning livestock--cattle, hogs, and sheep--for more than 14 days prior \nto slaughter.\n  Nearly every farm and ranch organization in the country supports a \nban on packer ownership, including the American Farm Bureau, the \nNational Farmers Union, R-CALF, the Livestock Marketing Association, \nthe Organization for Competitive Markets, the Center for Rural Affairs, \nand the Western Organization of Resource Councils, just to name a few.\n  More importantly, every farm and ranch group in South Dakota supports \nmy amendment, including Farm Bureau, Farmers Union, the Cattlemen, the \nStockgrowers, Livestock Auction Markets, the Independent Pork \nProducers, and even South Dakota Governor Janklow.\n  Let me take some time to clarify what our amendment does, and, what \nit does not do.\n  The objectives of our amendment are to increase competitive bidding, \nchoice, market access, and bargaining power to farmers and ranchers in \nlivestock markets. Here are the facts about our amendment.\n  First, my language strengthens section 202 of the Packers and \nStockyards Act of 1921--and 80-year-old law--by prohibiting meatpackers \nfrom owning, feeding, or controlling livestock for more than 14 days \nprior to slaughter. Currently, packers are already prohibited from \nowning sale barns and auction markets.\n  Second, it exempts producer-owned cooperatives engaged in slaughter \nand meatpacking, in addition to packing plants owned by producers who \nslaughter less than 2 percent of the national annual slaughter of beef \ncattle--724,000 head--hogs--1,900,000 head-- or sheep--69,200.\n  Therefore, many of the innovative, start-up projects operating and \nbeing formed to give producers greater bargaining power in the market \nwill not be affected by our amendment. Some have made very misleading \nand false statements about the Johnson-Grassley amendment and our \nintent. Let me try to clarify some of those issues.\n\n  This amendment does not prohibit meatpackers from purchasing \nlivestock for slaughter. In fact, it promotes the\n\n[[Page S518]]\n\npurchase of livestock in the cash market. Therefore, it promotes \ncompetition and bidding among a significant number of buyers.\n  Again, I say, this amendment does not ban packers from owning \nlivestock for slaughter; it simply says they cannot own the livestock \nfrom birth all the way until slaughter, the vertical integration to \nwhich some aspire. It bans them from owning livestock prior to 14 days \nfrom the date of slaughter.\n  The amendment does not prohibit forward contracts wherein packers and \ngrowers work together to raise and market livestock as long as the \nlivestock are owned by the individual farmer or rancher.\n  Senator Grassley and I have taken significant efforts to make it \ncrystal clear that forward contracts and marketing agreements are not \nprohibited under this amendment. We have entered into a colloquy making \nit clear that the word ``control'' only refers to substantial \noperational control and not contracts.\n  There are those who would prefer that this amendment did apply to \nforward contracts, and I respect those who hold those views. But the \ngoal of this amendment is narrow. The goal of this amendment is focused \nexclusively on the actual vertical integration, the actual packer \nownership from birth to slaughter of livestock.\n  Some have questioned whether contractual marketing arrangements known \nas forward contracts are permitted under the provision. The answer is \nyes.\n  Three of the most respected agricultural economists and legal counsel \nin America--Roger McEowen from Kansas State University, Peter \nCarstensen from the University of Wisconsin, and Neil Harl from Iowa \nState University--have completed an analysis that supports our intent \nthat contractual marketing arrangements and forward contracts are \npermitted under this amendment.\n  These experts agree with us that the meaning of the word ``control'' \nin this amendment applies to a potential arrangement purposefully \ndrafted by a clever legal counsel to give a packer control over the \nownership of livestock from birth to slaughter, though a farmer may \nhold title to the livestock, by providing the packer complete \noperational control over these animals.\n  Operational control provides the packer the ability to dictate nearly \nevery detail of production and marketing, such as the facilities, \nnutritional and veterinary decisions, as well as providing the packer \n24-hour access to the livestock. Forward contracts and other marketing \narrangements do not give a meatpacking firm managerial or operational \ncontrol of the production-to-market process. Rather, such arrangements \nonly provide the packer with a contractual right to receive delivery of \nthe livestock in the future. The producer signing the contract still \nmakes most of the production decisions. Therefore, forward contracts or \ncontractual marketing arrangements are still permitted under the \nlanguage of this amendment and the word ``control'' does not affect \ntheir use.\n  So Senator Grassley and I have received assurance from legal counsel \nthat ``control'' does not include forward contracts and marketing \nagreements. On the other hand, those expressing opposition have \npresented no legal analysis in support of their proposition that \nsomehow the word ``control'' in this legislation means a prohibition on \nforward contracting.\n\n  While marketing arrangements such as forward contracts have caused or \ncan cause problems in the market, they are outside the scope of this \nspecific amendment.\n  In a December colloquy with Senator Grassley, we stated the intent of \nthe word ``control'' must be read in the context of ownership. In other \nwords, ``control'' means substantial operational control of livestock \nproduction, rather than the mere contract right to receive future \ndelivery of livestock produced by a farmer, rancher, or feedlot \noperator. ``Control,'' according to legal dictionaries, means ``to \ndirect, manage or supervise.'' In the meaning of our amendment, the \ndirection, management, and supervision is directed towards the \nproduction of livestock or the operations producing livestock, not the \nsimple right to receive delivery of livestock raised by someone else.\n  There are two reasons that forward contracts and marketing agreements \nare not within the definition of ``control.'' First, these contracts do \nnot allow a packer to exercise any control over the livestock \nproduction or operation. Rather, the contracts merely provide the \npacker with the right to receive delivery of livestock in the future, \nand most include a certain amount of quality specifications. There is \nno management, direction, or supervision over the farm operation in \nthese contracts.\n  The farmer or rancher makes the decision to commit the delivery of \nlivestock to a packer through the contract without ceding operational \ncontrol. In fact, the farmer or rancher still could make a management \ndecision to deliver the livestock to another packer other than the one \ncovered in the contract, albeit subject to damages for breach of \ncontract. Even where such contracts include detailed quality \nspecifications, control of the operation remains with the farmer. The \nquality specifications simply relate to the amount of premiums or \ndiscounts in the final payment by the packer for the livestock \ndelivered under the contract.\n  Second, several States, such as Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South \nDakota, already prohibit packer or corporate ownership of livestock.\n  The Iowa law, for example, prevents packers from owning, operating, \nor controlling a livestock feeding operation in that State. But packers \nand producers may still enter into forward contracts or marketing \nagreements without violating that law because operational control, in \nthe context of ownership, is the issue. The term ``control'' is \nintended to be similarly interpreted and applied in this amendment.\n  Beyond the genuine concern about this amendment, a few in the \nmeatpacking industry have hastily come to false, or at least erroneous, \nconclusions about its effect, and, frankly, they are busily working the \nHalls of Congress to kill this amendment due to those concerns. It may \nbe that we simply have a profound philosophical difference between \nthose of us who supported the amendment and others in opposition.\n  I believe our country is best served by a wide dispersion of \nindependent livestock producers who have, in a free market, an \nopportunity to leverage a decent price for their animals and a decent \nopportunity to sell those animals in a competitive environment. I \nbelieve it is a disservice to rural America, a disservice to the \nlivestock industry, if we wind up with a circumstance where our \nindependent livestock producers increasingly become, in effect, low-\nwage employees of the packers on their own land--subject to all the \nrisks of livestock production but very little of the occasional profit \nthat can come about from a fair opportunity to sell their animals. So \nwe have a profound difference of vision of what livestock production is \nall about and how our country is best served.\n\n  I believe in free enterprise. I believe in competition. I believe in \nindependent producers having opportunities to seek out alternative \nbuyers for their animals on an independent cash basis.\n  If some wish to forward contract and to secure its assurances, that \nis fine. That is a prerogative they have as well, at least under this \namendment. But I do not believe we ought to have a total vertical \nintegration of the livestock industry whereby a very small handful of \nhuge agribusiness conglomerates control the production of livestock \nfrom birth all the way through slaughter, reducing livestock producers \nto simply low-wage employees, for all practical purposes. That is not \nmy vision of rural America. That is not the vision shared by the people \nwho supported this amendment.\n  So I think that while a lot of this debate is caught up in what may \nsound legalese to many, the actual consequences of what is going on \nhere have profound effects on the look of rural America for all time to \ncome.\n  There is a particular packer who has been running full-page ads in my \nState, apparently with an intent to intimidate me. They have the right \nto do that. It turns out that the packing company that does operations \nin my State is a pork production company which has never owned hogs, \nand has no particular immediate plan to, and would not be affected, at \nleast for now,\n\n[[Page S519]]\n\nby this amendment. They may wish to go into a different business plan \nthan they have had in the past, and that may be the case.\n  But I want to make clear that I believe someone has to stand up for \nlivestock producers in our country. We see this continued \nconcentration, this continued integration, going on in every sector of \nthe economy, but certainly in agriculture it has been one of the \nharshest. For that reason, Senator Grassley and I have offered this \namendment. We have already passed this amendment on a narrow 51-to-46 \nvote earlier this past session of the 107th Congress.\n  I have no problem with an additional vote, an up-or-down vote. Let \neveryone stand up and be counted wherever they are. I respect my \ncolleagues however they may come down on this issue. I do want to \nconvey the real import, the real impact of this amendment, and make \npeople understand what is, in fact, at stake.\n  The amendment being offered would reduce this antipacker ownership \namendment to another study. Heaven knows, we have studies galore lining \nthe shelves of every building in Washington, DC, many of them gathering \ndust. We have known USDA to conduct study after study after study not \nleading to any matter of practical consequence. I don't think our \nfarmers and ranchers need another study.\n  It is incorrect to observe that no hearings have been conducted on \nthe topic of packer ownership. Rather, the Senate Agriculture Committee \nhas held three hearings on concentration in livestock markets, packer \nownership, and other issues--in June of 1998, May of 1999, and April \n2000--and the problems remain clear and the need to act remains real.\n  The percentage of hogs owned by packers rose from a small 6.4 \npercent, as recently as 1994, to 27 percent in 2001, from 6.4 percent \nto 27 percent packer ownership in a period of only 7 years, according \nto the University of Missouri. This increase in packer-owned hogs means \nthat packers prefer to buy their own hogs instead of paying farmers a \nfair price, thereby depressing competition. Eighty-eight percent of \nrespondents in the Iowa Farm and Rural Life Poll believed that \nmeatpackers should be prohibited from owning livestock, and 89 percent \nbelieved that too much economic power is concentrated in a few large \nagribusinesses, according to studies done by Iowa State University.\n  When packers own their own farms and their own livestock, they do not \nmake purchases from farmers who would otherwise be providing economic \ncontributions to rural communities--main street businesses, school \ndistricts tax base, banks, car dealerships, feed stores, and so on. \nThose opposed to this amendment have a different vision for rural \nAmerica, a far different vision than mine. I have a more optimistic \nview of what rural America could look like. I envision more farmers and \nranchers being able to compete in a free market and a free enterprise \nsystem raising more livestock on family farms so local economies can \ngrow and the environment can be safer for families to make a living.\n  I fear if we go the other direction, packer market power will grow, \nallowing packers to go to the cash market only during narrow bid \nwindows or time periods each week rather than bidding all week, thus \nresulting in panic selling by producers.\n  A ban on packer ownership of livestock will not drive packers out of \nbusiness. Most of their earnings are generated from branded products \nand companies marketing directly to consumers. Conversely, livestock \nownership by packers could drive independent livestock producers out of \nbusiness because they will simply be at the mercy of these large \ncorporations.\n  I do not, again, have a problem with another vote. It was important \nto clarify the forward contracting component of this amendment to make \nit crystal clear that that is not the gist of it. The gist is not \nforward contracting. The gist is the vertical integration of the actual \nownership, the birth and slaughter of livestock in America.\n  We have a very fundamental decision to make in this body. I don't \nunderestimate the steep climb this amendment has to make. I know the \npackers have been active in their lobbying effort. I know the \nintimidation efforts have been extraordinary. I recognize that no such \namendment is contained in the House version of the agriculture bill and \nthat, even if we were to survive in the conference committee, an uphill \nfight would occur there relative to this amendment.\n\n  Nonetheless, it is important to lay out in a clear, concise fashion \nwhat is at stake, what my motives are, what the motives are of the \nbipartisan sponsorship of this amendment, and to reflect that that may, \nin fact, be why this amendment acquired the support of every single \nRepublican and Democratic Senator on the northern plains where \nlivestock production is such a key component to the economies of our \nStates.\n  I look forward to continued debate and another amendment to vote on. \nWe will see what the final product is, but I did want to make it very \nclear what this amendment does, what it does not do, and to make \ncertain people understand that this is not some arcane agricultural \nissue; that this, in fact, is fundamentally crucial to the look of \nrural America for all time to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment to update and \nsomewhat improve the so-called sugar program. The sugar subsidy program \nhas been driving the domestic cane refinery industry out of existence, \nand it has eliminated thousands of good jobs. This amendment helps \nstrike a new balance between saving our Nation's domestic refinery jobs \nand protecting sugar producers from foreign competition.\n  What this amendment does is ensure that the amount of sugar allowed \nto come into the United States actually makes it to the market. The \namendment would reallocate the unfilled portion of a country's quota \nwhen that country doesn't fill its quota, which happens almost \nannually.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture does have the ability under present law \nto reallocate the quota, but it is a fight every year for domestic \nrefineries to get enough sugar to refine, and it is also a fight to get \nthe Secretary--regardless of whether it is a Democratic or Republican \nadministration--to make this reallocation.\n  The amendment would allow refineries to obtain more sugar under the \nquota by taking some allocation from nations not exporting as much \nsugar as they are allowed and giving it to nations that would export \nmore sugar to the United States.\n  The amendment is supported by the United States Cane Sugar Refiners' \nAssociation and the following independent refineries: C Sugar in \nCrockett, CA; Colonial Sugar in Gramercy, LA; Savannah Foods in Port \nWentworth, GA; Imperial Sugar in Sugar Land, TX.\n  In the past, we have failed to balance the refineries and the growers \nof the sugar industry successfully. This farm bill represents an \nopportunity to make a change before more refineries are forced to \nclose. This amendment will help the country's sugar refining industry. \nIt will not strip the domestic producers of any benefits.\n  Something must be done to save our sugar refining industry. Since \n1981, 13 out of 23 cane refineries in the United States have been \nforced out of business. Here they are on this chart: Hawaii, Florida, \nMassachusetts, New York, Illinois, Florida, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, \nLouisiana, Missouri, and Louisiana. The loss of jobs between 1981 and \ntoday is over 4,000. Those refineries that do remain open today \nstruggle to survive under what are very onerous import restrictions.\n  At the end of the last year, we had a debate and the Senate \noverwhelmingly, regretfully, voted to continue the sugar subsidy \nprogram. I continue to oppose these sugar subsidies, but I recognize \nthere are not the votes to eliminate the sugar program right now.\n  I first became involved in this issue when David Koncelik, the \npresident and CEO of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company, known \nas C, informed me in 1994 that his 88-year-old refinery in Crockett, \nCA, was forced to temporarily close because it could not get cane sugar \non the market to refine.\n  C is the largest refinery in the United States. It is the only such \nfacility on the west coast. It refines about 15 percent of the total \ncane sugar consumed in the United States. The company is capable of \nproducing and selling about 800,000 tons of refined sugar annually. It \nis currently producing about 700,000 tons.\n  Anyone who has driven from San Francisco to Sacramento and crossed \nthe Carquinez Straits, as you go on to the bridge, you look down and \nyou see this old, large brick refinery known as C All of us grew up \nto the C commercial where they sang ``pure cane sugar from Hawaii''--\nsomething like that--and I have seen the struggle go on year after \nyear.\n  Hawaii is C's sole source of domestic raw cane sugar. But the \nHawaii sugarcane industry has been in decline now for over a decade. In \nfact, from 1996 through 2001, cane acreage fell by 50 percent in \nHawaii, according to the Congressional Research Service. C can only \nmake up for the lack of Hawaiian cane output by importing cane from \nother countries.\n  There is the rub. Our Nation's restrictive sugar import quota limits \nthe amount of sugar available for C to refine. Simply put, C has \nbeen unable to get enough sugar to refine and has been forced to send \nworkers home on several occasions.\n  In 1981, C had 1,313 employees. It is a union plant. In 1995, the \ncompany had 812. By 1999, that number dropped to 580 employees. Today, \nthe refinery employs 565 workers.\n  The U.S. sugar refining industry will continue to be at risk unless \nwe adjust this imbalance in the industry and reform the sugar program. \nThis amendment provides an opportunity to provide immediate relief to \nC and the other domestic refineries without compromising one single \nbenefit to sugar producers. It is going to be interesting to see if we \ncan get it through, because even though it does not take anything from \nthem, they still oppose this. I have a hard time understanding why. \nThis is not an attack. It is simply a way to update and improve the \nquota system.\n  Let me repeat that. This amendment is not an attack on the sugar \nprogram. Sugar imports have been restricted almost continuously since \n1934 in order to support high prices for domestic sugarcane and sugar \nbeet producers. The USTR, working with the Department of Agriculture, \nallocates shares of the quota among 40 designated countries. Since the \n1994 Uruguay Round of trade talks, the United States has allowed the \ndesignated countries to export 1.256 million tons of sugar to the \nUnited States under the quota. Today's sugar import restrictions are \nbased on a formula derived from trade patterns that prevailed over a \nquarter of a century ago, and therein lies the rub and the major \nproblem for domestic refiners such as C The quota does not \naccurately reflect how much countries are able to export to the United \nStates.\n  Some of the 40 designated countries have even been forced to provide \nan export allocation when they do not export any sugar at all. Does \nthat make sense? I think not. In fact, according to the GAO, on the \naverage, from 1993 through 1998, 10 of the 40 countries were net \nimporters of sugar. This means they do not export sugar to the United \nStates if they need to import sugar to their own country. Therefore, \nthat allocation, that part of the quota, goes unused. Our refineries \nthat would like to buy that raw sugar on the open market cannot buy it. \nIt makes no sense.\n  Other countries continue to export sugar, but they have substantially \nreduced their production. For example, since the allocations were made, \nthe Dominican Republic has experienced a 50-percent decline in sugar \nproduction, and the Philippines, a 27-percent drop, but the allocation \nfor both countries has remained the same. If the Philippines is not \ngoing to export and the Dominican Republic is not going to export their \nquota, all we want to do is let some country get that shortfall and put \nit on the market to give our domestic sugar refiners the opportunity to \nbuy it.\n  Some countries have substantially increased their sugar production \nbut not seen the amount they are allowed to export to the United States \nincrease. For example, since the allocations were made, Guatemala, \nColombia, and Australia have increased their production by 219 percent, \n96 percent, and 61 percent, respectively, while their shares of the \nallocation have remained the same.\n  Some countries have similar allocations under the quota despite \ndramatically different levels of sugar exports. For example, Brazil and \nthe Philippines are both allowed to export 14 percent of the total \nquota, but Brazil\n\n[[Page S521]]\n\nexports 21 times more sugar than the Philippines worldwide. It is \nunacceptable that quota allocations have not been revised for 20 years, \nor 2 decades, despite dramatic changes in the ability of many countries \nto produce and export sugar.\n\n  Is there a way to update the sugar export amounts allowed into the \nUnited States without adversely impacting growers? I believe there is, \nand the amendment I have offered will provide the slight change to the \nsugar export quota that is desperately needed.\n  The United States has imported on the average about 3 percent less \nsugar than the quota allowed from the 1996-through-1998 allocation \nbecause some countries did not fill their allocations. So there is that \n3 percent out there. Since the sugar quota does not reflect the current \ncapability of many countries to produce and export sugar, the GAO has \nconcluded:\n\n       The United States Trade Representative's current process \n     for allocating the sugar tariff rate quota does not insure \n     that all of the sugar allowed under the quota reaches the \n     United States market.\n\n  There is the point. There is the differential. The sugar that does \nnot reach the market in the quota should be made available.\n  I would like to read some of the July 1999 report on the sugar \nprogram issued by the GAO:\n\n       The current allocation process has resulted in fewer sugar \n     imports than allowed under the tariff rate quota. From 1996 \n     through 1998, the United States raw sugar imports averaged \n     75,000 tons less annually than the amount USDA allowed the \n     United States Trade Representative to allocate under the \n     tariff rate quota. According to domestic refinery officials, \n     this shortfall has exacerbated recent declines in the overall \n     availability of raw cane sugar on the U.S. market.\n\n  If there is a shortfall in sugar exported to the United States, and \nrefineries are shut down because there is not enough cane to refine, we \nneed to allow the quota to be flexible when there is this shortfall. \nThe amendment I have offered will reallocate unused sugar in the quota \nto other countries when there is an export shortfall. This is exactly \nwhat the USTR did as recently as 1995. It is also the precise \nrecommendation of the GAO in its 1999 report. In suggesting change to \nthe sugar program, the GAO advised:\n\n       Changes could include such actions as providing a means of \n     reallocating the current quota.\n\n  All this amendment does is ensure the amount of sugar allowed to come \ninto the United States is actually making it to the market. How is that \nso threatening to people? This opportunity to reallocate the quota when \nthere is a shortfall will not hurt growers because the shortfall does \nnot represent enough sugar to affect price. Of course, that is what \nthey will say, that this will affect price. It will not affect price. \nIt has not affected price before. There is no reason to believe it will \naffect it now.\n  In the 1999 report, the GAO found:\n\n       Because the shortfalls in the tariff rate quota reduced \n     total U.S. sugar supplies by less than 1 percent, they had a \n     minimal effect on the domestic price of sugar.\n\n  If you do not trust me, trust the GAO. The inefficiencies of the \ncurrent import restrictions demand that Congress accept this amendment.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this amendment. It will \nhelp make the sugar program operate more effectively and efficiently. \nIf this body can't accept this simple amendment, it clearly tells me \nthat not only is the sugar allocation outdated, but it is essentially \ncontrolled to manipulate so certain people can do business while others \ncannot.\n  These refineries are very important. My Crockett refinery is the \nmajor source of jobs in that entire Crockett community. Each year, the \nCEO has to come back here to plead with his representatives in \nCongress:\n\n       I can't buy enough sugar on the market to keep my people \n     employed. I pay them good salaries. It is important I be able \n     to operate and refine sugar. I want to buy it on the open \n     market and I can't--is simply wrong.\n\n  It is flawed public policy. I ask for this body's support to pass \nthis amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nthe New York Times.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 6, 2001]\n\n                   Sugar Rules Defy Free-Trade Logic\n\n                           (By David Barboza)\n\n       For anyone who thinks of the United States as a free-trade \n     nation, the 10 story brick sugar refinery on Highway 90A here \n     on the outskirts of Houston is startling.\n       The plant can produce up to 500,000 tons of sugar a year, \n     enough to sweeten about 90 billion doughnuts. But while \n     America has a sweet tooth, it does not need all that sugar. \n     Indeed, America is swimming in sugar, largely because the \n     sugar business is one of the economy's most protectionist \n     niches. Sugar programs that protect growers from foreign \n     competition cost American consumers almost $2 billion a year \n     in higher prices for everything from candy bars to cold \n     cereal, according to government studies. Artificially high \n     prices have led to overproduction, leaving taxpayers the \n     owners of one million tons of sugar that they pay $1.4 \n     million a month just to store, some of it in Sugar Land.\n       Yet earlier this year the owner of the plant here--the \n     Imperial Sugar Company, the nation's biggest sugar refiner--\n     was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, \n     because it has lost so much money lately turning relatively \n     high-priced raw sugar into the refined sugar it sells into a \n     depressed, glutted market.\n       Now, refiners are demanding an overhaul of the sugar \n     program. Consumer groups want it abolished. And even its \n     backers and beneficiaries--big growers that are major donors \n     to both political parties--are dissatisfied. They want more \n     protection, complaining that new trade initiatives, like the \n     North American Free Trade Agreement, threaten to undermine \n     the industry and further depress the price of sugar.\n       Congress is now hearing testimony on these matters as it \n     takes up a new farm bill. The conventional wisdom is that \n     Washington is unlikely to scrap a program that has bipartisan \n     support, any more than it has been prone to eliminate \n     supports for other farmers.\n       But some lawmakers say sugar policy, in particular, is ripe \n     for revision.\n       ``Events of the past year indicate that the sugar program \n     is becoming increasingly unmanageable and that radical \n     reforms are needed urgently,'' said Richard G. Lugar, \n     chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and a longtime \n     opponent of the program.\n       At the heart of the debate is a sugar policy that since the \n     New Deal has held that domestic growers ought to be shielded \n     from the vagaries of the commodity markets. The current \n     program, put in place in 1981, promised that kind of \n     stability by limiting imports and making loans to growers.\n       But in recent years, helped by technology and weather, \n     production has exploded. And government policies and price \n     supports, on balance, encouraged farmers to abandon even more \n     seriously depressed crops in favor of sugar beets and cane.\n       Overproduction sent prices tumbling, hurting growers. But \n     the hardest hit were cane refiners. At times, the prices they \n     paid for raw sugar were higher than those at which they could \n     sell refined sugar.\n       If nothing changes, industry officials fear a feroclous \n     one-two punch: the possible loss of cane-refining capacity at \n     home, which could hurt food producers, and a steady rise in \n     imports, which could wipe out both domestic growers and \n     refiners.\n       Free-market economists say that might be the most efficient \n     outcome, but no industry disappears without a fight. The \n     refiners are just one of the interest groups that have \n     stormed Capitol Hill.\n       None are so powerful as the nation's largest producer of \n     raw sugar, the Flo-Sun Corporation of Palm Beach, Fla., run \n     by Jose Pepe Fanjul and Alfonso Fanjul, Cuban exiles who \n     created a sugar empire in the Florida Everglades and who are \n     now big donors to both Republicans and Democrats.\n       Flo-Sun and other giant producers want to strengthen the \n     program by putting new restrictions on domestic production of \n     sugar beets and cane. They also want to limit the scope of \n     any future trade deal that might lead to what they consider \n     unfair competition.\n       ``We don't believe we ought to sacrifice the American \n     farmer to bring in sugar that is subsidized by other \n     governments,'' said Judy Sanchez, a spokeswoman at U.S. \n     Sugar, one of Florida's biggest cane producers.\n       Critics of the program--from food producers to refiners to \n     consumer groups--would like the program discarded or \n     significantly weakened.\n       ``We want the program phased out,'' said Jeff Nedelman, a \n     spokesman for the Coalition for Sugar Reform, a trade group \n     that represents food and consumer groups, taxpayer watchdogs \n     and environmental organizations. ``This is corporate welfare \n     for the very rich. The program results in higher prices for \n     consumers, direct payments by U.S. taxpayers to sugar \n     growers, and it's the Achilles' heel of U.S. trade policy.''\n       Chicago, home of Sara Lee cakes and Brach's Starlight Mints \n     candies, has aligned itself with the critics. A few weeks \n     ago, Mayor Richard M. Daley and other city leaders announced \n     that they would lobby Congress to end the sugar program, \n     which they said was hurting the city's makers of candy and \n     food by inflating costs.\n       Indeed, the General Accounting Office says the sugar \n     program cost consumer about $1.9 billion in 1998, with the \n     chief beneficiaries being beet and cane growers.\n       Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who is a \n     strong backer of the\n\n[[Page S522]]\n\n     sugar program, says Americans are not being overcharged. \n     Rather, he contends, prices on the world market are \n     artifically depressed by surplus sugar from countries that \n     subsidize production.\n       ``The world price has nothing to do with the cost of \n     sugar,'' he said. ``And my contention is that the program \n     causes stable prices.''\n       Americans' appetite for sugar is measured in pounds. The \n     average person in this sugar-saturated country consumes more \n     than 70 pounds a year of refined sugar and that does not \n     include most soft drinks, sauces and syrups, which are \n     sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup.\n       But even that appetite is no match for current levels of \n     sugar production. A record 8.5 million tons of sugar was \n     produced in the United States in 1999, and that sent raw \n     sugar prices tumbling to 18 cents a pound, the lowest level \n     in 20 years. The Agriculture Department stepped in last \n     June to buy 132,000 tons, at a cost of $54 million, or 20 \n     cents a pound.\n       Imperial Sugar--already burdened by $500 million in debt \n     because of an acquisition spree--was hit harder than anyone \n     in the industry. The company was forced to buy raw sugar cane \n     at about the same price that it could sell the finish \n     product.\n       ``We're out of gas before we turn the lights on,'' said \n     I.H. Kempner III, Imperial Sugar's chairman, whose family \n     acquired its first holdings in 1907. Imperial filed for \n     bankruptcy protection in January.\n       The New York-based Domino, a unit of Tate & Lyle of Britain \n     and a leading supplier of pure cane sugar to grocery chains, \n     is also ``in desperate shape,'' said Margaret Blamberg, a \n     spokeswoman. C Sugar, a big California refiner, is \n     struggling both with low sugar prices and the state's rising \n     energy costs.\n       For growers, the biggest threat is the political tide \n     favoring free trade. Under Nafta, Mexico is getting greater \n     access to the American sugar market. And in 2008, the \n     agreement will give Mexico unlimited access to the American \n     market.\n       Just how much Mexican sugar can enter the American market \n     this year is in dispute. American trade officials say that \n     about 100,000 tons of surplus sugar is allowed in, while \n     Mexican officials say the figure is 500,000 tons. Under an \n     agreement reached at the Uruguay Round of global trade talks \n     in 1994, the United States is required to import about 1.1 \n     million tons of sugar a year.\n       The solution, the growers say, is more protection for the \n     industry. Two weeks ago, the House Agriculture Committee \n     heard testimony from the major sugar producers, who proposed \n     stricter market and production controls at home and more \n     restrictive trade policies.\n       ``You have to fix the big trade problems,'' said Luther \n     Markwart, chairman of the American Sugar Alliance, which \n     represents the major growers.\n       Trade experts, however, say the sugar program makes free-\n     trade talk seem hollow.\n       ``Sugar is a nightmare in terms of trade negotiations,'' \n     said Prof. Robin A. King, an expert on trade policy at \n     Georgetown University. ``This is one reason other countries \n     get frustrated with our position on free trade. They say, `We \n     want to trade, but the items were produce you won't let in.' \n     ''\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask that the amendment be set aside.

PROHIBITION ON PACKERS OWNING, FEEDING, OR \n                   CONTROLLING LIVESTOCK.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 202 of the Packers and Stockyards \n     Act, 1921 (7 U.S.C. 192(f)) (as amended by section 1021(a)), \n     is amended by striking subsection (f) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(f) Own or feed livestock directly, through a subsidiary, \n     or through an arrangement that gives the packer operational, \n     managerial, or supervisory control over the livestock, or \n     over the farming operation that produces the livestock, to \n     such an extent that the producer is no longer materially \n     participating in the management of the operation with respect \n     to the production of the livestock, except that this \n     subsection shall not apply to--\n       ``(1) an arrangement entered into within 14 days before \n     slaughter of the livestock by a packer, a person acting \n     through the packer, or a person that directly or indirectly \n     controls, or is controlled by or under common control with, \n     the packer;\n       ``(2) a cooperative or entity owned by a cooperative, if a \n     majority of the ownership interest in the cooperative is held \n     by active cooperative members that--\n       ``(A) own, feed, or control livestock; and\n       ``(B) provide the livestock to the cooperative for \n     slaughter; or\n       ``(3) a packer that is owned or controlled by producers of \n     a type of livestock, if during a calendar year the packer \n     slaughters less than 2 percent of the head of that type of \n     livestock slaughtered in the United States; or''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the amendments \n     made by subsection (a) take effect on the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (2) Transition rules.--In the case of a packer that on the \n     date of enactment of this Act owns, feeds, or controls \n     livestock intended for slaughter in violation of section \n     202(f) of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (as amended by \n     subsection (a)), the amendments made by subsection (a) apply \n     to the packer--\n       (A) in the case of a packer of swine, beginning on the date \n     that is 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act; \n     and\n       (B) in the case of a packer of any other type of livestock, \n     beginning as soon as practicable, but not later than 180 \n     days, after the date of enactment of this Act, as determined \n     by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I will speak a little bit now on this \namendment and what it pertains to, but I am offering this on behalf of \nSenator Grassley, my colleague from Iowa.\n  This is an amendment to the Craig amendment. Senator Grassley, \nunavoidably, could not be here today. He has to be back in the State of \nIowa. But, obviously, we will not be voting on this until next week \nanyway. But we wanted to lay this down today.\n  I am going to take the time now just to talk a little bit about this \namendment and what it does. And then, of course, my colleague, Senator \nGrassley, will further elaborate on this when he returns after the \nweekend.\n  As my colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, mentioned yesterday, there \nhas been a great amount of hype surrounding Senator Johnson's amendment \nthat bans packer ownership. I cosponsored that amendment. The chief \ncosponsor, of course, was Senator Grassley from Iowa. Now, Senator \nCraig wants to replace the Johnson amendment which was adopted in the \nSenate, with a study because Senator Craig says he has some concerns \nabout how the Johnson amendment will work.\n  The basic concern--as I understand it, and as I listened to the \nspeech last night and have read the Record--is over the word, \n``control''; that somehow there is a confusion about ``control'' and \nwhether ``control'' would prohibit any kind of contracting \nrelationships that a packer might have with a producer.\n  Certainly, I believed when the Johnson-Grassley amendment was adopted \nthat it was quite clear in the legislative language, and in the \nlegislative history, that the amendment did not in\n\n[[Page S523]]\n\nany way preclude various types of contracting arrangements, such as \nforward contracting, for example.\n  But those who are representing the huge packing industry have come in \nand kind of muddied the water. They have clouded it up and said: Oh, \nno, this may take away a farmer's right to contract. Of course, I have \nheard from some of my farmers in Iowa, who, first, do not want packer \nownership of livestock because they know how badly that affects them, \nbut, second, they do not want to have interference with contractual \nrelationships they might want to make with packers.\n  So to take care of any lingering concerns about this issue of \n``control,'' Senator Grassley is offering a second-degree amendment to \nSenator Craig's amendment.\n  In essence, Senator Grassley's amendment, which I have asked to be a \ncosponsor of, will make it clear that while packers will not be able to \nown livestock, farmers will still be able to use contracts if they want \nto.\n  As I said, there has been a lot of sort of hubbub going on around the \nJohnson amendment. Earlier this morning, I engaged in a colloquy with \nmy friend from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone. And there were these \negregious ads taken out in the Sioux Falls Argus Herald by one large \npacker, Smithfield Foods, Incorporated. The person who signed that was \nMr. Joseph W. Luter, III, chairman and chief executive officer of \nSmithfield Foods, Inc. We talked about this ad and how egregious, how \nbad it is. It really is economic and political blackmail in the way \nthis ad was written and what they are threatening to do. So again, to \nclear this up, Senator Grassley and I have offered this amendment to \nhelp address this type of economic strongarming.\n  What the bill said, and what the legislative history made clear, is \nthat packers could no longer own livestock, but the farmers could still \ncontract and enter into these marketing agreements.\n\n  Well now, how did the industry, the packing industry, create all this \nfuss? They did everything in their power to confuse and scare farmers, \nby making the conclusory statement that the Johnson legislation would \nban contracting. In one paper, which Senator Craig referenced last \nnight, eight economists made the same false assumption that the \nprohibition of packer ``control'' of livestock would affect \ncontracting.\n  Why the economists assume this, I do not know. The economic paper \nprovided no legal analysis. I am told that none of the eight economists \nis a lawyer or has had any training in the law. The economic paper \nprovided no legal analysis. In fact, to my knowledge, the opponents of \nthis ban, the big packers, have never released any type of legal \nanalysis to the public. They have just said this as a scare tactic. I \nguess the reason they have not released any legal analysis is because \nit would not survive legal or public scrutiny.\n  The economists relied on an incorrect legal assumption. So they \nrelied on an incorrect legal assumption, and they provided a detailed \nanalysis based on that incorrect legal assumption. And, of course, the \npacking industry and the press ran with it.\n  Thankfully, three lawyers who have worked in agriculture for years \nand are some of the best known in the field pointed out the fallacy of \nthe economists' assumption. Roger McEowen of Kansas State University, \nNeil Harl of Iowa State University--whom I know personally is both a \nlawyer and an economist--and Peter Carstensen of the University of \nWisconsin Law School, the three of them thoroughly explained that the \nword, ``control,'' has a very predictable meaning in the law and that \nit does not affect contracting.\n  Madam President, I will not read it, but I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record the analysis and statement by these three \nindividuals regarding the legal standpoint issue of ``control.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       From a legal standpoint, ``control'' issues arise \n     frequently in an agency context in situations involving the \n     need to distinguish between an ``independent contractor'' and \n     an ``employee'' for reasons including, but not limited to, \n     liability and taxation. Typically, the existence of an agency \n     relationship is a question of fact for a jury to decide. At \n     its very essence, whether a relationship is an independent \n     contractor relationship or a master-servant relationship \n     depends on whether the entity for whom the work is performed \n     has reserved the right to control the means by which the work \n     is to be conducted. Under many production contract settings, \n     the integrator controls both the mode and manner of the \n     farming operation. The producer no longer makes many of the \n     day-to-day management decisions while the integrator controls \n     the production-to-marketing cycle. The integrator is also \n     typically given twenty-four hour access to the producer's \n     facilities. Conversely, forward contracts, formula pricing \n     agreements and other types of marketing contracts typically \n     do not give the integrator managerial or operational control \n     of the farming operation or control of the production-to-\n     marketing cycle. Instead, such contracts commonly provide the \n     packer with only a contractual right to receive delivery of \n     livestock in the future. While it is not uncommon that \n     livestock marketing contracts contain quality specifications, \n     most of those contract provisions relate exclusively to the \n     amount of any premium or discount in the final contract \n     payment for livestock delivered under the contract. \n     Importantly, the manner in which quality requirements tied to \n     price premiums are to be satisfied remains within the \n     producer's control. Accordingly, such marketing contracts \n     would likely be held to be beyond the scope of the \n     legislation's ban on packer ownership or control of livestock \n     more than two weeks before slaughter. Thus, a packer would \n     still have the ability to coordinate supply chains and assure \n     markets for livestock producers through contractual \n     arrangements provided the contracts do not give the packer \n     operational and managerial control over the livestock \n     producer's production activities.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. So even with the assurance from these three legal \nexperts, the opponents continue to raise doubts about the Johnson \namendment's effect on contracting, even to the extent that some of the \noriginal supporters of the ban now want to set it aside because they, \ntoo, are concerned about this control issue. We cannot take this step \nbackward.\n  Recently, Senator Grassley and I, and others, have been working with \nsome of these legal experts, as well as the American Farm Bureau, to \ndevelop an amendment that takes away any need to delay further any ban \non packer ownership. This amendment makes it even clearer that while \npackers cannot own livestock, farmers still have the ability to forward \ncontract and enter marketing agreements.\n  Let me describe how this amendment works.\n  Essentially, this amendment says that a packer can forward a contract \nor enter into any type of marketing agreement as long as the producer \ncontinues to materially participate in the management of the operation \nwith respect to the production of the livestock. The key phrase here \nis, ``materially participate.''\n  Why do we choose those words? Because there is a well-established \ndefinition to the phrase. Every farmer knows the phrase. Every attorney \nwho works with the farmers knows well the importance of the term. That \nis because a farmer who materially participates in the farming \noperation must pay self-employment taxes. Those who do not materially \nparticipate do not have to pay self-employment taxes.\n  The phrase has appeared in the IRS Code, section 1402(a) since 1956. \nTo say that there is overly abundant case law and administrative \ncomment and law review articles about the term would be an \nunderstatement.\n  The legal community, the tax community, and the farm community know \nthe difference because it is simply the difference between having to \npay self-employment taxes or not paying them.\n  What does this mean for forward contracts and marketing agreements? \nThis amendment does not affect them. I know that farmers in Iowa who \nsell hogs under marketing agreements or who sell cattle under forward \ncontracts materially participate because they pay self-employment \ntaxes. Because the farmers materially participate in the management of \ntheir livestock production, this amendment will not affect their \ncontracts.\n  This amendment takes care of any concern that people had about the \noriginal law being unclear. It definitely takes care of anyone's \nconcern about the law's effect on contracting. This amendment also \nmaintains the same exemption from Senator Johnson's original amendment; \nthat is, it exempts cooperatives as well as small packers who slaughter \nless than 2 percent of the national slaughter.\n  Therefore, many of the innovative startup projects operating and \nbeing\n\n[[Page S524]]\n\nformed to get producers greater bargaining power in the market will not \nbe affected by this amendment.\n  I have to say something about Senator Craig's amendment in which he \nwants further study. Around here we know that an amendment to do a \nfurther study is killing the amendment-- especially this one. Senator \nCraig says we need more information. We have been there. The USDA has \nreleased a number of studies and papers on the issue of packer \nownership and captive supply over the years, and the only thing that is \nclear is that the issue begs for policy clarification from Congress.\n  Just in the past few years, the USDA released a major study on the \nprocurement practices in the Texas panhandle as well as a recently \nreleased paper on the captive supply of cattle. This paper, which was \nreleased on January 18 of this year, included a 15-page appendix that \nlists the numerous studies already conducted. Senator Craig wants more \nstudies.\n\n  What do these studies find? They find a strong correlation between \nincreased captive supplies and lower prices. The correlation is there. \nBut the studies usually find that it is too hard to tell for sure \nwhether one causes the other.\n  It seems that the USDA is never going to be able to tell for sure. \nSomeone can always create doubt. It is precisely in these types of \nsituations that Congress should step in and clarify that certain \npractices such as packer ownership are illegal, to clarify it once and \nfor all.\n  It really boils down to this: If you believe that the top four \npackers of cattle in this country who control 81 percent of the market \nshould be able to own livestock in a captive situation--if you believe \nthat--you want to vote for Craig. You don't want to vote for the \nGrassley amendment. But if you believe that those independent cattle \nproducers in Missouri, Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska, Texas, and \nKansas--all over the Midwest and the West--if you believe those \nindependent producers ought to have some bargaining power and be able \nto bargain and negotiate with those top four packers on prices and have \nsome independence and be able to own their livestock or to contract it, \nthen you will want to vote for the Grassley amendment.\n  That is what it is all about. You have huge packers who want to own \nlivestock, who now own livestock. And here is the way it works. The \npacker owns the livestock. The farmer comes in. When cattle are ready \nto sell, you can't keep them around much longer; you have to sell them. \nSo you go to the packer, and the packer says: Here is how much money I \nwill give you for them. The livestock producer says: That is not \nenough. The packer says: Take it or leave it, because I have my own \ncattle which I can feed through the packinghouse, and I know you can't \nkeep those cattle for another 14 days on feed.\n  There you go. They squeeze them. It is called economic concentration, \nand they squeeze those independent producers. They are going out of \nbusiness right and left.\n  In my part of the country, we like to have a good livestock industry. \nYou have balance. Sometimes when grain prices are low, you get high \nlivestock prices. If livestock prices are low, you get higher grain \nprices. You have a good, even income for farmers who may have both \nlivestock on feed, whether it is cattle or hogs, and grain production.\n  This takes away from those independent farmers a valuable source of \nincome and livelihood.\n  Packer ownership does not help farmers. The packers get an increased \nability to manipulate the markets. When packers lock up the chain \nspace, as they say at the packing plant, the farmer does not have \naccess to the market. We don't need a study. We have had enough \nstudies. We need good, clear legislation. The Grassley amendment that \nprohibits the ownership of livestock by packers clears this up once and \nfor all.\n  Studies we don't need. We don't have to wait for studies. We have had \nplenty of them. Our farmers have been calling for action for years. \nLiterally dozens of farm, commodity, rural community, and religious \ngroups seek a ban on packer ownership. The two largest general farm \norganizations, the American Farm Bureau and the National Farmers Union, \nhave explicit policy against packer ownership. They don't call for more \ndelay. They don't call for more wringing of hands, for more studies \nthat never seem to come to fruition. They want us to respond to the \nreal problems that real farmers have out in the countryside today.\n\n  Our farmers deserve more than just another study that is not going to \nshow anything. They want real reform in the livestock markets. I think \nit is time to give them what they need and what our country needs. If \nwe really believe in the market system, and we believe in many players \nand transparency and openness, how can you vote to let four of the top \npackers of livestock who control 81 percent of the market control all \nthe inputs? That is not a free market. What our livestock producers are \ncalling for is a free market. That is what we are calling for.\n  I compliment my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, for his \namendment and for working with us--and the staffs working together with \nothers--on a bipartisan basis to clear this up once and for all. When \nwe get back next week, we will speak again about this.\n  Over the weekend, there should not be any doubt in anyone's mind that \nthe Johnson amendment would prohibit forward contracting. It doesn't. \nBut in case there is any lingering doubt, the Grassley amendment clears \nit up and makes it explicitly clear that this amendment will not \nprohibit contracting relationships between farmers and packers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wellstone). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank Senators Lugar and \nHarkin for the hard work they have demonstrated on this bill. I also \nthank them for accepting a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that is \nsimilar to a resolution I introduced earlier this week along with nine \nof my colleagues: Senators Bingaman, Dayton, Dorgan, Kerry, Sarbanes, \nChafee, Dodd, Hagel, and Lott.\n  Our resolution highlighted the important role effective foreign \nassistance programs play in fostering political stability, food \nsecurity, rule of law, democracy, and ultimately peace around the \nworld.\n  Our resolution, as we originally introduced it, expressed the sense \nof the Senate regarding the importance of U.S. foreign assistance \nprograms as a diplomatic tool for fighting global terrorism and \npromoting U.S. security interests.\n  Many times we think about foreign assistance as just humanitarian \nassistance, helping other people. We have an obligation to do that. We \nforget, though, that when it is used effectively, it is a good foreign \npolicy tool.\n  In fact, it is an essential foreign policy tool. Tragically, I \nbelieve we have seen the amount of money that we put into foreign \nassistance go down in real dollars within the last 20 years. So as we \ntry to carry out American foreign policy, that tool is simply not there \nas much as it used to be.\n  Without question, there is a direct link between foreign aid programs \nand the self-sufficiency and stability of these developing countries. \nThe reality is that when we go into a developing, impoverished, or war-\ntorn nation and give the suffering people assistance, we can make a \npositive difference. We can feed starving children, care for the sick \nand elderly, house countless orphans, and teach people new and more \neffective methods of farming. If we do these things, the people of \nthose nations would be better able to pull themselves out of \nhopelessness and despair. These assistance programs must be looked at \nnot just as a handout but literally, as we always say, a hand up, \ngiving people the opportunity to help themselves.\n  Chaos, poverty, hunger, political uncertainty, and social instability \nare the root causes of violence and conflict around the world. We know \nthis. We also know we must not wait for a nation to implode before we \ntake action. We must not wait for a nation's people to suffer from \npoverty, disease, and hunger. We must not wait for the rise of despotic \nleaders and corrupt governments, such as the Taliban.\n  I believe we certainly have a moral obligation to those in the world \nsuffering at the hands of evil leaders and corrupt governments. We have \na moral obligation to the 1.2 billion people in the world who are \nliving on less than $1 a day. We have a moral obligation to\n\n[[Page S525]]\n\nthe 3 billion people who live on only $2 a day. This kind of poverty is \nunacceptable and, quite candidly, it is dangerous to us and to the \nstability of the world. I think it is something we have to work to \nchange. It is in our self-interest that we do so.\n  The fact is that foreign assistance has had an enormous impact when \napplied effectively. For example, over the past 50 years, our \nassistance has helped reduce infant child death rates in the developing \nworld by 50 percent. We also have had a significant impact on worldwide \nchild survival and health promotions, through initiatives, such as \nvaccinations and school feeding programs.\n  Agriculture is certainly another area of great success. Today, 43 of \nthe top 50 countries that import American agricultural products have in \nthe past received humanitarian assistance from the United States. \nToday, they are our customers. Our investment in better seeds and \nagricultural techniques over the past two decades have made it possible \nto feed an additional 1 billion people throughout the world.\n  Despite its importance and immeasurable value, our overall foreign \naffairs budget has been stagnant for the past 20 years. As I said, in \nreal dollars, it has gone down. We currently use only about one-half of \n1 percent of our Federal budget for humanitarian assistance. Yet this \nassistance is absolutely critical for people in war-ravaged, \npolitically unstable, impoverished nations. The children, the elderly, \nand the civilian people are not responsible for the political and \neconomic turmoil in their homelands, but they are the ones who always \nend up suffering the most.\n  Right now, increases in foreign assistance could make a very real \ndifference around the world. One example is in our own backyard, and \nthat is in the country of Haiti. I recently returned from a trip to \nHaiti, where I witnessed the tremendous devastation, destitution, and \ndesperation of that country located less than 2 hours by plane from the \nshores of Miami.\n  Haiti remains the poorest country in the hemisphere. Democracy and \npolitical stability continue to elude the Haitian people. The already-\ndire humanitarian conditions of Haiti's 8.2 million people continue, \ntragically, to deteriorate. Today, less than one-half of their \npopulation can read or write. The country's infant mortality rate is \nthe highest, by far, in our hemisphere. At least 23 percent of the \nchildren up to age 5 are malnourished. Only 39 percent of Haitians have \naccess to clean water, and diseases such as measles, malaria, and \ntuberculosis are epidemic.\n  Haiti is also suffering from an AIDS crisis--really an epidemic. \nRoughly 1 out of 12 Haitians is living with HIV/AIDS. This is the \nhighest rate in the world, outside of sub-Sahara Africa. According to \nthe Centers for Disease Control projections, Haiti will experience up \nto 44,000 new HIV/AIDS cases this year, and that is at least 4,000 more \nthan the number expected in the United States. We have a population, \nobviously, a great deal higher than Haiti. They have a population of \nabout 8 million people. Ours is nearly 35 times larger than theirs.\n  In addition, there are an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 deaths each year \nin Haiti from AIDS. Already, AIDS has orphaned 163,000 children. That \nnumber is expected to skyrocket to between 320,000 to 390,000 over the \nnext 10 years. Haiti also continues to suffer from an unnecessarily \nhigh HIV transmission rate from mother to child. Some of this is easily \nprevented through proper counseling and medication. Currently, only one \nclinic in Port-au-Prince provides these critical, lifesaving services.\n  Indeed, things are bad in Haiti, and they stand to get only worse. \nRight now there is a great deal of money that the international \ncommunity is holding up, awaiting reforms to be made, awaiting the \nGovernment of Haiti to settle disputes concerning the May 2000 \nelection. I believe it is correct to withhold that money. But what it \nmeans is that the only assistance coming from many countries--certainly \nthe only assistance coming from the U.S.--is the purely humanitarian \nassistance that does not go through the Government. That purely \nhumanitarian assistance has gone down and down and down. We have taken \nit down for the last few years. The prospects are that we will take it \ndown again this year. I think that is, quite bluntly, a mistake. It is \na mistake for us to continue to reduce this humanitarian assistance. \nThis is not money that is going to the Government of Haiti. This money \nis going to NGOs, private organizations, charitable groups that are \ndealing directly with the people of Haiti, who are helping with \nagricultural problems and challenges and helping them feed their \nchildren through school feeding programs and helping them with the AIDS \nproblem. All of this work is done directly on the ground by people who \nare making a difference.\n  I think we should reconsider our position--the position we have seen \nin the past few years of continuing to ramp down that assistance that \ngoes directly to these NGOs and to the people of Haiti. I believe we \nhave a moral obligation to stay committed to these people, irrespective \nof what the Haitian Government does or does not do. The reality is that \nwe need to increase foreign assistance across the board, not just the \nmoney that goes to protect the Haitian people but the much-needed aid \nthat reaches all corners of the developing world. While we as a Nation \nmust project strength, we also must project compassion.\n  Quite simply, providing humanitarian assistance is the right thing to \ndo. It is also in our national interest to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S525-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S525-S528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention \nof my colleagues the coming debate on the energy bill which will be \nbefore this body sometime next week, at the pleasure of the majority \nleader, of course. I want to share with my colleagues the concern I \nhave that somehow in this energy bill we may get into a debate--and it \nmay be more than a debate. It may be pointing fingers at one another--\nwith regard to the Enron situation. I think it is fair to say there is \na lot of blame around here.\n  The objective and responsibility we have is to correct the damage \nthat has been done to ensure it does not happen again, and if indeed we \ncan find accountability, we should proceed with that process because \nthat is part of our job.\n  In my opinion, as the former chairman of the Energy Committee and \nranking member currently, we have going on a little politics both in \nthe House and Senate. We are trying to create a political issue out of \nthe Enron failure. I think it is fair to say at least some are not \nparticularly interested in the facts. They are more interested in the \nrhetoric, which occasionally occurs around here.\n  What we have seen is the devastation with the employees, the \nstockholders, the billions that are lost, and retirement funds that \nhave been wiped out. Indeed, I think we have to focus on the reality \nthat this is a series of lies, a series of deceits, a series of shoddy \naccounting, a series of corporate misconduct, a series of coverup. That \nis the bottom line. It should not have happened, but it did happen. I \nthink it is fair to say our obligation goes to trying to protect the \nconsumers and protect the stockholders.\n  One of the interesting things, though, as one who has followed the \nenergy process very close, the failure of Enron really had nothing to \ndo with the market price of electricity, the market price of national \ngas, or the market price to consumers in this country. It is very \nimportant to understand the system worked. In other words, Enron was \nbuying and selling energy. They were not a great producer of energy. \nWhen they basically failed, those who were supplying Enron simply moved \nto other distributors. So the consumer was not hurt. Keep that in mind. \nThis was a failure internally within this corporation that affected a \nlot of people, but it did not affect the ratepayers nor the supply in \nthis country. The private system basically worked.\n  What are some of the issues surrounding the political gain or \npolitical consequences? I think we have to agree we should try and look \nat a bipartisan effort to present real solutions to America's energy \nproblems. Some are interested in demonizing the President and the Vice \nPresident with stories that are somewhat misleading and off the focus \nof the reality of why this corporation failed. We have seen our good\n\n[[Page S526]]\n\nfriend over in the House, Congressman Henry Waxman, issue a white paper \nentitled, ``How the White House Energy Plan Benefited Enron.'' That is \na pretty broad accusation.\n  Now I want to try and balance that a little bit because the \nCongressman asserts many policies in the White House energy plan are \nvirtually identical to the positions Enron advocated. I want to look at \nthe record for a few minutes.\n  The intended inference of the report, no matter how inaccurate, is \nthat the administration's national energy policy was written solely to \nbenefit Enron.\n  In my opinion, the logic of the Congressman leaves a little bit to be \ndesired. To use that logic, we should be critical of any energy bill \nthat helps meet our Nation's growing energy needs just because a \ncompany, for that matter any company, even one producing renewable \nenergy, could benefit.\n  It is true some elements of the administration's energy policy are \nconsistent with the views of Enron, but it is also true that far more \nelements of the Clinton administration's energy policy were consistent \nwith the views of Enron.\n  I think we have to look at some of the facts. I am prepared to do \nthat in the next few minutes. For example, one of the elements, \naccording to a Washington Post story on January 12, in a meeting when \nSecretary of Energy Pena under the Clinton administration, and Ken Lay, \nwho was the head of Enron, pressed the Clinton administration to \npropose legislation that would assert Federal authority over a national \nelectricity market--now this is what the previous administration \nbasically did. It was kind of interesting because some of the material \nthat comes out of the research that is done by the media, that \naddresses some of the backroom meetings that went on, deserve the light \nof day, and I am prepared to share that briefly. I met with Ken Lay in \nmy office on one occasion.\n  The purpose of Mr. Lay's meeting with me was to encourage me to \nsupport deregulation at a time certain of America's electric energy \nmarket. Under the deregulation plan he supported, there would be a \nsimultaneous definite date under which various States would come in \nunder deregulation. I was opposed to that.\n  That had happened, of course, in the California situation where we \nhad a cap by the State of California on retail, and I felt we could not \nsimply mandate everybody come in at the same time under deregulation. \nThe fact that some have deregulated, like Pennsylvania, Texas, and \nother States, it has gone very well. Those States have seen a reduction \nin their electric rates. It still was not a perfect process. The States \nshould have the opportunity for innovation and to deregulate over a \nperiod of time.\n  According to a company version of the meeting, Lay and Pena, after my \nmeeting with Lay, agreed that a go-slow approach to deregulation \nadvocated by the Senate Energy Committee's chairman, Frank Murkowski, \nRepublican of Alaska, was unacceptable. In other words, Pena had asked \nEnron officials to keep the Energy Department staffers posted on \ndevelopments in Congress.\n  The point I want to make, and make very clear, is it would not have \nbeen in the national interest to have followed the objective of Ken Lay \nand Enron to open up simultaneous deregulation of the electric market. \nAs indicated in the memorandum, in the meeting with Pena and Ken Lay--\nand Pena, again, was Secretary of Energy at that time--they agreed that \nmy approach was too slow and unacceptable.\n  I want to compare where we are today because this is the issue, or \nthe accusation, that somehow the energy plan proposed by the \nadministration was out of the Enron playbook. I want to compare where \nthe current energy bill is relative to the specifics that would be \napplicable to Enron if Enron were still a functioning corporation. So \nlet us look at many of the elements of Senator Daschle's energy bill \nbecause I believe many of them are straight out of the Enron playbook \nin asserting Federal authority over a national electric market. I think \nit should be pointed out that Enron has never wanted to deregulate \nelectricity. Instead, they want to Federalize electricity. Now there is \na difference. It is the regulatory process. Enron wanted different \nregulations, not deregulation in the sense of my last remarks where I \nindicated the only thing they would support was simultaneous \nderegulation.\n  So they wanted different regulations. They wanted to preempt States \nand put FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in charge. \nEnron wanted to create a one-size-fits-all system that benefits \nnational marketers such as Enron--Enron is a national marketer. They \ndid not produce power --and, on the other hand, ignore local concerns \nand interests, which is one of the reasons I objected. Enron wanted \nspecial provisions of particular benefit to that company.\n  I think Enron had every intention of getting a movement in their \ndirection, and they had access to take their plans directly to the \nupper echelons of the leadership, and they did. What is the result? Let \nme share the result because this is where we are today. This is what \nthis body is going to be looking at next week when we take up the \nDaschle energy bill.\n\n  First, this bill did not come before the committee of jurisdiction. \nThat is the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. I am the ranking \nmember. It was crafted in secret. It was crafted in violation of \ntraditional Senate rules. And, in my opinion, to a large degree, it \nwould have benefited Enron because the Daschle bill grants further \nauthority to restructure the electric power industry. It allows FERC to \ntake any action it may deem appropriate to create competition as FERC \nsees fit. The Daschle bill grants FERC open access to all transmission \nlines. It gives FERC authority over transmission not now within the \npurview of federally owned and State owned. The Daschle bill creates \nuniform reliability standards under FERC control. That is something \nEnron opposed. The industry consensus relied on this because it would \nallow for regional differences. They did not want regional differences.\n  The Daschle bill includes transmission information disclosure. That \nbenefited Enron's trading activities, provisions that require \ndisclosure for potential commercial sensitive transactions that would \nhave given Enron a complete and competitive advantage and helped them \ngame the electric power mark.\n  Further, the Daschle bill offers a special transmission access and \nbenefit for wind generators and a renewable portfolio standard of \nbenefits. As we know, Enron owns wind generation companies.\n  The Daschle bill includes Federal preemption of States on consumer \nprotection. Enron wanted a uniform regulatory system, equally \nacceptable across State lines, regardless of different needs in \ndifferent States.\n  Finally, the Daschle energy bill includes nationwide uniform \ninterconnection standards. Again, Enron wanted a unified national \nsystem without talking and taking into consideration regional concern.\n  That is a partial wish list. As we look at the allegations back and \nforth of whose bill favors Enron, we should look at it fairly and \nobjectively. This is a virtual wish list, in my opinion, for a company \nthat made millions and millions of dollars trading electricity \nnationwide.\n  Enron's main goal was to create the federalized system found to a \nlarge degree in the Daschle bill before the Senate. By knocking down \nState rights in exchange for Federal command and control, Enron would \nhave gained the substantial advantage in energy markets at the hands of \nState protections of consumers. In other words, the State has the \nobligation to protect its consumers.\n  One Senator referred to the Bush energy plan the other day as ``a \ncash and carry'' for Enron. If that is the case, perhaps the approach \nwe have in the majority leader's bill ought to be ``a quick check'' as \nEnron got far more money and would have gotten far more money in the \nproposed bill before the Senate, the Daschle bill, than it did under \nthe Bush energy plan. As I say, those who live in glasshouses should \nnot throw stones and perhaps should not take baths.\n  I conclude with the situation surrounding the committee of \njurisdiction, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. We talk \nabout ensuring that we have an energy supply to meet our Nation's \nneeds. There is one place in this country where energy\n\n[[Page S527]]\n\nis in great demand. In my opinion, that is this body of the Senate. \nEnergy, energy, everywhere, in all sorts of committees--except one \ncommittee. That is the committee where it belongs, the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee.\n\n  Through a press release issued late last October, Senator Daschle \nbasically pulled the plug on the Energy Committee: The Senate's \nleadership wants to avoid quarrelsome, divisive votes in committee. \nThat was how the release read.\n  What happened was, clearly, the majority leader did not like the \nwriting on the wall, so he basically took and created his own bill and \nintroduced it as the bill that will be considered by this body. I think \nthe development of that bill was in the worst traditions of the Senate \nand was done without the open process associated with the committee \nrequirements. There was no opportunity for Republican or Democrat \namendments, and it was done far out of the reach of the public or input \nof the reach of the public, out of the glare of the media. That fact, \nin itself, should have the media howling. But I don't hear many of them \nhowling. But their silence on that fact has been somewhat deafening.\n  In doing so, the committee of jurisdiction has simply not been \nallowed to meet. That is in clear violation of committee rules and \nSenate rules. But we have not met on any markup since October. That is \na mandate from the majority leader to the committee chairman, Senator \nBingaman.\n  What frustrates a lot of Members on the committee is that this is \napplicable only to the Energy Committee. Other committees have been \nallowed to meet, and they have not been pushed aside. For example, the \nCommerce Committee has been allowed to meet because they are having a \nvigorous debate about the controversial issues, CAFE standards for \nautomobiles. It is a legitimate debate, and it belongs in the Commerce \nCommittee. It is an energy debate that should be aired in public, in \nthe press, and under scrutiny of public opinion. That is current. But \nthe committee of jurisdiction is not allowed to meet on the underlying \nbill.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee has been allowed to meet. \nThey are having a vigorous debate about a controversial issue, and that \nis Price-Anderson, to help the nuclear plants that are online in this \ncountry. Again, it is an energy debate that should be aired in public, \nin the press, and under scrutiny. It is being done. Yet the underlying \ncommittee of jurisdiction is forbidden from meeting on the energy bill.\n  The Finance Committee has been allowed to meet. They are debating a \nwide variety of tax provisions to help spark the next generation energy \nsources for the country. Again, it is the energy debate that should be \naired in public, in the press, and under scrutiny. And it is in the \nFinance Committee. But where is the Energy Committee, the committee of \njurisdiction? Silenced--totally silenced in this debate.\n  As the ranking member, I will not be silenced. I don't think this is \na fair process. We are using every avenue available to help make \ncertain the Americans hear the voice on the other side in this debate. \nWe will continue our effort to carry out the challenge that President \nBush laid out in his State of the Union to make this Nation more secure \nin the face of the volatile and dangerous world in which we live. \nEnergy security must be part of that debate, even if the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee is not allowed to meet.\n  Finally, let me generalize on what the Daschle-Bingaman energy bill, \nS. 1766, provides. In general, the bill contains very little in the way \nof increasing domestic production of conventional forms of energy--oil, \nnatural gas, coal, and nuclear. As a consequence of our energy \ndependence on imported oil, we are about 57 percent dependent. On \nSeptember 11, we were importing just over a million barrels a day from \nIraq. Currently, that is 750,000 barrels a day. One has to question \nwhether indeed an energy bill should address our increased dependence \non foreign sources of oil.\n  I am often reminded of a statement made by Mark Hatfield, who served \nin this body for a long, long--long time. He headed up the \nAppropriations Committee. He was a pacifist, if I can characterize him \nto some degree. But on this issue of increasing our imports of oil from \nthe Mideast, he often said: I will support opening up ANWR, opening up \noil discoveries domestically, on any occasion, rather than send one \nmore American, man or woman, overseas to fight a war on foreign soil \nover oil.\n  That is what part of this debate is going to be about, because we \nhave opportunities to increase domestic oil production. Some are going \nto say that we have other forms of energy, let's use them. We do, but \nthe world moves on oil. Until we find another alternative, we are going \nto be increasing our dependence on very unstable sources: Iraq, Iran, \nSaudi Arabia. The consequences of that to the American people are, I \nthink, severe.\n  We are going to have a debate in this body. There is going to be an \neffort to filibuster. The National Environmental Policy Act groups have \nbeen against us. This has been a cash cow for them. Opening up ANWR \nspecifically is the lightning rod. Those organizations have gotten \ntogether and put fear in the American people that it cannot be opened \nup safely.\n  They suggest it is a 6-month supply. That is absolutely ridiculous. \nThat would be like assuming there was no other energy produced in this \ncountry or imported for a period of 6 months.\n  They say it is somewhere between 5.6 and 16 billion barrels. If it \nwere in the middle, 10 billion barrels, it would equate to about 25 \npercent of the total crude oil produced in the United States. It would \nbe the largest discovery, if you will, other than Prudhoe Bay. That is \nmore oil than the proven oil reserves in Texas. Some say it will take \n10 years. We built the Empire State Building in less than 2 years. We \nbuilt a pipeline in a couple of years--800 miles. By permitting, we \ncould get this oil on line in a couple of years.\n  When Members are going to vote on this issue, they are going to be \ntorn by the pressures from America's environmental community that has \nmilked this issue like a cash cow, for money and membership. When we \neventually pass it, they are going to move on to another cause, make no \nmistake about it. I think we are all practical politicians who \nrecognize that.\n  So these Members who stand here are going to have to make a vote on \nwhether to be responsive to the environmental groups or do what is \nright for America--that is, to reduce our dependence on imported oil.\n  This bill favors reduction in energy demand through the creation of \nnew Federal agency efficiency standards--I am talking about CAFE--and \nit also focuses on fuel and renewable energy technologies, all of which \nI support. But we have to be careful and recognize that it is very easy \nto set a goal for 2015 of 37 miles per gallon. We are around 24 miles \nper gallon now. Because in the year 2015 a lot of us are not going to \nbe here, we are not going to be held accountable. So it is very \nconvenient to put that off and say let's achieve a standard of 37 miles \nby the year 2015.\n  We have to concern ourselves with the safety of the automobiles. We \nhave to concern ourselves with the mandate that Government is going to \ndictate what kind of car you drive, jobs protection in the industry--\nOK? These are considerations that I believe are paramount in the \ndiscussion on CAFE standards.\n  Some suggest the alternative is to let a scientific process set an \nachievable increase in CAFE standards, or mileage. That is the position \nI favor. Let's do what is attainable so we can be held accountable, not \nbeing held accountable by the year 2015, or thereabouts, for an amount \nthat may not be practical, achievable, or maybe at a cost that is \nprohibitive--or at a cost of safety or maybe at a cost of jobs.\n\n  Further, this legislation does not appear to solve the pressing \nenergy problems the United States will face in the next decade, acting, \ninstead, as the energy policy for 50 years from now. That is not what \nwe want to do. That is just putting it off. By our account, this bill \ncreates 40 Federal programs, 12 new Federal offices, and authorizes 41 \nnew studies related to energy policy.\n  I am going to have a lot more to say about this later. I conclude my \nremarks again with the reference that each Member here is going to be \nheld\n\n[[Page S528]]\n\naccountable for his or her vote and that accountability should be on \nwhat is right for America, not what the environmental lobby dictates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent an article appearing in the AP entitled \n``U.S.-British Planes Bomb Iraq'' dated Monday, February 4, be printed \nin the Record. We are importing 750 million barrels a day from Iraq at \nthe same time we are bombing them.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Feb. 4, 2002]\n\n                     U.S.-British Planes Bomb Iraq\n\n                            (By Ben Holland)\n\n       Instanbul, Turkey.--U.S. and British planes patrolling a \n     no-fly zone over northern Iraq bombed Iraqi air defense \n     systems Monday in response to anti-aircraft fire, U.S. \n     officials said.\n       It was the first time U.S. and British planes had bombed \n     Iraq's north since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, said Capt. \n     Brian Cullin, a spokesman for U.S. European Command in \n     Stuttgart, Germany. The bombing came amid rising debate on \n     whether Iraq will be the next target of the U.S. anti-terror \n     campaign.\n       The bombs were dropped after Iraqi forces northeast of \n     Mosul in northern Iraq fired on a routine air patrol, the \n     U.S. European Command said in a written statement.\n       ``All coalition aircraft departed the area safely,'' the \n     statement said. Cullin said it would not be clear for some \n     time how much damage was done to the Iraqi targets.\n       U.S. and British planes based in southeast Turkey have been \n     flying patrols over northern Iraq since September, 1996. The \n     two countries say the operation is designed to protect the \n     Kurdish population of northern Iraq from Iraqi leader Saddam \n     Hussein.\n       ``There's a day-to-day commitment made by three very strong \n     coalition partners . . . toward a population we still feel we \n     have an obligation to protect,'' Cullin said.\n       Expectations that Iraq could be the next target of the \n     U.S.-led anti-terror campaign were strengthened by President \n     Bush's State of the Union address last week.\n       Bush said Iraq was part of an ``axis of evil,'' along with \n     Iran and North Korea, and accused it of seeking weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       Turkey, host to the air patrols and a launching pad for \n     strikes against Iraq in the 1992 Gulf War, has expressed \n     anxiety over the prospect of war in Iraq, fearing that the \n     fall of the Baghdad regime could lead Kurds in northern Iraq \n     to create a Kurdish state. That could in turn boost \n     aspirations of autonomy-seeking Kurds in Turkey.\n       Turkey's Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit, warned the Iraqi \n     leader on Monday to admit U.N. weapons inspectors in order to \n     head off possible U.S. military action.\n       Iraq has refused since 1998 to allow U.N. inspectors into \n     the country to check if the Baghdad regime has dismantled its \n     weapons of mass destruction. Baghdad has rejected a U.S. \n     warning to admit the inspectors or face the consequences.\n       In a letter to Hussein, Ecevit warned of the ``sever \n     consequences to be encountered'' if Iraq does not allow the \n     inspection.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, I always enjoy his presentations. He is always prepared. He \nbelieves fervently in what he was addressing. I look forward to the \ndebate we are going to have on ANWR and a number of other issues on \nthis energy bill, which is going to come up next week. The majority \nleader indicated last year that it would be brought up before the \nPresidents Day break. That break is a week from today.\n  We are on the agriculture bill. I think we can see the end of that, \nas I mentioned to my friend from Alaska today. I hope we can be on the \nenergy bill by next Wednesday and work on that for a few days next week \nand maybe a few days after that when we come back. But I look forward \nto the debate. It is something we need to do. Energy policy is so \nimportant to this country.\n  While there are divergent views on what that energy policy should be, \nthat is the American system. We are going to come here, work through \nall this, and come up this year with what I hope is a finalized version \nafter we finish our conference. It will be something to give us a long-\nterm energy policy for this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S528-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S528-S537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAGRICULTURE, CONSERVATION, AND RURAL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment I just \noffered be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a few weeks ago I saw a movie called ``A \nBeautiful Mind.'' It is based upon a true story of a man by the name of \nJohn Nash who is a mathematician from Blue Field, WV. He is probably \none of smartest men ever born on this Earth. I was so fascinated by the \nmovie that I read the book which was the basis for the movie. The book \nwas even more intriguing, interesting, and fascinating than the movie. \nIt was a thick book. It read like a novel. I couldn't put it down.\n  This brilliant man could see the solution to the most complicated \nmath problems. He could see a solution to the problem before he \ndetermined how the solution came about. Most people work the other way. \nThey work up to finding a solution. He knew the solution. After he \nfound the solution, he would work out the problems so other people \ncould understand how he arrived at the solution.\n  Just one example: He won a Nobel Prize for what is called game theory \nin economics. Certainly, I am no mathematician. I will not explain it \nvery well.\n  But there was another eminent scientist who figured out what would \nhappen between two people playing a game--whether it was checkers, or a \ngame of cards, or a game of two people playing basketball. He would \ndetermine what the result would be. But John Nash said that is not good \nenough. What you need to do is figure out what would happen when large \nnumbers of people participated in a game. If two people, or four \npeople, or any amount of people were playing a game, he could determine \nwhat would happen. It sounds fantastic and unbelievable that you can do \nthat through mathematics, but he did it.\n  One of the things that could be determined, for example, were moves \nof the military during the cold war. Through a mathematical formula \nusing John Nash's theory, you could determine what would happen if the \nUnited States did this. This is what the Soviet Union would do.\n  I will not go into any more detail other than tell you he was a \nbrilliant man. But sadly, he became a schizophrenic paranoid. He had \npeople talking to him all the time who were real to him. These people \ntalking to John Nash were as real as if we were speaking to our wives \nwhen we left home today or speaking to one of the Senate staff. He \nbelieved things that he heard. As the movie depicts, he saw people on \noccasion.\n  Obviously, I was fascinated by this movie and by this book, but \nlistening yesterday to the people come to this Chamber and talk about \nmy language in this farm bill made me think of this movie and this \nbook. I am not accusing them of being paranoid or schizophrenic because \nthey were talking about something they either knew nothing about or \nthey were imagining things because they came down here talking about \nhow bad my water legislation was and they simply were without any basis \nin fact. I don't know where this came from.\n\n[[Page S529]]\n\n  I am from the West and people think about why a Senator from out West \nwould talk about these ``sacred issues'' such as water, grazing, and \nwilderness. I do it for a number of reasons. No. 1, I feel competent \nand qualified to do that. I live in the West. We don't need someone \nfrom Rhode Island telling us what to do in the West, even though they \nhave a right to do so because this is a national congress. But in \naddition to that, there is a new West out there.\n  I have great respect for cowboys, ranchers, and miners. But I am also \nrealistic. The West has changed. Seventy percent of the people in the \nState of Nevada live in Las Vegas. We have to protect those people in \nLas Vegas as much as we do the people in the outlining areas. We need \nto make sure they have water. Reno has 20 percent of the people in the \nState of Nevada. Ninety percent of the people in Nevada live in two \nmetro areas. I have an obligation to 90 percent of the people in the \nState of Nevada, just as I have for the other 10 percent of the people \nin the State of Nevada.\n\n  Water has changed. We know that agriculture uses huge amounts of \nwater. In this farm bill, I thought it was time we started being \nrealistic about the new West. Therefore, I worked hard to get a \nprotection in that bill dealing with a conservation program. Why \nshouldn't we deal with conservation in a farm bill? Many of us involved \nin the farm bill are not from the breadbasket States. The Presiding \nOfficer is from the State of Minnesota.\n  When I was Lieutenant Governor of Nevada, one night I went to the \nGovernor's Mansion. My dear friend, Governor O'Calahan, taught me in \nhigh school and he taught me how to fight. That is where I learned to \nbox--from Governor O'Calahan. He was a great fighter with over 200 \namateur fights. He lost his leg in the Korean war and lost his boxing \ncareer.\n  I can remember we were there in the Governor's Mansion with his old \nuncle from Minnesota. I sat and listened to these two men--one an old \nman at that time and Governor O'Calahan who was a very young Governor--\ntalk about growing up in Minnesota. I thought they were making it up. \nBut I have checked with other people since. It is absolutely true that \nin Minnesota at nighttime in the hot summer you can actually hear the \ncrops growing--snapping, popping out, and growing. That isn't the way \nof the West.\n  In Searchlight, NV, there are trees around my home. It takes hundreds \nof years for the Joshua and Spanish Daggers to grow. It takes hundreds \nof years. We have bushes all around my home in Searchlight. They take \nhundreds of years to grow. That is how the arid desert is different \nthan the breadbasket.\n\n  So for many of us involved in the farm bill--we are not from the \nbreadbasket States--the most important provisions of this bill are \nthose that deal with conservation.\n  In the State of the Presiding Officer--the land of lakes--Minnesota \nhas hundreds of lakes, I am told. In Nevada, we have very few lakes. We \nhave Lake Mead that is man made. We have Lake Mojave that is man made \nbecause of Davis Dam and Boulder Dam. We have Pyramid Lake and Walker \nLake, two desert terminus lakes. There are only 20 lakes like those in \nthe rest of the world.\n  We do not have many lakes. We have very few rivers. And what we call \nrivers, people from the Presiding Officer's part of the country would \nlaugh at. You can walk across our rivers. So conservation is important \nto us in the West.\n  I started my service in the Senate as a member of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. I am still a member of that committee. I have \nbeen chairman of the committee twice. Probably the most controversial \nissue about which we have dealt in that committee is how we deal with \nthe negative environmental effects of farming and ranching.\n  One time I was serving as chairman of the subcommittee that dealt \nwith fish and wildlife, and we worked on the difficult issue of the \nEndangered Species Act with the late John Chafee, my dear friend, who \nat that time was the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee; my friend Max Baucus, who now is chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, and at that time was the ranking member of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, and Senator Dirk Kempthorne, now the \nGovernor of Idaho. We worked together and crafted a very fine reform of \nthe Endangered Species Act.\n  That effort failed for a couple reasons. One reason it failed was \nbecause it was not moved on quickly enough by Senator Lott, the then-\nmajority leader. He had his own reasons for not moving on it, I am \nsure. At the time it gave people too much time to nitpick our \nlegislation.\n  But I think the main reason the bill failed is that it gave \nlandowners and farmers financial incentives and benefits for helping \nendangered species but the funding was not mandatory. So the farmers \nand landowners were afraid we would not give them any money. People did \nnot know if the appropriations process would put money in their hands. \nSo for the farmers and landowners who wanted financial help, we could \nnot give it to them.\n  This program that is in this bill right now, that my friend, Senator \nCrapo, is trying to change, fills the void that bill could not. It \nbrings real money to the table to help address these problems through \nvoluntary incentives.\n  One of my colleagues from the western part of our country who \ndiscussed this issue in the Chamber yesterday asked: Why are we talking \nabout water in the farm bill? For heaven's sake, why shouldn't we talk \nabout water in the farm bill?\n  In the arid West, agriculture consumes the lion's share of the water. \nSometimes that use comes into conflict with other users.\n  We have had a long, ongoing problem with the tiny little Truckee \nRiver that runs through Reno, NV. It is tiny by the standards of \nMinnesota and other States where there is a lot of water, but in Nevada \nthat is a river that is the lifeblood for the northern part of the \nState.\n  I worked and got passed, about 10 years ago, legislation that settled \na 100-year water war between the States of California and Nevada, which \ninvolved two Indian tribes, two endangered species, involved the cities \nof Reno and Sparks, agricultural interests, and involved a wetlands \nthat had gone from 100,000 acres to 2,000 very putrid acres that were \nkilling fish and animals that even came there. We resolved that. Now \nthere is fresh water going in there. The legislation is almost \nimplemented.\n  At that time, the cities of Reno and Sparks were using 69,000 acre-\nfeet of water a year. The farmers were getting out of that same little \nriver, not long before that, 400,000 acre-feet of water a year. It was \njust a very few farmers. A lot of the water was being wasted that the \nfarmers were using. The only way the wetlands were maintained, even as \nthey were, was because of the overflow from the farms because the \nNewlands project--the first ever Bureau of Reclamation project, that \ncreated that farming community--dried up one lake--Lake Winnemucca is \ngone--and was in the process of drying up Pyramid Lake, lakes \ncontrolled and in the land of the Indians.\n  We were able to reverse that. I think we are going to have a healthy \nagricultural community, and certainly we are going to have a better \nIndian community. They have been able to do a lot of things as a result \nof that legislation.\n  But I only gave that example to show the huge amount of water that is \nused in agriculture. And at the time, they grew basically hay and \nalfalfa, which are very water intensive.\n  This section in this bill is a place to address these conflicts. The \namendment, which I will offer at the appropriate time, to that \nprogram--I am amending my section through the amendment that will be \noffered to Senator Crapo's legislation--is to account for the \nlegitimate concerns people have raised since this legislation first \ncame up before the end of last year.\n  Some of my Western colleagues noted yesterday there will be an \namendment to strike the program. That is what Senator Crapo is doing, \ntrying to eliminate it.\n  My amendment, and the provision in the bill that I have, is supported \nby hundreds of groups. The vote that we will take on my amendment and \nSenator Crapo's will be scored by the League of Conservation Voters. \nThey already have a letter out on that.\n  But the groups supporting this legislation I talked about are too \nnumerous to mention. There are scores of organizations that support \nthis legislation,\n\n[[Page S530]]\n\nnational organizations, such as the National Audubon Society, the World \nWildlife Fund, The Wilderness Society, Trout Unlimited, Environmental \nDefense, and State and local organizations--well over 100 of them from \nAlabama to Wisconsin.\n  This is really good legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters that I have just \nspoken about be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                League of Conservation Voters,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2002.\n     Re oppose anti-environment amendments to the farm bill (S. \n         1731).\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is \n     the political voice of the national environmental community. \n     Each year, LCV publishes the National Environmental \n     Scorecard, which details the voting records of Members of \n     Congress on environmental legislation. The Scorecard is \n     distributed to LCV members, concerned voters nationwide, and \n     the press.\n       LCV urges you to opposes the following amendments to \n     Senator Harkin's (D-IA) Farm Bill:\n       A Smith (R-OR) amendment that would use crop disaster \n     relief funds to pay farmers for implementing environmental \n     laws. These payments to implement a broad range of federal \n     laws and contracts could create a huge drain on funds that \n     are needed to compensate farmers for real disasters and would \n     chill enforcement of important federal environmental, labor \n     and other safeguards.\n       A Crapo (R-ID) amendment that would strike a program that \n     would purchase or lease water rights from farmers to help \n     endangered fish and other species. The program guarantees \n     state water law protections and state approval of all water \n     purchases and leases.\n       A Roberts (R-KS) amendment that would allow self-interested \n     parties, such as fertilizer company representatives, to \n     become federally-reimbursed advisors to farmers on \n     conservation practices. This ``fox guarding the hen house'' \n     provision could allow commercial businesses with an interest \n     in promoting heavy use of chemical inputs to formulate \n     conservation plans designed to limit such inputs to protect \n     water quality.\n       Two Burns (R-MT) amendments: the first would prohibit \n     farmers from enrolling more than half of the farms in the \n     Conservation Reserve Program, which could break up CRP into \n     smaller tracts of land that have significantly less habitat \n     value and bar the enrollment of some highly sensitive lands. \n     S. 1731 already prohibits more than 25% of eligible land in \n     any county from being enrolled in regular CRP. The second \n     Burns amendment would require that the Secretary pay more for \n     enrolling less productive lands in CRP than more productive \n     lands. Many valuable enrollments, such as stream buffer \n     strips, are on both productive and non-productive lands. \n     Reducing payments for productive lands would effectively \n     preclude their enrollment.\n       A Hutchinson (R-AK) amendment to exempt USDA's Wildlife \n     Services program from National Environmental Policy Act \n     (NEPA) review in the killing of migratory birds. It would \n     also eliminate the authority of the Fish and Wildlife Service \n     (FWS) to regulate such killings and create a dangerous \n     precedent for piecemeal exemptions from NEPA and our \n     international treaty obligations.\n       LCV's Political Advisory Committee will consider including \n     votes on these issues in compiling LCV's 2002 Scorecard. If \n     you need more information, please call Betsy Loyless in my \n     office at (202) 785-8683.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Deb Callahan,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 February 5, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: We urge you to help resolve conflicts between \n     farmers and endangered fish and other aquatic species by \n     supporting the incentive-based Water Conservation Program in \n     the conservation title of S. 1731, the Agriculture, \n     Conservation and Rural Enhancement Act of 2001.\n       The Water Conservation Program authorizes the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture to acquire or lease water rights on \n     1.1 million acres of land, so long as water transfers are \n     consistent with state water law and have been approved by \n     state officials. State officials must also permit the \n     Secretary of Agriculture to implement the program in their \n     state.\n       Freshwater species are North America's most endangered \n     class of species--they are vanishing five times faster than \n     North America's mammals or birds and as quickly as tropical \n     rainforest species. Inadequate stream flow is among the \n     leading threats to endangered fish because low summer flows \n     reduce dissolved oxygen levels, increase water temperatures, \n     and limit access to food and spawning habitat. The absence of \n     rising spring flows--which triggers spawning and aids fish \n     migration--is also a major threat.\n       We urge you to support this voluntary, incentive-based \n     approach to one of the nation's most pressing environment \n     challenges. Please support the Water Conservation Program in \n     the conservation title of S. 1731, the Agriculture, \n     Conservation and Rural Enhancement Act of 2001.\n           Sincerely,\n       National Organizations: American Lands; Department of the \n     Planet Earth; Endangered Species Coalition; Environmental \n     Defense; Environmental Working Group; Institute for \n     Agriculture and Trade Policy; Institute for Environment and \n     Agriculture; Land Trust Alliance; National Audubon Society; \n     Rails-to-Trails Conservancy; Restore America's Estuaries; \n     Trout Unlimited; The Wilderness Society; World Wildlife Fund.\n       State and Local Organizations: Alabama Rivers Alliance, AL; \n     Altamaha Riverkeepers, GA; American Bottom Conservancy, IL; \n     American PIE--Public Information on the Environment, MN; \n     Amigos Bravos, NM; Arkansas Nature Alliance, AR; Ascutney \n     Mountain Audubon Society, VT; Audubon Arkansas, AR; Audubon \n     California, CA; Audubon Colorado, CO; Audubon of Florida, FL; \n     Audubon Society of New York State, Inc./Audubon \n     International, NY; Bear River Watershed Council, UT; Belgrade \n     Regional Conservation Alliance, ME; Blue Heron Environmental \n     Network Inc., WV; Cacapon Institute, WV; California League of \n     Conservation Voters, CA; California Trout, Inc., CA; Campaign \n     to Safeguard America's Waters, Earth Island Institute, AK; \n     Citizens for a Future New Hampshire, NH; Citizens for a \n     Quieter Santa Barbara, CA; Citizens for Alternatives to \n     Chemical Contamination, MI; Citizens of Lee Environmental \n     Action Network, VA.\n       Clean Air Now, CA; Clean Up Our River Environment (CURE), \n     MN; Clinch Coalition, VA; Coalition for a Clean Minnesota \n     River, MN; Coalition for Jobs and the Environment, VA; Coast \n     Action Group, CA; Coldwater Fisheries Coalition, Inc., NH; \n     Committee on the Middle Fork Vermilion River, IL; Communty \n     Environmental Council, CA; Community Forestry Resource \n     Center, MN; Concerned Citizens Committee of SE Ohio, OH; \n     Delaware-Otsego Audubon Society, NY; Devil's Fork Trail Club, \n     VA; Douglaston Chapter of the Sierra Club, NY; Dutches County \n     Farm Bureau, NY; ECO-Action, FL; ECO-Store, FL; Endangered \n     Habitats League, CA; Environmental Action!, GA; Environmental \n     Defense Center, CA; Experience Appalachia!, OH; Federation of \n     Fly Fishers, MT; Forest Guardinas, NM; Forest Watch, VT; \n     Friends of Butte Creek, CA; Friends of Critters and the Salt \n     Creek, IL; Friends of Poquessing Watershed, PA; Friends of \n     the Locust Fork River, AL; Friends of the Nanticoke River, \n     MD; Friends of the North Fork of the Shenandoah River, VA.\n       Friends of the Santa Clara River, CA; Friends of the St. \n     Joe River Association, Inc, MI; Friends of the Wekiva River, \n     Inc, FL; Friends of the White Salmon River, WA; Great \n     American Station Foundation, NV; Great Basin Mine Watch, NV; \n     Group for the South Fork, NY; Halifax River Audubon, FL; \n     Hancock County Planning Commission, ME; Hardy Groves, Inc, \n     FL; Humane Education Network, CA; Juniata Valley Audubon \n     Society, PA; Keepers of the Duck Creek Watershed, OH; Lake \n     Champlain Committee, VT; Lake Superior Greens, WI; Maine \n     Congress of Lake Associations, ME; Maine Farmland Trust, ME; \n     Marion County Water Watch, KY; Michigan Resource Stewards, \n     MI; Montana Fishing Outfitters Conservation Fund, MT; Montana \n     River Action Network, MT; Mountaineer Chapter Trout \n     Unlimited, WV; My Mothers Garden Inc.

The Farm \n     Bill heading to the Senate floor, S. 1731, removes the animal \n     unit eligibility cap for the Environmental Quality Incentives \n     Program, opening the program to CAFOs of over 1,000 animal \n     units. Our nation's agricultural policy should help family \n     farmers and encourage sustainable agriculture and should not \n     provide incentives for further concentration of livestock \n     into ever-larger factory farms. The proposed Wellstone \n     amendment would prevent EQIP from becoming a massive giveaway \n     to the nation's largest industrial animal factories.\n       Grassley/Dorgan Payment Cap Amendment: Senators Grassley \n     and Dorgan are offering a major commodity program reform \n     amendment to reduce the payment limit per farm for direct \n     payments to $75,000 and for marketing loan payments to \n     $150,000. This compares to the levels in the underlying bill \n     of $200,000 on direct payments and a $300,000 nominal limit \n     and no effective limit at all on marketing loan gains. The \n     amendment removes the major loopholes in current law and \n     tightens the ``actively engaged in agriculture'' rules. The \n     amendment would reinvest \\3/4\\ of the $1.3 billion savings in \n     the food stamp program, with the remainder to the Initiative \n     for Future Agriculture and Food Systems program.\n       Although farm programs are typically justified as aid to \n     family farms, farm payments in fact today go overwhelmingly \n     to the largest farms, many of which obtain more than $1 \n     million per year. According to USDA, these farms use these \n     funds to our-compete and then buy-out smaller and medium-\n     sized farms. This amendment will help restore integrity to \n     the programs. It also helps the environment because it will \n     reduce some of the pressure for overproduction, which leads \n     to loss of habitats and excess use of chemicals.\n       Durbin Amendments: The Durbin Amendment would curtail \n     incentives created by farm program payments to cultivate new \n     lands and increase production beyond levels supported by the \n     market. Farm program payments, designed to serve as a safety \n     net for the natoin's commodity producers, are giving farmers \n     incentives to maintain and increased production at levels \n     not supported by the market. According to USDA analysis, \n     roughly 23 million acres of range and pastureland were \n     converted to row crops between 1982 and 1997. These \n     conversions contribute to crop surpluses, low prices, and \n     higher government payments, as well as to significant \n     declines in grassland ecosystems and many bird and other \n     wildlife species that depend upon them. CBO estimates that \n     the Durbin amendment could save $1.4 billion over ten \n     years, which the amendment would devote to added nutrition \n     programs.\n\n     Amendments to OPPOSE:\n       Smith (OR) Amendment: Senator Gordon Smith's amendment \n     would use crop disaster relief fund to pay farmers for \n     implementing environmental law. Although the amendment has \n     been explained as helping farmers deal with ``regulatory \n     disasters,'' the amendment opens up potential liability to \n     pay farmers for the simple reason that they have only \n     subordinate water rights and they face a dry year. Throughout \n     the West, the water available in rivers is over-appropriated, \n     meaning it is owned many times over. Only in the wettest \n     years, can all potential water users be satisfied. This \n     amendment could put the government in the position of paying \n     landowners in essence for water they do not own.\n       Crapo Water Conservation Amendment: Senator Crapo has \n     introduced an amendment that would weaken the water \n     conservation provisions of the bill by converting a program \n     designed to pay farmers to reduce water use to benefit \n     endangered species into additional traditional CRP acres. The \n     water conservation program in the bill does not take land out \n     of production but instead allows farms to install more \n     efficient water use equipment or shift to more water-\n     efficient crops and lease their surplus water to protect \n     endangered species. It therefore provides an incentive-based \n     tool to alleviate conflicts between farmers and endangered \n     species. Attacks on this program have mistakenly claimed that \n     it would interfere with state water rights. But all leases \n     must meet state water law and therefore in general must be \n     approved by state officials, and the program will only be \n     implemented where Governors have agreed. It is quite possible \n     that other amendments designed to weaken this provision will \n     also be introduced.\n       Roberts Technical Assistance Amendment: Senator Roberts has \n     introduced an amendment that would weaken and threaten the \n     quality and integrity of the valuable technical assistance \n     that farmers need to implement cropping practices that are \n     environmentally sound. The amendment could exclude employees \n     of state of local governments, such as conservation district \n     personnel, from being able to offer the technical assistance \n     needed to help farmers implement the farm conservation \n     programs. At the same time, the amendment would allow \n     fertilizer company representatives and other self-interested \n     actors to become federally reimbursed advisors to farmers on \n     conservation practices, including fertilizer and pesticide \n     use, while being reimbursed for their services by the federal \n     government. This ``fox guarding the hen house'' provision \n     could lead to widespread abuse because commercial business \n     with an interest in promoting heavy use of chemical inputs \n     would be formulating conservation plans designed to limit \n     such inputs to protect water quality. In addition, the \n     amendment would establish the Certified Crop Advisers \n     Program, just one of many private sector-established \n     programs, as the ``standard'' for the technical assistance \n     certification program that the Natural Resources \n     Conservation Service must develop. This eliminates \n     flexibility for the Secretary to establish a sound \n     certification program that people must meet in order to \n     become providers of conservation technical assistance.\n       Burns Amendments: Senator Burns has introduced two \n     amendments to deal with the legitimate concern that the \n     Conservation Reserve Program may be enrolling too much land \n     in a few states. Unfortunately, the amendments would do more \n     harm than good. The first amendment would prohibit farmers \n     from enrolling more than half of their farms in the program. \n     The affect would be to break up CRP into smaller tracts of \n     land that have significantly less habitat value and to bar \n     the enrollment of some highly sensitive lands. Senator \n     Harkin's bill (S. 1731) already prohibits more than 25% of \n     eligible land in any county from being enrolled in regular \n     CRP. In addition, producers cannot receive more than $50,000 \n     total in CRP program payments. While it takes sense to enroll \n     more CRP land in practices like buffer strips, enrolling many \n     half farms (regardless of the size of the farm) may be the \n     worst solution. The Harkin bill already includes new \n     provisions to encourage more buffer strip enrollments.\n       A second amendment by Senator Burns would require that the \n     Secretary pay more for enrolling less productive lands in CRP \n     than paid for more productive lands. In general, CRP criteria \n     can and should target less, rather than more, productive \n     lands. But many of the most valuable enrollments are strips \n     of land, such as stream buffers, on both productive and non-\n     productive lands. In addition, some highly productive lands \n     are also highly erodible or otherwise very sensitive. USDA \n     has followed a policy of discouraging enrollment of \n     productive lands but not precluding their enrollment when \n     there is a strong environmental justification. This amendment \n     would require that USDA greatly reduce payments for these \n     high value enrollments on productive lands, effectively \n     precluding their enrollments. In many parts of the country, \n     this policy could preclude almost all enrollments.\n       Hutchinson NEPA and Migratory Bird Exemption Amendment: \n     Senator Hutchinson has introduced an amendment to exempt \n     USDA's Wildlife Services program for National Environmental \n     Policy Act (NEPA) review before the killing of migratory \n     birds and would eliminate the authority of the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service (FWS) to regulate such killings. The \n     amendment presently applies to all migratory birds, but may \n     be narrowed to apply just to cormorants. The amendment should \n     be opposed in either form.\n       The Hutchinson amendment short-circuits the efforts by the \n     FWS to address cormorant management issues through the \n     regulatory process. After a complete environmental review, \n     FWS has concluded that cormorants have not caused any clear \n     adverse effects on fish populations in open water (as opposed \n     to aquaculture). The Hutchinson amendment would also create a \n     dangerous precedent to establish a wholesale exemption from \n     NEPA and our international treaty obligations for a single \n     species.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment that I will offer is a \ncomplete substitute for the Water Conservation Program that is in the \nbill. It addresses all the arguments that have been raised about it \nsince last year.\n  It prohibits the Federal Government from holding, leasing or buying \nwater rights in any way whatsoever.\n  It gives control over the program to the States with Federal \noversight, consistent with existing United States Department of \nAgriculture farm conservation programs.\n  It gives States real money to help address real problems through \nprograms they are implementing already.\n  This program is important because when a drought occurs, competition \nfor water becomes fierce. Farmers and fish--that is lakes--both get \nless water because of the drought. Or it could be a stream or a river. \nIf conditions become bad enough, the farmer loses\n\n[[Page S532]]\n\nwhatever water he has. No one gives the farmer a way to get by until \nthe drought is over.\n  My existing Water Conservation Program that is in the bill--and this \nsubstitute--would get him that payment to tide him over until the \ndrought is over.\n  The existing program said that if a farmer wanted to transfer his \nwater to benefit fish or water, lake, stream, or river during a drought \nyear, he would get a Federal payment in return.\n  It would be up to the farmer and up to the State to decide if the \nState law would allow the transfer to occur. Many States already have \nprograms such as this: California, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada.\n  Some of my colleagues from the West raised some concerns about the \nprogram before we recessed in December. They said a lot of things about \nthe program that were not intended or just were not true.\n  Some of these arguments were repeated on the floor yesterday. They \nsaid it gave the Federal Government the right to confiscate water. I \ndon't know how to say it other than it doesn't. It is ridiculous. They \nsaid if one farmer decided to transfer his water under a short-term \ncontract, they could take away the other farmer's water. Think about \nthe logic of that. If you are a farmer or a rancher who is using his \nwater to irrigate, who, under this program, now decides to leave his \nwater in the stream, how can leaving water in a stream ever mean \nanother farmer is going to get less water? That is illogical. It \ndoesn't make sense.\n  Some of my colleagues had some legitimate questions about the \nprogram. The main concern was that the States rights and traditional \nrole in setting their own water could be affected. So it was decided \nthat one way to deal with this problem was to let the States decide \nwhether they want the program or not. Senators Domenici and Bingaman \nand I amended the program to say that. If you don't want to participate \nin the program, you don't participate. If you want to, come on in.\n  I thought more about their concerns and decided the best way to get \nwater conservation programs implemented in the right way was to let the \nStates run them as they do under a few USDA conservation programs \nalready. The Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program and the Farmland \nProtection Program both put States in the driver's seat with respect to \nconservation. The USDA makes sure that the State's conservation ideas \nare sound and that the State implements conservation plans and \nagreements with USDA oversight.\n  That is what this amendment does. It replaces the existing program \nwith two pilots. Both pilot programs are run by the States--not by big \nbrother in Washington--according to the existing model. Both pilots get \nmandatory conservation money into the hands of States and gives them \ndiscretion on how to spend it to solve their water conservation needs.\n  The first pilot program would expand a successful partnership between \nthe USDA's Conservation Reserve Program and the State of Oregon to \nrestore habitat and to lease water to help fish and wildlife. The \nsecond provision would create a new State-delegated program to help \nfund irrigation efficiency measures, help willing farmers convert from \nwater-intensive crops to less water-intensive crops, and to lease, sell \noptions, or sell water. The programs provide $375 million for States to \nuse on this menu of different water-conserving options.\n  Both provisions will help resolve conflicts between endangered \nspecies and farmers such as we have seen in the Klamath Basin in \nOregon, the San Francisco Bay Delta, and the Truckee-Carson Basin in \nNevada. Let me explain how these programs work.\n  First, the Water Conservation Enhancement Program will build on the \nsuccessful Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. This program \npermits USDA and States to combine CRP and State funds to target \ncritical resources for protection and restoration. Today, 17 States \nhave these programs to target protection of important resources, such \nas the Chesapeake Bay.\n\n  The Water Conservation Enhancement Program expands to other States \nthe Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program developed by the State of \nOregon which pays farmers irrigated land rates if they voluntarily \ntransfer their water rights to the State for a limited amount of time. \nUnder this model, farmers may also enter into the program and not \ntransfer their water if the enrollment would benefit the fish habitat \nin some way. The provision would reserve a half million acres of this \nConservation Reserve Enhancement Program for this purpose; 40 million \nacres would remain available for traditional uses of the CRP.\n  Just like the current program, States must develop and submit \nproposals to the secretary so States have the control. Farmers do not \nhave to participate in the program. If they do participate, they do not \nhave to transfer their water rights to the State.\n  Under the provision, farmers could simply choose to receive funds to \nrestore lost wetlands, grasslands, and other habitat, and retain their \nwater rights.\n  The second provision creates a new $375 million water benefits \nprogram run by States that could use the money for any of the three \nbroad water conserving programs. Most Western States already have \nprograms to do this. This Federal money will bolster these programs. \nFirst, States can use the money to help farmers install irrigation \nefficiency infrastructure, such as lining canals and building fish \nscreens. Second, States can use the money to help farmers switch crops \nand use less water. For these options, the State would get 75 percent \nof the cost of the measure adopted. A farmer, the State, or a \nconservation group can match the remaining cost.\n  The amount of water saved by virtue of the Federal contribution would \nbe transferred for an environmental purpose while the measure is in \nplace and only while the measure is in place.\n  The amount saved by the farmer's contribution can be used by the \nfarmer any way he wants. If the farmer wants to contribute more to the \ncost of the measure, say, 50 percent of the irrigation measure, he uses \nthat 50 percent of the saved water.\n  Third, States can use the money to lease, sell options on, or buy \nwater rights from willing farmers for fish and if consistent with State \nlaw. Like the Water Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, States \nwould have complete control over the program. For people walking in \nhere yesterday saying they are taking away the States rights, my water \nengineer, a man by the name of Mike Turnipseed, a very conservative \nperson, believes this is a great program.\n  States must affirmatively ask to be certified by the Secretary to \nadminister the program, and the State must designate an appropriate \nState agency to administer the program. The State would hold any water \nrights leased or acquired under this program. The Federal Government is \nstrictly prohibited by this legislation from holding or buying water \nrights. In addition, States would have to subject all water leases and \npurchases for the review and approval of the State water boards--in our \ncase, the State water engineer.\n  As I have mentioned, both programs have to be initiated by States \nsubject to State water law, approved by State water officials, and \nensure that the water rights be held by States. If that is not clear \nenough, I have added general language to make it clear that the State \nwater law is paramount. I have also added language to ensure that \nprivate property rights are fully protected.\n\n  Both of these programs would help ease the conflicts between the \nneeds of farmers and the needs of endangered fish, as we have seen in \nthe Klamath Basin and in my State in the Truckee and Walker River \nBasins. These programs will give States the resources they need to plan \nahead for years when water supplies are too low to meet all needs. \nThese programs will give farmers greater flexibility.\n  Under this program, a farmer who wouldn't have enough water to have a \nprofitable year can, if he or she chooses, transfer that water to \nbenefit a lake or fish or a stream.\n  The contract payment can then tide the farmer over until better water \nyears, years in which the fish don't need the water. These programs \nwill also help protect freshwater species, species which are important \nto the recreational and commercial economies of States in the West.\n\n[[Page S533]]\n\n  Freshwater species are North America's most endangered class of \nspecies. They are vanishing five times faster than North America's \nmammals or birds and as quickly as tropical rain forest species. \nHabitat loss and degradation are the single biggest threat to \nfreshwater species in trouble. Inadequate streamflow is the largest.\n  In closing, there are a few things to remember about these water \nconservation provisions: The Water Conservation Reserve Enhancement \nProgram and the Water Benefits Program. First, both programs are \ncompletely voluntary. No farmer could be coerced, forced, or in any way \ncajoled into participating in either of them.\n  Second, the Federal Government, by this legislation, is explicitly \nprohibited from leasing, buying, and holding water rights.\n  Third, States must choose to participate in these programs. If they \ndo, the programs are run by States and must be consistent with State \nwater law.\n  Fourth, State water boards and engineers must review and approve all \nwater transfers.\n  Fifth, the water benefits programs will pay for irrigation efficiency \nprojects that not only conserve water for fish and other things, but \nwill also conserve water that farmers can use to grow more crops or can \nsell to other farmers.\n  But I think, most importantly, lastly, the program will help reduce \nconflicts between the needs of farmers and the needs of this Nation's \nfish and wildlife, rather than just one or the other.\n  Mr. President, I have already asked that the list of organizations \nsupporting this legislation be printed in the Record. It is extensive. \nI don't see other Senators here in the Chamber, but virtually every \nState has organizations that support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy). The distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Montana is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2839 to Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, this amendment will help farmers who have \nexperienced very deep, strong disasters due to weather conditions. It \nprovides desperately needed disaster assistance for America's farmers \nand ranchers.\n  I begin by thanking Senators Enzi, Reid, Burns, Landrieu, Dorgan, \nJohnson, Conrad, Carnahan, Dayton, Stabenow, and Lincoln for \ncosponsoring this.\n  I also thank the 57 Senators who voted in support of this measure \nwhen we tried to append it to the stimulus package a couple weeks ago. \nWe came very close to passing this amendment. Unfortunately, 10 of our \ncolleagues were not present for the vote, and given the strong showing \nof bipartisan support and the likelihood that I think more than 60 \nSenators support this measure, it is vital that we try again with more \nSenators present.\n  The amendment extends to the 2001 crop the same agricultural disaster \nprograms that have proven crucial to American farmers in recent years. \nWhat could be more obvious and commonsense than to extend to the 2001 \ncrop the same programs that have proven crucial to American farmers in \nrecent years?\n  The amendment provides $1.8 billion for crop disaster program and \ncovers quality loss due to army worms. It provides $500 million to the \nlivestock assistance program, with $12 million directed to the Native \nAmerican livestock feed program. It also addresses the concerns of our \napple producers and provides $100 million toward their market loss \nassistance program.\n  Producers desperately need these disaster programs. They need them to \nhelp mitigate the devastating effects of an unprecedented streak of \npoor weather throughout the United States.\n  Mr. President, I know you will remember when you came to Montana, I\n\n[[Page S534]]\n\nthink in the 1980s, how bad that drought was, walking out in the \nfields, virtual dust, with no crops. That was, I think, in the late \n1980s. I must tell you, regrettably, I was thinking about that trip you \nand I, Senator John Melcher, and others took to Montana earlier this \nyear when I was in an area a little way from where we were, with the \nsame conditions--dust, no crops. In about a 200-square-mile area \nnothing was combined.\n  This chart basically indicates the drought impact in the United \nStates. The red, as you can see, are areas of our country already \ndeclared disaster because of drought. The green patches you can see \nhere are areas that are recovering from drought. They are obviously not \nout of the woods. They have been in a drought situation. The yellow \nrepresents drought watch areas. That means close to being declared a \ndrought area. That is an area qualifying for disaster assistance.\n  On the map, essentially all of the United States down around the \nMississippi River is either in drought conditions or drought watch \nconditions. I don't know whether it is climate change that is causing \nthis or global warming. All I know is that very strange weather \nconditions are hurting farmers and ranchers. It is our job to do what \nwe can to be sure they are made whole.\n  These weather conditions could not have happened at a worse time. \nWhile struggling to survive 3 disastrous years in agriculture, farmers \nalso have faced sharply escalating operating costs. Just think of it. \nThe drought hits, operating costs go up--high operating costs due to \nhigh energy and fertilizer prices--income is not doing too well, and \nfarm debt is increasing.\n\n  A couple words about farm expenses. Total farm expenses were \nestimated to rise another $4.5 billion in 2001. That is after the rise \nof nearly $10 billion in the preceding year. Farm debt has been rising \nin the last 3 years, after recovering from the crisis in the mid-1980s. \nWe just talked about the late 1980s, and now farmers are borrowing as \nmuch or higher, and that adds to their operating costs.\n  Statistics kept by USDA's Economic Research Service demonstrate that \nnet farm business income was at a decade low in 1999 and in 2000. \nThanks to a limited recovery in income last year--very slight--which \nmeans that unless Government assistance continues, net farm income in \n2001 is projected to be lower than farm income in 1999 or 2000. Thus, \nif our efforts are curtailed, if weather problems continue, costs rise, \nand there is no time to recover from the contraction of farm operating \nincome since 1998, the impact on rural America will be devastating.\n  You might ask: Why now? Why this amendment on the farm bill? \nBasically, simply, because the clock is ticking. People need help now. \nThey can't wait. Farmers in economic distress are not able to make the \nusual purchases of seed or fertilizer now, not to mention--I don't want \nto overdramatize this--in some cases, plain old food and clothing.\n  Equipment and tractor dealers close their doors, as do rural schools \nand local merchants, which makes the agricultural sector--which is \ndirectly and indirectly responsible for nearly one-fifth of the U.S. \ngross domestic product--among the worst affected areas in the United \nStates and the most vulnerable sectors of the U.S. economy.\n  Our amendment extends the disaster relief programs that have been \ncritical to shoring up farm income over the last 3 years. This relief \nwill allow farmers--and rural economies that depend on them--to get \nback on their feet.\n  I want to address several issues that were raised when we last \ndebated this issue. First, some worried that these payments would go to \nmillionaire farmers. Why should this agricultural disaster assistance, \nthey say, go to millionaire farmers? I might say that charge is totally \ninaccurate, unfounded, and probably misunderstood.\n  The crop disaster benefits under this amendment are limited to \n$80,000 per person and no one with an annual gross income of $2.5 \nmillion or more is eligible. That is, if your gross income is $2.5 \nmillion or more, you don't qualify. That sounds like a lot of money, \nbut that is gross income, not net income. Most farmers have no net \nincome. If you take the gross and subtract out the costs, whether it is \ndebt service or expenses, or whatever else it might be, the net income \nfor most farmers is negligible--if there is income at all.\n  Second, some Senators believed these disasters were already covered \nunder the crop insurance program.\n  Let me be clear: I support Federal crop insurance. I think most \nSenators do. However, Federal crop insurance only covers a small \npercentage of farmers, as well as only a fraction of their losses. That \nis due to adverse weather conditions in 2001.\n  To quote the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, \nGary Broyles:\n\n       Current crop insurance only covers up to 57 percent of a \n     farmer's loss, but farmers do not operate with a 25 percent \n     profit margin, especially in areas that have had multiple \n     years of weather-related problems.\n\n  In addition, other sectors in the agricultural industry such as \nspecialty crops and livestock are not eligible for Federal crop \ninsurance. For them, their losses are really real. They particularly \nneed help. If producers have crops that qualify in the Government \nprograms, I would think livestock and other specialty crops in \nagriculture should also qualify.\n  On a related note, farmers who do receive assistance under this \nprogram are required to obtain crop insurance on their next crop if it \nis available.\n  One final point. Producers are now making planting decisions for next \nyear. Without these disaster payments, I have to say--and I hear this \nconstantly--many banks will refuse to provide operating loans. They \nwill refuse to extend the credit that farmers need to try planting for \nanother year. Without these loans, many farmers will be unable to \nplant, it is that simple, which is giving up any hope of economic \nrecovery in the near future.\n  This hits pretty close to home. In my State of Montana, it is \nanticipated 40 percent of producers seeking operating loans this year \nwill be denied; that is, denied if we fail to provide this assistance \nunder this amendment. It is that timely. It is that significant. Of \ncourse, that is going to very much hurt the agricultural economy with \nindividual farmers.\n  In conclusion, I have many letters of support for this amendment. \nThey literally continue to pour in. They include the National \nAssociation of Wheat Growers, the National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation, the National Farmers Union, the National Cotton Council, \nthe American Farm Bureau, the United Stockgrowers of America, the \nNational Barley Growers Association, the U.S. Canola Association, \nAmerican Soybean Association, the National Sunflower Association, the \nNorthwest Farm Credit Services, and others.\n  Today we have another chance to help these farmers get back on their \nfeet. If we cannot make it rain, we can make a difference. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment to provide the disaster assistance \nso many in American agriculture need given these whacky weather \nconditions we are experiencing this year which is hurting American \nagriculture.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I'm pleased to be a cosponsor of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Montana to provide disaster \nassistance to those farmers and ranchers who suffered crop or \nlivestock-related losses in calendar year 2001.\n  American agriculture is beginning its fifth straight year of rock \nbottom prices. For those farmers lucky enough to raise a decent crop, \nthe only thing that's been keeping them in business is the supplemental \nrelief that Congress has provided in each of the past four years. Last \nmonth, the Department of Agriculture confirmed that net farm income \nwill fall by 20 percent this year, to $40.6 billion, unless Congress \nresponds with improved farm policy.\n  As bad as this situation is, however, the blow is doubly hard for \nproducers whose crops have been ravaged by drought, excess moisture, or \nsome other natural calamity. These producers have little to fall back \non, they\n\n[[Page S535]]\n\ncannot hope to make up in volume what they are losing under Depression-\nera prices. In North Dakota, the brutal reality of today's farm \neconomics leaves little margin for either error or misfortune, and for \nmany of those producers suffering natural disaster losses, their luck \nhas run out. That is why Congress must respond.\n  I want to commend the Senator from Montana for his tireless efforts \nto address the disaster situation. I know that his State has been hard \nhit by consecutive years of drought, and his ranchers are reeling. He's \nbeen trying since last fall to respond in some way.\n  In my own State of North Dakota, we have received some of the rains \nthat passed over Montana. Unfortunately, those rains came just as our \nwheat crop was maturing, and the result has been serious losses due to \nscab and other quality problems. Some estimates put North Dakota's \ndisaster losses last year at near $200 million. Even those who have \npurchased crop insurance find that their indemnity payments won't \nrestore profitability to their operation, so that is why this \nadditional assistance is required.\n  To vividly illustrate what last year's disaster losses have done to \nthe typical farming operation in North Dakota, I would like to cite \nsome figures from an instructor in an adult farm management program in \nmy state.\n  According to this farm management instructor, the farm operations he \nis advising--located in an area hit hard by natural disasters--had an \naverage net farm income last year of just $25,937--down 54 percent from \nthe previous year. These net farm income figures actually include \ngovernment payments received under existing farm programs. If farm \nprogram payments are excluded, these farmers would have had a \nsubstantially negative farm income--losing $46,665 per farm, on \naverage, last year. That's the harsh reality of farming in the Northern \nGreat Plains today.\n  So again, for all these reasons, I am pleased to cosponsor this \nneeded amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to \nexpress my support for the Baucus amendment to the farm bill. I want to \ncommend Senator Baucus for his leadership on this amendment.\n  This amendment provides much needed relief for our farmers and farm \ncommunities. This emergency assistance will provide an immediate boost \nto the sagging farm industry in Missouri. I am especially grateful to \nSenator Baucus for his assistance in providing relief to farmers whose \ncrops were damaged by an invasion of armyworms. Armyworms marched \nthrough Missouri and left a trail of crop destruction and economic loss \nin their wake. The armyworm is a caterpillar only about one and a half \ninches long, but they march in large groups, moving on only after \ncompletely stripping an area. Last winter's unusually warm weather and \nthe summer drought conspired to make life easy for the armyworm and \nhard for the farmer.\n  Thousands of farmers across southern Missouri were devastated. One \nofficial at the Missouri Department of Agriculture said that last \nyear's invasion was the worst he has seen in his 38 years at the \nDepartment. Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman declared 32 counties in \nMissouri disaster areas due to the extent of the armyworm damage.\n  Missouri wasn't the only State hit hard by the armyworm infestation. \nFarmers throughout the Midwest and Northeast were all affected. The \narmyworms work extremely fast. Jim Smith, a cattle farmer in Washington \nCounty, completely lost 30 acres of hay field and most of the hay on \nanother 30 acres. He said that he did not even know he had armyworms \nuntil 20 acres had been mowed down ``slick as concrete'' by the \ninsects. In his 73 years on the farm, Mr. Smith says this is the worst \nhe has even seen.\n  This invasion has had severe economic consequences for my State. \nMissouri is second in the Nation in cattle farming. As a result of crop \nloss, farmers are using winter hay reserves to feed their cattle and \ndairy cows. Farmers are not only losing thousands of dollars in crop \nloss, but also have the additional and substantial expense of \npurchasing livestock feed for their herds this winter. In addition, \nsome farmers were forced to sell their yearlings earlier than normal. \nDue to premature sales of yearlings, farmers got below average prices \nfor their heads of stock, further increasing farm loss. The effects of \nthis infestation will continue to be felt.\n  It isn't just the farmers that are suffering economic loss. When the \nfarmers hurt financially so do the feed merchants, farm supply dealers, \nand gas stations. The funds provided in this bill will help all of \nMissouri recover from the armyworm infestation. So, I support this \namendment and I look forward to its inclusion in the farm bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, President Bush was in Denver this morning. \nHe has probably left by now, I suppose, and is on his way to the \nOlympics in Salt Lake City.\n  I was very interested in his stop in Denver because he gave an \naddress to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. He talked about \nsome of his ideas for the new farm bill.\n  At the outset, I want to note I had a chance to speak personally with \nthe President briefly when he visited Moline, IL, the home of John \nDeere, about 3 weeks ago. I asked if we could get together and meet on \nthis farm bill, and he said that we could. I am still looking forward \nto that meeting.\n  The message that I thought came through to the President very clearly \nin Moline, IL, was that the farm bill is the economic recovery bill for \nrural America; that farmers need some certainty, and that our \nagricultural lenders, agricultural businesses and rural communities \nneed some certainty about what the farm program will be this year. \nWithout some greater assurance, farmers cannot buy the supplies, \nequipment and other inputs they need and that affects the rural \neconomy.\n  So I was hopeful and remain hopeful the President will help us try to \nget this farm bill through the Senate, but we are still stuck on it. I \nremain hopeful we will be able to finish this farm bill next week, but \nthen again that is not certain.\n  I paid some attention to the speech the President gave in Denver, and \nI was interested in what he mentioned. First of all, he said he was \ncommitted to the $73.5 billion over 10 years in new spending for the \nfarm bill, which was in our budget resolution for this year. That is \ngood, but it is important to note his budget also calls for dramatic \nreductions in commodity loan rates. A good share of that $73.5 billion \nwould be required just to make up for the large loan rate reductions. \nSo it is critical to look carefully below the surface of the budget.\n  Now, the President then went on to talk about how new farm bill \nfunding must be evenly spent over 10 years.\n  He says he doesn't want to ``front-load'' it, which he said \n``overpromises and underperforms.'' I don't quite understand that \nexpression, but it is clear he wants to spend the farm bill funding \nevenly over 10 years.\n  There was one glaring omission in the President's remarks. He did not \nmention that his own Department of Agriculture, a month ago, estimated \nthat net farm income this year would be 20 percent lower than it was \nlast year unless we provide additional assistance. The President \nglossed over that fact about the dire state of the farm economy.\n  The President evidently is pointing at the Senate bill which puts \nsomewhat more of the $73.5 billion in the first 5 years than it does in \nthe second 5 years. Actually not a lot more. Half of $73.5 billion \nwould be somewhere around $37 billion. Our bill is about $40 billion in \noutlays in the first five years. So it is only about $3 billion more \nthan half. We believed it important to put more funding upfront because \nnow is when it is critically needed. The President's own Department of \nAgriculture said that we would see a 20 percent drop in net farm income \nthis year. When farmers are hurting and going out of business, that is \nthe time to come in and help.\n  I don't know what the farm economic situation will be 8, 9, or 10 \nyears from now. It may be just fine. If that is the case, we should not \nneed to spend much of any money on commodity programs 8, 9, or 10 years \nfrom now. But when commodity prices are low and farmers are struggling, \nas they are, now is the time to reach out and help. That is the main \nreason why there is more funding in the first 5 years than in the \nsecond 5 years. The President did not mention\n\n[[Page S536]]\n\nthat. He wants to say, whatever we spent this year is what we will \nspend 9 years from now. What sense does that make? I don't know what \nwill happen 9 years from now. I hope farmers are making good money and \ndon't need Government assistance 9 years from now. There is more money \nin the first 5 years of our bill because it is needed now to help \nfarmers stay in business and for rural communities that are struggling \neconomically.\n  The President said a good farm bill should include the farm savings \naccount. That is fine. I have nothing against farm savings accounts. \nWhen you are losing 20 percent of net farm income, how do you have \nmoney to put into a savings account?\n  Then he said it must include conservation. I believe he said every \nday is Earth Day for people who rely on the land for a living.\n  If that is the case, why did the administration in December support a \nsubstitute to the Senate bill that slashed support for conservation? \nWhat the President is saying does not track with what the \nadministration is doing in Washington on this farm bill.\n  The President was speaking to the National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation, the producers of our beef cattle. I am disappointed the \nPresident did not mention packer concentration. We debated that this \nmorning. We had debate on it in December also, including the fact that \nfour large packers control 81 percent of all the cattle slaughtered in \nAmerica. If that is not undue economic concentration, I don't know what \nis. Yet the President did not talk about that.\n  We have an amendment on this bill to keep packers from feeding \nlivestock so that our independent pork and beef producers can have a \nbetter bargaining position and a fighting chance to survive. But the \nPresident didn't mention the issue of economic concentration in Denver. \nI find that curious, at the least.\n  The President also said something about political budget gimmickry \nand cobbling together loose political coalitions. Is this the President \nwho said we have to work together, that we should all work together in \na bipartisan atmosphere?\n  There are competing interests. Agriculture covers a broad spectrum in \nAmerica. Of course we want to take into account farmers in Vermont, as \nwell as we take care of farmers in Texas, or in Washington, or in \nMaryland, or in Iowa. It is a broad country. As chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, my responsibility is to be cognizant and aware \nand supportive of agriculture nationwide. Yes, we have put together \ncoalitions. Of course we have. But isn't that what the President wants \nto do? Work together in a bipartisan atmosphere and try to put together \na coalition to get something through?\n  He said we cannot set the loan rates too high. Specifically, what \ndoes that mean? He also vowed, when he became President, he would make \nagriculture the cornerstone of U.S. economic policy. Yet I have not \nreceived the specifics from the Administration that would allow us to \nnegotiate to come up with the new farm bill.\n  To make something a cornerstone, you have to lay a foundation down \nfirst. I have not seen the specifics of a farm bill from the \nAdministration to lay down a foundation for agriculture.\n  Last year when the Department of Agriculture under Secretary Veneman \nput out a policy book on American agriculture, I gave it high praise. I \nfound I could support a lot of the objectives in that book, especially \nincluding stronger support for conservation. We put it in our bill. \nMost of it was in the Department of Agriculture book last year.\n  Again, I was very shocked in December when there was a substitute \nbill offered to ours that drastically cut the conservation we had put \nin our bill and the administration supported it. So I hope there will \nbe less talk about political gimmickry and more cooperation from this \nadministration when it comes to getting this farm bill finished.\n  I am looking forward to work with the President. I have said that \ntime and time again. We have worked in a bipartisan atmosphere here. I \ncontinue to point out, as I always say, the facts give lie to rhetoric. \nThe fact is, our bill came through our committee with strong bipartisan \nsupport, every single title except the commodity title, which still had \nbipartisan support but just not overwhelming bipartisan support. The \nbill on the Senate floor now commands a bipartisan majority. It is good \nfor agriculture.\n\n  If we are accused of having gone overboard to represent the dairy \nfarmers in Vermont, the sugar farmers in Louisiana, the cotton farmers \nin Texas, the rice farmers in Arkansas, the corn and soybean farmers in \nIowa, the wheat farmers in Kansas, the pork producers in Iowa and the \nupper Midwest, the cattle producers all over America, the orchards in \nMichigan, and the apple growers in Washington State--if we are accused \nof having gone out of our way to help them survive and be a vital part \nof rural America, I plead guilty. You bet we have because I believe in \nAmerican agriculture, and I believe it still should form the foundation \nfor our economic policy in America.\n  Believing that, we have laid down the cornerstone, we have laid down \nthe foundation, on energy and conservation and commodities and rural \neconomic development and trade and, yes, nutrition.\n  On nutrition, for which the President's budget provides some $4 \nbillion less for nutrition than is in our farm bill, that is an \nimportant part of the farm bill.\n  I appreciate the President paying a visit to the National Cattlemen's \nBeef Association. I look forward to working with him in a bipartisan \natmosphere, to get through a sound farm bill. I just hope his speech \nwriters and those who are advising him might better inform him what we \nare doing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Harkin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I had the privilege to be presiding while \nthe distinguished Senator from Iowa was speaking of the work he has \ndone putting together this farm bill. I listened. I have been chairman \nof the Agriculture Committee on one occasion, ranking member on another \noccasion, when we had to put through the 5-year farm bill.\n  I have worked with the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, and now Presiding Officer, for over 20 years \nbetween the House and the Senate. I know how hard it is to put such a \nbill together.\n  The distinguished Senator from Iowa worked very closely with all \nMembers--both Republicans and Democrats--in meeting after meeting, \nconversation after conversation, on the floor, in their offices, in the \nSenate dining room, walking across the Hill. I have been privy to a \nnumber of those conversations.\n  A farm bill has a number of diverse aspects to it. The President \nseems to wrap everything into some kind of sense of patriotism. We have \nto be patriotic. We have to have a missile defense system to be \npatriotic, we have to pass tax credits. Incidentally, the last tax cut \nand stimulus package they proposed would have given, I believe, a \nquarter of a billion dollars to Enron. I am not quite sure just what \nkind of patriotism comes out of giving another $250 million of \ntaxpayers' money to Enron. Maybe it is because I come from Vermont and \nnot Texas, but it didn't seem all that patriotic. But I digress.\n\n  The point is, everybody in this body is patriotic, Republicans and \nDemocrats. Why don't we just acknowledge that. We wouldn't be here \notherwise. Let's think, though, what that means. That means protecting \nall aspects of our country.\n  The United States is the only significant power in the world able to \nfeed itself and still export food--billions of dollars worth of food. \nThat is part of our national security. We are not energy sufficient. \nMaybe someday we will be, if we do a better job of conservation. We are \nfood sufficient. We are a nation of over a quarter of a billion people \nand we can feed ourselves from within our own borders, and that will\n\n[[Page S537]]\n\ncontinue to be true if we continue the incentives that keep people on \nthe land, keep the land productive, protect the environment for farmers \nso they can keep that land productive, and to be able to tell farmers: \nYou will work hard and long, but you will be able to make a living out \nof it, your kids can go to college, someday you will be able to \nretire--all the things people desire.\n  I hope as we go forward the White House would realize we are all in \nthis together. We are not talking about a partisan farm bill. One of \nthe things I have enjoyed the most, serving for 27 years now on the \nAgriculture Committee, is the bipartisanship of that committee. I value \nmy friendship with the current chairman. I value my friendship with the \nformer chairman, Senator Lugar. They are two of the closest friends I \nhave in this body.\n  I remember Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, and Bob Dole working \nclosely together on nutrition matters. This is a diverse group, but I \nthink one thing that united them was their great sense of humor and a \npassion, a special passion for feeding the children of this country.\n  There have been bipartisan coalitions on that committee ever since I \ncame here. There was a bipartisan coalition that started the WIC \nProgram, one of the best things for children, for pregnant women, for \nwomen post partum, after giving birth. These are programs that have \ncome out of there--the School Lunch Program, which has improved the \nnutrition of our children and is now considered just a staple of \nGovernment. Yet as Harry Truman knew at the time of World War II, so \nmany people were rejected for the draft because of lack of nutrition, \nso he started the School Lunch Program.\n  I say this to commend the tremendous work of the Senator from Iowa. I \nam proud of him. I am proud to be his friend. I am proud to serve as a \nmember of his committee.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S537-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HAPPY BIRTHDAY GREETINGS TO SENATOR PAUL SARBANES\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am delighted to extend, even though \nbelatedly, happy birthday greetings to the senior Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Sarbanes. His birthday was on February 3, so he has now \nreached the grand age of 69. Oh, to be 69 again!\n  Let me say that Senator Sarbanes and I have more differences than \njust our ages. He is of Greek ancestry, and proud of it. I am of \nsouthern and Appalachian ancestry, and beyond that, going back through \nthe years of time and change, of Anglo-Saxon ancestry, and I am proud \nof that.\n  He is a member of the Greek Orthodox Church. I am a member of the \nSouthern Missionary Baptist Church.\n  He is from the Chesapeake region of the Eastern Shore of Maryland. I \nam from the coalfields of southern West Virginia.\n  His career began by waiting on tables, washing dishes, and mopping \nfloors in the Mayflower Grill in downtown Salisbury, MD. Mine began by \nworking in a gas station in the cold winter of January and February \n1935, having to walk 4 miles to work and 4 miles back, and earning $50 \na month, $600 a year.\n  But, Mr. President, Senator Sarbanes and I share many common \ninterests. One of these common interests that Senator Sarbanes and I \nshare is our love for the Senate. And I have always appreciated that in \nSenator Sarbanes' career.\n  I have observed Senator Sarbanes since he was first elected to the \nSenate in 1976--200 years after that historic year of 1776. I have \nadmired the rational way that this perfectly reasonable man has always \ngone about his business.\n  I watch him when he is listening to witnesses in committees. I serve \non the Budget Committee of the Senate with Senator Sarbanes. He has a \nrare, subtle way of listening carefully and then going right to the \ncrux of a matter. He is very effective in his questions and the manner \nin which he performs his work on committees.\n  He is a thinker. I spoke of his Greek ancestry. Paul Sarbanes is the \nepitome of the Greek thinker, of which we have read so much in history.\n  I have watched him as he has served as chairman of the Congressional \nJoint Economic Committee, as chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs Committee.\n  He is also the chairman of the impressive and influential Maryland \ncongressional delegation, which includes Senator Barbara Mikulski in \nthe Senate as well as Representative Steny Hoyer in the House.\n\n  He has been a very effective member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and, as I earlier indicated, as a member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee.\n  There is a long list of reasons I admire Paul Sarbanes. One of the \nreasons I came to admire Paul Sarbanes was the support he gave to me \nwhen I was the majority leader and when I was minority leader in the \nSenate. During troubling times, during the most difficult votes, in the \nmidst of the most controversial issues, I nearly always called upon \nPaul Sarbanes for his counsel, for his advice. Every leader would be \nfortunate to have a Paul Sarbanes as a colleague to whom he could go \nand seek advice and counsel.\n  So there he was, with his advice and his friendship. I can't begin to \nsay how much I appreciated that in Paul Sarbanes, as one of the most \nprobing, acute intellects that I have seen in my 56 years of serving in \nlegislative bodies. His word is his bond. His loyalty is unchallenged. \nHis integrity is beyond reproach.\n  So allow me to use these belated birthday greetings to say: Thank \nyou; thank you, Senator Paul Sarbanes, for being a friend as well as a \ncolleague; thank you for your tremendous work for your State and our \ncountry.\n  I should also thank the people of the State of Maryland for having \nthe wisdom and the common sense to send Paul Sarbanes here to be with \nus in 1982, in 1988, in 1994, and in 2000. He is now the longest \nserving U.S. Senator in the history of the State of Maryland. The \nSenate and our country are the better for it.\n\n       Count your garden by the flowers,\n       Never by the leaves that fall;\n       Count your days by the sunny hours,\n       Not remembering clouds at all.\n       Count your nights by stars, not shadows;\n       Count your days by smiles, not tears.\n\n  And on this beautiful February afternoon, Paul Sarbanes, count your \nlife by smiles, not tears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S537-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S537-S540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 FAITH\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yesterday the President spoke at the \nNational Prayer Breakfast. Let me just quote a few excerpts from the \nPresident's remarks. This is what he said. He said more, of course, but \nthese are four paragraphs that I will excerpt from the totality of the \nremarks.\n  The President said:\n\n       Since we met last year, millions of Americans have been led \n     to prayer. They have prayed for comfort in time of grief; for \n     understanding in a time of anger; for protection in a time of \n     uncertainty. Many, including me, have been on bended knee. \n     The prayers of this nation are a part of the good that has \n     come from the evil of September the 11th, more good than we \n     could ever have predicted. Tragedy has brought forth the \n     courage and the generosity of our people.\n       None of us would ever wish on anyone what happened on that \n     day. Yet, as with each life, sorrows we would not choose can \n     bring wisdom and strength gained in no other way. This \n     insight is central to many faiths, and certainly to faith \n     that finds hope and comfort in a cross.\n       Every religion is welcomed in our country; all are \n     practiced here. Many of our good citizens profess no religion \n     at all. Our country has never had an official faith. Yet we \n     have all been witnesses these past 21 weeks to the power of \n     faith to see us through the hurt and loss that has come to \n     our country.\n       Faith gives the assurance that our lives and our history \n     have a moral design. As individuals, we know that suffering \n     is temporary, and hope is eternal. As a nation, we know that \n     the ruthless will not inherit the Earth. Faith teaches \n     humility, and with it, tolerance. Once we have recognized \n     God's image in ourselves, we must recognize it in every human \n     being.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire speech by \nPresident Bush be printed in the Record at the close of my remarks.\n\n[[Page S538]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will differ with President Bush in many \nthings, and in many ways; and I suppose practically every Senator here \nwill at some point differ with the President in regard to something. On \nhis faith-based initiative, I may differ with him. But I am glad that \nthe President took time in his busy day to make these remarks at the \nNational Prayer Breakfast. I am glad to hear him utter the name of \nGod--the person in our country who is at the apex of the executive \nbranch of Government, pausing in his day to recognize a higher power \nthan that of the Chief Executive of this country. The Chief Magistrate \nof our Nation spoke of God and spoke of having been on bended knee.\n  Mr. President, remarks such as these have become all too rare, even \nin this country, when uttered by a high Government official who is \nelected--not directly, but indirectly, at least --by the people of the \nUnited States.\n  So I respect President Bush for his humility, for his willingness to \ncall upon God, to express a faith, to express a strength that can only \ncome from calling upon the Creator of us all. It is unfortunate, but \nthese are times when few men and women, relatively speaking, it seems \nto me, recognize God in their lives and in the life of the Nation. \n``Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.''\n  I am almost an antique around these precincts in our Capitol. I \nsuppose one might say I am almost a neanderthal, having lived 84 years. \nI come from a background in which God was a major factor in my life.\n  When I was a little boy living in the ``sticks'' in southern West \nVirginia, in Mercer County, impressed upon my young mind was a belief \nin a Higher Power. The Bible was the one book in my humble household--\nthe Bible--the King James version of the Bible. The woman who raised me \nwas my aunt. Her husband was my uncle by virtue of their marriage. Many \ntimes, when I was a child living in Mercer County, I would hear her \npray after we had turned out the kerosene lamps. I would hear her \npraying in the other room. Even after I had grown to manhood and was a \nMember of Congress and would go back to West Virginia on the weekends, \nor during a recess, always when I started back to Washington, she would \nsay, ``Robert, you be a good boy. I always pray for you.''\n  Many times, I have gone back to those coal fields and knocked on her \ndoor at night, at 2 o'clock in the morning, 3 o'clock in the morning, \nafter having driven across mountain roads from Washington. She would \nalways get up and unlock the door. Sometimes I would go up on the porch \nand see her on her knees praying. Many times, she would get out of bed \nand unlock the door and let me in the house and offer to fix a meal for \nme at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning. And then, when I would go to bed, \nand the lights were all out, I would hear her prayers coming from \nanother room. I knew she was on her knees.\n  So, the President spoke of having been on his knees at times, and \nthat our Nation during these trying days has found comfort in its \nsuffering by being on its knees. People are turning back to the church. \nI remember that woman as she prayed on her knees. And I remember him, \nher husband. I knew no other father than he. He was the only man I ever \nknew as my father--except for one occasion when I was in high school, \nmy senior year, when he and I caught a Greyhound bus and traveled back \nto North Carolina where I did meet my biological father and spent about \na week in his home. But that coal miner who raised me, and whom I \ncalled my dad, was likewise a religious man.\n  These two wonderful old people, this couple who raised me, didn't go \naround wearing their religion on their sleeve and making a big whoop-\nde-do about it; they didn't claim to be good, as the Bible says that no \nman is good. They didn't belong to the Christian right or the Christian \nleft, or Christian middle, or whatever it was. They had that King James \nBible in their home. They lived their religion. They didn't look down \nupon any man and they didn't look up to any man--except they looked up \nto God. So they brought me up like that and taught me like that.\n  Now, I will say this: Regardless of how far one may stray from the \nright path, if he has had this basic faith drilled into him from the \nbeginning by parents who reared him and taught him how to live, he may \nstray away from those lessons, but he will come back.\n  We all err and fall short of the glory of God. It just touches my \nheart and makes me feel good that the Chief Magistrate of our country \ntalks about getting on his knees. So I say while I may differ, and will \ndiffer from President Bush, I will also respect him and respect his \nhumility, his basic faith exemplified by what he is saying in this \ninstance, exemplified by his indicating that a nation advances when it \nadvances on its knees. Once when my wife and I dined at the White House \nwith Mr. Bush as President--that is and may be the only time we will \never have the privilege of dining there--but upon that occasion \nPresident Bush said grace at the table before we ate. He did not call \non me to say grace. He said it himself. He was, I am sure, not \nattempting to impress us with his faith but he was practicing it. \nNobody was there other than Ted Stevens, his wife, my wife, me and the \nPresident.\n  So, yes, we will differ on President Bush's budget--we will disagree \nmightily on that--but when it is all said and done I have to remember \nthat here is a man who preaches and practices, as far as I have seen, \nhis faith.\n  ``Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. \nExcept the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.''\n  I hope we will never become so mighty, so wrapped up in ourselves \nindividually, so subordinated to the tenets of partisan political \nparties, that we fail to acknowledge God. After all, when it comes down \nto the last mile of the way, the last hour of my days, if I have a \nclear mind at that point I will not be thinking about the Democratic \nParty. I will not be reciting the tenets, the principles, of the \nDemocratic Party. Politcal party in that moment will mean nothing to \nme. Instead, I will be wondering, how will it be with my soul when I \nhave to meet God face-to-face.\n  Now perhaps I did not think so much about these things when I was 24 \nor when I was 34, but 50 years later at the age of 84, I am drawn to \nthink about these things. No, the party platform will not be worth much \nto me in that hour. Nor will it be to you or to you, but that moment is \ncoming. For some of us, it will be all too soon. We know not when. It \ncomes to us all. It comes to Presidents. It comes to Kings. It comes to \nGovernors. It comes to Senators. It comes to coal miners, to farmers, \nto schoolteachers, to lawyers, but it comes.\n  I salute President Bush for his remarks. I hope he will continue to \ncall upon his Maker in his search for strength and comfort.\n  I lost a grandson 20 years ago this year. For a long time thereafter, \nI walked in a deep valley. I sought everywhere for strength. I went to \nsee the coroner. I went to see the State policeman who was there and \nsaw my grandson's body removed from the truck that had crashed and then \ncaught fire. I went to see the volunteer fire department that was \nnearby. Again and again I went to these same people. I was searching, \ntrying to persuade myself that my grandson had not suffered. I found \nthe greatest of comfort when I felt that my grandson was aware of my \ngrief--that he knew about my grief, and that I have the promise in \nGod's Word that I can see Michael again.\n  There may come a time in the young lives of these high school juniors \nwho are here as pages, when they, too, will find succor and comfort \nonly in God's Word, feeling that, yes, He is here, He knows about their \ngrief.\n  I will refer to one other time in my life. I was much younger than \n84, much younger than I was in 1982 when I lost my grandson. This was \nback in 1945, during the Second World War. I had been a welder in \nBaltimore for a year and a half working on ``Victory'' ships and \n``Liberty'' ships. I decided to take my wife and two daughters and go \nsouth to Florida the next winter rather than remain in Baltimore \nshipyards where the cold winds came across the bay, as we were on the \ndecks of the ships welding that cold steel. I was in Crab Orchard, WV, \nin southern West Virginia, visiting with my uncle and aunt who had \nraised me and I dreamed\n\n[[Page S539]]\n\nthat Mr. Byrd, the man whom I had always recognized as my dad, had \ndied.\n  The very next day I received a telegram from my brother--who is still \nliving; he is 88, a little older than I, still living in North \nWilkesboro, NC--saying to me that my biological father, Mr. Cornelius \nCalvin Sale, had died. After having dreamed that my adopted father had \ndied, the very next day I received a telegram saying that my natural \nfather had died.\n  Mr. Byrd and I caught a Greyhound bus and we traveled to North \nCarolina. I attended the funeral of my father, Mr. Sale. From there, I \nleft alone to go to Florida to get a job there, if I could, as a \nwelder, building ships. I traveled all night on a bus. I took a welding \ntest the next morning in Jacksonville in a shipyard. I failed the test. \nHaving been up all night, I didn't have a steady hand, perhaps. I \nfailed that test.\n  I asked: Where else are they testing and hiring welders here in \nFlorida? I was told to go over on the west side of Florida on the side \nof the gulf. I was told that they were hiring welders in Tampa. So \nacross Florida I started again on a bus. When I reached Lakeland, late \nin the day, I got off the bus and I went into a little grocery store \nand bought a stick of pepperoni, some crackers, a piece of Longhorn \ncheese, and a can of sardines. I sat down on a railroad rail outside \nthe grocery store and I ate. What was left, I put back in the paper bag \nand found myself a hotel. It didn't cost much in those days to stay in \na hotel, so I spent the night in a hotel.\n  While in that hotel I, of course, felt lonely. My wife and two \ndaughters were back in West Virginia, miles away. I was homesick.\n  I opened the drawer of a table in the room, and there was a Gideon \nBible. That was the first Gideon Bible I had ever seen. It was the King \nJames version. Senators often hear me refer to the King James version. \nThat is the only Bible I will read, the King James version. I like its \nimmaculate English, its beautiful prose. I read two or three chapters \nof that Bible and went to bed. I said a little prayer and asked God to \nprotect me and protect my wife and children back in West Virginia, to \nforgive us, and to help me the next day when I took the welding test in \nTampa.\n  The next day, I rose early. I ate what I had left over from the \nprevious day: some pepperoni, some cheese, some of the bread. I went on \nto Tampa, took the welding test, passed it with flying colors, and was \nhired to work in McCloskey Shipyard.\n  I found in that Bible the words of comfort and succor that helped me \non that night in Tampa, FL. That was 57 years ago.\n  I say to the young people here and to those young people who are \nwatching the Senate via television, I want us to appreciate the words \nof the President when he talks about God, about prayer. I want you to \nrealize that even though you are just juniors in high school, you too \nare going to grow old some day. We all grow old if God lets us live \nlong enough. And there will come a time in life when you will need the \nstrength that comes from a faith in a Creator, faith in a higher power. \nThat is the kind of faith that our fathers had, the men and women who \nbuilt this country, who built this Republic. It is a representative \ndemocracy. But it is not a democracy, a pure democracy. Theirs was a \npure democracy in Athens, in Greece. But that was a small town compared \nwith Washington, DC, or New York City.\n  I say to the young people of this country--as well as to Senators--it \ndoesn't make any difference how many degrees you may have, how many \ndegrees you may attain, what you may achieve, the heights of whatever \ncareer you may choose in this life. Remember, when it all comes down to \nthe end, six feet of Earth makes us all of one size. What will count \nthen most of all is how well will I be prepared when I stand before the \neternal judge?\n  I attended an execution once of a young man who had killed a cab \ndriver. He had hired a cab driver in Huntington, WV, to take him to \nLogan. On the way to Logan he shot the cab driver in the back, tossed \nhim out beside the road, took his money, and went on. A few days later \nthe young man was apprehended in a theater in Montgomery, WV. He was \nbrought to trial, convicted, and sentenced to die in the electric \nchair.\n  West Virginia law at that time required a certain number of witnesses \nto an execution. I thought that, inasmuch as I had occasion often to \nspeak to young people in Sunday school classes, churches, Boy Scouts, \nGirl Scout troops, 4H Clubs, if I could talk with this young man who \nwas about to go to the electric chair, he might be able to tell me \nsomething that would help these young people with whom I would meet and \nspeak.\n  On this occasion I went to the State penitentiary at Moundsville. I \nasked the warden to let me be one of the witnesses. He gave his \napproval. Before the execution, which was scheduled to be at 9 p.m., I \nasked the warden to let me talk with this young man whose name was Jim \nHewlett. This was in 1951 when I was a member of the West Virginia \nSenate. I went to the death house, entered the death house, and there \nwas Jim Hewlett. I shook his hand. It was clammy, with perspiration. \nBehind him was a chaplain.\n  I said to Jim Hewlett, I have come tonight to ask you if you might \nhave something that I could say to young people. I often have the \noccasion to speak with young people. I think you just might have \nsomething I could tell them, that would help them.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Well, tell them to go to Sunday school and church.\n\n  He said:\n\n       If I had gone, I wouldn't be here tonight.\n\n  And then, as I started to go--I knew the time was fleeting and his \nremaining minutes were precious to him. As I turned to go, he said:\n\n       Wait a minute. Tell them one other thing.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Tell them not to drink the stuff that I drank.\n\n  Those were his exact words:\n\n       Tell them not to drink the stuff that I drank.\n\n  I said:\n\n       Well, now, what do you mean by that?\n\n  The Chaplain broke in. He said:\n\n       I know what he means. He was drinking when he killed the \n     cab driver. You see that little crack on the wall up there? \n     If he were to have two or three drinks right now, he would \n     try to get through that crack in the wall. That's what it \n     does to him.\n\n  I left the death house and went back to the warden's office, and when \nthe hour came, I returned to the death house, and entered the death \nchamber. As one of the witnesses, I watched Jim Hewlett die.\n  Some years later, probably 30 years later, I was in the northern \npanhandle of West Virginia, and while I was there, someone said: Why \ndon't you go down and see Father--I don't remember the Father's name--\ngo down and see Father So-and-So. He's very ill, and I am sure it would \nhelp him if you just stopped by and said hello.\n  I said:\n\n       OK, where does he live?\n\n  I had my driver take me to the man's house. He was sitting out on the \nback porch in the sunshine. I introduced myself and sat down with him.\n  For some reason, I cannot account why, my conversation went back to a \ntime when I visited Moundsville and witnessed the execution of a young \nman named Jim Hewlett. I don't recall how our conversation took this \nturn. But this priest, who, indeed, was in very failing health, \nlistened raptly as I told about this execution, about what I had said, \nabout what Jim Hewlett had said.\n  When I finished, the priest said:\n\n       Yes, that's the way it was. You see, I was the Chaplain \n     that night when you visited Jim Hewlett in his cell.\n\n  I didn't know the priest. I didn't know his name. But there he was, \n30 years later, and he had been in that cell.\n  The point I want to make is this. The young man scoffed at religion, \nand after he was convicted of this crime and scheduled to die, he \ndidn't want a chaplain in his cell. He scoffed at religion. But when \nthe last days came and Governor Patteson of West Virginia declined to \nchange his sentence, declined to commute his sentence from death to \nlife in prison or whatever, Jim Hewlett knew then that he was, indeed, \ngoing to die, and he wanted a chaplain in his cell. He had scoffed at \nreligion. Now, when he knew that he indeed was going to meet God \nshortly, he wanted a chaplain in his cell.\n  That is why I say to you young people all over this country, there \nwill come a time when you, too, will want--will want God.\n\n[[Page S540]]\n\n     Last night, I passed beside the blacksmith's door,\n     And heard the anvil ring the vesper chime,\n     And looking in, I saw upon the floor,\n     Old hammers worn with beating years of time.\n     ``How many anvils have you had,'' said I,\n     ``To wear and batter all these hammers so?''\n     ``Only one,'' the blacksmith said, then with twinkling eye,\n     ``The anvil wears the hammers out, you know.''\n     And so the Bible, the anvil of God's word,\n     For centuries, skeptic blows have beaten upon,\n     But, though the noise of falling blows was heard,\n     The anvil is unharmed, the hammers gone.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   Remarks by the President at National Prayer Breakfast, Washington \n                      Hilton Hotel, Washington, DC\n\n       The President: Thank you very much, John. Laura and I are \n     really honored to join you this morning to celebrate the 50th \n     anniversary of the National Prayer Breakfast. And Admiral \n     Clark, whatever prayer you used for eloquence, worked. \n     (Laughter and applause.) I appreciate your message and I \n     appreciate your service to our great country. (Applause.)\n       I want to thank Jon Kyl and Judge Sentelle for their words, \n     and CeCe for your music. I appreciate getting the chance to \n     meet Joe Finley, the New York City firefighter. He's a living \n     example of what sacrifice and courage means. Thank you for \n     coming, Joe. (Applause.)\n       I want to thank Congressman Bart Stupak. I really \n     appreciate the fact that my National Security Advisor, \n     Condoleezza Rice, is here to offer prayer. (Applause.) I \n     appreciate the members of my Cabinet who are here. I want to \n     say hello to the members of Congress.\n       I'm particularly grateful to Lisa Beamer for her reading \n     and for her example. (Applause.) I appreciate here example of \n     faith made stronger in trial. In the worst moments of her \n     life, Lisa has been a model of grace--her own, and. \n     (Applause.) And all America welcomes into the world Todd and \n     Lisa's new daughter, Morgan Kay Beamer. (Applause.)\n       Since we met last year, millions of Americans have been led \n     to prayer. They have prayed for comfort in time of grief; for \n     understanding in a time of anger; for protection in a time of \n     uncertainty. Many, including me, have been on bended knee. \n     The prayers of this nation are a part of the good that has \n     come from the evil of September the 11th, more good than we \n     could ever have predicted. Tragedy has brought forth the \n     courage and the generosity of our people.\n       None of us would ever wish on any one what happened on that \n     day. Yet, as with each life, sorrows we would not choose can \n     bring wisdom and strength gained in no other way. This \n     insight is central to many faiths, and certainly to faith \n     that finds hope and comfort in a cross.\n       Every religion is welcomed in our country; all are \n     practiced here. Many of our good citizens profess no religion \n     at all. Our country has never had an official faith. Yet we \n     have all been witnesses these past 21 weeks to the power of \n     faith to see us through the hurt and loss that has come to \n     our country.\n       Faith gives the assurance that our lives and our history \n     have a moral design. As individuals, we know that suffering \n     is temporary, and hope is eternal. As a nation, we know that \n     the ruthless will not inherit the Earth. Faith teaches \n     humility, and with it, tolerance. Once we have recognized \n     God's image in ourselves, we must recognize it in every human \n     being.\n       Respect for the dignity of others can be found outside of \n     religion, just as intolerance is sometimes found within it. \n     Yet for millions of Americans, the practice of tolerance is a \n     command of faith. When our country was attacked, Americans \n     did not respond with bigotry. People from other countries \n     and cultures have been treated with respect. And this is \n     one victory in the war against terror. (Applause).\n       At the same time, faith shows us the reality of good, and \n     the reality of evil. Some acts and choices in this world have \n     eternal consequences. It is always, and everywhere, wrong to \n     target and kill the innocent. It is always, and everywhere, \n     wrong to be cruel and hateful, to enslave and oppress. It is \n     always, and everywhere, right to be kind and just, to protect \n     the lives of others, and to lay down your life for a friend.\n       The men and women who charged into burning buildings to \n     save others, those who fought the hijackers, were not \n     confused about the difference between right and wrong. They \n     knew the difference. They knew their duty. And we know their \n     sacrifice was not in vain. (Applause.)\n       Faith shows us the way to self-giving, to love our neighbor \n     as we would want to be loved ourselves. In service to others, \n     we find deep human fulfillment. And as acts of service are \n     multiplied, our nation becomes a more welcoming place for the \n     weak, and a better place for those who suffer and grieve.\n       For half a century now, the National Prayer Breakfast has \n     been a symbol of the vital place of faith in the life of our \n     nation. You've reminded generations of leaders of a purpose \n     and a power greater than their own. In times of calm, and in \n     times of crisis, you've called us to prayer.\n       In this time of testing for our nation, my family and I \n     have been blessed by the prayers of countless of Americans. \n     We have felt their sustaining power and we're incredibly \n     grateful. Tremendous challenges await this nation, and there \n     will be hardships ahead. Faith will not make our path easy, \n     but it will give us strength for the journey.\n       The promise of faith is not the absence of suffering, it is \n     the presence of grace. And at every step we are secure in \n     knowing that suffering produces perseverance, and \n     perseverance produces character, and character produces \n     hope--and hope does not disappoint.\n       May God bless you, and may God continue to bless America. \n     (Applause.)\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

It is supported by many farm groups. The people who oppose \nthis amendment, as I said this morning, have a lot of imagination \nbecause what they are talking about has no relation to the facts, and \nit is obvious to me it is without foundation.\n  I hope people will refer to the statement I made earlier today and \nrecognize that all these concerns about the Federal Government taking \nthe water from these poor, unfortunate ranchers and farmers is simply \nuntrue. State law would rule. Any water that would be transferred would \nbe that of a willing seller or a willing lessor. No one can be forced \nto do anything. It does not change State water law. For example, in the \nState of Nevada, the water engineer makes those decisions relating to \nwater and would still make those decisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S540-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S540-S541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                               RUBY RIDGE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to report on \nwhat may be the concluding chapter of the tragic incident at Ruby Ridge \nwhere the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the FBI had a \nstandoff with Randy Weaver which resulted in the death of his wife and \nthe death of his son Sammy Weaver and the death of a deputy U.S. \nmarshal.\n  The Judiciary subcommittee which I chaired conducted extensive \nhearings on this matter back in 1995. At that time we developed the \nfacts that Randy Weaver was sought out by agents from the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms unit to be an informant. And they sought \nto buy from him two sawed-off shotguns which he did provide. Then they \nthreatened him with criminal prosecution unless he would be an \ninformant. When he refused to do that, a criminal prosecution was \ninitiated.\n\n[[Page S541]]\n\n  Process was not served on Randy Weaver, and the process server \nthought they had given him notice of the trial. But that led to the \nissuance of a warrant of arrest, and Randy Weaver resisted on the \nmountaintop. That led the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms unit \nto come to try to compel the arrest. A fire fight ensued, where Deputy \nMarshal Degan was killed; where Sammy Weaver, age 14, was killed in an \nincident involving Sammy Weaver's dog, a very tragic setting. Then the \nFBI came in with their hostage rescue team and Randy Weaver's wife was \nkilled.\n  The case went to trial in the Federal court against Randy Weaver, \nwhich found him guilty on lesser charges but concluded that Randy \nWeaver had, in fact, been entrapped.\n  During the course of the extensive hearings before the Judiciary \nsubcommittee, it was developed that while Randy Weaver was certainly at \nfault in providing these two sawed-off shotguns, that he had in fact \nbeen entrapped and that it was totally inappropriate conduct by the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in mounting this assault on \nRandy Weaver and his family.\n  During the course of these hearings, FBI Director Louis Freeh \nconceded that the FBI had violated Weaver's constitutional rights in \ntheir use of deadly force, and the FBI changed those practices. John \nMagaw, who was the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms, steadfastly defended the propriety of what BATF had done in \nthe face of what the subcommittee found to be overwhelming evidence of \nimpropriety on the part of the BATF.\n  Recently President Bush nominated Mr. Magaw to be an under secretary \nfor the Department of Transportation for airport security.\n  And that led Senator Craig, who sat with the subcommittee--although \nnot a member of the subcommittee--and myself to have a meeting with Mr. \nMagaw to review his conduct and his attitude on BATF at Ruby Ridge. \nDuring the course of those discussions, we went into the matter in some \ndetail. When Mr. Magaw had his hearing on December 20, I questioned him \nat length before the Commerce subcommittee. Although not a member, I \nreceived the acquiescence of the Commerce Committee and the \nsubcommittee to question Mr. Magaw. We went through the facts.\n  Mr. Magaw said at that hearing that if he had it all to do over \nagain, he would, in effect, concede that the BATF unit had made serious \nmistakes in their conduct there. Notwithstanding some reservations that \nI personally had about Mr. Magaw's judgment, even in the face of this \nconcession, it seemed to me that when we have the major problems of \nairport security in the United States today, and the President wanted \nMr. Magaw, had personally interviewed him, and I discussed the matter \nat length with Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta, who wanted \nMr. Magaw confirmed. That was the last day of the session. I decided \nnot to put a hold on Mr. Magaw. I thought, in fact, he would be \nconfirmed in what we call wrap-up. But somebody else put a hold on, not \nme. He was not confirmed.\n  The President made an interim appointment. After we reconvened in \nJanuary, Mr. Magaw has been confirmed by the Senate. I have taken these \nfew minutes to put on the record what I think is a very important \nconcession from the then-Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms, that his unit did not act properly.\n  We have to recognize, in my opinion, that when congressional \noversight finds serious errors and serious problems with the \nadministrative branches, that there be a sincere effort to correct \nthem, and to the credit of the FBI and Louis Freeh, that concession was \nmade. They changed their policy on the use of deadly force. Now we have \non the record at these hearings in the Commerce Committee that then-\nDirector Magaw conceded the errors and elaborated on changes which he \nhad made in BATF procedures.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S541-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATIONS TO HIGHMORE, SD GRAND OPENING OF THE NEW HIGHMORE HIGH \n                                 SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the community of Highmore, SD, and the Highmore School \nDistrict as they celebrate the grand opening of their new high school.\n  Helping each child obtain the best possible education is more \nimportant than ever. While some of our Nation's schools are providing \ninstruction at an exceptional level, others are simply not making the \ngrade. Poor infrastructure and inadequate facilities can have an effect \non student learning. When a school has a leaky roof, or holes in the \nwalls, or other unsafe conditions, it sends a message to the students \nwho attend that school that education is not really a high priority.\n  Highmore is sending a different message to its children. Highmore's \ncommitment to give its students a safe learning environment will have \ntremendous effects on this community for years to come. This community \nshould be commended for its efforts to ensure every child in the \ndistrict has access to a quality education, starting with a great \nschool building.\n  I am especially impressed by the determination of the school district \nand Superintendent Larry Gauer to see this project to completion. \nSchool Board President Julie Gutzmer, Vice Chairman Leroy Scott, board \nmembers Jim Frost, Ed Westcott, Jerry Dittman, Rod Kusser and Peggy \nKroeplin, and the outstanding faculty and staff are all to be commended \nfor their vision and dedication to this project.\n  It is true that our Nation's future security depends on the soundness \nof its foundation. Our future will be strong and bright only if we help \nall of our children grow up to be well-educated, healthy, contributing \ncitizens. I view public education as an investment in our national \nsecurity, and I will continue my efforts to see that all students have \naccess to a healthy, positive school environment that encourages them \nto learn and grow.\n  But the Federal Government can only be a partner in this important \neffort. The efforts of dedicated people in communities like Highmore \nworking together is what will make the difference for the youth of \nSouth Dakota and across the Nation. It is wonderful to see that the \npeople of Highmore are making education a priority. I salute them for \ntheir foresight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S541-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         MINNESOTAN TO LEAD THE NATION INTO THE WINTER OLYMPICS\n\n Mr. DAYTON.

These games have taken on a \nspecial importance in our country this year in the wake of the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks, and will be an important part of our \nNation's healing process.\n  That is why I am so proud that Minnesotan Stacey Liapis will help \ncarry the flag that once flew at the World Trade Center into the \nOpening Ceremony of the Olympics.\n  Stacey Liapis is a curling team member from Bemidji, who at the age \nof 27, is competing for the first time in the Winter Olympics.

Mr. President, one year ago today, the Senate \npassed S. 235, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2001. This bill, \noverwhelmingly approved by a vote of 98-0, is the product\n\n[[Page S542]]\n\nof many months of hearings, bipartisan compromise, and cooperation that \nbegan during the last Congress. It is designed to promote both public \nand environmental safety by reauthorizing and strengthening our federal \npipeline safety programs which expired in September, 2000.\n  Since the Senate began debating pipeline safety improvement \nlegislation in 1999, the House has taken little action. Various \npipeline safety improvement measures are available for consideration by \nthe House, including a bill introduced December 20, 2001 by the \nChairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I \nencourage the House Members to act swiftly and help prevent not only \nneedless deaths and injuries, but also environmental and economic \ndisasters. Legislative action is necessary as demonstrated by the \nnumber of tragic accidents in recent years.\n  For example, on June 10, 1999, 277,000 gallons of gasoline leaked \nfrom a 16 inch underground pipeline into the Hannah Creek near \nBellingham, WA. The gasoline migrated into the Whatcom Creek, where it \nwas subsequently ignited. The ignition set off an explosion and fire, \nburning along both sides of the creek, for approximately 1.5 miles, \nkilling two 10 year old boys and an 18 year old young man who was \nfishing in the creek. In addition to the three deaths, there were eight \ninjuries and environmental damage to the area. Also, the fire damaged \nthe Bellingham Water Treatment Plant and other industrial structures, \nas well as a private residence. Interstate 5 was closed for a period of \ntime because of the thick smoke, and the Coast Guard closed Bellingham \nBay for a one mile radius from the mouth of the Whatcom Creek.\n  Other tragedies have occurred. On August 19, 2000, a natural gas \ntransmission line ruptured in Carlsbad, NM, killing 12 members of two \nfamilies. On September 7, 2000, a bulldozer in Lubbock, TX, ruptured a \npropane pipeline. The ensuing cloud was ignited by a passing vehicle, \ncreating a fireball which killed a police officer.\n  Congress was called on to act after the first accident in Washington. \nI introduced S. 2438, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000, on \nApril 13, 2000. With the assistance of a bipartisan group of Senators, \nincluding Senators Slade Gorton and Patty Murray, the Commerce \nCommittee reported the measure favorably later that July. The Senate \ntook swift action upon return from the August recess, during which the \naccident in New Mexico had occurred. We passed S. 2438 by unanimous \nconsent on September 7, 2000, on the same day as the rupture in Texas.\n  The Senate's accomplishment that year stemmed from several months of \nhearings and countless meetings. Unfortunately, the House failed to \napprove a pipeline safety measure so we were never able to go to \nconference or send a measure to the President. Our collective inaction \nwas a black mark on the 106th Congress.\n  After the opening of the 107th Congress, I introduced nearly \nidentical legislation, S. 235, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of \n2001. The Senate acted swiftly and passed S. 235 on this date last \nyear, one of the first legislative actions of the 107th Congress. The \nHouse now has the opportunity to remove the black mark by acting on \npipeline safety legislation.\n  Including the tragedies I mentioned earlier, a total of 71 fatalities \nhave occurred as a result of a pipeline accident over the past three \nyears. It should be noted, however, that despite these horrible \naccidents, the pipeline industry has a good safety record relative to \nother forms of transportation. According to the Department of \nTransportation, pipeline related incidents dropped nearly 80 percent \nbetween 1975 and 1998, and the loss of product due to accidental \nruptures has been cut in half. From 1989 through 1998, pipeline \naccidents resulted in about 22 fatalities per year--far fewer than the \nnumber of fatal accidents experienced among other modes of \ntransportation. But this record should not be used as an excuse for \ninaction on legislation to strengthen pipeline safety.\n  The Office of Pipeline Safety, OPS, within the Department of \nTransportation's, DOT, Research and Special Programs Administration, \nRSPA, oversees the transportation of about 65 percent of the petroleum \nand most of the natural gas transported in the United States. OPS \nregulates the day-to-day safety of 3,000 gas pipeline operators with \nmore than 1.6 million miles of pipeline. It also regulates more than \n200 hazardous liquid operators with 155,000 miles of pipelines. Given \nthe immense array of pipelines that traverse our nation, \nreauthorization of our pipeline safety programs is critical to the \nsafety and security of thousands of communities and millions of \nAmericans nationwide.\n  Early attention by the Senate demonstrates our firm commitment to \nimproving pipeline safety. I will continue to do all I can to advance \npipeline safety legislation this year. When the Senate considers an \nEnergy bill in the upcoming days or weeks, I intend to offer S. 235 as \nan amendment to it. I hope my colleagues will join with me in \ndemonstrating their strong support for addressing identified pipeline \nsafety lapses and will vote for this amendment.\n  I remain hopeful that Congress as a whole will finally act before we \nreceive another call to action by yet another tragic accident. Action \nis needed. It is needed now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S542-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IN RECOGNITION OF RICHARD ``NIGHT TRAIN'' LANE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise today to \nacknowledge the life of Richard Lane, a National Football League player \nwho finished his career playing for the Detroit Lions, who passed away \nTuesday, January 29th. Richard ``Night Train'' Lane possessed great \nathletic capabilities, a passion for the game and played the game of \nfootball like no one else. He is still recognized by many as one of the \ngreatest cornerbacks to ever play the game.\n  Through hard work and an unwavering commitment to the game of \nfootball, Night Train Lane's skill has made an indelible mark on the \nannals of football history. At six feet, two inches and 210 pounds, he \nwill be remembered for hounding wide receivers with his trademark \ntackle, the Night Train Necktie.\n  Upon graduating from High School, Night Train attended Scottsbluff \nJunior College, where he played football for one season. After a year \nin college, he served four years in the United States Army. He played \nwide receiver for service teams during his time in the Army and was \nspotted by a Los Angeles Rams scout during an Army exhibition game. In \n1952, upon his discharge from the Army, Night Train was invited to drop \nby the Rams training camp for a try out.\n  In his rookie season with the Rams, he had 14 interceptions in a 12 \ngame season, a record that has stood for 50 years despite the NFL \nseason schedule increasing to 16 games. After starting his career with \nthe Rams, he was traded to the Chicago Cardinals, and later traded to \nthe Detroit Lions. Over the course of his 14 year career, he made 68 \ninterceptions, five for touchdowns. His career interception return \nyards total of 1,207 is still second in NFL history.\n  After retiring from the NFL, Lane worked in the front office of the \nDetroit Lions, and was later head coach of both Southern University and \nCentral State University. He later returned to Detroit to become \nexecutive director of the Police Athletic League, a sports program for \nat-risk children in Detroit. Night Train Lane's hard work and \ntremendous ability has been recognized by his peers who elected him to \nthe Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1974 and to the 75th anniversary all-\ntime team in 1994.\n  I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in saluting Night Train Lane \nfor his extraordinary career in the National Football League, his \nhonorable service to our nation and his work with the children of \nDetroit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S542-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S542-S543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred May 19, 1994 \nin Savannah, GA. Milton Bradley, 72, was fatally strangled by a man who \nbelieved Bradley to be gay.\n\n[[Page S543]]\n\n  The attacker, Gary Ray Bowles, 32, was charged with the murder in \nconnection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S543-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MINNESOTAN TO LEAD THE NATION INTO THE WINTER OLYMPICS\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, as all of America knows, the XIX \nOlympic Winter Games begin tonight in Salt Lake City. For an athlete, \nmaking the Olympic team is one of the highest possible accomplishments. \nTo be chosen by one's teammates to carry the American flag and to lead \nthe American team into tonight's opening ceremony is an absolutely \nstratospheric achievement!\n  That great honor has been bestowed by the American team on \nMinnesota's Amy Peterson. I wish to pay tribute to her extraordinary \nathletic skills and leadership abilities, and to all the other \nMinnesota athletes competing in this year's Games.\n  Amy is a speed skater from Maplewood, MN, who at the age of 30 is \ncompeting in her fifth Olympics! She has already won a silver medal and \ntwo bronze medals for the United States, and this year she hopes to cap \nher career with a gold medal. Amy, I hope you achieve your goal. Yet, \nyou have already surpassed that high achievement by the honor you \nearned tonight.\n  Amy has been called, in recent press reports, ``arguably the greatest \nWinter Olympian in Minnesota history.'' That is quite a distinction, \nsince Minnesota has always been one of the best-represented states in \nthe Winter Games. Both the 1960 and 1980 gold medal-winning U.S. men's \nhockey teams were spearheaded by Minnesota players and coaches. In the \nmost recent Winter Games, Minnesota players led the U.S. women's hockey \nteam to win the gold medal. In so many other winter sports, Minnesota \nathletes have excelled. Now, to that roster of great Minnesota athletes \nand leaders, we proudly add the name of Amy Peterson.\n  To honor Amy's many accomplishments and her selection by her American \nteammates to lead them, I am having an American flag flown today over \nthe U.S. Capitol. When the Games are concluded, I will present this \nflag to Amy. I hope she will fly it proudly for her lifetime, and that \nit will always remind her of this most special night.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S543-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNITION OF THE POLAR PLUNGE FOR SPECIAL OLYMPICS\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the \nrecent success of the Third Annual Polar Bear Plunge for Special \nOlympics Kentucky.\n  This always exciting, entertaining, and chilling polar plunge was \nable to shatter previous year's records for participants and money \nraised. With nearly 260 ``Polar Bears'' taking the icy plunge, Special \nOlympics Kentucky raised more than $45,000 to help support year round \nsports training and competition for Kentuckians with mental \ndisabilities.

Mr. President, on October 20th, a significant \nevent took place that I am afraid was lost in the crush of events. \nDeputy Sheriff Keith Flink was recognized by the National Order of \nBenevolent Elks' Drug Awareness Program and the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration with the first ever Enrique Camarena Award. His efforts \nto educate the young people of Iowa deserve to be highlighted.\n  The Enrique Camarena Award honors law enforcement officials who \nperform above and beyond the call of duty in drug enforcement. Enrique \nCamarena was a DEA agent who was kidnaped, tortured, and murdered by \ndrug traffickers while working undercover in March of 1985. Agent \nCamerena believed that one person could make a difference.\n  The memory of his sacrifice made for his country has been \nmemorialized through the celebration of National Red Ribbon Week, and \nnow through the National Enrique Camarena Award that was established by \nthe Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. The award was established \nto recognize and honor an individual who has made a significant \ncontribution in the field of drug prevention and who personifies Agent \nCamarena's belief that one person can make a difference.\n  Last fall, Deputy Sheriff Keith D. Flink from Odebolt, IA, was the \nwinner of the first Enrique Camarena Award. Deputy Sheriff Flink has \nspent over 30 years working in law enforcement, and working with young \npeople to teach them the dangers of drugs and alcohol, mostly on his \nown time. I think the time and commitment that Deputy Sheriff Flink has \ngiven to his community is best reflected in a letter his children sent \nthe Award Selection Committee. I would like to have printed the full \ntext of the letter in the Record following this statement, and add my \npraise to theirs for the hard work their father has done in Sac County.\n  It is important that each of us remembers that it is the activities \nof people like Deputy Sheriff Flink that really make a difference. The \npeople of Odebolt, the citizens of Sac County, are aware of this. The \nElks recognized the value of his contributions by giving him this \naward. And we, as a nation, should always remember that while the ``big \nthings'' that was as a country stand for are important, it is the \neveryday activities that make a difference. We should never forget, \nnever become too busy to recognize the accomplishments of everyday \nheros like Deputy Sheriff Keith Flink.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                  October 1, 1999.\n     Enrique Camarina Award Selection Committee.\n       Dear Selection Committee: My brothers and I heard our \n     father, Keith Flink, has been nominated for the Enrique \n     Camarina Award. After hearing this, we wanted his dedication \n     and achievements to be known. He has achieved many great \n     things in life by doing tasks above and beyond what is \n     expected. He is so concerned with the safety of all people \n     that he has no problem teaching about ``the war on drugs'' \n     while not on duty. There are so many times he will work the \n     night shift, sleep for 3 or 4 hours, and get up to give a \n     presentation on his own time. He does this with no complaints \n     because it is very important to him to get everyone to ``say \n     no to drugs''! He has also done a lot of research to give \n     great, effective presentations to the citizens in the area. \n     As you can see, he is very dedicated to his job on and off \n     duty!\n       Our father has taught us a lot about life. While growing \n     up, we always saw him practicing what he truly believed. He \n     still does this through all the volunteering he does for the \n     safety of the community. He is a true leader by the work that \n     he does and the positive example that he sets for society.\n       My brothers and I are very proud of our father and would be \n     honored if he was the recipient of the Enrique Camarina \n     Award. He definitely deserves it!\n       Thank you for your time.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeana Boyd,\n     Justin Flink,\n     Jory Flink.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S543-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S543-S545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-5296.

A bill to promote charitable giving, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am truly proud to join Senators \nSantorum, Bayh, Brownback, Bill Nelson, Cochran, Carnahan, Lugar, \nClinton and Hatch in introducing the Charity Aid, Recovery, and \nEmpowerment, or CARE, Act. This important bill responds to a \nsignificant problem facing our nation: the social service needs of far \ntoo many of our fellow citizens continue to go unmet, and we in \nCongress must do more to bring additional resources to people in need \nand to assist and empower the community and charitable groups seeking \nto serve them.\n  A little over a year ago, Senator Santorum and I stood with President \nBush as he unveiled his Faith-based and Community Initiative. At the \ntime, I embraced the plan's worthy goals, to strengthen our \npartnerships with charitable organizations and help them help more \npeople in need, but I cautioned that the devil truly would be in the \ndetails.\n  As it turned out, those details, particularly as they related to \ncreating a larger, lawful space for faith-based groups at the public \npolicy table, proved more than devilish when it came to translating our \noutline into legislation. It would not be an exaggeration to say that \nmany people had lost faith in ever seeing anything remotely resembling \na faith-based and community initiative.\n  But after many months of discussion, debate, and disappointments, I \nam proud to report that we have finally reached a balanced, bipartisan \nagreement, one that avoids the controversies that have to date bogged \ndown the President's plan in Congress, and that advances our common \ninterest in turning the growing good will in our country into more good \nworks in our communities. The truly bipartisan and diverse group of \ncosponsors who join me today testify to that.\n  That good will is an unmistakable outgrowth of the September 11 \nattacks. I have never seen our country more united or more committed to \nour common values, to freedom and tolerance, faith and family, \nresponsibility and community. With this bill, we hope to harness that \nrenewed American spirit to help make our country as good as our values, \nand to help restore hope to people and places it has too often gone \nmissing.\n  We start by acknowledging that, in the wake of September 11 and the \nweakened economy, there is an ongoing and consequential charity crunch. \nWith so much of our generosity focused on relief efforts, contributions \nto other groups have dropped markedly and resources have dwindled \nconsiderably, severely constraining the ability of many vital charities \nto meet rising demands. A survey released this week by the Association \nof Fundraising Professionals found that 44 percent of charities are \nexperiencing shortfalls in contributions.\n  This bill is designed in part to respond directly to that charity \ncrunch with a targeted two-year strategy to help leverage new public \nand private funding for the nation's non-profits. It would create a \nseries of new tax incentives, including a meaningful deduction for non-\nitemizers, to spur more charitable giving. And it would substantially \nincrease Federal funding for the Social Services Block Grant program, \nwhich underwrites a broad range of critical programs, by more than $1 \nbillion.\n  But this is not a short-term or short-sighted proposal. The CARE Act \nemploys a number of other tools to help empower community and faith-\nbased groups over the long haul and expand their capabilities, by \nproviding new forms of technical assistance that will make it easier \nfor smaller grassroots organizations to qualify for Federal aid. And it \nbuilds on a proposal that Senator Santorum and I have long advocated to \nexpand the use of innovative Individual Development Accounts, IDAs, to \nhelp low-income working families save and build assets and attain self-\nsufficiency.\n  As you can tell, this is not just a faith-based bill. It is a civil \nsociety bill. It is aimed at strengthening support for the broad range \nof community, civic, and philanthropic groups, including the \nreligiously-affiliated, that are strengthening our social fabric. It \ncontains none of the troubling charitable choice provisions that were \nin the House bill, H.R. 7, that undermined or preempted civil rights \nlaws and raised constitutional concerns.\n  What it does do, though, is to take some common-sense, narrowly-\ntargeted steps to knock down specific, documented barriers preventing \nmany smaller faith-based social service providers from fairly competing \nfor Federal funding. There's just no good reason to disqualify an \notherwise qualified faith-based group just because they have a cross on \ntheir wall or a mezuzah on their door, or because they have a religious \nname in their title, or they have praise for God in their mission \nstatement.\n  In moving forward with this bill, we as Democrats and Republicans \nrecognize that while charities are not a replacement for government, \ngovernment cannot do it all, either. In fact, there are some things \nthat government cannot do at all, like repairing the human spirit. That \nis why it is so important for us to partner with the agents of civil \nsociety, who, as we saw again and again after September 11, can fill in \nthose holes and fill up our hearts.\n  And that is why I am so pleased with this proposal, and proud of the \nwork we have done together to make it viable. In the end, the Good \nLord, not the devil, is in the details. I want to thank the President \nfor his leadership and his cooperation, and to thank my friend Senator \nSantorum for his steadfast faith in that process. This is one CARE \npackage that will, I am confident, deliver a lot of good to a lot of \npeople, and which I believe a lot of Democrats and Republicans will \neagerly support.\n  People in need and the groups that help them are waiting for our \nhelp. The CARE Act will bring it to them. I urge my colleagues to join \nus in supporting it. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1924\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

To do so, \n     it would leverage new support and resources for a broad range \n     of community and faith-based groups--including those that are \n     already working cooperatively with government to provide \n     critical services and improve people's lives, and those who \n     want to become part of that partnership.\n       This diverse universe of charitable organizations--which \n     proved once again after the terrorist attacks how effective \n     they are in meeting real human needs--is uniquely American \n     and forms the backbone of our civil society. The CARE Act \n     would strengthen that backbone through a broad array of tools \n     and strategies--(1) tax incentives to spur more private \n     charitable giving; (2) innovative programs to promote savings \n     and economic self-sufficiency for low-income families; (3) \n     technical assistance to help smaller social services \n     providers do more good works; (4) narrowly-targeted efforts \n     to remove unfair barriers facing faith-based groups in \n     competing fairly for federal aid; and (5) additional federal \n     funding for essential social service programs.\n\n\n                 title i: charitable giving incentives\n\n       This section offers a series of targeted tax incentives to \n     spur additional charitable giving and thereby bring increased \n     resources to organizations helping those in need. Among other \n     things, these provisions would:\n       Create a charitable tax deduction of up to $400 for \n     individual taxpayers and $800 for couples who do not itemize \n     on their tax returns;\n       Allow IRA holders to make charitable contributions from \n     their accounts;\n       Provide an enhanced deduction for donations of food and \n     books to charitable organizations;\n       Reduce and simplfy the excise tax on foundations from 2 \n     percent to 1 percent to encourage greater social investments;\n       Raise the contributions cap for subchapter C corporations \n     and expand incentives for S corporations to increase \n     corporate charitable giving; and\n       Modify the unrelated business income tax for charitable \n     remainder trusts.\n       These provisions are designed to respond to the immediate \n     challenges facing charities in the wake of the September 11th \n     attacks and the weakened economy, which have put a \n     significant drain on resources. These provisions, which are \n     effective through 2003, have not been officially scored by \n     the Joint Tax Committee, but are estimated to cost between \n     $8 billion and $10 billion.\n\n\n               title ii: individual development accounts\n\n       This section encompasses the bipartisan legislation that \n     Senators Lieberman and Santorum have introduced to expand the \n     use of Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) to encourage \n     low-income working families to save and build assets. IDAs \n     are special savings accounts that offer matching \n     contributions from the sponsoring bank or community \n     organization, on the condition that the proceeds go to buying \n     a home, starting or expanding a small business, or to pay for \n     post-secondary education--the assets necessary to provide \n     stability and self-sufficiency.\n       Initial IDA demonstrations around the country have proven \n     successful in changing the lives of account holders and \n     reducing their dependency on governmental and other social \n     services. The CARE Act aims to build on these successes and \n     increase the availability of IDAs, by significantly reducing \n     the cost for banks and community organizations to offer these \n     innovative accounts. Specifically, it would provide a dollar-\n     for-dollar tax credit to offset the matching contributions up \n     to $500 per account. This incentive, which is estimated to \n     cost $1.7 billion over the next 10 years, could help create \n     as many as 900,000 new accounts over that time.\n\n\n       title iii: equal treatment for non-governmental providers\n\n       This section addresses a recurring complaint of small \n     faith-based organizations--that certain government agencies \n     have refused to consider grant applicants with religious \n     names or those who use facilities containing religious art or \n     icons--with a narrowly-tailored solution. Specifically, it \n     states that an applicant may not be disqualified from \n     competing for government grants and contracts simply because \n     the applicant imposes religious criteria for membership on \n     its governing board, because the applicant's chartering \n     provisions contain religious language, because the applicant \n     has a religious name, or because the applicant uses \n     facilities containing religious art, icons scriptures or \n     other symbols. These provisions do not relieve any applicant \n     from meeting all other grant criteria or address the issues \n     of preemption or civil rights laws.\n       This section also addresses another problem many smaller \n     community and faith-based grassroots organizations face in \n     obtaining federal funding. These organizations often do not \n     have the capacity or resources to seek and administer a \n     government grant or contract, even though they may be best \n     positioned to deliver the services. To help them overcome \n     this hurdle, this section authorizes government agencies to \n     give grants or enter into cooperative agreements with larger \n     and more experienced organizations, who then will be \n     authorized to award subcontracts or subgrants to smaller \n     grassroots organizations, with whom they will work to \n     administer the grant.\n\n\n                      title iv: 501(c)(3) EZ Pass\n\n       This section would make it easier for many charitable \n     groups to obtain a 501(c)(3) designation, and thereby make it \n     easier to qualify for Federal grants and contracts. 501(c)(3) \n     status confirms that an organization is a tax-exempt charity, \n     eligible to receive tax-exempt donations. Although any group \n     that applies for that status can hold itself out as a \n     501(c)(3) once it sends the IRS its application, a number of \n     government programs won't consider applications from any \n     group that hasn't yet received approval of its application \n     from the IRS--a process that sometimes can take several \n     months.\n       To help facilitate that process, the bill requires the IRS \n     to expedite the 501(c)(3) application of any group that needs \n     that status to apply for a government grant or contract. And, \n     in a effort to help the smallest of these groups, it requires \n     the IRS to waive the application fee for groups whose annual \n     revenues don't exceed $50,000.\n\n[[Page S556]]\n\n                    title v: Compassion capital fund\n\n       To help small community and faith-based organizations \n     better partner with the government and serve communities in \n     need, the bill creates a Compassion Capital Fund and \n     authorizes four agencies to distribute its resources. HHS, \n     DOJ, HUD and the Corporation for National and Community \n     Service will collectively have over $150 million to offer \n     technical assistance to community-based organizations for \n     activities such as writing and managing grants, assistance in \n     incorporating and gaining tax-exempt status, information on \n     capacity building and help researching and replicating model \n     social service programs.\n\n\n                 title VI: social services Block Grant\n\n       This section would increase Federal funding for the Social \n     Services Block Grant (SSBG), which most charitable \n     organizations agree is a critically important and effective \n     program for meeting the needs of disadvantaged communities \n     and families. SSBG provides flexible funds to states for such \n     vital programs as Meals on Wheels, child and elderly \n     protective services, and support services for the disabled. \n     Over the last five years, however, the program has seen its \n     funding reduced by more than $1 billion.\n       The bill aims to restore funding for SSBG over the next two \n     years to its authorized level as dictated in the 1996 welfare \n     reform law. It would first increase the funding level to \n     $1.975 billion for fiscal year 2003; the program is currently \n     funded at $1.7 billion. It would then raise the funding level \n     to its full authorized level--$2.8 billion--for fiscal year \n     2004. This would represent an increase of $275 million for \n     the coming fiscal year, and more than $800 million for the \n     following year.\n\n\n                    title vii: maternity group homes\n\n       This section is designed to advance one of the key goals of \n     welfare reform--helping teenage mothers achieve self-\n     sufficiency--by strengthening federal support for locally-run \n     maternity group home programs. The 1996 welfare reform law \n     requires that minors live at home under adult supervision or \n     in one of these maternity group homes in order to receive \n     benefits. Teenagers who are provided the opportunity to live \n     in these homes are more likely to continue their education or \n     receive job training, less likely to have a second teenage \n     pregnancy, and more likely to find gainful employment that \n     allows them to leave welfare. To help give more teenage \n     mothers this kind of opportunity, the bill creates a separate \n     funding stream for maternity group home programs and \n     authorizes $33 million in additional funding.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Gregg):\n  S. 1925. A bill to establish the Freedom's Way National Heritage Area \nin the States of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nestablish the Freedom's Way National Heritage Area in New Hampshire and \nMassachusetts. The bill is cosponsored by Senator Kennedy and Senator \nGregg.\n  The bill proposes to establish a national heritage area including 36 \ncommunities in Massachusetts and six communities in New Hampshire. The \narea has important cultural and natural legacies that are important to \nNew England and the entire Nation. I want to highlight just a few of \nthe reasons I believe this designation makes sense.\n  The Freedom's Way is an ideal candidate because it is rich in \nhistoric sites, trails, landscapes and views. The land and the area's \nresources are pieces of American history and culture. The entire \nregion, and especially places like Lexington and Concord, is important \nto our country's founding and our political and philosophical \nprinciples. Within the 42 communities are truly special places. These \ninclude the Minuteman National Historic Park, more than 40 National \nRegister Districts and National Historic Landmarks, the Great Meadows \nNational Wildlife Refuge, Walden Pond State Reservation, Gardener State \nPark, Harvard Shaker Village and the Shirley Shaker Village.\n  In addition, there is strong grassroots support for this designation. \nThe people of these communities organized themselves in this effort and \nhave now turned to us for assistance. I hope we can provide it. \nSupporters include elected officials, people dedicated to preserving a \nsmall piece of American and New England history, and local business \nleaders. It is an honor to help their cause.\n  Finally, I am very pleased that Senators from both Massachusetts and \nNew Hampshire have embraced this proposal. I thank Senators Kennedy and \nGregg.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S556-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 206--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MARCH 17 THROUGH MARCH \n     23, 2002 AS ``NATIONAL INHALANTS AND POISON PREVENTION WEEK''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 206\n\n       Whereas according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, \n     inhalant use ranks third in popularity behind use of alcohol \n     and tobacco for all youths through the eighth grade;\n       Whereas the over 1,000 products that are being inhaled to \n     get high are legal, inexpensive, and found in nearly every \n     home and corner market;\n       Whereas using inhalants even once to get high can lead to \n     kidney failure, brain damage, or even death;\n       Whereas inhalants are considered a gateway drug, 1 that \n     leads to the use of harder, more deadly drugs; and\n       Whereas because inhalant use is difficult to detect, the \n     products used are accessible and affordable, and abuse is so \n     common, increased education of young people and their parents \n     regarding the dangers of inhalants is an important step in \n     our Nation's battle against drug abuse: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of March 17 through March 23, 2002, \n     as ``National Inhalants and Poison Prevention Week'';\n       (2) encourages parents to learn about the dangers of \n     inhalant abuse and discuss those dangers with their children; \n     and\n       (3) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     week with appropriate activities.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to submit a resolution to \ndesignate March 17 to March 23, 2002 as ``National Inhalants and Poison \nPrevention Week.''\n  What exactly are inhalants? Inhalants are the intentional breathing \nof gas or vapors for the purpose of reaching a high. Over 1,400 common \nproducts can be abused--such as lighter fluid, pressurized whipped \ncream, hair spray, and gasoline, the abused product of choice in rural \nAlaska. These products are inexpensive, easily obtained and legal. An \ninhalant abuse counselor told me, ``If if smells like a chemical, it \ncan be abused.'' It's a ``silent epidemic'' because few adults really \nappreciate the severity of the problem. One in five students has tried \ninhalants by the time they reach the eight grade. The use of inhalants \nby children has nearly doubled in the last 10 years. Further, inhalants \nare the third most abused substances among teenagers, behind alcohol \nand tobacco.\n  These are facts that should trouble every parent, and every American. \nInhalants are deadly. Inhalant vapors react with fatty tissues in the \nbrain, literally dissolving them. One time use of inhalants can cause \ninstant and permanent brain, heart, kidney, liver or other organ \ndamage. The user can also suffer from instant heart failure known as \n``Sudden Sniffing Death Syndrome'', this means an abuser can die the \nfirst, tenth or hundredth time he or she uses an inhalant. In fact, \naccording to a recent study by the Alaska Native Health Consortium, \ninhaling has a higher risk of ``instant death'' than any other abused \nsubstance.\n  That's what happened to Theresa, an 18-year-old who lived in rural \nWestern Alaska. Theresa was inhaling gasoline, shortly thereafter her \nheart stopped. She was found alone and outside in near zero degree \ntemperatures. Theresa, who was the youngest of five children and just a \nmonth shy of graduation, was flown to Fairbanks Memorial Hospital where \nshe was pronounced dead on arrival.\n  To help combat this, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation opened \nAlaska's first inhalant treatment center last year. It is my hope that \nsomeday our treatment facility will only have empty beds. But, if this \ndream is to be realized, we must stop the abuse before the kids have to \ngo into treatment. My experience has been that prevention through \neducation is the key. As such awareness must be promoted among young \npeople, parents and educators. I hope that a national week of awareness \nwill encourage programs throughout the country, alerting parents and \nchildren to the dangers of inhalants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S556-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S556-S557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2836.

Mr. President, there are amendments that are still pending. \nWe have a finite list of amendments. I hope there will be Senators on \nboth sides to offer amendments in relation to this bill. All the \namendments offered today will be put in the normal list of amendments \nthat have been offered, and we will try to work something out. It may \nbe there will be some that will be accepted by Senators Harkin and \nLugar.\n  There are a number of other amendments that need to be offered. I \nwould think if we expect to complete this bill that we need to have \nsome of these offered Monday. It will not be possible to have everybody \noffer their amendments Tuesday and have votes on Tuesday and still get \nto the energy bill on Wednesday.\n  So I say to both the majority and minority Senators, we need to \nreally move forward on this. I hope that staffs and others will \nindicate that they should have their Senators here at 3 o'clock on \nMonday to start offering amendments.\n  The next rollcall vote will begin at 6 p.m. on Monday on two \nExecutive Calendar nominations. Rollcall votes will also occur Tuesday, \nFebruary 12, as early as 10 a.m. in relation to amendments on the farm \nbill or on additional Executive Calendar nominations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/08/senate-section/article/S572-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2002, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  Mr. REID.
