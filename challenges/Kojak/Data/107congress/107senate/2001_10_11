The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we all realize this morning that a month \nhas passed since the disaster of September 11, and we still are \nconfronted with the need for airline security, as the headlines in Roll \nCall state, ``Airport Firms Form Alliance''; as well as, ``Baggage \nScreening Companies Take Case to the Hill.''\n  So one month after this fanatical killing of 5,000 to 6,000 \nAmericans, thousands more casualties, and as many as 10,000 children \nleft without a parent, some without 2 parents, we are being delayed by \nthe contractors and the lobbyists. One of them particularly, cited in \nthis case, has banded together in a lobbying drive that so far has \nsucceeded--Argenbright.\n  There is also an article in the Miami Herald published Thursday, \nSeptember 13 about their efforts. I ask unanimous consent that the \narticle in full be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Miami Herald, Sept. 13, 2001]\n\n             Company Pleaded Guilty to Previous Violations\n\n                           (By Tyler Bridges)\n\n       Atlanta.--The security company that provides the checkpoint \n     workers at the airports breached by Tuesday's hijackers has \n     been cited at least twice for security lapses. In its worst \n     infraction, Atlanta-based Argenbright Security pleaded guilty \n     last year to allowing untrained employees, some with criminal \n     backgrounds, to operate checkpoints at Philadelphia \n     International Airport. In settling the charges, Argenbright \n     agreed to pay $1.2 million in fines and investigative costs. \n     Argenbright also came under criticism in 1999 for security \n     breaches that caused delays of Northwest Airline flights. \n     Argenbright was also found to have committed dozens of \n     violations of federal labor laws against its employees at Los \n     Angeles International Airport, an adminsitrative law judge \n     ruled in February 2000. The violations included 40 \n     suspensions and final warnings stemming from a strike by the \n     employees in April 1999. The violations also include the \n     disciplining of another union activist and threats, both \n     written and verbal, against the Argenbright employees. Among \n     other disciplinary action, Argenbright was required to remove \n     warnings from files related to the strike and give suspended \n     workers back pay.\n       Argenbright, a subsidiary of AHL Services, provides \n     security workers at 17 of the nation's 20 largest airport \n     hubs, including Newark, Logan and Dulles, where the hijacked \n     flights originated. The company is hired by the airlines. \n     There was a report Wednesday that two of the hijackers who \n     flew out of Logan might have arrived there from Portland \n     International Airport in Maine. A spokesman there said the \n     airlines at the airport use another security firm, not \n     Argenbright.\n       Argenbright officials declined to speak with a reporter \n     Wednesday. The company released a statement that expressed \n     sorrow for the ``tragic events'' and said officials are \n     ``working closely with and providing full support to its \n     airline customers as they deal with the aftermath of \n     yesterday's major terrorist attack.'' Argenbright also \n     provides checkpoint security at Miami International Airport. \n     Gary Dellapa, the airport's former director, said the company \n     got average marks for its work.\n       In the Philadelphia case, Argenbright hired more than 1,300 \n     untrained checkpoint screeners form 1995 through 1998 without \n     checking their backgrounds. Among these employees were \n     ``dozens of criminals,'' according to the government's \n     sentencing memorandum. Argenbright falsely certified that the \n     company had done the background checks and fraudulently \n     charged airlines for this work, the government said. U.S. \n     Attorney Michael R. Stiles in Philadelphia said the \n     violations of Federal Aviation Administration Regulations did \n     not harm any passengers or the airlines. But his office said \n     that ``if corporations such as Argenbright Security Inc. fail \n     to meet their obligations and responsibilities, then the \n     millions of people who fly on commercial aircraft every day \n     are put at risk.'' Edwin R. Mellett, vice chairman and co-\n     chief executive officer of AHL Services, said at the time \n     that the company fired the employees directly involved in the \n     fraud and cooperated with the investigation.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Argenbright is a contractor at Logan Airport, at Newark \nAirport, and at Dulles, all three airports from which the planes on \nthat disastrous day were taken over.\n  The article relayed how the firm was fined for misgivings and \nmisdeeds at Philadelphia. It says Argenbright, a subsidiary of AHL \nServices, provides security workers at 17 of the Nation's 20 largest \nairport hubs, including Newark, Logan, and Dulles, where the hijacked \nflights originated.\n  The company is hired by the airlines. Incidentally, the major \namendment we have is for airline worker benefits. I thought we passed a \n$15 billion package so we could stabilize the airlines so they could \ncontinue the health care and pay for their workers. But, no, we have to \nhave an additional amendment to take care of the unemployed airline \nworkers. I do not know what the $15 billion did, whether or not it took \ncare of the airline bonuses that we all know about.\n  Let me read. In the Philadelphia case, Argenbright hired more than \n1,300 untrained checkpoint screeners from 1995 through 1998 without \nchecking their backgrounds. Among these employees were dozens of \ncriminals. That is in quote marks--``dozens of criminals.'' According \nto the Government's sentencing memorandum, Argenbright falsely \ncertified the company had done the background checks and fraudulently \ncharged the airlines for this work. In other words, they lied about the \nbackground checks and charged the airlines for the background checks \nthey lied about. Yet they hold us up for an entire month because we \nwant to prevent further negligence. As has been stated, we had a pretty \nsobering lesson with Pan Am 103 and we knew how security was lax at \nthat particular time, so we were working to strengthen it. We were \ngoing to have higher standards. We were going to have more training. We \nwere going to have supervision and more pay.\n  And then in 1996, TWA 800. Guess what. We had all kinds of studies, \ncommissions, hearings. All this debate about contracts has been ongoing \nnow for 15 years. What did we come up with? More higher standards, more \ntraining hours, more supervision, and more pay. But you have to \ncontract out.\n  No one would ever think contracting would help the Border Patrol. No \none would think of contracting out the FBI. No one would ever think \nabout contracting out the security and protection of the President, the \nSecret Service. No one would think about contracting out our security, \nthe Capitol Police.\n  Walking into the Capitol today, I was asked, should we get the \nNational Guard around the Capitol? We have the Capitol Police. They are \nnot only adequate, they are more than adequate. They have been doing an \noutstanding job. We don't need any more National Guard troops running \naround and everything else of that kind. Terrorists would do better \nthan getting a Senator or two or a bunch of them. They would be \nreplaced by the Governor by sundown, so you couldn't get rid of them.\n  In any event, here we come. No one would think about contracting out \nthe Customs agents or any of these other security workers or the \n669,000 civilian workers in defense. They are Civil Service, they get \nhealth care. They get retirement benefits. They are stable. They are \nreliable. They are professional. They are accountable. That is what we \nare trying to do in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Who is holding the Senate up? The lying, thieving lobbyists who said \ncontract, contract, contract out.\n  We have federalization in the bill. I want to see who comes to take \nit out of the bill. The unmitigated gall of that crowd running around \nhere after learning what we've learned for 15 years, and particularly \nafter the September 11 hijackings and terrorist killings, they have the \nunmitigated gall to say that is what we ought to do again.\n\n  They don't have any idea of security. They have an idea of their \npolitical issue and their reelection because they pledged to downsize, \nget rid of the Government--the Government is not the solution, the \nGovernment is the problem. So they can't viscerally, ideologically, or \nphilosophically, even think in terms of security. They are like a \nchicken with the line in the sand: In my reelection, I pledged to get \nrid of the Government, and I'm not about to vote for 28,000 \nprofessionals.\n  If we get the bill to the House, we can negotiate what is necessary. \nThe traveling public are ready, willing, and anxious to pay for it. \nHeavens above, we ought to at least take away the threat of being shot \ndown. The day before yesterday, and yesterday again,\n\n[[Page S10489]]\n\nsomebody hands a note to the pilot, and good gosh, you have F-16s, A-\n10s, F-15s flying above ready to shoot you down. Who wants to get on a \nplane and get shot down?\n  This bill, S. 1447, will take care of that. We lock the cockpit door; \nit is never open. Let me emphasize, the chief pilot of El Al said: My \nwife can be assaulted in the cabin, but I don't open that door. The \nintended hijacker knows he will not be able to hijack the plane. He can \nstart a fight. He can maybe kill some people. He is going to get killed \nhimself.\n  You can see how the traveling public is ready to take them out. They \ndid on the flight yesterday. They did on the flight the day before. \nMore power to these patriotic Americans. The people understand. When is \nthe Senate going to understand and cut out this dillying around and get \ntogether to pass security, safety? It is unheard of that they would \nresist, having learned from all of these other experiences, having \nlearned from September 11 to not even give it a second thought, just \nbite their teeth and say: We are not going to have the Federal \nGovernment do anything. We don't trust government.\n  I think we were elected to get the Government to work. And we have \ntried the so-called contracting already. We can easily lock that door. \nThat does away with the expense of everybody being on alert, flying \nplanes around. No one put that cost down in defense, but we will get \nthe Defense appropriations measure, and they will find out, as a result \nof our dillying around, we have a charge now for guard units that are \nalerted--to do what? To shoot down domestic flights. Why? Because of \nthe Senate.\n  We should have gotten off our backsides and seen reality and been \nready, by gosh, to get moving here on an airline security measure. Yes, \nwe federalize. We are proud of it. It is taken care of. It is paid for. \nThe pilots are for it. The executives are for it. The flight attendants \nare for it. The municipal association is for it. Everybody is for it \nexcept the lobbyists, who want to continue to cheat and continue to \ndefraud. Isn't it grand? We have put up with it long enough.\n  There is no reason we can't get through this bill today. We have two \nor three amendments. I think we can temporarily set aside Carnahan. We \nhave the final vote at 1:35, so that time has been changed because the \ndistinguished cardinal is coming to town and we have a prayer service. \nSo we will go along and put it off for another hour, but they can \ndebate that amendment. Everyone knows its merit. Otherwise, we ought to \nhave two or three amendments here this morning and move ahead this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at 1:35 we will vote on the Carnahan \namendment. I am proud to be a sponsor with Senator Carnahan. I thank \nSenator Carnahan for the thoughtful amendment she has proposed. I join \nin urging our colleagues to support that amendment.\n  As the opening prayer indicated, we all have a sense as we rise on \nthe Senate floor about the momentous time this is, the 1-month \nanniversary of the terrorist attack. We are being summoned as a nation \nto give thoughtful prayer and consideration to those who lost their \nlives. Our colleagues are doing so at the Pentagon and other services \nthroughout the day. We are all mindful of that, and supportive of it.\n\n  But we also want to carry on our Nation's business, and we are \nmindful of the actions that have been taken and will be taken in the \nvery near future. We know that just after the attacks on the World \nTrade Center and the Pentagon that all the airlines effectively were \ngrounded for a period of time, as a direct result of that. We found \nthat the airline industry was compromised and was facing a very bleak \nand ominous future. Whether the industry itself was going to be able to \nsurvive was in question.\n  Those issues were talked about here, discussed, debated on the floor \nof the Senate. It is unusual that the Federal Government effectively \ncloses down a particular industry, an industry that has very broad \nimplications in terms of our economy. But, the federal government took \nthat action and, therefore, we felt we had an additional responsibility \nto help, assist, and offset the losses of those airlines, particularly \nthose losses that had been incurred as a result of the Federal action.\n  Of course it is a complicated issue because some of these airlines \nwere facing difficult financial situations at best and those adverse \nsituations were accelerated because of the actions of the Federal \nGovernment. But no one questions or doubts that the actions taken by \nthe FAA and Department of Transportation were in the national interest. \nNo one questions that. So we have a responsibility to address that.\n  In a matter of really 2 or 3 days here in the Senate we took action, \nsome $15 billion to make sure the airline industry was going to be \npreserved and that there were a range of different financial supports \nfor the airline industry. As a result, we took care of an industry and \nwe took care of management personnel, but we failed, in a very serious \nway, to take care of the workers in that industry who were just as \nadversely impacted as those who fly the planes and the management \npersonnel who supervise the industry, without which the airline \nindustry would not be able to function. These workers were left out and \nleft behind. That was a critical mistake.\n  The Carnahan amendment is an attempt to remedy that mistake. 120,000 \nworkers were directly affected by the decision regarding the airline \nindustry, which is trying to get back on its feet. As a direct result \nof the terrorist attack, those 120,000 workers have lost their jobs--\nthe flight attendants, reservation clerks, baggage handlers, caterers, \nmechanics, those who make the spare parts and those who service and \nclean the aircraft--they would be working today. They would have a \nfuture of some hope and some opportunity. Now 120,000 of them have lost \ntheir jobs. The Carnahan amendment will not restore their jobs, but it \nwill ease the pain that these workers are experiencing by extending \nunemployment compensation, to which they have indirectly contributed, \nmaintaining their health insurance, and maintaining the opportunity for \nsome training for these workers.\n  They lost their jobs, not because they didn't show up for work, not \nbecause they have not worked and had superior job performance over a \nperiod of years--one worker who I met on Sunday night before returning \nto Washington, had worked for the airline for 10 years. Yet they were \ncutting down, people who had worked there for 10 years--she lost her \njob. She had been an outstanding employee.\n  All this amendment is saying is, as we took care of the airline \nindustry, as we took care of the management personnel, let us at least \nshow some consideration for the 120,000 workers.\n\n  We know we have an important responsibility to pass this legislation. \nI am eager to vote for it and support the position of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, in terms of the federalization of these workers at the \nairports. We can get through that today. No one is interested in undue \ndelay.\n  We know we are also going to have the antiterrorism bill which we \nhave every expectation will pass this week. Then we know we will have \nan opportunity to talk about the stimulus package, to try to meet our \nresponsibility to the millions of workers who have been laid off, have \nlost their jobs and are suffering in all parts of our Nation. We have a \nresponsibility to address those needs.\n  The Carnahan amendment basically addresses an issue of fairness. It \nis fairness to the workers. We are saying we took care of the industry \nin those emergency times in a few short days, but we left out the \nworkers. That is unfair. Americans understand fairness. All we are \nsaying, for those particular workers to whom we were unfair at that \ntime when we passed the Airline Security Act, we are going to be fair \nto them to some extent. We are not going to restore their jobs, which \nwould be something they would want and they would be eager to accept, \nbut we are showing we are not forgetting them. That is why this \nCarnahan amendment is so important.\n  We have to speak for those workers. I supported the airline emergency \nlegislation. It was important. But we recognize that at that time, as \nwe were looking at the industry and also focused on the victims, those \nfamilies who had gone through such extraordinary trauma and loss, the \nworkers\n\n[[Page S10490]]\n\nwere left out and left behind. That was wrong. This amendment tries to \nredress that kind of injustice.\n  It is fair. It is sensible. It is responsible. It is a very moderate \namendment in what it tries to do, in terms of the health insurance, \ntraining, and unemployment compensation. It would be wrong for this \nbody to reject that proposal. I am hopeful that we will accept it and \nwill vote on cloture and vote to accept this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time to \ntemporarily set aside the Carnahan amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1861\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to call up amendment No. 1861, \nwhich is at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux] proposed an \n     amendment numbered 1861.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . LESS-THAN-LETHAL WEAPONRY FOR FLIGHT DECK CREWS.\n\n       (a) National Institute of Justice Study.--The National \n     Institute of Justice shall assess the range of less-than-\n     lethal weaponry available for use by a flight deck crewmember \n     temporarily to incapacitate an individual who presents a \n     clear and present danger to the safety of the aircraft, its \n     passengers, or individuals on the ground and report its \n     findings and recommendations to the Secretary of \n     Transportation within 90 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       Section 44903 of title 49, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Authority to Arm Flight Deck Crew with Less-than-\n     lethal Weapons.\n       ``(1) In general.--If the Secretary, after receiving the \n     recommendations of the National Institute of Justice, \n     determines, with the approval of the Attorney General and the \n     Secretary of State, that it is appropriate and necessary and \n     would effectively serve the public interest in avoiding air \n     piracy, the Secretary may authorize members of the flight \n     deck crew on any aircraft providing air transportation or \n     intrastate air transportation to carry a less-than-lethal \n     weapon while the aircraft is engaged in providing such \n     transportation.\n       ``(2) Usage.--If the Secretary grants authority under \n     paragraph (1) for flight deck crew members to carry a less-\n     than-lethal weapon while engaged in providing air \n     transportation or intrastate air transportation, the \n     Secretary shall--\n       ``(A) prescribe rules requiring that any such crew member \n     to trained in the proper use of the weapon; and\n       ``(B) prescribe guidelines setting forth the circumstances \n     under which such weapons may be used.''.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, it is absolutely, critically important \nthat the bill before the Senate pass and be signed into law, and that \nit be passed and signed into law as quickly as possible.\n  One of the biggest concerns the American public have, ever since the \ntragic day of September 11, is the fear of getting back into airplanes \nin safety. That, certainly, by any measure, is an understandable fear.\n  If you look at some of the incidents that have occurred, even since \nSeptember 11, you see a greater degree of concern than we have ever had \nsince the Wright Brothers started flying airplanes about airplane \nsafety.\n  Yesterday a plane had to make an emergency landing in Shreveport, LA, \nbecause of a disturbed, deranged passenger. We saw just a couple of \ndays ago a passenger breaking into the cockpit of a commercial \nairliner--again a deranged passenger, not necessarily connected with \nany terrorist incident.\n  But all of this points to the fact that we can no longer do business \nas usual when it comes to airline security and safety. Our surface \ntransportation subcommittee of the Commerce Committee, which I am \nprivileged to chair, is also looking at the safety and security of not \nonly airplanes, but also whether it is safe to ride on Amtrak passenger \ntrains, whether it is safe to take a trip on a passenger cruise line \nwith literally thousands of working people and crew on those ships as \nwell as, literally, thousands of passengers. So all modes of \ntransportation are being looked at as we have never before done in the \nhistory of this country. And that is good.\n  This Congress, in a bipartisan way so far, has been able to respond \nto those threats, has been able to produce legislation in a timely \nfashion, like the bill of the chairman, Senator Hollings, that is \nbefore the Senate today. In a bipartisan fashion it says we are no \nlonger going to be lackadaisical about airline security.\n  We are no longer going to give the job of making sure airlines are \nsecure to the low bidder. We are not going to be worried about who can \ndo it the cheapest but rather who can do it the best.\n  That is what this bill before the Senate, which I strongly support, \nis all about. It is must-do legislation, and it should be done as \nquickly as possible.\n  Along with that debate, a lot of people have made various suggestions \nabout how we can further secure the flying public on airlines.\n  Some have suggested that every airline should have air marshals \naboard. I think that is a good suggestion--people who are trained in \norder to prevent hijacking or disturbing the operations of the plane.\n  Some have suggested we ought to arm the pilot, the copilot, and the \nnavigator, if there is one on a particular plane, so they can protect \nthe cockpit.\n  Actually, I think the best way to protect the cockpit is to seal it \noff. If you can't get into the cockpit from the back of the plane, the \nplane cannot be hijacked to a different location. I think it is just \nthat simple.\n  The security of the cockpit door so that it is completely \ninaccessible from the back of the cabin, unless the pilot and the \ncopilot want it to be, is absolutely essential. This bill would allow \nthat to occur. That is a degree of safety that is very important.\n  Others have argued that the pilot and the copilot should be armed. I \ndo not know if they want to arm them with AK-47s or .38 or .45 pistols \nor rifles or shotguns. But they have suggested various methods to arm \nthe crew of a plane with lethal weapons that could be used in the event \nof a disturbance by passengers who are intent on bringing down the \naircraft or doing bodily harm to the people on the plane. I think that \ngoes a little further than I think most Members of Congress are willing \nto go.\n\n  Obviously, if you have lethal weapons in a plane, a number of things \ncan happen. Just like when you throw a ball at a football game, only \ntwo things can happen: You can complete the pass, or have an \ninterception; or, possibly three: You can have an incompleted pass. \nOnly one of those is good for your team.\n  When you arm the cockpit, a number of things can happen. Many of them \nare not good: You can have those weapons get into the hands of the \nhijackers themselves. You can have those weapons do bodily damage to \npassengers or kill them on the plane, by mistake or by accident. Or you \ncan have a lethal weapon with a high-powered bullet actually penetrate \nthe skin of the airplane, causing decompression of the airplane and \ncausing it to be in a very precarious position and in danger of \ncrashing and killing everyone on the plane.\n  A lot of bad, unintended things can happen if you arm the pilot and \nthe crew with lethal weapons on the plane.\n  Therefore, my amendment simply says that we want to take a look at \nother types of weapons which would be nonlethal and which also could be \neffective in disarming people who are intent on bringing down or \nhijacking the plane, thereby providing greater security to the captain \nand the copilot of the plane.\n  My amendment is relatively very simple. It requires the Institute of \nJustice to assess the range of nonlethal weapons for use by flight deck \ncrew members that could temporarily incapacitate an individual who \npresents a clear and present danger to that aircraft and present those \nfindings to the Secretary of Transportation within 90 days.\n  If the Secretary--after they get that recommendation and after it has \nbeen carefully considered--determines that nonlethal weapons are \nappropriate and necessary and would effectively serve the public \ninterest, then the Secretary\n\n[[Page S10491]]\n\nmay authorize the flight deck crew in an airliner to carry that less-\nthan-lethal weapon while the airline is engaged in providing \ntransportation.\n  If the Secretary makes the determination that they want to go \nforward, the Secretary must prescribe the rules the crew members have \nto follow. And they also have to establish the rules that require the \ncrew members be in fact trained in the proper use of the weapon and \nprecise guidelines as to when those weapons can be used.\n  It is very interesting. I am sure the Presiding Officer, with his \nmilitary background, has seen a lot of different weapons that are \nlethal and nonlethal, of course.\n  On the nonlethal weapons, I had a demonstration in my office. It is \nanother story about how they got the nonlethal weapons into my office. \nThey said they did not have much of a problem at all. They walked in \nwith a suitcase full of very curious weapons and said they were \nbringing them to show me. And they got right in. I guess they were \nproperly checked and that security was followed. I hope so.\n  The members of the Justice Department brought in a whole array of \nwhat they call nonlethal weapons that are available under current \ntechnology. They range from electronic shock weapons to stun guns. The \nbrand name is Tasers. They are really interesting. They can \nincapacitate a person by merely touching them with the weapon. The new \nstun guns can actually deliver an electric shock to a disturbed or a \nterrorist individual from a distance of up to about 20 feet and \nincapacitate them with the stun gun in order for people to take control \nof those individuals while they are knocked semiconscious, not killing \nthem but certainly incapacitating them so you can again control of the \nairplane. These are effective.\n\n  The technology is proven technology. And we are saying that the \nDepartment of Justice and the National Institute of Justice, which does \nthat type of work within the Justice Department, should evaluate the \npotential for using these types of stun guns on airplanes. I think they \ncan be very effective weapons in incapacitating someone who is trying \nto take over the airplane without doing deadly harm to other passengers \nand without danger of penetrating the walls of the airplane, \ndecompressing the airplane, and causing severe problems.\n  These weapons can work. But I don't think I know enough about them--\nand I dare say most Members don't know enough about them--as to whether \nthey can really be used on the airplane. That is why I am calling for \nthis study and to report back to the Congress to let us know what they \nare doing. When the Secretary gets that report, he can authorize it if \nhe thinks it is appropriate.\n  Other items that are nonlethal in addition to the stun guns are what \nthey call chemical incapacitants, which is a fancy name for basically \nthe pepper-spray-type system, which looks like a handgun or a pistol \nand shoots these little pellets that contain various pepper \ningredients. They are very small.\n  When these pepper spray dispersants shoot these little pellets, they \nwill hit the person in the chest. They don't break or explode \nviolently, but they will burst open and spray the person who has been \nhit with it with a pepper-type ingredient which will incapacitate them \ntemporarily and sufficiently to allow people to take control of that \nindividual.\n  The anesthetizing darts are nonlethal projectiles which can \nanesthetize someone and incapacitate them at the same time. It is a \nlittle dart that cannot penetrate the cabin, but a dart would penetrate \nthe individual to anesthetize and incapacitate them.\n  There are little things called impact projectiles, which are airfoil \nprojectiles. They are hard plastic projectiles. If you get hit with \nthem, you are going to get knocked down and not be able to continue \ndoing what you were doing before you were hit by them; I guarantee it.\n  There are disabling devices called dazzling-laser-light devices, \nwhich are sort of interesting. They showed me these weapons in my \noffice. You can hit a person in the face with this laser light, and the \ncloser they come to the weapon, or the laser light, the less they can \nsee because it really hits them with a laser light that absolutely \ntemporarily blinds and they cannot see. This is a Flash Gordon-type of \nweapon that can incapacitate someone. It has a lot of possibilities.\n  Finally, physical entanglement devices: This is a small projectile \nthat actually sends out a net. I have seen it used in wildlife reserves \nwhen wildlife officials try to capture a wild animal. This net covers \nthe animal and allows the people to catch the animal for whatever \npurpose they are trying to catch it. It does not harm the animal, but \nit certainly incapacitates it. These same types of systems can be used \nin a plane and be very effective.\n\n  I do not know that any of these are the answer, but I do suspect one, \nor a combination of some of them, would be effective for the pilot, for \nthe copilot, or for members of the flight crew, to give them extra \nprotection.\n  I do not want to make a decision today in this Chamber that one of \nthese is the best. That is why this amendment simply says we would \nrequire the Institute of Justice, within the Department of Justice, to \nassess the range of these weapons, and within 90 days--it is not going \nto take that long--to give a report to the Secretary of Transportation \non their findings of whether one is good, one is better, one is not so \ngood, or whether none of them is good, and make that recommendation to \nthe Secretary.\n  Under my amendment, if the Secretary, after getting those \nrecommendations, determines, with the approval of the Attorney \nGeneral--and I have the approval of the Secretary of State--that it is \nappropriate and necessary and would effectively serve the public \ninterest, then the Secretary can authorize the members of the flight \ndeck to carry less-than-lethal weapons on board. I think it is in \nkeeping with the chairman's desire to protect the passengers and crew.\n  This is a good bill. It should not be delayed. We should do it this \nweek. It will be the added security that the American flying public \nwill have, to give them the guarantee that, in fact, it is absolutely \ntotally safe to get back in our planes to fly to whatever destination \nsafely, and secure in the knowledge that everything has been done to \nprotect them and the crew. I hope my colleagues will be in a position \nto realize this is the correct approach.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Louisiana, \nSenator Breaux, for his thoughtful presentation.\n  The chief pilot of all the pilots of El Al, in his testimony, asked \nfor stun guns at that particular time. I know there has been a \nsuggestion about a Colt .45. I carried one of those for 3 years-plus, \nand other weaponry, in combat. But you do not want anybody with a Colt \n.45 on a plane. The distinguished Presiding Officer, as a great West \nPoint graduate, knows you are liable to hit what you want to hit, but \nthen the bullet could go through and ricochet around and hit two or \nthree other people. That is just too much firepower.\n  This particular approach is deliberate and thoughtful. I would be \nready to accept it on behalf of our side. We are checking with Senator \nMcCain and the other side right now to see what they desire. There \ncould be further debate. I heard a moment ago that another Senator \nwishes to address the subject.\n  Let me commend Senator Breaux for his leadership in this particular \nregard because this can be analyzed. Obviously, the Senators cannot \nanalyze everything that is necessary to give the proper security. There \nis no doubt that some kind of added protection would be in order.\n  For my part, of course, when we close that secure cockpit door, we \nhave pilots to fly, not to fight. So it is that even then, with a stun \ngun, fine, all right, so they cannot really kill someone, but even that \nwould not be necessary in this Senator's view. But whatever the \ndecision of the body is on this particular score, it seems to me that \nthe Senator from Louisiana is on the right track.\n  It can be studied, analyzed, and provided for with this particular \napproach--not just for us, for wanting to have done something, to say, \nwell, we\n\n[[Page S10492]]\n\nare going to authorize a .45 caliber pistol or a Thompson submachine \ngun or an M-1, or anything else of that particular kind. We have to be \nfar, far more careful in some of the security initiatives that we have \nundertaken.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator. We will check with our colleague \nwho wants to be heard on this matter. Pending that, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in urging the adoption of the Breaux \namendment, there is one colleague at the memorial exercise who would \nwant to be heard and perhaps have an amendment. The adoption of the \nBreaux amendment will not forgo any consideration he may have, if he \nthinks it is an improvement. I wanted to say that publicly because we \nare not trying, on the one hand, to disregard the desire of all of us \nto be at that memorial service and at the same time overriding the duty \nwe have here on the floor to move this legislation.\n  In that light, I then urge the adoption of the Breaux amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate? If not, \nthe question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1861) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set \naside the Daschle-Carnahan amendment so that we can consider both the \nInouye and the Rockefeller amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1865\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, \nMr. Inouye, has an amendment that I send to the desk and ask the clerk \nto report.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for Mr. \n     Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 1865.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of Transportation to grant waivers \n for restrictions on air transportation of freight, mail, and medical \n  supplies, personnel, and patients to, from, and within States with \n  extraordinary air transportation needs or concerns during national \n                              emergencies)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . MAIL AND FREIGHT WAIVERS.\n\n       During a national emergency affecting air transportation or \n     intrastate air transportation, the Secretary of \n     Transportation, after consultation with the Aviation Security \n     Coordination Council, may grant a complete or partial waiver \n     of any restrictions on the carriage by aircraft of freight, \n     mail, emergency medical supplies, personnel, or patients on \n     aircraft, imposed by the Department of Transportation (or \n     other Federal agency or department) that would permit such \n     carriage of freight, mail, emergency medical supplies, \n     personnel, or patients on flights, to, from, or within States \n     with extraordinary air transportation needs or concerns if \n     the Secretary determines that the waiver is in the public \n     interest, taking into consideration the isolation of and \n     dependence on air transportation of such States. The \n     Secretary may impose reasonable limitations on any such \n     waivers.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this particular amendment has to do with \nwaiver authority. At the time of the terrorism of 9/11, there were body \nparts in flight and prepared for flight in Hawaii to be used, of \ncourse, in life-saving organ operations. It was pointed out that those \nparticular operations had to be stalled and set aside. This measure \nwill provide emergency power to the Secretary to make a waiver for this \nreason in case planes have to be grounded, as was properly done on 9/\n11.\n  I urge for the adoption of that amendment. It has been cleared on \nboth sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate? If not, \nthe question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1865) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n             Amendments Nos. 1866, 1867, and 1868, en bloc\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, with respect to the three Rockefeller \namendments, one has to do with safety and security of onboard supplies \nthat the flight personnel and pilots are concerned with.\n  The other Rockefeller amendment has to do with property and \npassengers. We have prescribed, everyone can see it on page 18 of the \nmanagers' amendment, whereby every bit of passenger luggage, cargo, and \nproperty will be screened. This provision would guarantee that all \nobjects are checked, as I read it, by adding language on page 18, \ninsert ``cargo, carry-on, and checked baggage, other articles.'' The \nother articles would be anything else. So there would be no dispute on \nthat particular amendment.\n  With the third amendment, the reference is to the Secretary ensuring \nthat the training curriculum is developed in consultation with Federal \nlaw enforcement. The Federal law enforcement has the expertise \nnecessary. We want to make sure of this. The distinguished Senator and \nchairman of our Aviation Subcommittee, the Senator from West Virginia, \nMr. Rockefeller, wants to make sure of it.\n  I send these three amendments to the desk and ask the clerk to report \neach.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for Mr. \n     Rockefeller, proposes amendments en bloc numbered 1866, 1867, \n     and 1868.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1866\n\n(Purpose: To establish minimum requirements for the antihijack training \n                              curriculum)\n\n       On page 17, line 16, after the period insert ``The \n     Secretary shall ensure that the training curriculum is \n     developed in consultation with Federal law enforcement \n     agencies with expertise in terrorism, self-defense, hijacker \n     psychology, and current threat conditions.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1867\n\n  (Purpose: To require screening of carry-on and checked baggage and \n               other articles carried aboard an aircraft)\n\n       On page 17, line 23, insert ``AND PROPERTY'' after \n     ``PASSENGER''.\n       On page 18, line 5, after ``mail,'' insert ``cargo, carry-\n     on and checked baggage, and other articles,''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1868\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that supplies carried aboard an aircraft are safe \n                              and secure)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SAFETY AND SECURITY OF ON-BOARD SUPPLIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Transportation shall \n     establish procedures to ensure the safety and integrity of \n     all supplies, including catering and passenger amenities, \n     placed aboard aircraft providing passenger air transportation \n     or intrastate air transportation.b)\n       (b) Measures.--In carrying out subsection (a), the \n     Secretary may require--\n       (1) security procedures for supplies and their facilities;\n       (2) the sealing of supplies to ensure easy visual detection \n     of tampering; and\n       (3) the screening of personnel, vehicles, and supplies \n     entering secured areas of the airport or used in servicing \n     aircraft.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield to the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of each of the \nthree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, without \nobjection, the amendments are agreed to en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1866, 1867, and 1868) were agreed to.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair. They have been cleared on both \nsides.\n\n[[Page S10493]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1855\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak to the \nCarnahan amendment. As everyone knows, the vote will be cast in a \ncouple of hours. Today, it is 1 month since the terrorist attacks on \nAmerica. In the days following September 11, we saw unbearable loss and \nunmatched heroism.\n  Now, as we take on those who perpetrated these attacks abroad, we \nhave the opportunity--we have the duty--to prevent the economic \naftereffects from rippling farther outward here at home.\n  For America's aviation workers and their families, the economic \nimpact of the crisis is real, it is immediate, and it is devastating. \nEvery day we see more reports of more layoffs. It is now estimated that \n150,000 workers have lost their jobs in the airline industry alone. \nMany of these workers and their families have no income and no health \ninsurance. What they face is not a recession; for them, it is a \ndepression.\n  I think we all agree it was right for Congress to act quickly to \nstabilize the airline industry. It is long past the time for us, \nhowever, to help those aviation workers who got no help from that bill \nwe passed a couple of weeks ago. That is what the Carnahan amendment \nwould do. It is a fair, balanced, and temporary package of assistance \nto aviation workers.\n  There are those who say helping workers isn't relevant to this bill. \nSome are suggesting that we should again put off helping those working \nfamilies. Let me ask you, how could you possibly say to 150,000 \nworkers, who had good jobs one day and no jobs the next, that they are \nnot relevant? How could you possibly tell 150,000 people, whose \nfamilies have lost their source of income and, in many cases, their \nhealth care, that they should wait a little longer?\n\n  This is not a vote about relevance or timing. Let's be very clear \nabout what this vote is. A vote against cloture is a vote against \n150,000 aviation workers who lost their jobs as a direct result of the \nSeptember 11 attacks. It is a vote against giving workers unemployment \ninsurance. It is a vote against helping those workers and their \nfamilies maintain health insurance. It is a vote against giving workers \nwho lost their jobs training so they can find new jobs that will allow \nthem to support themselves and their families.\n  A month ago today, America suffered the worst terrorist attack in all \nof history. All over the country, people are remembering the more than \n6,000 innocent men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day. \nWe need to remember that the people who died on September 11 were the \nterrorists' first victims. They were not their last. There are hundreds \nof thousands of other Americans who didn't lose their lives, but they \ndid lose their livelihoods. They are the economic victims of the \nSeptember 11 attack.\n  Right now, they are looking to us for help. They don't expect this \nCongress to solve all their problems. All they want is a little help to \nmake it through one of the worst times in their lives.\n  Just days after September 11, when we passed that $15 billion airline \nbailout package, many of us wanted, even then, to include this help for \ndisplaced workers; but we were told: ``This is not the time. There will \nbe another chance soon. We are going to consider an airline security \nbill. We can help the workers then.''\n  We reluctantly agreed to wait because we were told if we didn't get \nthat airline bill done that Friday, the airlines would be grounded on \nMonday and we would see hundreds of thousands of additional workers out \nof work. So we passed that bill to keep our airlines flying, and keep \nthose workers working.\n  After a week of delay, we are finally debating that airline security \nbill. Now what are we hearing? ``This is not the time. There is another \nbill coming, an economic stimulus package. We can help workers then.'' \nIt is always ``then.'' It is never ``now.''\n  Senator Carnahan and others have put together a good, fair, \naffordable, and extremely limited assistance package for these workers. \nThey have been remarkably flexible. They have made concession after \nconcession. They have compromised and they have compromised.\n  They have cut the costs of the package by more than $1 billion. They \nhave done everything anyone can do to build bipartisan support for this \npackage.\n  It is time for Congress to show its commitment not only to the \nairline industry, but also to its workers. The time has come to move \nthis package. We must not put these workers on hold yet again.\n  This issue is about values. We all espouse the importance of values. \nI have heard those speeches countless times here in the Senate Chamber \nhow we hold our values so dear. Of all those values, I do not know of a \nvalue of greater import than the value of family, than the value of \nensuring that we, as Americans, help one another. We built a country on \nthose values--values of family, values of neighbor helping neighbor. \nThis, too, is about values.\n  This is about preserving the integrity and the economic viability of \nthose families who are the economic victims of September 11. This is \nabout the values of people helping people in this country in a time of \nneed.\n  The response since September 11th has been remarkable. Our country \nhas responded in ways that make me proud to be an American. To watch \nthose rescuers climb that rubble in the days following the attacks, as \nI did, to watch those Red Cross workers come to the site and work 20, \n22-hour days as I did, to see people all over the country respond by \nputting up their flags, as they have, and, yes, to see Congress work \ntogether as closely as we have now for these last 4 weeks, makes me \nproud.\n  How sad it would be if we say, yes, we will help New York; yes, we \nwill help the airlines; yes, we will try to do as many things as \npossible to put this country right again, but we will say no to those \naviation workers.\n  Does that reflect our values? Is that in keeping with what we have \ndone for these last 4 weeks? I do not think so.\n  I mentioned the word ``hope.'' The one thing we need to do, above and \nbeyond anything else in our capacity as leaders in this country, is to \ngive people hope. They need a reason for hope. That is what we are \ntalking about this morning. That is why it is important we allow this \nlegislation to pass. That is why we have to vote for cloture.\n  I hope every Member of this Senate, when they vote on cloture this \nafternoon, will imagine themselves sitting in the living room of one of \nthose unemployed families. You are sitting in the armchair, and they \nare sitting on the sofa across the room, and they are asking you to \nvote. I would like you to look in their eyes and say no. No one could \ndo that.\n  We have to look in their eyes in that living room. We have to say: We \nunderstand all of your anxiety and all of your pain and all of the \neconomic concern you have for your family. And then we must say, in the \ncontext of values, and in the belief that neighbor helps neighbor in \nthis country, we are going to help you, just as we helped the airlines, \njust as we, indeed, needed to help the people of New York. We are going \nto give you hope. We are going to say yes to you, too.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of \nS. 1447, the Aviation Security Act. I, first of all, extend my \nappreciation to the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator \nHollings, for the brilliant work he has done on this matter, and to the \nranking member, Senator McCain, for his persistence and ability\n\n[[Page S10494]]\n\nto work as a team with Senator Hollings.\n  I see in the Chamber today somebody who has worked hard on this \nmeasure, and that is the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison. She also \nhas done an outstanding job in working on a bipartisan basis to make \nsure airports are safe. I appreciate her help.\n  This bill is crucial to enhance aviation safety. It is critical, in \nfact, to enhance aviation safety and security for America, for the \nState of Nevada, for the State of Nebraska, for all States. This \nAviation Security Act represents a well-crafted bill that provides a \nmodern and effective aviation security program for our country.\n  This bill establishes, among other things, a Deputy Secretary for \nAviation Security within the Department of Transportation; it mandates \ncockpit doors and locks to protect our flight crews. This is not \nsomething that is a choice; it is mandatory. And it federalizes airport \nscreening of passengers and cargo.\n  This is so important. We have a system that is unique to this country \nwhere we have airlines putting out to the lowest bidder the job of \nprotecting and ensuring our safety. It does not work. We all have been \nthrough airport security around the country. We know they are well-\nmeaning people, but their average term of employment is 90 days, and \nthen they are off doing something else. They are not trained well, they \nare not paid well, and they do not do a good job, as hard as they might \ntry.\n  Democrats and Republicans alike have drawn the same conclusions: We \nmust pass this very important legislation to protect the traveling \nAmerican public. Why? Because we need to get America flying and flying \na lot again.\n  The airline industry is a key component in our Nation's economy. My \nState is very dependent on our Nation's air transportation system. \nMcCarran Airport in Las Vegas provided service for 34 million \npassengers last year. That is a lot of people. We expected more to come \nthis year. We hope that still will be the case.\n  We are building another airport terminal. We are building a new \nairport in Las Vegas, one of the few places in the country where a new \nairport is being built. We received permission from Congress to use \nFederal land to build another airport about 35 miles outside of Las \nVegas. That is now being done. So the airline industry is a key \ncomponent of our Nation's economy. It is a key component of Nevada's \neconomy.\n  The legislation we are considering today will bring our airport \nsecurity system into the new century by reducing the risks that a \ncommercial airliner will again be turned into a weapon of mass \ndestruction. This is a goal on which we can all agree. This can never \nhappen again.\n  I stress to my colleagues the need for this aviation security \nlegislation is widely supported by the American people, and we must \nmove forward now. The bill we are considering will allow the United \nStates to move forward and provide our Nation the aviation security \nthat is necessary to address this new century. It is a good bill for \nAmerica.\n  This bill, we understand, is controversial in some people's minds. \nOne of the reasons it is controversial is the amendment upon which we \nare going to vote at 1:35 p.m. today, and that is the Carnahan \namendment. I applaud Senator Carnahan for her work on this legislation.\n  No one better among us can ever understand the loss in New York than \nSenator Carnahan, whose husband and son were killed in an airplane \ncrash a short time ago. I am sure Senator Carnahan, being the sensitive \nperson she is, was compelled to offer this legislation because she \nbetter understands how people feel after a loss such as this.\n  What does her amendment do? Her amendment would provide financial \nassistance, training, and health care coverage to employees of the \naviation industry who lost or will lose their jobs as a result of the \nattack on September 11. The benefits would be distributed within the \nframework created by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. Based on \npreliminary estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, the cost is \nexpected to be $2.8 billion, but this amendment is pared down. As the \nmajority leader said, in an effort to work this through the process, we \nhave pared this down, and rightfully so. It is not the full amount \nneeded, but it certainly will be a tremendous shot in the arm for these \npeople.\n  Who is eligible? Employees of airlines, commercial aircraft \nmanufacturers, suppliers of airlines, and airports. Only those \nemployees who lose their jobs as a direct result of the attacks on \nSeptember 11, or security measures taken in response to the attacks as \ndetermined by the Secretary of Labor, will be eligible.\n  What are the benefits we are begging the Senate to approve? Provide \nan additional 52 weeks of unemployment insurance to people who no \nlonger are working as a result of this incident. Fifty-two weeks of \nunemployment insurance benefits and training for those workers who lose \ntheir jobs. This training would allow workers who have permanently lost \ntheir jobs to receive income assistance and training to assist them in \nmoving into a new industry or job.\n  There is also a provision to supplement unemployment insurance gaps; \nthat is, provide 26 weeks of unemployment insurance-like benefits for \nthose workers who would not otherwise qualify for unemployment \ninsurance. They were working but maybe they had not worked long enough \nto qualify. This would include workers who have been recently hired, \nwho had been working less than 6 months, part-time workers, low-wage \nworkers, and workers with intermittent employment; for example, single \nparents who have had to take time off to care for their children.\n  This legislation would provide Federal reimbursement of COBRA health \ninsurance premiums for eligible workers for up to 18 months and provide \nStates the option to provide medicaid coverage for those workers who do \nnot qualify for COBRA benefits. This would include new hires, low-wage, \npart-time, or intermittent workers as well as those workers whose \nemployers did not provide health insurance or are independent \ncontractors; for example, workers who load luggage or other cargo on \nthe planes.\n  This legislation is important for the country, and this specific \namendment is important for people who have been directly hurt, harmed, \nand damaged by this terrible act of September 11. People who step down \ninto the well of this Chamber to vote should understand today this is \nmore than political philosophy. It is a philosophy directed to say that \nthis country cares, this country is concerned and wants to help those \npeople who have been directly impacted, workers who have been directly \nimpacted as a result of this incident of September 11.\n  I hope everyone will vote to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, A also rise as a cosponsor of the \nCarnahan amendment to help those who are most hurt by the economic \nimpact of the terrorist attacks of September: the unemployed airline \nand airplane manufacture workers.\n  Thousands of American workers have lost their jobs during this \neconomic downturn. These workers need our help. That's why we need to \nact quickly on a robust stimulus package targeted at workers.\n  No workers have been hit as hard as those in the airline and aviation \nindustry; 140,000 thousand of these workers have been laid off since \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11. Unemployment is steadily rising. \nLast week the largest number of people in 9 years filed for \nunemployment, over 528,000 people. That's nearly the population of \nBaltimore City; 650,000 people live in Baltimore.\n  These are the pilots, the flight attendants, the baggage handlers, \nthe concessionaires, and the aircraft builders. These workers have: \nlost their paychecks, lost their health care and could lose their \nhomes. They need help immediately, just as we've helped their former \nemployers with a $15 billion stabilization package of grants and loan \nguarantees.\n\n[[Page S10495]]\n\n  I am confident that the airline industry and the U.S. economy will \nrecover; But help is needed today. How would the Carnahan amendment \nhelp the airline workers?\n  Senator Carnahan's amendment would provide financial assistance, \ntraining, and health care coverage to employees of the airline industry \nwho lose their jobs as a result of the attacks on September 11, 2001.\n  The Carnahan amendment would provide income support by extending the \nnumber of weeks eligible individuals can receive unemployment insurance \nfrom 26 weeks to 79 weeks. That's a year and a half. These cash \npayments would not create a strain on state budgets because they would \nbe funded entirely by the Federal Government.\n  For many workers do not meet their States' requirements for \nunemployment insurance would not be left out. They would receive 26 \nweeks of federally financed unemployment insurance.\n  Some workers may not return to their jobs within the airline \nindustry. These people would be eligible for retraining benefits. \nOthers may find alternative jobs within the airline industry. These \nworkers would be eligible for training to upgrade their skills.\n  The amendment would enable laid off workers to keep their health care \nby expanding the COBRA program which helps people who've lost their \njobs to keep their health insurance. The amendment enables the Federal \nGovernment to fully reimburse for COBRA premiums. Yet about half of \nthose who lose their jobs are not eligible for COBRA, so the amendment \nwould make these families eligible for Medicaid for up to 18 months, \nwith the Federal Government covering 100 percent of the premiums.\n  I strongly support the Carnahan amendment. It's a thoughtful and \ncomprehensive airline workers relief package. It's a good starting \npoint to address the needs of working families. It also provides a good \nmodel for a broader economic stimulus package that Congress should \nconsider soon.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Carnahan \namendment.\n  All of America was shaken by the horrendous events of September 11. \nAmerica's heart still aches for the thousands of people who lost their \nlives and whose lives have been altered permanently in one way or \nanother.\n  And now, as we watch America valiantly begin to recover, we are just \nstarting to realize the economic impact of this terrible tragedy. As we \nare all too well aware, people are losing their jobs and futures are at \nrisk.\n  I cannot imagine living through the tremendous stress of the past \nseveral weeks only to be told that I have now lost my job or I am being \nlaid off because my company cannot afford to keep running at full \nspeed. Unfortunately, the numbers of layoffs are increasing and the \nunemployment rate is trending upward.\n  One of the industries hardest hit by the economic downturn is the \nairline industry. In the short span of just a few weeks, hundreds of \nthousands of workers at airlines, airports, aircraft manufacturers and \nat the companies that supply the airlines, have lost their jobs. \nWorkers from commonly known companies like Boeing, Pratt and Whitney, \nAmerican and United Airlines, to name but a few, are losing their jobs \nand being laid off, their futures are less than certain.\n  The effects have been devastating. Hundreds of thousands of men and \nwomen who support the airline industry are losing their family's \nprimary source of income and health insurance.\n  But we can help. We can lend a helping hand to the thousands of \ndisplaced workers at these companies. We can restore their hope. We can \nmake a difference.\n  That is why I support and I ask my colleagues to support Senator \nCarnahan's displaced worker relief amendment. This amendment would \nprovide income support, job training and health care benefits for those \nairline industry workers affected by the aftermath of the events of \nSeptember 11. It would extend State unemployment benefits to provide \nincome, establish job re-training or job upgrade benefits to those who \npermanently lose their jobs in the airline industry, and provide \ncritical health care coverage for the workers and their families. These \ninitiatives will go a long way to restore the economic security of \nairline industry workers and their families.\n  No one expected the events of September 11, and no one envisioned \nthese terrible events would have such devastating repercussions in our \ncountry's most critical transportation industry. I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment and help airline industry workers get back on \ntheir feet and back to work.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of the \nCarnahan amendment to provide much needed assistance to airline \nindustry employees.\n  Almost a month later, we are still sorting through the aftermath of \nSeptember 11th. Thousands of people from New York and New Jersey were \namong those lost or injured on that terrible day. And now thousands \nmore across the country are beginning to feel the economic impact of \nthe tragedy.\n  A few weeks ago, this Congress did the right thing when we passed \nlegislation to help the airline industry. As a result of the attacks, \nthe airlines lost billions of dollars in the days that planes were \ngrounded.\n  And so many people have decided not to fly, the airlines have cut the \nnumber of flights by 20 percent since September 11th.\n  In my State, that has meant 300 fewer daily flights out of Newark \nInternational Airport.\n  This Nation's economy depends on healthy airlines to keep people and \ngoods moving, and Congress was right to help.\n  And now this Congress must continue to do right by passing this \namendment to help the people who work for the airlines and related \nindustries who have lost their jobs and health insurance as a result of \nthis slowdown.\n  So far, more than 140,000 airline industry workers across the nation \nhave lost their jobs and their healthcare. Virtually all of the \nairlines have laid off workers:\n  American Airlines--20,000 people; United Airlines--20,000 people; \nDelta Airlines--13,000 people; US Airways--11,000 people; Continental \nAirlines--11,000 people; Northwest Airlines--10,000 people; America \nWest--2,000 people; Midway--1,700 people; and American Trans Air--1,500 \npeople.\n  Airlines are a crucial employer in my state, more than 19,000 people \nin New Jersey are employed by the major airlines. Continental Airlines \nhas one of its hubs at Newark International Airport.\n  But just a few weeks ago, 2,000 of those Continental workers at \nNewark were laid off.\n  And it is not just airline workers who are feeling the cuts. The \npeople who provide the meal services and run the airport concessions \nhave also suffered thousands of lay-offs.\n  We cannot continue to delay. We must pass this amendment to help \nthese workers who have bills to pay and children to care for but who \ndon't know where they will be getting their next paycheck.\n  This amendment provides critical assistance in three ways.\n  Income support: Under current law, laid-off workers are eligible for \n26 weeks of State unemployment insurance. Under this amendment, they \nwould be eligible for an additional 20 weeks of federal benefits.\n  Training: No one knows when these airline jobs will come back or in \nwhat other industries these laid-off workers will find work. Under this \namendment, individuals who did not return to the airline industry would \nbe eligible for retraining benefits; those who find alternative jobs \nwithin the airline industry would be eligible for upgrade training.\n  Health Care: For up to a year, the Federal Government would fully \nreimburse eligible individuals for their COBRA premiums. Individuals \nwho do not qualify for COBRA and are otherwise uninsured would be \neligible for Medicaid, with the Federal Government covering 100 percent \nof the premiums.\n  We have waited long enough. It is time to make good on our obligation \nto provide for the airline industry workers who have lost their jobs \nand health care. I urge passage of the Carnahan amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this Nation is still reeling from the \nhorrific events of September 11. During the past month, our country has \ncome together to mourn those we have lost, to\n\n[[Page S10496]]\n\nhelp those who have been injured, and to comfort the many families \ninvolved. We continue to honor those who rushed selflessly to the aid \nof the victims and those who still work tirelessly in the rubble. We \nsupport our men and women in uniform who are making a bold strike \nagainst terrorism half the world away.\n  The ripple effects of the terrorist attacks of one month ago are \nbeing felt across the country. One of those effects is the tightening \nof security measures around the country, perhaps most visibly at our \nNation's airports. I commend the thousands of National Guard personnel \nwho are patrolling our airports, including seven airports in Wisconsin.\n  The impact that these vicious attacks have had on the airline \nindustry is undeniable. There is certainly a legitimate need to provide \nsome kind of assistance to our Nation's airlines in this time of \ncrisis, and for that reason I supported the airline relief package that \nthe Senate adopted last month.\n  But this assistance should not stop at the board room door. We should \nnot forget about airline employees and their families, including many \nWisconsinites. In the past month, more than 100,000 layoffs have been \nannounced by the airlines, and thousands more workers in related \nindustries have been or will be laid off in the coming months. These \nmassive layoffs are a double blow to an already shocked country.\n  Midwest Express Airlines, which is based in Oak Creek WI, has \nannounced that it will lay off 450 workers, or 12 percent of its work \nforce. Another Wisconsin-based airline, Air Wisconsin of Appleton, \nwhich is affiliated with United Airlines, has announced 300 layoffs, or \n10 percent of its workforce.\n  These airline workers are not just statistics. They are our \nneighbors, our friends, and our constituents. It is past time that we \nact to ensure that those who work for our Nation's airlines and their \nfamilies receive adequate relief, including continued access to health \ncare and unemployment and job training assistance. The amendment \noffered by the Senator from Missouri, Mrs. Carnahan, will provide these \nworkers with this crucial assistance.\n  I disagree with the argument that this amendment is not relevant to \nthe underlying airport security legislation. The financial well-being \nof all Americans is a vital part of our national security.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on the Carnahan amendment \nand to support its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I say to our colleagues who have \nsuggestions or amendments on this bill, that we want to encourage them \nto come down because we have the cloture vote on the Carnahan amendment \nscheduled, and once that is disposed of we hope we can move to the \nrelevant amendments that people have to offer and finish this bill \ntoday.\n  I think it is the intention of the majority leader, and the minority \nleader as well, to have an aviation security bill passed today. I think \nwe can do it because we only have a few amendments, and there are \nqualified legitimate differences of opinion and we can take those up \nand go forward. So I hope everybody will come down.\n  What we have is 95-percent agreement on the basics of this bill. The \nCarnahan amendment has a lot of positives, and I think we will pass \nsomething for our airline workers who have been laid off and workers in \nother industries who have been laid off because of the economic \ndownturn. I do not think it should go on this bill because, frankly, I \ndo not think we are ready yet. I do not think we have all of the \nrelevant information we need to know about what is not covered in \nunemployment compensation and COBRA to determine how much the Federal \nGovernment needs to step in. So I hope we would not go to the Carnahan \namendment. I hope we would be able to go to the rest of the bill and \nthe legitimate differences on the aviation security issues so we can \nmove down the road.\n  We will deal with the employees who have been laid off, and it is my \nhope that many of the people who have been laid off in one industry \nwill be able to go into the areas where we know we are going to \nincrease employment. We are going to increase employment in the defense \narea. We are going to increase employment in airline security and \nairport security. That is the bill we are trying to pass right now, \nwhich we think will create many new jobs.\n  The way we are trying to pass this bill is as a quality aviation \nsecurity package that assures we have a qualified workforce to do this \nlaw enforcement responsibility, and we are trying to make sure there is \na clear standard in every airport. We need a uniform standard. That is \nwhy our bill tries to make sure we have screeners who have the \nqualifications and standards that would be required to have this \nuniformity.\n  I think we are making great progress. I am very pleased that we are. \nI hope everybody will cooperate. I hope we can keep extraneous \namendments off, even if they have a lot of merit, because we have not \nfinished passing emergency legislation yet from what happened on \nSeptember 11.\n  Sad to say, we are now memorializing the 1-month anniversary of this \nterrible tragedy to our country, but I would also say we are making \ngreat progress since September 11. We have already passed $40 billion \nin authorization for emergency expenditures to help clean up New York \nand the Pentagon and to help the victims in their earliest needs. We \nhave already allocated money for emergency needs for our Department of \nDefense, and I can not think of anything more relevant and more urgent \nthan the needs of our military today as we know we are in a \nmobilization that is required to win this war on terrorism.\n  We have already allocated the billions of dollars that will be \nrequired for that. At the same time we are also trying to take care of \nthe Afghan people, who are fleeing their homes, by trying to make sure \nwe have humanitarian aid for them.\n  We need to add aviation security as an accomplishment. We need to add \nthe aid to the terrorism bill that gives our intelligence agencies the \ncapabilities they need to continue their extraordinary investigation of \nthe terrorist cells that have tentacles throughout our country and \nthroughout other countries around the world. So I hope the \nantiterrorism bill and the aviation security bill will be passed by the \nSenate this week. We could be very pleased with that accomplishment on \nthe 1-month anniversary of this tragedy. That, coupled with progress on \naviation security and antiterrorism would be the right approach to \ncontinue moving down the road and meeting our responsibility to deal \nwith this emergency.\n\n  What has come out every day since September 11 is the spirit of the \nAmerican people. From the horrible tragedy of September 11, we are \nseeing extraordinary heroism displayed every day by the American \npeople--a spirit seen especially when you go home. I have gone home \nevery single weekend since September 11. The flags are flying in \npeople's homes, the flags are flying in people's businesses, the flags \nare flying on people's cars and people are doing added things for their \nneighbors and friends. All of these things have certainly bonded \nAmericans.\n  In 1 month, we have come of age in our generation. We are dealing \nwith a crisis that has not presented itself to our generation in our \nlive time's, and now we have it. I think we are responding very well. I \nam proud of the progress we are making.\n  I look forward to continuing work on aviation security and \nantiterrorism this week. I hope we will then go on to the economic \nstimulus package, dealing with the displaced employees, for next week's \naccomplishments. We are making progress, and I am proud of America \ntoday. I think we are going to be filled with pride as we move down the \nroad to see how America is coming together to meet the crisis of our \ngeneration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support and \ncommend the President's back-to-work relief package.\n  From the workers in New York whose offices now lie in rubble to the \nworkers on the opposite coast who have lost their jobs in a massive \nlayoff, the terrorist attacks of September 11 have had a devastating \nimpact on our Nation's workforce. Just as we must rebuild the \nstructures damaged or destroyed, we must help to rebuild the\n\n[[Page S10497]]\n\nlives of workers who have been displaced because of the attacks.\n  As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Employment, Safety, and \nTraining, I am particularly concerned with providing effective and \nimmediate assistance to workers affected by the terrorist attacks. To \ndo so, the President's package must:\n  1, be targeted to individuals directly impacted by the September 11 \nattacks;\n  2, build upon existing programs, not create new ones. That is a major \npoint. We are doing a lot of things well already. We don't need a new \nFederal bureaucracy to do it;\n  3, provide State and local flexibility to address needs;\n  4, enable individuals to return to the workforce as quickly as \npossible through job training and job search assistance.\n  The President's back-to-work relief package is, indeed, based on \nthese principles. He deserves our unyielding support for a proposal \nthat is based on what works best for workers.\n  To enhance existing assistance programs available to displaced \nworkers, the President's proposal will extend unemployment benefits by \n13 weeks for Americans who have lost their jobs as a result of the \nterrorist attacks. It will provide $3 billion in special national \nemergency grants to States to help displaced workers maintain health \ncoverage, to supplement their income, and to receive job training. It \nmakes $11 billion available to States to help low-income displaced \nworkers receive health insurance. And, finally, it encourages displaced \nworkers to take advantage of the more than $6 billion in existing \nFederal programs that provide job search, training, and placement \nservices.\n\n  While the President's package is targeted to workers directly \nimpacted by the terrorist attack, it is not restricted to employees of \nthe airlines and related industries. That is an important point. There \nare many workers in other industries who have also lost their jobs as a \nconsequence of the attacks. It is inequitable to deny them relief \nprovided only to employees in certain industries.\n  I am especially pleased to see that the President's proposal will \nutilize national emergency grants under the Workforce Investment Act to \nprovide additional assistance to those communities and populations \nhardest hit by the terrorist attacks. I have been a strong supporter of \nthe Workforce Investment Act and the fundamental principles upon which \nthis landmark legislation was based.\n  Under the Workforce Investment act, States and localities have \nincreased flexibility to meet the needs of the local and regional labor \nmarkets. Today, in the wake of the tragic events of September 11, it is \neven more critical that States have the flexibility to effectively \nrespond to the needs of their dislocated workers.\n  States affected by the terrorist attacks will be able to receive \nnational emergency grants. The States may in turn use these funds to \nhelp ensure that dislocated workers maintain health insurance coverage, \nthat they receive income support during the recovery period, and they \nreturn to the workforce through training and job search assistance.\n  Both the Workforce Investment Act and the President's package \nrecognize that decisions regarding worker assistance should be made by \nthose closest to the problem and, therefore, closest to the solution. \nState and local governments--not the Federal Government--are best \npositioned to respond to workforce needs. That is the way our system is \nset up.\n  Under the President's package, national emergency grants may be used \nto provide training and job search assistance. In addition, displaced \nworkers are encouraged to take advantage of the $6 billion in existing \nFederal programs that provide training and placement services. Rather \nthan waste precious time and resources on creating new Federal \nprograms, displaced workers can immediately access one-stop centers and \nreceive job assistance services. In fact, New York, Massachusetts, and \nMinnesota have already applied for national emergency grants in the \nwake of the attacks.\n  Finally, the President's proposal is termed a relief package. It is \ndesigned to provide supplementary, temporary work to displaced workers \nduring the recovery period after the terrorist attacks. Now is not the \ntime to create widespread new Federal programs and entitlements. Now is \nthe time to address the immediate needs of workers who have lost their \njobs as a result of the tragic events of September 11 while utilizing \nexisting programs to help these people return to the workforce as \nquickly as possible. Ultimately, this approach, which the President has \ntaken, will best serve these workers and the American economy.\n  The question we must all answer is, How do we define success? The \nanswer is, Getting everybody back to work. How do we achieve that? We \nactivate proven, existing, and therefore immediate programs \nadministered by those closest to the people. I trust Mayor Giuliani and \nI trust Governor Pataki to be responsive, just as I trust the mayor of \nBoston and the Governor of Minnesota. A lot of that is because these \npeople have already been dealing with these existing programs. We don't \nneed to be creating something new just to throw money at them.\n  In closing, I say to my colleagues, the President's back-to-work \nrelief package is aptly named. It is designed to return to the \nworkforce those who lost their jobs as a result of the events of \nSeptember 11. The best way to help stimulate our economy is to get \nthese people working again as soon as possible.\n  To recap, I am in opposition to the cloture motion filed. We will \nvote on it at 1:35. I commend the President for taking a broader look \nand particularly commend the President for his willingness and desire \nto use those existing programs and existing people who are already in \nplace, use the talents that have already been built and trained to do \nit, to provide the necessary recovery we need, without winding up with \nan additional bureaucracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my \ndistinguished colleague from Wyoming, and I agree with him 100 percent \nthat there is no need for an additional program in which to dispense \nthese funds that we wanted to get to our airline workers so quickly. \nThat is why my amendment is set up to service needs under the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Act, already in place, that has worked so well at \nthe Department of Labor. I appreciate his concern for that, but I would \nlike to reassure him that we have taken that into consideration.\n  Mr. President, I would like to start by thanking my colleagues who \nhave risen in support of this amendment. I am heartened by their \nefforts on behalf of the airline industry. I am also very pleased to \nask unanimous consent that Senator Specter be added as a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. The amendment provides assistance to airline industry \nemployees who are laid off from their jobs as a result of terrorist \nattacks that occurred on September 11. It brings assistance to those \nwho had been employed by airlines, airports, aircraft manufacturers, \nand suppliers to airlines. For those workers, this legislation would \nprovide three basic benefits.\n  First, it extends unemployment compensation for an additional 20 \nweeks after employees have exhausted their State benefits. This \nprovides a safety net to help them make their mortgage payments, to \nfeed their families for a few extra months while they are trying to get \nnew jobs.\n  Second, this legislation provides training assistance to workers who \nwill not be able to return to their former jobs, training that is so \nessential today in a changing economy.\n  Third, this legislation helps workers maintain health insurance for \nthemselves and for their families. As my colleagues know, many workers \nwho were laid off are eligible to purchase health insurance from their \nformer employer. The average cost of these premiums is $500 per month. \nPeople who have been abruptly laid off will not have an extra $500 a \nmonth to spend on health insurance. Without help, they will be without \nhealth coverage.\n  This legislation reimburses the cost of those health insurance \npremiums for 12 months. For those workers who are not eligible to \npurchase health benefits, this legislation enables States to\n\n[[Page S10498]]\n\nprovide Medicaid benefits. This is an important step for Congress to \ntake to prevent even more children from joining the ranks of the \nuninsured in America.\n  Some have suggested the benefits I propose are out of line with what \nhas been provided to other workers who have lost their jobs. Let me \nrespond by pointing out that I modeled my legislation after an existing \nprogram, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. The Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Act provides help to those workers who have lost their jobs \nas a result of trade agreements. That program provides extended \nunemployment compensation for 52 weeks--much longer than the 20 weeks \nthat I propose. That program also provides training for 18 months, \nwhile I have proposed providing training for less than 12 months.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance Program has been a lifeline for many \nworkers. Between 1994 and 2000, over 1 million workers received these \npayments. I am glad they did. But let's be clear; these workers get \nmore generous benefits than all other workers who lost their jobs \nduring that time period.\n  The State with the most workers receiving unemployment and training \nbenefits under TAA is Texas. Texas has 8 percent of all the workers in \nthis program, about 86,000 people. Workers from Texas companies such as \nBig Dog Drilling, Tubby's Auto Service, and Rio Grande Cutters \nparticipate in this program. These workers qualify for enhanced \nbenefits because they lost their jobs due to trade. Why shouldn't \nairline workers who lost their benefits when they lost their jobs due \nto terrorism qualify?\n  My legislation provides one thing that the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Act does not, and that is health coverage. I have added this \nbecause I believe it is important that these workers and their families \nbe able to maintain their health coverage. I am pleased that President \nBush has recognized this need as well.\n  Last week, the President laid out some options for how the Government \ncan help provide health coverage to unemployed workers. Today is our \nchance to rise to that occasion.\n  My amendment will also be an economic stimulus. It will put money \ninto the pockets of Americans who need it most. We know these families \nwill spend the money. They need it to pay their bills. That is what we \nneed to get the economy going. We need consumer spending.\n  Finally, some have argued that this amendment has no place on an \nairline security bill. I respectfully disagree. Right now we are \npassing legislation in response to the terrorist attacks. These airline \nindustry workers were laid off as a result of these attacks. The \nlinkage is direct.\n  We must act today. There is no reason to delay assistance any longer. \nWe acted quickly to provide $40 billion in response to the terrorist \nattacks and the cleanup of Manhattan. That was the right thing to do. \nAnd we acted quickly to shore up the airlines with $15 billion, and \nthat was the right thing to do. Now is the time to do something for \nworkers. A vote at 1:35 this afternoon is the first opportunity since \nthe terrorist attack that we will have to invest in our workers, the \nheart and the soul of America. I have collaborated with my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle drafting this amendment. We have come up \nwith a reasonable proposal. Now I am asking simply that my colleagues \nallow the Senate to vote on this proposal. This amendment deserves an \nup-or-down vote. I hope the Senate does the right thing this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the Senator from \nMissouri by saying, first of all, I don't think this is a question of \nwhether we are going to respond to people who have been affected by the \nevents of September 11. The question is how best to respond to that. As \nshe noted, the President has a proposal that is going to broadly deal \nwith the problems of unemployment associated with the attacks on \nSeptember 11. But the question here is whether we are going to focus on \nextending unemployment benefits, as the proposed amendment does, or are \nwe going to get people back to work? It seems to me these people would \nmuch prefer to get their jobs back, to get back to the routines they \nenjoyed prior to September 11, rather than focusing for a long time on \nextending unemployment benefits, having to buy health insurance under \nCOBRA, and having to be retrained for a different job.\n  My guess is these people would be very happy just to get the old job \nback doing the same work they were doing before. That is why I think we \nhave the focus wrong.\n  I have proposed, and I am going to be urging my colleagues to very \nseriously consider, as part of the economic stimulus package a tax \ncredit to get people traveling again. The problem is people are not \ntraveling. If we had as much travel today, 1 month after this event, as \nwe did on the day of September 11, all of the people we are concerned \nabout under this amendment would have their jobs. We would not be \nworried about unemployment benefits. We would not be worried about \ntraining them to do a different kind of job. They would have the same \njob they had exactly a month ago. So shouldn't we be trying to get the \nAmerican public back to the habits it had prior to September 11? And \nthat specifically relates to travel. There is no question that of all \nof the economy, the travel industry is the most hard hit by the attack. \nThat should be obvious to everyone. It seems to me it should also be \nobvious, if we are going to talk about benefiting that segment of the \neconomy, either to help the people who were unemployed as a result of \nit or to stimulate the economy, what we need to do is focus on the air, \nwhere the patient is hurting the most.\n  The patient was hurting on September 11. Our economy was not in good \nshape. You could say we had a case of pneumonia. We were going to be \ngetting better over time, of course. We were going to be treating it \nwith antibiotics, but that was the condition then. Since then what has \nhappened, if you want to have a gruesome analogy, is we had an accident \nin which the arm was practically cut off. We are bleeding to death, and \nwe have to stop the bleeding in that the part of the body that is \nhurting the most and that is the travel industry.\n  So why aren't we focusing our efforts on getting that industry back \ngoing again? That will save the jobs of the people who want nothing \nmore than to go back to work. My proposal gives a tax credit for the \npeople to travel. It says if you make a financial commitment to travel \nbefore the end of this year, you get a tax credit of $500 on your 2001 \ntaxes; if it is a joint filing, $1,000. That is enough to stimulate \npeople to get back into the habits they had prior to September 11. All \nyou have to do is make that financial commitment. It can be air travel, \nautomobile, or bus. It can be a reservation at the hotel. We have \npeople who are hurting far more than just people who worked at \nairports--from the maid who makes up the bed in the hotel to someone \nwho, frankly, was working at Boeing aircraft making airplanes; they are \nnot making them because nobody is buying them and because people aren't \ntraveling--all the way from A to Z. We have people throughout our \neconomy--about one in seven jobs in the civilian sector--who are \nadversely affected by the events of a month ago. Throughout the \neconomy, the ripple effect of these attacks is incredible.\n\n  I talked to the CEO of Phelps-Dodge Corporation, a copper company in \nArizona. They had a big contract with Boeing to supply a special alloy \nmetal used in making airplanes. We need to think about the impact of \nwhat occurred throughout the economy. It is not just people who work at \nairports on whom we ought to be focusing; we ought to be focusing on \nthe economy broadly and on everybody affected by the travel industry.\n  How do you directly deal with that problem in the quickest way that \ngets the people their jobs back? You do that by providing some kind of \nincentive for people to resume the habits they had exactly a month ago.\n  I haven't heard a better idea than the one I proposed with this tax \ncredit. When you file your taxes for 2001 and calculate your tax \nliability to the Government, and you subtract $1,000, that is a pretty \ngood incentive. You wouldn't have to travel before the end of the year \nas long as you made your financial commitment to do so. You could be \ntraveling next Easter. It could\n\n[[Page S10499]]\n\nbe tourism; it could be business; it could be just going to visit \nsomebody; it could be visiting a sick relative--whatever it is.\n  People are now disinclined to travel primarily because they are \nunsure of the safety of the airline industry. They are unsure generally \nof what is in our future. Frankly, they need to get back into the habit \nof doing what they did before September 11 or terrorists will have won. \nThe purpose of terrorism is to demoralize. It is to change for all of \nAmerica the way we conduct our society and our culture. That is their \neffort. They are going to succeed in that if we simply throw up our \nhands and say, well, for all of the people who are out of work, we \nmight as well find something else for them to do because we will never \nget back to the way we were before September 11.\n  I reject that. We can get back to the way it was before September 11. \nA lot of things are going to change. We have to convince the American \npublic that it is safe to travel. If we can't do that, we are not doing \nour jobs.\n  I have been on six separate commercial air trips since the events on \nSeptember 11--flying back home and then back to Washington. I believe \nit is safe to travel. I think it is safer to travel than prior to a \nmonth ago.\n  We have to pass legislation that convinces the American public that \nthey can travel safely. Then I think we have to provide them some \nfinancial incentive because of our general economic conditions. That \nincentive would be to get them to go back to traveling, and to do so \nquickly. If we wait for all of this work throughout the system for a \ncouple of years, then everybody is going to be the loser. We will have \nall of these people unemployed. We will have to pay additional benefits \nin health care and retrain them to do something else. It would be far \neasier, less disruptive, better for the economy, and, frankly, better \nfor the psyche of the Nation to get back to the place we were a month \nago where people who lost jobs could go back to doing what they were \ndoing before.\n\n  It seems to me that instead of hastily acting on the proposal that \nonly applies to a narrow segment of our society--frankly, a minority of \nthe people who have been harmed by the attacks on September 11, a \nminority of the people who have been harmed as a direct result of the \nAmerican public traveling less--let's do two other things: Let's take a \nlook at what the President proposed in the way of benefits for people \nwho have lost their jobs but is broader based in approach; second, \nlet's get the American public traveling again.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we are putting together this so-called \nstimulus package, to differentiate between all of those wonderful ideas \nthat have been trotted out and proposing all kinds of things to spend \nmoney for or cutting taxes that we think will have some long-term \neffect on the economy--distinguishing between those proposals, on the \none hand, and others which can immediately and directly stimulate the \neconomy in the precise areas where it is needed the most.\n  What area needs it the most? The travel industry. What area was hit \nthe hardest by the attack last month? The travel industry. What area, \ntherefore, should we be focusing on? The travel industry. If we do \nthat, we are not going to have to worry about extending unemployment \nbenefits because we will get these people back to work.\n  Isn't that far better than focusing and, in effect, saying there is \nnothing we can do about it and we might as well decide right now to \nextend all of these unemployment benefits and retrain people to do some \ndifferent job? I think they would rather go back to the job they were \ndoing a month ago. That is what I propose we do.\n  Two things: No. 1, defeat this amendment. I think we ought to focus \non the President's proposal instead; and, No. 2, we ought to agree that \nwe have to have in the stimulus package something that will stimulate \ntrade quickly.\n  If somebody can come up with better idea than a tax credit proposal, \nI welcome it. In the meantime, that is what is on the table.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this as a way of stimulating travel, \nof getting people back to work again, and of denying the terrorists the \nvictory they sought of demoralizing the American people.\n  We will not be demoralized. We will not be defeatists and say we are \ngoing to have to change our way of doing things by putting people on \nthe unemployment rolls and retraining them to do something else. I \nreject that. We have to deny the terrorists the victories they sought. \nI think the way I propose to do it is the best way.\n  With all due respect of my friend from Missouri, I think her \nproposal--I understand why it is being put together--is not the best \nmedicine for what we are facing today.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to support the \namendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Missouri, Senator \nCarnahan.\n  I have been listening to some of the discussion this morning. \nFrankly, I believe there is much value on both points of view to \ncommend. I think we err if we consider some of these proposals to be \neither/or propositions.\n  This last Monday, the senior Senator from Minnesota, Paul Wellstone, \narranged a hearing in Minnesota on the effects of the September 11 \ndisasters on people of our State. It was an excellent hearing. It \nlasted for about 3 hours. We had representatives from the business \ncommunity testify about their needs, including the head of the Carlson \ncorporation, one of the largest travel firms in America, headquartered \nin Minnesota. Marilyn Carlson Nelson spoke very eloquently about the \nneed for the kind of assistance that my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Kyl from Arizona, just described. We also heard from a number \nof the workers who were affected in Minnesota by the events and the \naftermath of the events of September 11.\n  As you may know, in my home State of Minnesota, Northwest Airlines is \none of the largest employers within the State. It employs over 21,000 \nMinnesotans. It has operations worldwide. It has an enormous impact on \nour State's economy. In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 \nbombings, they announced the layoff of over 4,500 Minnesotans. These \nare men and women from all backgrounds and walks of life--corporate \nexecutives to mechanics, to airline attendants, to stewardesses. It \nalso affected people in the ancillary businesses that relate to the \nairline industry: Carpet cleaners, food processors, delivery men and \nwomen,\n  The hearing underscored the urgency and the precariousness of many of \nthese people's situations. People want to be working; there is no \nquestion about that. They don't want to be out of a job. They don't \nwant to be drawing unemployment benefits or receiving other kinds of \nassistance. But the hard reality is they are out of work today. Their \nprospects of being called back to work tomorrow are somewhere in \nbetween slim and none.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arizona that the object here is to get \nthese people back into their previous employment. I think we have taken \nsome important steps in that direction.\n  We provided emergency aid to the airline industry in the form of \nimmediate cash assistance and in the form of loan guarantees which the \nSenator from West Virginia and the Senator from South Carolina and \nother colleagues have been marshaling through this body. But that is \nnot going to get these people back to work tomorrow. It is not going to \nmeet their need for emergency assistance until they do.\n\n  We heard from, particularly women, including one I remember \ndistinctly. I remember on Monday, an Ethiopian woman--the mother of \neight children--who works, along with her husband. She works in the \nsector providing food services to airplanes. She lost her job. Because \nshe worked there an insufficient length of time, she is not eligible to \nreceive unemployment benefits from the State of Minnesota. She lost her \nhealth coverage for herself and her family of eight children when she \nwas laid off of work. She is not receiving any unemployment assistance \ntoday. She receives no health care assistance for herself and her \nfamily.\n  So my question to those who oppose this amendment is, what happens to \nthem? What happens to people who at this point are not even receiving \nany unemployment assistance or any health care assistance? It is bad\n\n[[Page S10500]]\n\nenough that we are going to deprive those who do qualify today for an \nabbreviated period of 26 weeks, at which point they are going to lose a \ncontinuation of their unemployment benefits, of their health care \ncoverage, but what about the people--and I was amazed at this hearing \nlast Monday to realize that there are a great number of people in \nMinnesota, and I assume then across the country, since we are one of \nthe best States in the Nation of covering people and making people \neligible for these assistances--what is going to happen to this woman \nwith eight children, and to others like her--thousands of others across \nthis country--who are not even today receiving any unemployment \nbenefits, who today do not have any health care coverage? What is going \nto happen to them if we do not take this action today?\n  I must say, I am also, frankly--``disappointed'' would be a mild \nword--I am really shocked that this body is suddenly so stingy when it \ncomes to providing the help and assistance that real people, working \npeople, people who are among the hardest working strivers in our \nsociety--suddenly when it is their turn to receive some necessary help, \nthe cupboard is bare or the budget does not provide for assistance, or \nwe just do not have enough money to provide help for them.\n  Two weeks go, my colleagues and I in the Senate joined--I believe it \nwas almost unanimous--together to provide help to bail out the airline \nindustry. Prior to that vote, we were told there was not enough time to \ncome to an agreement on the Carnahan amendment to add assistance for \nthe workers to the assistance we were providing to the corporations who \nrun these airlines.\n  As I said, I am very sympathetic to their plight because Northwest \nAirlines is one of the largest and most important employers in the \nState of Minnesota. But it was my understanding --and in hindsight, I \nguess I was maybe mistaken to have relied upon the assurances that were \ngiven to us prior to that vote--I relied on those assurances that there \nwould be a subsequent package that would have bipartisan support \nsufficient to pass it that would be in support of the Carnahan \namendment.\n  On that basis, I, and most of the Senate, if not all of the Senate, \nvoted in favor of that legislation. And I am glad I did. But now, \nfrankly, I am shocked to find out that agreement does not suffice, and \nthat even after we have taken this Carnahan amendment--and I commend \nthe distinguished Senator from Missouri for her hard work on this, \nalong with others, and for the dialogue that they have had across the \naisle--but the fact is, this has gone from over a $3 billion price \ntag--I think close to $5 billion initially; after costed out, to $3 \nbillion--and now I am told it is $1.9 billion. We continue to pare it \nback. Yet we, possibly, do not have sufficient support today to adopt \nit.\n\n  That means I go back to that Ethiopian mother of eight children and \nsay: Sorry, you just have to make it somehow without any benefits. You \nhave to make it somehow without any health coverage for your family. We \ndon't have enough money to do that, but we have enough money to provide \nloan guarantees and financial assistance to the corporations.\n  We also, according to what I am reading today, have the debate \nupcoming on economic stimulus. We are going to have an administration \nproposal supported by many of the very people who oppose this \nassistance for workers. According to the Washington Post today, that is \ngoing to cost revenue between $90 billion and $120 billion in the year \n2002. This includes a provision allowing business to write off 30 \npercent of the value of their new assets. It would reduce revenue by \n$48 billion in this year.\n  They want to speed up the phasing in of the tax reductions, passed \nlast spring, for the very wealthiest people in this society, bring \nthose rates down, accelerate the elimination of the estate tax, as \nthough encouraging people to--what?--die sooner, and that is going to \nstimulate our Nation's economy?\n  We hear, on the one hand, we have all this extra money available for \nthese kinds of very questionable tax breaks that are certainly going to \nbenefit the wealthy. They are going to benefit already profitable \ncorporations, who are maybe going through a difficult period of time \nbut, frankly, are still going to do just fine; but there isn't enough \nmoney here to provide for that mother back in Minnesota with eight \nchildren because it is not that we do not have the money, but that we \ndo not have the heart to do it.\n  So again, I say to Senator Carnahan, congratulations on a job very \nwell done. I hope the amendment will receive the kind of consideration \nfrom our colleagues today that enables it to be adopted because I, \nfrankly, think if we do not do so, if we do not even follow suit with \nwhat the President, to his credit, is supporting, that we are going to \ngo back to a very serious divide in this body and in this country \nbetween those who somehow qualify for these additional considerations \nat this point in time and the real people, people who are really down \nand out, through no choice or fault of their own.\n  Are we going to say, sorry, we are not going to help you, not because \nwe do not have the money to do so but because we do not have the will \nto do so? I think that would be cruel and unusual punishment for them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe it would be appropriate to \nask unanimous consent that I may introduce an amendment, two amendments \non the Aviation Security Act. It may be necessary to set aside the \nCarnahan amendment for an opportunity to introduce two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nintroduce one amendment that I don't believe is controversial. It \ncovers the issue of allowing pilots to continue to fly until the age of \n63.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire is \nasking that we object to every unanimous consent request regarding \noffering of amendments. Will the Senator withhold to let me see if I \ncan get a procedure by which the Senator from Alaska can offer the \namendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1863, which is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Reserving the right to object, this amendment, as I \nunderstand it, is the first amendment that will be unrelated to the \nbill. I don't want to comment further on that. We are going to have our \ncloture vote at 1:35. I object, at least for this period of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if I may ask unanimous consent \nthat I be allowed to speak as in morning business for about 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10500-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10500-S10502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE NEED FOR PILOTS TO HAVE GUNS IN THE COCKPIT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it was my intent to call up two \namendments. But there is objection. As a consequence, I will use this \nopportunity to discuss the merits since I will not be offering the \namendments now. They have already been filed at the desk. It is my \nintent, at the appropriate time, without objection, to ask for a \nrecorded vote on the amendments. I want to speak on the application of \nthe\n\n[[Page S10501]]\n\namendments and the importance of the amendments.\n  One of the amendments seeks to address the issue of what we do with \nour commercial aviation safety relative to the reality that we do put \nour lives in the hands of the pilot in command--and the copilot, to a \ndegree, depending on who has control of the aircraft. With the limited \nknowledge that we have relative to the two aircraft that went into the \nWorld Trade Center, and looking back at the apparent effort by \npassengers and, perhaps, some members of the crew, to try to take over \nthe aircraft that went down in Pennsylvania, one clearly can project \nwhat the outcome might have been had the captain of any of those \naircraft had a handgun in the cockpit, available for such a set of \ncircumstances.\n  It reminds me of an occasion with a little different circumstance. I \nwill try to put it in the vein in which it was communicated to me. It \nis not an exact parallel, but it represents a reality associated with a \nhandgun emergency. My wife and I were in New York a number of years ago \nand had been to the theater and were going back to our hotel in the \nfinancial district. As the taxicab came to a stoplight with several \nother cabs, there was a policeman with his baton tapping on the \nwindows.\n\n  The cabbie rolled down the window and the policeman said: How is your \nfare?\n  He said: Fine. And then the window was rolled up and the taxicab went \non.\n  I asked the cabbie: What was that all about?\n  He said: We have had a number of robberies and a couple of taxicab \ndrivers have been murdered in New York, so we are tightening up \nsecurity.\n  We went on for a while, and I casually said: Have you ever had a \nproblem?\n  He said: Only once.\n  I asked him what the problem was. He said he was taking a couple \nsomewhere and felt a little uneasy because they didn't seem to know \nwhere they were going. He took them to an area, and he decided the best \nthing he could do would be to let the fares out. There were two women \nand a man. As he told them to get out of the cab, suddenly he felt a \nrazor at his neck. They said: Turn over your wallet, and all the money \nyou have.\n  He said: I can't until I get out of the cab. They had to move at that \ntime so they could get out of the back seat and he could get out of the \nfront seat. As he did, he reached under the seat and pulled out a \npistol. The next time they confronted him, they were looking right at \nthe end of his barrel.\n  I asked him: What did you do then?\n  This is the part of the story that is really not apropos.\n  He said: I lined them up to the fence and robbed them.\n  I thought that was an interesting turn of events.\n  I said: Did you report it?\n  He said: Well, no, I didn't have a permit for the gun.\n  That is a little story that I think applies, at least in the sense \nthat had the pilot in command had the availability of a gun, things \nmight have been entirely different. One of my amendments seeks to arm \npilots of commercial aircraft with handguns, and I think the \njustification for that speaks for itself.\n  We put our lives in the hands of a pilot. Aviation security is of \nvital importance to our Nation's security, our economy, and we have \nlearned a lot since the tragic events since September 11 about how much \nour Nation depends on our freedom to move about our country. We also \nrely, obviously, on our lifeline of shipments and products. Most \nimportantly, our citizens rely upon the airlines for safe transit \naround the country and throughout the world.\n  I think it is our duty to ensure that they are traveling safe and \nsecure, and their confidence by our efforts will decide the future of \nair travel in our Nation and, in turn, the health of our country. \nThroughout this debate, we must remember that, as each passenger boards \na commercial airliner, they first look toward the cockpit. They look \ntoward the cockpit and the flight crew for their immediate security, \nbecause we all know that they, indeed, have our lives in their hands \nand they are trained and competent. When the plane rises into the sky \nand the wheels tuck away into the underbelly of the aircraft, it is the \npilot, copilot, and sometimes the navigator--the entire flight crew--\nwho serve as the last line of defense and security for that aircraft \nand the passengers therein.\n  So we as legislators, and as passengers, trust the flight crew with \nour safety and security. We must ensure that they have the tools to \ncompete, if you will, and to complete the task. For this reason, I have \nan amendment at the desk, which I will not call up at this time, but I \nintend to do so when there is no objection. This amendment would be to \nthe Aviation Safety Act, and it would allow pilots, copilots, and in \nthe case of navigators on commercial aircraft the ability and authority \nto carry a handgun while in flight for the defense of the plane.\n  We are talking about putting air marshals on the aircraft, aren't we? \nWe are talking about allowing them to be armed. The authority of an air \nmarshal currently on an aircraft indeed suggests that that individual \nis armed. You can't put air marshals on all flights, but you can \nprovide the authority for the captain and copilot to carry a handgun in \nthe cockpit.\n  I think this is, first and foremost, really an effort to increase the \nlevel of safety aboard our commercial fleets. It is intended to give \ncrew members the weapons and the necessary skills to thwart future \nhijacking attempts and to assist Federal sky marshals assigned to \ncommercial aircraft.\n  I don't take this amendment lightly. My amendment does not cavalierly \nattempt to hand out guns to flight crews and simply wish them the best. \nBecause of the September 11 tragedy, and the tactics used by the \nhijackers that day, we must change the way aircraft and passengers are \nprotected, and I believe my amendment contributes to that \neffort because it provides for strict and thorough background checks on \nall individuals who would be armed under this provision.\n\n  Secondly, it would require that flight deck personnel attend a \ntraining program approved by the Secretary of Transportation in \nconsultation with other appropriate Federal agencies.\n  My amendment also requires annual recertification to ensure that \nflight deck personnel maintain a high level of training.\n  Third, this amendment deputizes flight deck personnel who have passed \ntraining certification. This is a critical component, and this \namendment is necessary because it is imperative to keep the crew \nprotected and in control of the craft, but it is carefully tailored to \nlimit authority to cockpit protection.\n  As many in this Chamber are aware, there is a large percentage of \npilots who have served in the military. Many have served in law \nenforcement. In fact, many also serve as Reservists in different \nbranches of the military. These pilots have been trained in the use of \nweaponry. Why not utilize the trained personnel we already have?\n  I am not alone in this. The Airline Pilots Association supports this \nconcept. They have written to the FBI requesting a program to train \ncockpit personnel, and I have heard from many pilots, particularly in \nmy State of Alaska and around the country, who support it.\n  Frankly, many of our aircraft in Alaska fly in the bush and carry \nguns on the aircraft in control of the captain. It is done for a number \nof reasons, primarily not associated with terrorism, but simply the \nreality if you have an accident, if you go down in an isolated area, \nyou damn well better have a gun for your own survival and that of your \npassengers. Why not further enhance the chances of passenger and \naircraft survival.\n  I applaud the administration and this Congress for moving quickly to \nsecure the cockpit cabins and adding the sky marshals who, obviously, \nwill have guns, improving airport perimeter security, training \nscreening personnel, and increasing flight deck security. But we must \nalso afford passengers the utmost security after the plane has cleared \nthe runway. Arming pilots is not the only solution, but it is an \nimportant component because it might have resulted in those aircraft \nnot reaching the tragic end they did.\n  The pilots know what they need. The pilots have spoken. The \npassengers certainly will support it, and the Congress should pass it. \nI encourage my colleagues to support this amendment\n\n[[Page S10502]]\n\nwhen it does come up and is not objected to and the entire Aviation \nSecurity Act.\n  There is one other amendment I wish to talk about but which I am not \nprepared to offer because of the objection, but I plan to offer an \namendment that would repeal the Federal Aviation Administration rule \nwhich requires pilots who fly under part 121 to retire at age 60. It \nmight be a good thing if we had to retire around here at age 60, but \nobviously there is no check and balance on the Senate, but there is on \npilots.\n  If you are 60, you are through. How ridiculous is that? This was \nsomething that was done many years ago. I would much rather fly with an \nexperienced pilot who has lived to 60, and the fact that suddenly he \nturns 60 and he is no longer fit to fly is totally unrealistic. The \nhours gained and the experience gained provides a level of safety with \nwhich we all feel more comfortable.\n  If you fly with a person who has limited hours, who may be very young \nand very quick, they may not have the experience to know what to do \nunder certain conditions, mechanical, weather, or otherwise.\n  This amendment seeks to end blatant age discrimination against our \nNation's commercial pilots. Under the amendment I propose, pilots who \npass the physical and are in excellent health will be allowed to \ncontinue to pilot commercial aircraft until their 63rd birthday. This \nis optional. They do not have to. They can retire at 60. We are \noffering an extension.\n  The amendment will also allow the FAA to require pilots to undergo \nadditional medical and cognitive testing for certification as well as \nestablished standards for crew pairings. In many European countries you \ncan fly until 65. What is the difference?\n  This measure was the subject of a full Commerce Committee hearing and \nwas voted out of committee by a majority in March of this year. This \nissue has had a hearing.\n  Why does the FAA mandate pilots retire at 60? Good question. \nAccording to the agency, it is because of ``medical uncertainties \nconcerning pilot health after the age of 60.'' That was a long time \nago. We live longer. We are in better health. We have regular \nphysicals.\n  There are other theories. While public comments were accepted, no \npublic hearing to debate the issue was ever held. Think of that. While \npublic comments were accepted by the FAA, no public hearing to debate \nthe issue was held. Despite broad industry, pilot and union opposition, \nthe rule went into effect in 1960. The union supported it then. They \nwanted the pilots to be allowed to fly longer.\n  Since that time, we have seen studies sponsored by the FAA. None \nproduced concrete evidence that pilots over 60 years of age are a \nthreat to the flying public. In fact, the studies have not even \nincluded pilots over 60. Why? The FAA believes it lacks scientific \nconsensus, whatever that means, in favor of changing the age 60 rule. \nThe argument exists that there is no test that can determine the \nmedical and psychological fitness of a pilot to fly after 60. However, \nadvanced physiological and neurobehavioral testing methods do exist to \ntest pilots of any age.\n\n  Today, simulator training data estimates the risk of incapacitation \ndue specifically to cardiac complaint as only one event in more than 20 \nmillion flight hours. Sudden in-flight incapacitation is clearly a far \nless threat to aviation safety than are mishaps due to, what? \nInexperienced pilot error, those pilots who are younger and who simply \ndo not have the time, experience and know-how to recover from \nsituations that can occur.\n  Medical science has vastly improved since 1959 with improvements in \ndiagnosis which include early detection, prevention, health awareness, \nexercise, and diet. All of these factors have increased life expectancy \nsince 1959.\n  Airline pilots consistently demonstrate superior task performance \nacross all age groups when compared to age-matched nonpilots. Pilots \nare also subjected to comprehensive medical examinations, when? Every 6 \nmonths.\n  In the 42 years since the rule was promulgated, there has not been \nany evidence shown that pilots over age 60 are not fully capable of \nhandling their flight responsibilities. As many of my colleagues are \naware, up until the end of 1999, pilots were allowed to fly past the \nage of 60 in commuter operations.\n  This amendment also brings to mind several other pieces of \nlegislation. During the debate on the Senior Citizens' Right to Work \nAct of 2000, Senators supported the notion that workers today live \nlonger, are healthier, and live more productive lives, and that senior \nworkers are an invaluable resource to our Nation.\n  When enacting the Experienced Pilot Act of 1978, Congress stated that \nthe age 60 rule is arbitrary and discriminatory on its face. It \ndeprives qualified individuals of the right to continue in their \noccupation and, at the same time, deprives the airlines of their most \nqualified and experienced employees.\n  The time has come for Congress to repeal the age restrictions for \ncommercial pilots. We have had the hearings, and we have the need. \nYears of medical and safety data have failed to support the position \nthat the chronological age of 60 represents a passenger safety concern. \nTherefore, as long as pilots can pass the rigorous medical exam, he or \nshe should be allowed to fly.\n  We are proposing this only until age 63. We will evaluate the \nprogram, obviously, after that time. Air service is critical, as we \nknow, to keeping commerce alive. Experienced airmen are especially \ncritical in rural States. In my State of Alaska, we have a huge land \nmass, one-fifth the size of the United States. Many of our smaller \ncarriers provide the training ground for pilots and then suddenly those \npilots leave to go work for the larger airlines. We are constantly \nexperiencing a level of experience that lends itself occasionally to \naccidents as a consequence of the inexperience. We want to keep pilots, \nand if we could even bring some back who are over 60 and want to keep \nflying in the commuter area, I think it would be beneficial.\n  It is time we end age discrimination once and for all and keep \nexperience in the cockpit. I recognize some of the unions are a little \njumpy on this one, but those pilots in the right seat, the copilots, \nare going to want to fly a little longer when they get a little older, \ntoo. So this thing can all level out.\n  The difference between the unions on this issue and the airlines is \nit is a business decision, a matter of retirement. What we are talking \nabout is a need for these pilots to fly. They are healthy. Give them \nanother 3 years, evaluate the program, and get the benefit of \nexperience.\n  I thank the Chair for the attention and the courtesies of allowing me \nto finish, and at an appropriate time I want to advise the floor \nmanagers I intend to offer the amendments that are at the desk for a \nformal introduction and ask for rollcall votes at that time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter dated October 1, 2001, from Alaska Airlines pilot Carroll John \nCampbell.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Chugiak, AK, October, 1, 2001.\n     Hon. Senator Robert Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: I am writing in response to a \n     conversation I had with one of your staff members concerning \n     aviation safety. My name is Carroll John Campbell. I am an \n     airline pilot with Alaska Airlines. The recent change in the \n     tactics of hijackers aboard our aircraft have necessitated a \n     change in our response as an airline crew and as a traveling \n     public. Today, one has to believe that if a terrorist \n     breaches the cockpit, which is easy, they are going to kill \n     everyone on board the aircraft and any number of people on \n     the ground. Our current security procedures lack the ability \n     to stand in the way of these atrocities. New, stronger \n     cockpit doors are a must, and even those may be compromised. \n     In this event, the only thing standing between the airplane \n     and our friends and families on the ground is the flight \n     crew.\n       Lethal weapons are the surest means of defense. Handguns \n     are our best option. Non-lethal weapons such as stun guns are \n     of limited value in a phone booth sized compartment when \n     fighting a knife. I would much rather have the knife.\n       Current FAR's (108.11) authorize crews to be armed. \n     However, the FAA and airline policy double team the pilot to \n     keep us unarmed. We need new fool proof legislation that \n     guarantees any pilot who wants to be armed, can be armed.\n       I will be happy to work with your office to draft this \n     legislation. The public is finally demanding our incapable \n     security system be fixed after these horrendous attacks on \n     Sept. 11, 2001. Please don't let them down.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Carroll John Campbell.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10503-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10503-S10532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10503]]\n                    AVIATION SECURITY ACT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, the assistant \nmajority leader, is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the next 55 minutes we are under \ncontrolled time, controlled by the majority and minority leaders. So if \nanyone desires to speak on this very important matter which will occur, \nas I said, in 55 minutes--each side has an equal amount of time--I will \nyield to whomever wants to speak.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. We have plenty of time. I ask the Senator from New York, \nhow much time does the Senator wish to use?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 25 minutes 48 seconds remaining on \nthe Democratic side.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I expect to consume 5 minutes or less.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of the majority leader, Senator Rockefeller will \nyield the time until the vote occurs, or if Senator Hollings comes in, \nhe will yield the time.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I do not want to impinge upon the time \nof my good friend, Senator Rockefeller.\n  Mr. REID. No. Please go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise again in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Carnahan to provide immediate assistance to the over \n100,000 airline workers and those in aviation-related industries who \nhave been laid off and lost their jobs as a direct result of the \nterrorist attacks of September 11.\n  I just came from a very moving ceremony of commemoration at the \nPentagon, where the lives of those military and civilian employees at \nthe Pentagon, as well as the lives of the crew and passengers of the \nairplane that was mercilessly driven into the Pentagon, were honored.\n  I know we are working on other kinds of relief, and I am grateful to \nthe President, the administration, and my colleagues for the work that \nis being done on the economic stimulus package and for the work that is \nbeing done with respect to unemployment insurance and dislocated \nworkers' assistance, but I believe we have an obligation to move \nquickly with respect to the workers who have been laid off through no \nfault of their own or of their industry, and we cannot wait for the \nlarger packages to be put together and negotiated.\n  Just as we must provide security to all Americans who are flying in \nour skies, we also should provide economic security to those who have \nsupported us in the hundreds of thousands and millions of flights that \nwere a matter of course before September 11. They were doing an \nimportant job in maintaining our free travel and supporting an \nimportant economic activity, and now they are confronting the cruelest \nkind of questions: How will they make their next car payment? How will \nthey be able to afford the clothes their children might need? How will \nthey know whether to go out and look for another job or hope and wait \nthat business picks up on our airlines? I do not think we should be \nleaving our workers who have already been laid off. They need our help \nright now. I do agree we have to address the need to help all workers.\n  In New York, for example, the State labor department is estimating \nthat 285,000 workers throughout New York will lose their jobs as a \nresult of the attack we suffered. I do not think we should leave any of \nthese workers behind. If we are trying to build confidence--confidence \nin consumers, confidence in citizens--then we should address the needs \nof those people who have been economically harmed by these attacks. I \nrespect the work that others are undertaking. I will support that.\n\n  I ask this Chamber to send a message by voting in favor of Senator \nCarnahan's amendment that we are not going to just bail out airlines; \nwe are not just going to protect the traveling public. We are going to \nhelp protect economically those who we hope will be back in the skies, \nback behind the counters, handling the baggage.\n  I met yesterday with a group of executives from the travel and \ntourism industry. Stories from them about the low occupancy rates, the \nfact that people are not traveling for business or pleasure, were very \ndisturbing to me. Everyone knows we have real economic challenges. The \nlast thing in the world we need is people who are scared to go about \ntheir daily business, who are scared to take that long-planned trip to \nDisney World, who are scared to fly across the country to show off \ntheir new baby to their mother or grandmother.\n  Until we can get that confidence up--and I applaud our wonderful \nleadership of Chairman Hollings and Ranking Member McCain on the \naviation security bill--until we can get that confidence once again \nmoving forward so people will fly, we can't turn our backs on those men \nand women who were the backbone of this airline industry.\n  I hope every Senator will support the Carnahan amendment and do \neverything possible to demonstrate our concern and commitment to those \nwho were on the front lines and lost their jobs and livelihood because \nof the terrorist attacks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New York for \nher statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia controls the time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for yielding time \nand commend my colleague from New York for her statement. What she has \nheard in traveling about her State and the Nation I have heard in \nIllinois. During the last 2 weeks I had roundtables across my State, \nfrom the city of Chicago to major cities downstate, bringing in \nbusiness and economic leaders and saying, what can we do at this moment \nto breathe life back into this economy? They have said, restore \nconsumer confidence. We have to get people back into the stores and \nmaking decisions for purchases.\n  The Carnahan amendment which we are going to consider today takes an \nunfortunate group of people related to the aviation industry, who have \nbeen disadvantaged by being laid off or terminated, and says we are \ngoing to try to give them a hand to get back on their feet as quickly \nas possible.\n  A few weeks ago when President Bush suggested we help the aviation \nindustry, I was happy to do it. We have 50,000 people in the \nChicagoland area who work in aviation in some way, shape, or form. We \nare proud to be the home of United Airlines, a major hub for American \nAirlines, and now the business headquarters for Boeing aircraft. With \nthat sensitivity, I voted for that bill, understanding that unless we \ngot the airlines back on their feet, it was unlikely the economy would \nrespond. So we gave some $5 billion in grants and $10 billion in loans \nto the industry.\n  The sad part was the bill was passed in a hurry and didn't include \neverything that should have been included. It did not include the \nCarnahan amendment. Senator Jean Carnahan of Missouri has rightfully \nstated that if we are going to help the companies, if we are going to \nhelp the airlines, don't forget the employees. She notes, in preparing \nfor this bill, that some 140,000 people related to airlines and the \naviation industry may find themselves laid off as a result of the \nSeptember 11 terrorism attack against the United States.\n  I met with several flight attendants today who worked for Trans World \nAirlines, now part of American Airlines. They were concerned about the \nfact that 20 percent of their flight attendants have been laid off \nalready. We have seen 20,000 employees at United and American laid off, \nand perhaps even more.\n  The heartening thing is people are flying again. I notice it in the \nairports. I am glad to see it. We want to encourage more and more \npeople to take that trip, whether it is for business or for pleasure. \nBut in the meantime, over 100,000 of our fellow Americans in jobs \nrelated to the aviation industry are struggling to survive.\n\n[[Page S10504]]\n\n  Senator Carnahan's amendment addresses three particular areas that \nneed to be changed in the law to help these people. First and foremost, \neligibility for unemployment compensation. The 26-week eligibility \ncertainly may be enough, but Senator Carnahan suggests we give them \neligibility for an additional 52 weeks, if necessary. Most of them will \neither be back at work or find another job before that, but giving them \nthe peace of mind that they will have unemployment compensation is \nappropriate.\n  Second, she talks about training. Some of the people in the industry \nmay decide to go into another field--for one thing, into security. We \nhave talked about aviation security. We will need some of the best and \nbrightest working in our airports and all across this country to \nprotect the people and the traveling public. She includes in her \namendment a training provision. I think that makes sense as well.\n\n  The last point is one that not only makes sense for 140,000 aviation \nindustry employees, but it makes sense for every American. Senator \nCarnahan wants to make certain that we help these laid-off employees \npay for their health insurance. When I was in Chicago, I talked to some \nadministrators of hospitals. They said if we reach a point where more \nand more people are out of work and lose their health insurance, these \nfolks will turn up at the hospital sick, and they will be treated, but \nthe cost of their treatment will have to be absorbed by the hospital \nand generally by everyone else paying health insurance premiums. It \nmakes sense, under the Carnahan amendment, to be sensitive to this, to \nhelp the laid-off aviation and airline industry employees pay for their \nhealth insurance.\n  A lot of Members have talked about how to get the economy moving \nagain. Believe me, by taking this group of employees and saying to \nthem, we are going to give you a helping hand, it has to help them, \ntheir families, and our economy in general. Having said that, I will \nvote for the Carnahan amendment. I hope my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle will join me.\n  I suggest further that there are many people in many other industries \nwho are also losing their jobs. A friend of mine who has a number of \nhotels told me about the necessary cutbacks in employment at those \nhotels. Many know that the people working in hotels, whether in food \nservice or working in room service, or trying to do the housekeeping, \nhave startup jobs. They are low paying jobs. And these folks are being \nlaid off. Many of them are facing very difficult times. I am glad the \nPresident has suggested extending unemployment insurance. But we as a \nCongress should be sensitive to this as well.\n  If you want to know how to stimulate America's economy, it is not by \nleaving our friends, neighbors, and relatives by the side of the road \nas we press forward. Bring them along on this journey. Bring them along \nto see the economy's rebirth, which I believe will take place. It means \nthat Congress has to do something about it.\n  Frankly, let me tell you, a few of my colleagues, and only a few, \nthink the way to get the economy moving again is not to pay attention \nto the unemployed and the laid off but rather those who are doing well \nand are prosperous. They are suggesting we should, again, give tax cuts \nto the wealthiest people in America. That is just incredible to my \nmind, to suggest at this moment in our history we would show less \nsensitivity to those who are out of work and more generosity to those \nwho are already doing extremely well.\n  I think if we are going to have tax cuts, they should be focused on \nthose in the lower and middle-income categories, the millions who have \nbeen left behind by the original tax cut package which Congress passed \na few months ago, and others who need a helping hand. It is by \ninvigorating our economy in this way that I think we will see the \nrestoration of consumer confidence.\n  I hope this Congress not only passes the Carnahan amendment to help \nthe specific employees but goes on to pass an economic stimulus package \nwhich can be helpful as well. How can we do it? One suggestion is a \nmoratorium on the FICA tax, a holiday on the FICA tax. It means a 7 or \n8 percent increase in pay for every employee in America. That means \nmore money to take home when it is payday, more money to spend, I hope, \nto get this economy moving. That is something that can be done quickly \nand across the board.\n  The one thing Congress usually fails to do is come up with a solution \nin a timely fashion. Sadly, we don't have time on our side. We have \nstarted the holiday buying season and purchasing season across America. \nWe need to do something this month, in October, or early November that \nwill tell people they are going to have more resources to deal with \nmeeting the needs of their family and planning for the holidays. That \nmeans doing something immediately. Putting a moratorium on the FICA tax \nis one of those things. It will be seen in the next paycheck. People \nwill know it instantly.\n  There are also suggestions of State sales tax holidays. That is \nsomething we ought to explore. Of course, the Federal Government would \ncompensate the State and local governments for the loss of revenue from \nsales tax, but it would mean a reduction in price of many products \nwhich people might turn around and buy.\n  These are reasonable suggestions. I also think we ought to consider \nin the economic stimulus package tax benefits to businesses which are \nnow making necessary investments in security. These investments are \nimportant. They are absolutely critical in light of the September 11 \nattack, and we ought to help these businesses--whether it is in \nsurveillance cameras or additional security personnel. Unfortunately, \nthose acquisitions do not add to productivity; they just take from the \nbottom line. If we can help businesses get through this, then they may \nnot be forced to lay off people because of the pressures they face as a \nresult of the recession we are currently experiencing.\n\n  So I say to my colleagues, as you consider all the possibilities of \nwhat we might do this week, don't forget the people on the front line. \nDon't forget the aviation and airline employees. We were good to their \ncompanies when we should have been. I was happy to cast my vote that \nway. But I believe we should not forget the men and women who make up \nthe employee workforce of the aviation and airline industry. I am going \nto support the Carnahan amendment and recommend all my colleagues do \nthe same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask my friend, would he be willing to yield me 3 \nminutes following completion of the remarks of my colleague? Would he \nyield me 3 minutes once the Senator finishes?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the Senator from California, there are at \nleast one, perhaps two Senators on this side of the aisle who wish to \nspeak.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would they be willing to yield me the 3 minutes?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will agree to that if following the 8 minutes I \nwill have the opportunity to give Senator Allard 10 minutes, and then I \nwill take the rest of my time according to--let me just ask how much \ntime is remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. JOHNSON). There remains 23 minutes 48 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If I could have some time following the Senator from \nCalifornia, I agree to that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I can do this in less than 5 minutes because it feels \nas if every day, day after day after day, week after week after week, I \nhave been on the floor to speak to the question of simple justice, \nwhich is to make sure we provide help to aviation employees.\n  I am starting to regret that I just didn't hold up the $15 billion \npackage for the industry. I want to support the industry. I think it \nwas the right thing to do. But I knew then--I have been here long \nenough--that this was some leverage that we had to make sure the \nemployees were included.\n  I don't think the aviation industry was exaggerating their \ndifficulty. We were very worried about what was going to happen, but I \nknew we would\n\n[[Page S10505]]\n\nhave some leverage for employees. But on the basis of commitments that \nhad been made from other Senators that surely we were going to help the \nemployees, I thought: Let's go forward and help the aviation industry. \nSurely there will not be any opposition to helping the employees.\n  We have 4,500 Northwest employees out of work. There is also Sun \nCountry; there is Mesaba Airlines. There are other aviation employees \nout of work as well. I find it hard to believe that we do not have \nenough heart here to provide the help for them.\n  We have an aviation airline safety bill on the floor with Senator \nHollings providing great leadership. It is an important piece of \nlegislation and must be passed. It makes all the sense in the world to \nsupport the Carnahan amendment. For people who are in a lot of economic \npain, the Carnahan amendment says do three things: No. 1, extend the \nunemployment benefits up to a year; No. 2, since the economy is fluid \nand some people may want to get skills for other jobs that are \navailable, make sure you have the workforce development; No. 3, and I \nargue most important of all, since it is terrifying not only to be out \nof work but to know in a couple of months you are not going to have any \nhealth care coverage for yourself and your loved ones, provide up to 12 \nmonths of helping these families afford health care coverage for \nthemselves and their children.\n  Is this too much to support now? Instead, we have a second-degree \namendment. I will not get into ANWR. Some of my colleagues are so much \nin a rush to help the oil industry, so much in a rush to do something \nthat is environmentally reckless--it doesn't have a heck of a lot to do \nwith what we need to do by way of having an independent energy policy--\nanything that can be done to block help for hard-pressed employees who \nare out of work. This doesn't make sense.\n  I was convinced 2 weeks ago when we passed this package for the \ncompanies that there would not be any resistance at all. I said \nyesterday--I will say it again--99.9 percent of the people in Minnesota \nbelieve that we should not only help the industry, but we should be \nhelping the employees. Mr. President, 99 percent of the people in \nMinnesota believe it is a matter of elementary justice and fairness. \nApparently too many Senators do not get it, and they are blocking this \nassistance.\n  If this is the dividing line between Democrats and Republicans, I am \nproud to be a Democrat. Better yet would be if we had the support of \nevery single Senator, which would be the right thing to do, but \napparently we have an all-out effort to block this package.\n  I wish my colleagues had such passion and had such a heart not to \noppose helping people who are flat on their backs but to help them \ninstead. And the Senator from Illinois is right. Actually the sooner we \ndo this the better because the fact is, we are in a recession in our \ncountry. It is a deep recession. It has cut across a broad section of \nthe population--certainly in Minnesota, way beyond the aviation \nindustry. There are lots of small businesses and lots of other \nemployees--tourism, you name it--and the fact is, we need to pass an \neconomic stimulus package. We need to pass an economic stimulus package \nthat puts the purchasing power back into the hands of working \nfamilies--whether it be tax rebates vis-a-vis payroll tax that helps \nthem or whether it be a massive school construction program where we \nrepair buildings that have been crumbling and create jobs; whether it \nbe affordable housing and we create jobs; whether it be extending \nunemployment benefits; getting the health care benefits; whether or not \nwe do a lot of other things that will help employees support their \nfamilies and buy in this economy.\n\n  The sooner the better. We ought to be supporting the Carnahan \namendment as an important first step.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this country gives trade adjustment \nassistance to workers when they lose their jobs due to trade. I support \nthat. We all seem to support that. But it is shocking to me that a \nnumber of people in this Senate today do not support such assistance \nbecause of terrorism, an attack on our country, on our people, on our \nworkers. It is stunning to me.\n  You will hear every excuse in the book about why it doesn't belong on \nthis bill. People cannot pay their mortgages; they have been laid off. \nThey cannot pay their health insurance; they have been laid off.\n  Let me read to you simply a letter that went out from one of my \nairlines, American Eagle:\n\n       Unfortunately, due to the circumstances of this national \n     emergency which are beyond our control, it may be necessary \n     to close or reduce the size of some of our business \n     locations. This will cause some or all American Eagle \n     personnel at those locations to be laid off. Because American \n     Eagle's future rests on how well we can rebound from our \n     current situation, we cannot say at this time how long these \n     layoffs may last.\n\n  We gave the airlines a huge package. I supported it. I still support \nit. But I assumed we would follow it up to help those people who make \nthose airlines run. I am shocked, stunned, and in disbelief that we are \nnot here as patriotic Americans, both sides of the aisle, standing up \nfor the patriotic workers who lost their jobs because of an attack on \nthe United States of America.\n  I will look at this vote very carefully. It will hurt my heart if we \ndon't win this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes of my remaining \ntime to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Allen pertaining to the introduction of S. 1532 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Carnahan amendment which \naddresses the issues faced by employees who have been dislocated as a \nresult of the September 11 terrorist attacks against the United States. \nWhile we have not yet determined the full impact of the events of \nSeptember 11 on our economy, the preliminary information from the \nDepartment of Labor estimates that over 200,000 U.S. jobs were \neliminated in September. This includes a first-time unemployment claim \nincrease of over 7,700 jobs in my own State of Michigan. Expectations \nare that the October unemployment claim numbers will be even higher. \nMany of these workers were individuals employed in the airline and \ntravel related industries. The Carnahan amendment will help these \nworkers by providing extended income support, training benefits and \nhealth care benefits.\n  The issue of assisting dislocated workers should have been addressed \nlast month when we passed legislation to assist the airline industry at \na price tag of $15 billion. But over the objections of many of us, \nprovisions to assist workers in the airline and travel industry were \ntaken out of the airline industry assistance bill. We cannot continue \nto sit by idly while thousands of American workers lose their jobs \nbecause of the actions of terrorists. We now have an opportunity to \nassist workers who have been devastated economically by the tragic \nevents of September 11. Senators who oppose assisting those workers \nshould at least allow the Senate to debate the issue openly and vote \nquickly on the bill on its merits.\n  The Carnahan amendment specifically addresses the current economic \nsituation of employees of airlines, commercial aircraft manufacturers, \nsuppliers to airlines and airports. This bill currently has bipartisan \nsupport and over 35 cosponsors. I would like to commend Senator \nCarnahan for her tireless efforts to assist dislocated workers.\n  The Carnahan amendment would provide individuals who exhaust their \n26-week eligibility for State unemployment insurance an additional 20 \nweeks of cash payments funded entirely by the Federal Government. The \nbill would also allow individuals who do not meet their States' \nrequirements for unemployment insurance to receive 26 weeks of \nfederally financed unemployment insurance.\n  The bill would also allow individuals who would not be expected to \nreturn to their jobs within the airline industry to become eligible for \nretraining benefits. Individuals who would not be expected to return to \ntheir jobs, but who\n\n[[Page S10506]]\n\nmay find some alternative job within the airline industry, would be \neligible for upgrade training.\n  Finally under the provisions of the Carnahan amendment, the Federal \nGovernment would fully reimburse eligible individuals for their COBRA \npremiums so they can continue to be fully insured. Individuals who do \nnot qualify for COBRA and are otherwise uninsured would be eligible for \nMedicaid with the Federal Government covering 100 percent of the \npremiums. These health care benefits would last for a maximum of 12 \nmonths.\n  I can't stress enough the importance of assisting these dislocated \nworkers. The tragedy of September 11 has brought American families \ncloser together and given us all an opportunity to help those who have \nbeen directly affected by the terrorist attacks. I hope that in the \nSenate's newly found spirit of bipartisanship, we can agree to help \nthose American workers who urgently need our assistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 3 additional minutes, for a total of 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, this Senate has acted swiftly and with \nunity in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks. We provided \n$40 billion to begin the relief effort. We authorized the President to \nuse force in pursuing the terrorists and the nations that harbor them. \nAnd we created a $15 billion relief package to help stabilize our \nNation's airlines.\n  I have been very proud of the manner in which this body has acted \nover the last month, but we have not yet acted on behalf of the tens of \nthousands of Americans who have lost their jobs as a result of these \nattacks. Now is the time to do something for the workers.\n  Before we passed the airline stabilization bill, I came to this \nChamber on several occasions to argue on behalf of including assistance \nto displaced workers as part of that package, but in an effort to pass \nthe bill expeditiously, I was asked to withhold my amendment. So I did. \nThat was the right thing to do.\n  We cannot delay any longer. Some of my colleagues have spoken in \nopposition to my amendment, by arguing that we have already helped \nairline workers by providing assistance to airlines. That is only half \nright. By helping the airlines avoid bankruptcy, we saved many jobs. \nHowever, we have not done anything for the families of the 140,000 \nairline industry employees who are losing their jobs despite the \nairline stabilization package.\n  The $15 billion we gave to the airlines is not helping those families \npay their mortgage. That money is not helping them put food on the \ndinner table. And that money certainly is not helping them pay for \nhealth insurance for their families. The modest assistance provided in \nthis amendment will help these families deal with a tough situation.\n  There are hundreds of thousands of Americans who are losing their \njobs. Some of my colleagues have asked why we should provide special \nassistance to airline workers.\n  First, let me say, I am eager to work with President Bush and my \ncolleagues to provide assistance to all displaced workers as a part of \nthe economic stimulus package. This vote is not a choice between my \nplan and the President's plan. We can do both. I believe we must \naddress airline workers separately, and now.\n  Furthermore, current law already treats some displaced workers \ndifferently than others. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Program \nprovides special benefits to workers who have lost their jobs as a \nresult of increased imports. Over 1 million workers have benefitted \nfrom this program. I am glad they did. But let's be clear; they \nreceived a better benefit package than other laid off workers. If we \ncan provide these benefits to aid workers who lost jobs due to trade, \ncan't we do so for workers who lost their jobs due to terrorism?\n  The amendment we are about to vote on would provide similar benefits \nto airline industry workers who have lost their jobs as a result of the \nSeptember 11 attacks.\n  The more than 140,000 airline industry employees who are being laid \noff have been dealt a terrible blow. I don't know how many Members of \nthis body know what it is like to be a child in a family with a laid \noff worker. I do. My grandparents, with whom I lived for many years, \nwhen my parents worked, lived in this very city. I can recall a time \nwhen my grandfather, a carpenter, came home and sat in the kitchen and \nsaid to my grandmother: I have been laid off. I remember her tears, and \nI remember their fears, as they did not know what the future held for \nthem.\n  It is time we gave to these workers of America's airlines a sense of \nconfidence that their future is assured. This is our chance to send a \nmessage to the workers of America that we know they are facing hard \ntimes, we want to help, and this Senate stands ready to take action.\n  It is not enough to say, wait for the next piece of legislation, and \nthe next after that. It is not enough to say that we have to move on to \nother pressing business. This measure deserves an up-or-down vote on \nits merits, not a filibuster.\n  I urge my colleagues to let the Senate vote on this amendment, and I \nurge a vote in favor of cloture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Carnahan for her \namendment. I congratulate her and express my appreciation for her \nefforts on behalf of employees of the airlines who have suffered \ndirectly as a result of Federal action.\n  I am sympathetic to the needs of the displaced workers who she and so \nmany of our colleagues want to address. I say this to the Senator: I \nbelieve this issue has to be addressed. There are people who, as a \nresult of Federal action, were put out of work. That is a fact.\n  I cannot support this amendment. For one reason, Senator Hollings and \nI made a commitment; and we made that commitment because, if we allow \none amendment that is not germane to this bill, then there is no reason \nwhy we should not allow numerous others, which is the same reason why I \nwill oppose any other amendment, including the Murkowski-Smith \namendment.\n  But I hope we can work together. I think Senator Carnahan's amendment \nneeds to be narrowed dramatically. I think it can be addressed to \nspecific individuals who have been affected by Federal action. I \nbelieve in the Senator's amendment there are some employees who are not \ndirectly impacted who would receive help that may not be necessary.\n  I also submit that both the airlines and the employees needed to be \nhelped. We did give financial assistance to the airlines, and we do \nneed to move forward. I know the chairman shares my views that we need \nto move forward on that issue.\n  I agree that we still need to provide assistance to workers who have \nbeen laid off as a result of these attacks. The appropriate amount, \nnature, and recipients of Federal assistance for the unemployed is a \ndifficult and inevitably contentious issue.\n  Last night Senator Gramm criticized the Carnahan amendment for being \nunfairly narrow because it only helps certain industry sectors where \nworkers have been laid off as a result of the September 11 attacks and \ndoes not address hotel workers, restaurant workers, transportation \nservice workers, travel agents, and many others whose layoffs can be \nattributed to terrorist actions. I do not agree with that comment.\n  I understand that the benefits provided under the expanded trade \nadjustment assistance model are over and above traditional unemployment \nassistance available to other displaced employees.\n  In addition to concerns about the scope of the amendment--which may \nbe overinclusive in some respects and underinclusive in others--I think \nthere are very significant practical problems that render the amendment \nfundamentally unworkable.\n  The Carnahan amendment charges the Department of Labor with paying \n100 percent of eligible workers' COBRA premiums and suggests these \npremiums be made directly to insurance providers. I understand, \nhowever, that\n\n[[Page S10507]]\n\nLabor simply has no mechanism in place for doing this. Determining \nCOBRA eligibility; verifying the amounts that are owed to insurers on \nbehalf of tens of thousands of workers; to whom it is owed; and how it \nis to be paid is not something that can be turned around overnight. If \nthe intention is to provide laid off workers with benefits in the near \nterm, the Carnahan COBRA compensation mechanism does not seem very \nworkable to me.\n  But having addressed some of the concerns I have with it, let me \nreiterate again, however, that I agree with what Senator Carnahan and \nothers are doing in trying to provide assistance to workers who have \nbeen laid off as a result of the terrorist attacks.\n  I look forward to working with her and others.\n  I say to Senator Carnahan, no matter how this amendment is taken care \nof--and I believe that the required 60 votes will not be obtained by \nthe sponsor of the amendment--the issue is not going away. I know that \nSenator Hollings and I are committed to working with the Senator. We \nhave taken care of the shareholders and the airline executives and the \nairlines themselves. Now we need to take care of the unfortunate \nvictims of this terrorist attack.\n  I hope Senator Carnahan recognizes that it is not out of a lack of \nsympathy, but we simply have to move forward because the safety and \nsecurity of Americans on airliners is the most important and paramount \nfactor, and the reason why this legislation is on the floor, as we \nspeak--safety and security. That is why this amendment has to be \nrejected at this time, in my opinion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, is there time remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague, Senator \nMcCain. I support much of what is in the Carnahan amendment, but this \nis not the right vehicle for it. It has not yet been determined how \nmuch we need to do and how we should do it. We need to work that out.\n  I will be working with Senator Allen, Senator Carnahan, and others to \nassure we have the help we need for displaced workers. Right now, if we \nare going to keep jobs in the aviation industry, we need to pass the \nAviation Security Act. If something is going to keep the bill from \nhaving the strong support of the Senate, then we will get bogged down \nin that amendment.\n  Let's get these people back to work. The way we get them back to work \nis for people in America to be secure in flying again. That is what our \nbill will do. It is going to provide a security system that gives \npeople confidence that they will be safe when they fly. If we can bring \nthe people back to flying again, we will bring the jobs back on the \nmarket. That is what these people want. They want to work for the same \nairline, the aircraft manufacturing company or the hotel that they \nleft. The way to keep those jobs is to bring the public back to flying \nagain.\n  We want business as usual in our country. We want the economy to \nstabilize. We want to get those people back on the job. They would \nrather work than collect unemployment benefits. We can put them to work \nif we can pass this aviation security bill. We are very close. If we \ncan keep from starting a process of having extraneous amendments on \nthis bill, we will be able to pass it because we will be able to take \namendments, vote on them, and pass the bill. I hope we will be able to \ndo that tonight.\n  I thank everybody who has cooperated so much on the bill. I look \nforward to working on passage of the bill after we have taken the stand \nthat we will not allow extraneous amendments.\n  I ask the distinguished Senator from Arizona if it would be proper to \nyield back the time and start the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). All time is yielded back. Under \nthe previous order, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Daschle \n     amendment No. 1855 to S. 1447, the Aviation Security bill:\n         Harry Reid, Bob Graham, Bob Torricelli, Jean Carnahan, \n           Jeff Bingaman, Maria Cantwell, Richard J.

On this vote, the yeas are 56, \nthe nays are 44. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is clear a majority of the Senate \nwants to act in favor of taking some action for those directly affected \nby the shutdown of America's airlines after September 11. So if a \nmajority of the Senate has expressed their will, I strongly suggest we \nsit down and negotiate a reasonable package. We did take care of the \nairlines in a very generous package. Now we need to move forward with \nan agreement that would get at least 60 votes so we can address the \nneeds and plight of 100,000 employees, at least, who have been rendered \nunemployed by the September 11 events.\n  I voted to not invoke cloture on this amendment. I intend to work \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle so we can come up with a \nreasonable package to compensate individuals who were directly affected \nby an act of the Federal Government. That is what we are talking about. \nThat is what we are talking about. I always thought one of the \nobligations of government was to care of those who were affected by \nevents and decisions beyond their control. It was a decision of the \nFederal Government, and a right one, to shut down the airlines of \nAmerica, including 3 weeks at Reagan National Airport.\n  I want to work with my colleagues and get this legislation in a \npackage that can be agreed to by, hopefully, all, including the \nadministration. I believe very strongly we need to act on it. I don't \nwant to be repetitive except to say we should have a sense of urgency \nabout 100,000 employees who were rendered unemployed just as we did \nover the plight of the airlines and their shareholders and executives, \nas well as the American flying public.\n  Very shortly we will hopefully move to an amendment from Senator \nSmith\n\n[[Page S10508]]\n\nand Senator Murkowski. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, with the consent of the two managers of \nthe bill, we have three people who wish to speak on the vote that just \ntook place. I ask unanimous consent Senators Dodd, Cantwell, and Reid \nbe allowed to speak for a total of up to 15 minutes, and prior to that, \nSenator Murkowski will introduce his amendment. As soon as we finish \nwith the three speeches, we will move to the Smith-Murkowski amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I failed to acknowledge we still have \npending the Carnahan amendment. So what I would ask in the consent is \nwe temporarily set aside the Carnahan amendment; that we go to the \nMurkowski amendment, but at such time as the majority leader, who \noffered the amendment on behalf of Senator Carnahan, comes to the \nfloor, that he be recognized to take whatever appropriate action on the \nunderlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1863\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, it is my intention to propose \namendment No. 1863, about which I have already spoken at some length. \nThis particular amendment allows, under the circumstances, the \nextension to commercial airline pilots the right to fly beyond the age \nof 60 to the age of 63. It is my intention to ask for a recorded vote \non the amendment.\n  I ask that the clerk report the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1863.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n           (Purpose: To establish age limitations for airmen)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. AGE AND OTHER LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (A) General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     beginning on the date that is 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act--\n       (1) section 121.383(c) of title 14, Code of Federal \n     Regulations shall not apply;\n       (2) no certificate holder may use the services of any \n     person as a pilot on an airplane engaged in operations under \n     part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, if that \n     person is 63 years of age or older; and\n       (3) no person may serve as a pilot on an airplane engaged \n     in operations under part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, if that person is 63 years of age or older.\n       (b) Certificate Holder.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term ``certificate holder'' means a holder of a certificate \n     to operate as an air carrier or commercial operator issued by \n     the Federal Aviation Administration.\n       (c) Reservation of Safety Authority.--Nothing in this \n     section is intended to change the authority of the Federal \n     Aviation Administration to take steps to ensure the safety of \n     air transportation operations involving a pilot who has \n     reached the age of 60, including its authority--\n       (1) to require such a pilot to undergo additional or more \n     stringent medical, cognitive, or proficiency testing in order \n     to retain certification; or\n       (2) to establish crew pairing standards for crews with such \n     a pilot.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, it is my understanding at a time \nagreed upon by the floor leaders, Senator Smith will be recognized to \noffer a first-degree amendment for himself as well as Senator Murkowski \nregarding cockpit security, and no second-degree amendments will be in \norder.\n  I further ask consent that there be 20 minutes for debate equally \ndivided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of the \ntime, the amendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, is this the amendment we \nanticipated coming up?\n  I have no objection.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1855\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, if I may, I want to take a couple of \nminutes to express my disappointment at the Senate's failure to invoke \ncloture and to allow for the consideration of the Carnahan amendment. I \nam saddened, in the midst of this otherwise harmonious relationship we \nhave been developing, that we would deny the opportunity to have a \nvote, an up-or-down vote, where 51 votes would win, 50 or fewer would \ncause the amendment to fail. We are not even going to have a chance for \na straight vote on the amendment being offered by the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Let me tell you why I am disappointed. First, I think the country \nhas, with almost unanimity, watched the Congress of the United States \nand the President of the United States work in a fashion unprecedented \nfor those of us who are today serving here. There are some whose \nservice goes back many years. But I suggest even for those with the \nlongest service in the Senate, they could not recall a time during \ntheir service when we have been as united as a people and as united as \npublic servants as we are today.\n  With that as a backdrop, it was terribly disappointing to me to see \nus walk away from those individuals who every day go to work and try to \nmake our airlines work as well as they can. We all stood together \nhere--with the exception of 1 vote--when the airline industry came up \nand said, we need some help. We did not get involved in filibusters or \ndemanding 30 hours of debate. Democrats and Republicans, with the \nexception of one of our colleagues, raised their hands and cast their \nvotes ``aye'' to help out this industry.\n  The suggestion was made during that debate that we could not do \nanything to help out the workers right away but we would do it as soon \nas we could. So we said: Fine, with that kind of a general assurance, \nwe will vote to bail out the shareholders--in effect. That is what we \ndid. I voted for that bill, and I am glad I did. I think it was \nnecessary because not just the airlines but other industries that \ndepend upon a healthy airline service would be adversely affected as \nwell.\n\n  But to turn around and say to the thousands of people who have lost \ntheir jobs, whose home mortgages, car payments and health care benefits \nare in jeopardy--you must go find a meaningful level of employment in \nan economy that was already in trouble before September 11. Mr. \nPresident, I do not understand this Chamber that could find in its \npockets enough money to bail out a shareholder and yet couldn't find \nthe small change to bail out innocent people.\n  This has been tough enough on our country over the last month. We \nhave seen today at the Pentagon, and elsewhere, memorial services to \nrecognize the contribution of those who lost their lives. That is \nappropriate and proper.\n  I listened to the eloquent words of the Secretary of Defense, and the \neloquent speech of the President to the employees at the Pentagon, and \nto the world, for that matter.\n  But it is our obligation as well, not only to recognize those who \nhave given their lives but to also recognize the living and what they \nare going through. The idea that you cannot have a simple vote on \nwhether or not you are going to extend unemployment insurance for an \nadditional number of weeks; that you are not going to provide for COBRA \ncontinuation coverage for individuals--I do not understand that.\n  What happened to us in the last couple of weeks? When it comes to \nthose at the very top of the income spectrum, with all due respect, \nthey are not the ones suffering from the airline industry problems. But \nthe idea that the majority of people who lose their jobs have little or \nno value is something I do not understand.\n  My hope is that we have a vote on this issue and those who did not \nvote\n\n[[Page S10509]]\n\nfor cloture would cast a vote in favor of the thousands who have lost \ntheir jobs and find themselves and their families in a very precarious \nsituation.\n  Individuals who do not qualify for extended health insurance under \nCOBRA and who are otherwise uninsured would be eligible for Medicaid, \nwith the Federal Government covering 100 percent of the premiums. For a \nfew weeks, to get people back on their feet, could we not find it in \nour hearts to extend to them the kind of help they need?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I took to the floor earlier, in a brief moment that I \nhad, and I made the connection between trade adjustment assistance and \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reid). The time of the Senator from \nConnecticut has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I made the connection between trade adjustment assistance \nand this bill, which Senator Carnahan based on the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Act. I ask my friend, doesn't he think if we can help people \nwhen they lose their job because of trade, we should help people when \nthey lose their job because of a terrorist attack on this country? I \nask him, doesn't it seem ironic that somehow, when you lose your job \nbecause of trade, you get the help, but not if it is a result of a \nterrorist attack?\n  Mr. DODD. I think the Senator from California raises a very good \nquestion, and one that she provides the answer for in her question.\n  Obviously, over the years, we have said to people, if you lose your \njob because of trade policies--which we think have a long-term \nbeneficial effect on the country and we see something good come out of \nthat--if you lose your job because we are trying to achieve a greater \ngood, we will step into that breach and provide some assistance to you \nand your family.\n  How ironic that when something terrible happens and you lose your \njob, we can't provide benefits to help you and your family during \ndifficult times.\n  I am stunned by this. I thought this was going to be a non-issue. I \ncould see where people might want to modify this a bit. Instead of 52 \nweeks, make it 45 weeks; instead of 100 percent of Medicaid, we will \nmake it 90 percent.\n  I can understand people making a case that we need to modify the \nCarnahan amendment. But not to provide for any kind of alternative is \nsomething that just gets away.\n  We have to finish the bill. I know the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee has an awful burden to get this done. He has argued very \npersuasively that we have a responsibility to meet the security needs.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I understand the sense of urgency to get this done. I am \nsure my friend from South Carolina would not argue with that coming up \nrather quickly as we did with the airline bailout. That didn't take \nlong. We managed to find the time around here to come up with the time \nto debate it, discuss it, and work it out. Again, I voted for that \nbill. I would again today. I don't argue with that at all.\n  But I am stunned that we can't find the time somehow to say to those \nthousands of workers--baggage handlers, flight attendants, and \nmechanics--who have lost their jobs and are wondering how they are \ngoing to make ends meet--we have time for everybody but you. Everybody \nelse got in line. But you don't. We are sending the message that we \ndon't have enough time to take care of you.\n  I am terribly disappointed that our colleagues have decided to reject \nthis cloture motion. But I tell you that people out there have lost \ntheir jobs. Millions of other Americans are watching this vote to see \nwhat we did to average people out there on this day, 1 month later. We \nmemorialize those who lost their lives but this Chamber couldn't find \nin its heart to come up with a few extra dollars to help some people \nwho have lost their work.\n  That is a sad day. That is not the way to commemorate those who gave \nso much 1 month ago. I am deeply disappointed in my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Boxer). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I also rise with a great deal of \nfrustration over the last vote where the majority of my colleagues in \nthe Senate want to act to help workers who have been impacted by the \nacts of September 11 and the emergency that has prevailed; that we do \nsomething to help those who have been most impacted by job layoffs by \ncutbacks in major industries related to transportation; and that we act \nimmediately.\n  I am very frustrated, even though a majority of my colleagues want to \nsee such legislation passed to help workers who are going to be laid \noff, who are going to have to struggle with how to pay for health \ninsurance, who will not have the assistance for job training that might \nput them back in the economy sooner, that they are going to be without \nassistance. They are going to be without that assistance, even though a \nmajority of my colleagues wanted to see that legislation passed, \nbecause we could not get this cloture vote in the Senate today.\n  I ask, if not now, when?\n  We were told after the events of September 11, when everybody wanted \nto work in a bipartisan fashion to expedite the decisionmaking in the \nSenate, that we needed to band together. We did. We acted quickly on \nlegislation to help and assist the airline industry. I think the vote \nwas 98 to 0.\n  At that same time, we were told we need to act now to help the \nindustry. We will come back to help workers. So with earnest, Senator \nCarnahan, Senator Kennedy, myself, and Senator Murray from Washington \nhave been working diligently on this proposal.\n  Today we are sending the wrong message to the American people. We are \nsending the message that this body thinks it is more important to help \nthe corporate executives and the shareholders of the airline industry \nthan it is to help the American workers. That is absolutely the wrong \nmessage.\n  When you think about it, consumer confidence counts for about two-\nthirds of our economy. In the past month of September, consumer \nconfidence has been at its all-time low since 1996.\n  This is an economic issue. Just as the assistance package for the \nairlines was an economic issue, this assistance to the workers is an \neconomic issue. Instead of working together in a bipartisan fashion, we \nshowed our partisan colors today by not allowing this vote to take \nplace. The majority of Senators wish this legislation would have \npassed.\n  In Washington State, where 20,000 to 30,000 workers could be laid off \nby the end of next year, the impact will be real. Some estimates are \nthat a $1.29 billion loss will be felt by our local economy. That is \nquite significant in the State of Washington where we have already been \nfeeling the impact of the downturn in the economy.\n  When you think about the individual workers, yes, they will receive \nsome unemployment benefits. What about health care? When you think \nabout it, a typical worker in the aerospace industry might make $40,000 \nto $50,000. Yet the impact of losing that income and having \nunemployment insurance is not being able to pay for health care \nbenefits. An average worker with a family might pay as much as $850 a \nmonth for the loss of health care benefits, on top of other bills they \nhave to pay--for their mortgage, for their food, and for their \nchildren's education.\n  We are sending a terrible message that it is more important to help \ncorporate executives and shareholders than to care about the \neducational needs of the airline workers in our country. That is the \nwrong message.\n  We need to move ahead in a bipartisan fashion to think about the \nripple effect on our economy. It is not just the airline manufacturing \nindustry, as I said, with 20,000 to 30,000 layoffs, but the hundred-\nplus thousand layoffs in the airline industry overall. That impact on \nour economy at a time when our economy is already seeing a downturn is \nnot the kind of message we need to be sending.\n  It is very important that we move ahead. If not now, when will we act \nto support workers in this country in their time of need?\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S10510]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the majority leader is now in the Chamber. \nI am not going to use the 5 minutes allocated to me under the previous \norder. I ask unanimous consent that the time be given to the majority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I come to the floor to express my grave \ndisappointment at what the Senate has just done.\n  This is the first time we have said no to any of the victims of \ndisaster of 1 month ago. It is the first time we have said no to \nworking families struggling to put their lives back together.\n  I am troubled, disappointed, and disillusioned.\n  I will say this: We will not give up. We will not quit. We will not \nallow those workers to in any way believe that this country is going to \nturn its back on them when they need it the most. We will help them. We \nwill find a way to do this. We will keep the fight. We are committed, \nas people determined to help all of those who are hurting so badly, \nincluding those who have no job, including those who have no health \ninsurance, including those who need training today--including all of \nthose victims. We cannot say no to these people. We will be back. We \nwill not give up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, under the previous order, it is now my \nunderstanding we are going to go to the Smith-Murkowski amendment on a \n20-minute time agreement; is that right?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1874\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I have amendment No. \n1874 at the desk, and I ask for its immediate consideration as \ndescribed under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], for himself, \n     Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Thurmond, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1874.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To further provide for the safety of American aviation and \n                     the suppression of terrorism)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . FLIGHT DECK SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Title.--This Section may be cited as the `Flight Deck \n     Security Act of 2001'.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked four \n     civilian aircraft, crashing two of the aircraft into the \n     towers of the World Trade Center in New York, New York, and a \n     third into the Pentagon outside Washington, District of \n     Columbia.\n       (2) Thousands of innocent Americans and citizens of other \n     countries were killed or injured as a result of these \n     attacks, including the passengers and crew of the four \n     aircraft, workers in the World Trade Center and in the \n     Pentagon, rescue workers, and bystanders.\n       (3) These attacks destroyed both towers of the World Trade \n     Center, as well as adjacent buildings, and seriously damaged \n     the Pentagon.\n       (4) These attacks were by far the deadliest terrorist \n     attacks ever launched against the United States and, by \n     targeting symbols of America, clearly were intended to \n     intimidate our Nation and weaken its resolve.\n       (5) Armed pilots, co-pilots, and flight engineers with \n     proper training will be the last line of defense against \n     terrorists by providing cockpit security and aircraft \n     security.\n       (6) Secured doors separating the flight deck from the \n     passenger cabin have been effective in deterring hijackings \n     in other nations and will serve as a deterrent to future \n     contemplated acts of terrorism in the United States.\n       (c) Aviation Safety and the Suppression of Terrorism by \n     Commercial Aircraft.--\n       (1) Possession of firearms on commercial flights.--The FAA \n     is authorized to permit a pilot, co-pilot, or flight engineer \n     of a commercial aircraft who has successfully completed the \n     requirements of section (c)(2) of this Act, who is not \n     otherwise prohibited by law from possessing a firearm, from \n     possessing or carrying a firearm approved by the FAA for the \n     protection of the aircraft under procedures or regulations as \n     necessary, to ensure the safety and integrity of flight.\n       (2) Federal pilot officers.--\n       (A) In addition to the protections provided by the section \n     (c)(1) of this Act, the FAA shall also establish a voluntary \n     program to train and supervise commercial airline pilots.\n       (B) Under the program, the FAA shall make available \n     appropriate training and supervision for all such pilots, \n     which may include training by private entities.\n       (C) The power granted to such persons shall be limited to \n     enforcing Federal law in the cockpit of commercial aircraft \n     and, under reasonable circumstances the passenger compartment \n     to protect the integrity of the commercial aircraft and the \n     lives of the passengers.\n       (D) The FAA shall make available appropriate training to \n     any qualified pilot who requests such training pursuant to \n     this Act.\n       (E) The FAA may prescribe regulations for purposes of this \n     section.\n       (d) Reports to Congress.--Not later than six months after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, and every six months \n     thereafter, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit to \n     Congress a report on the effectiveness of the requirements in \n     this section in facilitating commercial aviation safety and \n     the suppression of terrorism by commercial aircraft.''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I say to my colleagues, \nI will be very brief. If there are others who wish to speak, they may \nwant to come to the Chamber. We have only, as I understand it, 20 \nminutes equally divided.\n  This amendment, I say to my colleagues, is the one that has been \nknown as the gun-in-the-cockpits amendment. I am pleased to report \nthat, to the best of my knowledge, the Senate has agreed to accept this \namendment, which I think is good news for the airline industry and good \nnews for all of us who fly across America, and all over the world, as a \nmatter of fact.\n  First of all, I thank my colleagues, Senator Murkowski and Senator \nBurns, for their leadership, and also Senator Thurmond for working with \nme to put this amendment together. Also, Senator McCain and Senator \nHollings were very helpful as we worked out the compromise so we could \noffer this amendment without a lot of rancor.\n  The motto of my legislation is that armed pilots are the first line \nof deterrence and the last line of defense--the first line of \ndeterrence because terrorists will know that armed pilots will be able \nto defend the cockpit and defend the aircraft from a hijacking; the \nlast line of defense because when all else fails, including the air \nmarshals and perhaps even a reinforced cockpit door, an armed pilot \nwill be in the cockpit to defend that cockpit from terrorist hijackers.\n  I think it is important for us to think and reflect back on what has \nhappened in the past month. We all know what happened on September 11. \nThose terrorists got in that cockpit, and the pilots had no defense \nonce that door was kicked in, except their bare hands. We have had \nanother----\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senate is not in order, and I am extremely interested \nin hearing about the content of this amendment. I hope the Senate can \nbe in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Senators will take \ntheir conversations to the back of the Chamber.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Senator from California for \nher courtesy.\n  In the last week, we have had another incident--not a terrorist \nincident but one where a person got into the cockpit and caused the \nplane to be destabilized momentarily.\n  I think it is important to understand, after all of the events of \nSeptember 11, and all of the efforts we have made to encourage and \nbring people back to flying again, we still had another incident where \na person actually got into the cockpit.\n  Now we know--and we are working on all of this--we are going to \nreinforce the cockpit doors; there will be armed marshals; we are going \nto increase security on the aircraft. All of these things are being \ndone. But I would ask my colleagues to reflect for a moment as to what \nwould happen if, in spite of all of that--in spite of all three of \nthose things: The marshals, the reinforced cockpit doors, and increased \nsecurity around the aircraft--somebody got into that cockpit again. \nThey could bring that plane down.\n\n[[Page S10511]]\n\n  If, in fact, a pilot had a gun, that pilot would have the opportunity \nto stop that hijacker or person coming into that cockpit to cause \ndamage. If the pilot could not do it, if the pilot did not have a \nweapon, and that person got into the cockpit, the worst of all things \ncould be that the hijacker would commandeer the plane and do some \nterrible destruction using the aircraft as a weapon of mass \ndestruction. But what might happen, and what could have happened last \ntime, were it not for the brave passengers on Flight 93, we could have \nto shoot down our own commercial aircraft with our own American \ncitizens in that aircraft.\n\n  It is far preferable to have the pilot shoot the hijacker and \nmaintain control of the cockpit than it is to have the hijacker get \ncontrol of the cockpit and have the President of the United States have \nto make that god-awful, gut-wrenching decision to shoot down a \ncommercial aircraft to save the lives of thousands, killing perhaps a \ncouple hundred American citizens. So this is the right thing to do.\n  The Senator from California mentioned that she wants to know the \ncontent of the amendment. The content of the amendment, I say to the \nSenator, is very reasonable. It says that the FAA is authorized to \npermit, if the airlines and the pilots would agree to do it--if they \ndid agree; no one is forced to carry a weapon into the cockpit. That is \nthe pilots' and the airlines' decision.\n  So I think it is reasonable. I have met with dozens of pilots on this \nissue, many from New Hampshire and Massachusetts, some here, from most \nof the airlines. I know there are very few who disagree with this \namendment, but the vast, overwhelming majority of the pilots, probably \n95 percent of them, agree with it. It is the right thing to do, and not \nonly for safety reasons but also, if we are going to bring back the \nairline industry and get those people back to work who have lost their \njobs, we have to bring passengers back to the airplanes; we have to \nrestore their confidence.\n  I am going to feel a lot more confident knowing that pilot is going \nto have the opportunity to stop that hijacker when that hijacker comes \nthrough that cockpit door, if he gets through the cockpit door in spite \nof all the other things we are doing.\n  So remember, this is not an amendment that is just hanging out there \nwith nothing else. This is an amendment that is working in conjunction \nwith increased airport and aircraft security, reinforced cockpit doors, \nand perhaps a Federal marshal--at least spot-checked on flights. It \ngoes with all of that. And this is the final stop, so that pilot can \nhave the assurance, with that TV camera or monitor, so he or she can \nsee what is going on in the back of that aircraft, in the cabin. At \nthat point, the pilot can turn and be prepared to face that hijacker \nwho could cause unbelievable destruction.\n  So I am pleased and proud to offer the amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Burns, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Thurmond. I know there \nare others who support it as well.\n  Madam President, I know other people would like to speak, so I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield the Senator whatever time she \nwishes to consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  Madam President, as someone who for a long time has taken the \nopposite position on guns, I think this amendment makes sense.\n  We are working toward having air marshals on our airplanes. We will \nalso be working--and I want to announce here my support of the Burns \namendment--to really move security into the Department of Justice where \nit belongs.\n  Until we do all this, I think this amendment makes sense. It gives \nthe FAA a chance to decide if they think it is prudent for a pilot, who \nis trained, and who wants to, and who is willing to, to be able to \ndefend the aircraft.\n  I just want to remind my colleagues that every single plane that was \nhijacked was going to my State of California. I want you to know that \nevery time I think about this, I think of how many people are \nsuffering. I think we need to do everything we can to prevent any more \nof these hijackings from occurring.\n  Therefore, I believe this amendment is right. I believe it is \nprudent. It also was supported in front of our Commerce Committee--I \nsee my chairman in the Chamber--by the gentleman who represented the \npilots at the last hearing we had.\n  So I thank my friend. I am supporting this amendment, as well as the \nBurns amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I yield whatever time he \nmay consume to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes remain to the sponsor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Before I yield, however, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have three letters of support printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Gun Owners of America,\n\n                                 Springfield, VA, October 3, 2001.\n       Dear Senator: Senator Bob Smith will be introducing an \n     amendment to the Aviation Security Act. I urge you to vote in \n     favor of his amendment.\n       The Smith amendment will provide the opportunity for pilots \n     to use firearms to defend their passengers and planes, as \n     well as provide for reinforcing the cockpit doors on \n     commercial aircraft.\n       I urge you to vote for the Smith amendment, as it can help \n     save the lives of pilots, crew members, and passengers--not \n     to mention the lives of thousands of citizens on the ground.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                     John Velleco,\n     Director of Federal Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Rifle Association of America, Institute for \n           Legislative Action,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 2001.\n       Dear Senator: In the aftermath of the tragedy that occurred \n     on September 11th, various proposals have been offered to \n     deal with airline security. As the United States Senate \n     begins debate on the Aviation Security Act, S. 1147, \n     amendments may be offered relating to pilot and passenger \n     security.\n       One proposal, sponsored by Senators Bob Smith and Conrad \n     Burns, addresses pilot safety by allowing--not requiring--\n     properly trained commercial pilots, co-pilots, and flight \n     engineers to carry firearms. On behalf of the 4 million \n     members of the National Rifle Association, I urge you to \n     support this common sense and well-balanced measure.\n       Armed pilots with proper training and suitable equipment \n     will be the last line of defense against hijackers and \n     terrorists in providing cockpit and aircraft security. \n     Obviously, proper training is an essential component of this \n     legislation. Along with the possibility of U.S. Air Marshals \n     accompanying commercial flights, this measure would send a \n     strong message to potential attackers that self-defense \n     exists in the air as well as on our land.\n       The National Rifle Association stands with the Air Line \n     Pilots Association and the Allied Pilots Association in \n     supporting this amendment. This measure will provide both \n     deterrence to hijackers and terrorists and safety to airline \n     employees and the traveling public. Please vote ``yes'' on \n     the Smith/Burns amendment to S. 1147.\n       Sincerely,\n                                            Charles H. Cunningham,\n     Director, NRA Federal Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Air Line Pilots\n\n\n                                   Association, International,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 2001.\n     Hon. Robert C. Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the 67,000 members of the \n     Air Line Pilots Association, International, I want to offer \n     our most sincere thanks and our support for your amendment to \n     S. 1447, which would provide for armed federal pilot \n     officers.\n       The Administration, Congress, and the industry are all \n     heavily involved in activities and discussions aimed at \n     improving security. Many of the proposed security initiatives \n     and proposals will take months, even years to implement; some \n     of them are also very expensive.\n       We have learned, in a most tragic fashion, that the \n     occupants of the cockpit must be protected in the event of a \n     cockpit door breach in order to prevent further loss of life \n     to passengers, crew, and those on the ground. Provision of \n     armed air marshals and enhanced cockpit doors will help. \n     However, not all flights will have the protection of air \n     marshals, and new, more secure cockpit doors will not be \n     installed overnight.\n       For those reasons, it is our strong belief that the last \n     line of defense must be a method of training, deputizing and \n     arming those pilots who both volunteer and qualify to carry a \n     means of lethal self-defense. Not all pilots will want to \n     carry a weapon, and some who do may not qualify under the \n     FBI's strict screening and training criteria, but there will \n     be thousands of our members who\n\n[[Page S10512]]\n\n     can meet both criteria. Once the cost of training these \n     pilots is complete, there would be virtually no other expense \n     for providing an FBI-trained federal officer in the cockpit \n     who is capable of administering lethal force.\n       In addition to adding a genuine security enhancement in the \n     very near term, the creation of a federal pilot officer \n     program would also generate a tremendous amount of confidence \n     among pilots to protect themselves and, thereby, their \n     passengers. We believe that your proposal, if implemented, \n     should also translate into greater confidence in air travel \n     security by the traveling public and help the airlines return \n     to profitability much sooner than they could otherwise.\n       In summary, we believe that your proposed federal pilot \n     officer program is a most reasonable, practical, cost-\n     effective, and efficient means of enhancing airline security. \n     ALPA supports it and we urge its enactment.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                  Duane E. Woerth,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from New Hampshire.\n  Madam President, I want to say to all those folks who would be \ncritical, this does not make it mandatory for a weapon to be on the \nflight deck. This says they are able to take one if they are \ncomfortable with one.\n\n  I point to American Airlines Flight 11, which was the first plane to \nhit the north tower. The pilot was a Vietnam veteran and the copilot \nwas a Navy Top Gun pilot. On American Airlines Flight 77, Charlie \nBurlingame was a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and a Top Gun \npilot. On United Airlines 175, which was the second plane to hit the \nsouth tower, both the pilot and copilot were veterans, one a Navy \npilot, one a Marine Corps veteran.\n  What we are saying is, if these men and women who operate the flight \ndeck are comfortable with a weapon, they should be allowed to have a \nweapon. That is what this amendment says.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his leadership and the \nSenator from California for her support.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the following letter from the Allied Pilots Association be printed \nin the Record in support of amendment No. 1874.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Allied Pilots Association,\n\n                                  Fort Worth, TX, October 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Robert Smith,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the Allied Pilots \n     Association, which represents the 11,500 pilots of American \n     Airlines, I wish to express our strong support for the \n     ``Flight Deck Security Act of 2001.''\n       We must take immediate action to enhance our nation's \n     aviation security. We believe the ``Flight Deck Security \n     Act,'' S. 1463, will help ensure the safety of both airline \n     flight crews and the flying public.\n       APA supports allowing qualified pilots to carry firearms. \n     The majority of our pilots have served in the military, where \n     they received weapons training, and many are already \n     qualified to handle small arms. Armed pilots will help deter \n     terrorists from attempting to hijack an aircraft. \n     Furthermore, they would provide a last line of defense to \n     resist the hijacking of commercial aircraft.\n       The Allied Pilots Association urges the Senate to pass the \n     ``Flight Deck Security Act.'' We believe S. 1463's voluntary \n     firearm program should be enacted immediately.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Captain John Darrah,\n                                                        President,\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, how many minutes would the Senator want?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I know there is an amendment. I want to make some \ngeneral comments about the bill. What would be the appropriate way?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily set aside the \namendment and the Senator from Maryland be allowed to speak for 5 \nminutes on the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Arizona, the national leader \non this topic.\n  Madam President, we just came from the Pentagon memorial for all of \nthose who died at the Pentagon on the fateful day, 9/11, one month ago.\n  We have been going to several memorials. They have been heartfelt. \nWhether it was at Emmitsburg for the National Fallen Firefighters \nMemorial, today at the Pentagon, joining with Senators Lott and \nDaschle, having the resolution on a national day of remembrance, all of \nthese are very special to me because on that fateful day, I lost 60 \nMaryland constituents: 54 at the Pentagon, those who were working at \nthe Pentagon and who were on that fateful flight. Six others, who we \ncurrently know of, lost their lives at other sites.\n  I know the Chair knows we feel a great debt of gratitude to the \ngallant people on Flight 93 who probably saved our lives. I support the \nmemorials. I was honored to be there.\n  I am pleased to join in a resolution for a national day of \nremembrance. I think we need a permanent way of remembering those \npeople who died on that very fateful, grim, horrific day. The way we \nhonor their memory is to make sure it never, ever can happen again.\n  This is why I am so passionate about our moving our aviation security \nbill, why I am very firm in terms of trying to make our railroads safe \nand also ensuring that those people who work in the field of \ntransportation and in airports and airlines are not doubly victimized, \nfirst by the terrorists and then by an economic compensation system \nthat leaves them without jobs, without incomes, without future \ntraining, and a bleak future. We should not doubly punish them by \nleaving them without an economic security safety net.\n\n  I plead to my colleagues today: Let us put aside our ideologies on \nhow we think Government should be this size or Government should be \nthat size. We need to think about what is the right thing to do for the \nAmerican people. I want to get America moving again. I want them to be \non the rails. I want them to be in planes. I want them to feel free to \ntravel. This is why I am so passionate about the need to have an \naviation security bill that also federalizes our security operations.\n  It ensures that we have the best to guard us. We have the best to \nguard us at the military; God bless them. We have the best to help \nrescue us in our fire and police departments; God bless them. Let's \nhave the very best and the best trained at our airports.\n  While we are making our airports safe, let us look at other areas of \nvulnerability, and then that goes to our railroads. We need, again, \npassenger screening. We need baggage screening. We need to assure the \nsafety of our tunnels, of which we have many in the Northeast corridor. \nI know the Chair is from a railroad corridor State. Last but not at all \nleast, I am concerned about those 528,000 people who filed for \nunemployment last week. That is just a little bit less than the size of \nmy great city of Baltimore. A half million people are on unemployment, \nnot because they were laggards, not because they don't want to work, \nnot because they don't want to show up for duty, but because of \ncircumstances outside of their control.\n  We have it within our control to make an economic safety net for \nthem. I say to my colleagues, we have clotured this; we have bargained \nthat; we have negotiated that. Let us get back to the spirit we had a \nfew weeks ago when we were not a Republican Party or a Democratic \nParty. We were the red, white, and blue party. Let's do right for \nairline security. Let's do right for railroad security. Let's do right \nfor the people who have lost their jobs because of terrorist attacks. \nThat will be the best permanent memorial we could make to those who \nhave fallen because of this horrific deed.\n  Madam President, four civilian airliners from three of our Nation's \nairports were used as weapons of war on September 11. As we're debating \nthis legislation, our military is taking action against those who were \nresponsible. One way to support our troops is to improve safety for all \nAmericans. That's the goal of this legislation. This bill enables us to \ntake three concrete actions to improve the safety of our skies.\n  Security is a high skill job. Yet airport screeners in this country \nare low paid--$6.00 an hour or less. Fast food restaurant employees are \npaid better.\n  They are poorly trained. The FAA requires 12 hours of classroom \ntraining. Other countries do a better job. France requires 60 hours of \ntraining. Belgium requires at least 40 hours. Often, those who perform \nthe training have had\n\n[[Page S10513]]\n\nonly a few hours of training themselves.\n  They are inexperienced. Turnover rates are alarming: 126 percent from \nMay 1998 through April 1999 at our nation's 19 largest airports; as \nhigh as 416 percent in some instances.\n  They have low morale which leads to poor performance.\n  FAA inspection reports reveal significant weaknesses in the \nperformance of our airport screeners. Security inspectors showed that \nBWI ranked fifth among major airports in the number of bombs, grenades \nor other weapons that went undetected in federal inspections.\n  This is not a new problem. The GAO reports that in 1987 airport \nscreeners missed 20 percent of the potentially dangerous objects used \nin tests and it's been getting worse over the past few years.\n  Part of the solution is to federalize our airport security workforce. \nWe have Federal officials protecting our borders and protecting our \nPresident. We also need Federal officials protecting our flying public. \nWhy federal workers? They can be fully trained and monitored. Their \nprimary goal would be safety, not the economic bottom line. The \nHollings bill does this by Federalizing airport security operations, by \nrequiring extensive training--40 hours of classroom training, 60 hours \nof on-the-job instruction--by deploying law enforcement personnel at \neach airport, including armed personnel at airport security screening \nlocations.\n  The safety of our pilots is critical to ensuring the safety of the \npassengers. The tragedies of September 11 showed that we need to \nstrengthen the cockpit door and locks to prevent entry by non-flight \ndeck crewmembers.\n  In a hijacking situation, we've always focused on deterrence, that \npilots and copilots should negotiate with hijackers until the aircraft \nis safely on the ground. September 11 shattered that idea.\n  This bill prohibits access to the flight deck cockpit by any person \nother than a flight deck crew member. It requires the strengthening of \nthe cockpit door and locks to prevent entry by non-flight deck crew \nmembers and requires commuter aircraft that do not have doors to get \ndoors.\n  On September 11, some heroic Americans on United Airlines flight 93 \nlost their lives as they confronted the terrorists. They prevented the \nplane from flying into the Capitol or the White House. These brave \ncitizens lost their lives, yet they saved many others--perhaps even \nthose of us in this chamber.\n  Yet we can't ask American citizens to risk or lose their lives. We \nneed Federal air marshals on our airplanes to protect our citizens.\n  The Sky Marshal Program dates back to the Kennedy Administration when \nthe concern of hijackings to Cuba was prevalent. In 1970, the program \nwas greatly expanded to include 1,500 U.S. Customs officers, 800 \nmilitary personnel. Two years later, the U.S. Customs Sky Marshal \nProgram was phased out.\n  Then, in 1985, a 727 TWA flight from Athens was diverted to Beirut \nwhere terrorists murdered Robert Dean Stetham of Maryland. The \nhighjackings of 1985 prompted Congress to reinstate the Air Marshal \nprogram, but it is spartan and skimpy.\n  This legislation would require a marshal on every flight. That's \nabout 25,000 flights a day, pre-September 11, on all domestic flights \nand on all international flights originating in the U.S.\n  The events of September 11 were an attack against America and against \nhumanity. We are a nation that is grief stricken, but we are not \nparalyzed in our determination to rid the world of terrorism. In the \nmean time, we must act to make transportation safer in the United \nStates. We must have a sense of urgency and pass this legislation \nimmediately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, unless the Senator from New Hampshire \nwould like to speak again, we yield back the remainder of our time and \nurge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1874) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1875\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I have an amendment and I send it to the \ndesk and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

      ``(3) Beginning on the date of enactment of the Aviation \n     Security Act, the Administrator shall conduct all research \n     related to screening technology and procedures in conjunction \n     with the Attorney General.''.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, Senator DeWine of Ohio and Senator \nMcConnell of Kentucky are cosponsors of this amendment. It has been a \nsubject of conversation for the last week. The events of September 11 \nchanged a lot of things--where we place emphasis and how we do business \nin this town. We are changing who is directly responsible and directly \naccountable for airport security.\n  When I first looked at the legislation as it was being drafted, there \nwas one glaring fault. That was that the enforcement of security and \nsafety of America's traveling air passengers was still in the \nDepartment of Transportation. I have believed since September 11 that \nsomething had to be changed. In other words, we had to do something \nthat would give the flying public a sense of security and safety and \nthe rules would be made outside of the Department of Transportation. I \nbelieve it should be in the Department of Justice.\n  If you look at what we have to do and the areas in which we have to \ndo it, the argument that the chairman of the full committee made, which \nis when you take those areas of intelligence and passengers lists, \nwhich we are going to have to scrutinize a little bit better and more \nin the future than we have in the past, when we take a look at the \noutside of the airport or the peripherals and the security of the \nairport security itself, when you look at security in the check-in area \nand also the area known as the departure gate, then we shift our \nemphasis to cargo, that which is shipped on regularly scheduled flights \nand also among the people who are in the air freight business, also the \narea in which we park our aircraft overnight or aircraft that has been \nparked for some length of time, and the aircraft itself--those are \ndistinct areas where we have responsibilities for security and safety--\nno other agency in the Government is better equipped to do the job in \nall those areas than the Department of Justice.\n\n  So what my amendment says is that we give a bright line of authority \nto the Attorney General, who is accountable and responsible for the \nsecurity and safety of air traffic. That does not say that the \nDepartment of Transportation, or even the FAA, doesn't have a little \nsay about what goes on in their business. They should be able to set \nsome of the rules and make sure aircraft are certified to fly and \npilots are certified to fly, and those things. But on the security end \nof it, America is telling me they want law enforcement powers just for \nthe sense of security when they travel.\n  I have often used this analogy with folks who like football and those \nfolks who like baseball and basketball: they are great sports, but you \nnever see the teams refereeing or umpiring themselves. It has to be \ndone by an entity that understands the rules or the mission of safety, \nand security. So that is where we are.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. It allows a setting of \nstandards. It allows the checking of employees, if they work in \nsensitive areas, such as bag handling, and they are near the aircraft. \nThose employees are going to have to stand the scrutiny of the Justice \nDepartment in order to get a job on the ramp, so to speak.\n  When I came out of the Marine Corps, I worked for the airlines for \nabout 3 years. I understand what goes on out there. They are not doing \nmany things differently today than they did 35 or 40 years ago. They \nhave better equipment. They don't have to lift as much as we used to in \nthe old days, but there is more security.\n  What this amendment does is it says the Department of Justice, the \nAttorney General of the United States of America, will be responsible \nfor setting up the apparatus through the Justice Department to make \nsure that our areas are secure and people are safe when they fly.\n  So I offer this amendment. I ask for your support as we move forward. \nI think we have worked out just about all of the kinks. We have people \nwho want to make statements. I say to my ranking member and my boss on \nthe Commerce Committee that they want to speak a little bit on this \namendment. Then I will turn it over to him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Montana, who I \nhave had the privilege of working with for many years on the Commerce \nCommittee, I think this is a good amendment. One of the reasons I think \nit is a good amendment is because we are trying to address a major \nissue with this legislation, and that is to restore confidence on the \npart of the American people in the belief that they can fly on\n\n[[Page S10515]]\n\nairliners and be in airports with a sense of security.\n  I think the Senator's amendment, by putting these responsibilities \ninto the Department of Justice, will increase that confidence factor \nrather dramatically. I don't think right now that most Americans know \nwho is in charge of the airport screening procedures. I have often \nasked that question myself. I don't think Americans believe that one \nagency that is in charge has done a very good job, whoever is \nresponsible for it. We see continued breaches of airport security--even \nafter September 11. So I think the amendment of the Senator from \nMontana is a good one. I think it will move the process in the \ndirection we are seeking for this legislation.\n  I thank Senator Burns for his active participation and involvement in \nthis issue. I know Mr. McConnell, the Senator from Kentucky, wants to \nspeak on this amendment as well. If the chairman wants to speak, \nperhaps we can wait a few minutes for Senator McConnell after he \nfinishes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Arizona \nhas pointed out the main concern that we have, and that is that airline \ntravelers have complete confidence in the security, safety, and \nnormalcy of our airlines--as we are all pleading with the people of the \ncountry to get back to normal travel. The best way to do that is to \nhave law enforcement immediately connected to personnel in and around \nthe facility, and out on the tarmac, that they are all aware of \nsecurity threats--specifically, to be on the lookout for people on a \nwatch list.\n  The overall security effort would be developed, no question, by the \nFBI domestic homefront security office. They are the ones that would \nhave immediate knowledge of anyone on a watch list, communicating \nimmediately, of course, with their screeners and others working in the \nairport and its facility.\n  I think it is a well-considered measure. The Senator from Montana \nrecommended this when we approached this subject 3 or 4 weeks ago. We \ntalked back and forth. We are trying to get things done. In order to \nget things done, sometimes your own personal choice is subjugated to \nthe good of the body generally. The good of the body and the White \nHouse, for that matter, was to put responsibility for airport security \nunder the Department of Transportation's purview.\n  But there is no question, as the Senator from Arizona says, this \namendment would facilitate the enactment and passage of this \nlegislation. I support it.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the bill we are discussing today would help \nto ensure the safety of flying for passengers on the planes as well as \ninnocent civilians on the ground.\n  However, I am concerned that the bill will broadly expand the law \nenforcement authority of the Department of Transportation and the \nFederal Aviation Administration. I believe we should let experienced \nlaw enforcers set the standards to protect the safety of commercial air \noperations.\n  The mission of the DOT is to:\n\n       serve the United States by ensuring a fast, safe, \n     efficient, accessible and convenient transportation system \n     that meets our vital national interests and enhances the \n     quality of life of the American people, today and into the \n     future.\n\n  The mission of the U.S. Marshall Service under the oversight of the \nAttorney General is to:\n\n       enforce federal laws and provide support to virtually all \n     elements of the federal justice system by providing for the \n     security of federal court facilities and the safety of judges \n     and other court personnel; apprehending criminals; exercising \n     custody of federal prisoners and providing for their security \n     and transportation to correctional facilities; executing \n     federal court orders; seizing assets gained by illegal means \n     and providing for the custody, management and disposal of \n     forfeited assets; assuring the safety of endangered \n     government witnesses and their families; and collecting and \n     disbursing funds.\n\n  The key phrase is to ``enforce Federal laws.'' The Justice Department \nis a law enforcement body. That agency is tasked to protect the \nAmerican people through the enforcement of laws set by Congress.\n  Prior to 9/11, the primary responsibility for aviation security was \nshared by the FAA, airports and the carriers.\n  The FAA set the standards and regulations that were followed by the \nairports and carriers. The FAA was responsible to provide threat \ninformation obtained from the intelligence community to the security \napparatus protecting our airports and carriers.\n  The Air Marshall program, although active, was relatively non-\nexistent as there were fewer than 50 security personnel enlisted to \nsecure our passenger airplanes.\n  Airports remain responsible for the physical security of airport \nfacilities, law enforcement and security personnel. In Montana, our \nGovernor has temporarily deployed the Montana National Guard to protect \nour airports while a threat remains significant. I have discussed \nairport security with Montana's airport managers and they have informed \nme of their current practices.\n  Airlines and cargo carriers are responsible for implementing those \nsecurity activities that directly affect the flow of passengers, \nbaggage and cargo aboard aircraft.\n  Since 9/11 we have entered a new era. The last hijacking of a U.S. \nairline using a weapon was in 1989, when a passenger used a starter \npistol and two folding knives to hijack an American Airlines plane.\n  Prior to that, a Pacific Southwest Airline jet crashed in 1987 after \na former ticket agent for the airline smuggled a gun aboard and broke \ninto the cockpit, killing the flight crew. All 43 people aboard were \nkilled.\n  But is was the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 on Dec. 21, 1988 over \nLockerbie, Scotland that turned the attention of security officials \nfrom guns to bombs, which can be relatively small and made of plastic.\n  While we have upgraded our equipment to detect bombs, we have not \naddressed concerns about uniform standards used to detect potential \nhuman threats in a plane.\n  At airport security checkpoints, walk-through metal detectors \ncurrently screen passengers. If the detector alarms, screeners use \nmetal-detecting hand wands. Nonmetallic objects, including plastic and \nceramic weapons, will generally not be found by either procedure.\n  At the same checkpoints, carry-on bags are screened by equipment that \ndisplays an x-ray image of bag contents. An operator who sees a \nsuspicious object in the image, or whose view is blocked by a \nconcealing object, may hand search a bag as a backup procedure. \nNonmetallic objects may be visible in the checkpoint x-ray image, but \nless clearly than metal items, and operator training has, up to now, \nbeen focused on identifying metal items.\n  The checkpoint screeners who work for these private security \ncompanies have rapid turnover, more than 100 percent per year at many \nairports. The pay is low and is largely attributed to this high rate of \nturnover.\n  Until directed otherwise by the Secretary of Transportation on \nSeptember 12, 2001, many small knives, such as pocketknives, were \npermitted on board aircraft, even if detected by security personnel.\n  I have concerns about unsecured access to the plane. There were \nseveral reports about finding box cutters and other potential weapons \non planes that had landed on 9/11/01. These findings could lead one to \nbelieve there were other planned attacks during that fateful day.\n  Prior to 9/11, several people had access to an aircraft and could, \nperhaps, leave a weapon in a hidden location for use by someone else. \nThese people include the flight crew, maintenance personnel, cleaners, \ncaterers, and baggage handlers.\n  The DOT Inspector General reported his office was able to gain \nunauthorized access to secure areas of airports 68% of the time in \ntests during 1998 and 1999 and has found in audits that background \nchecks of airport personnel are ineffective and are frequently not \nconducted as required.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. We need to \nestablish a national standard that protects American citizens. I \nbelieve the Justice Department is the proper authority to set that \nstandard.\n  I thank the chairman, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1855, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of \nSenator Daschle, that the Carnahan amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10516]]\n\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1875\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to support the Burns amendment. \nFirst, I congratulate my colleague for his work on this amendment. He \nhas been very diligent in explaining in meeting after meeting off the \nfloor of the Senate for the last week or 10 days why his amendment \nshould pass. I congratulate him on his amendment. I congratulate him on \nhis diligence and his perception of what we should be doing.\n\n  This is a simple amendment, one that I believe makes a very big \nstatement. The statement says we believe our Justice Department is best \nsuited to manage particular aspects of security at our airports. The \nreality is we need accountability. We need to know there is an agency \nin charge that knows how to manage security. That agency, I believe, is \nthe Justice Department of the United States.\n  I say that because the Justice Department is in the business of law \nenforcement, and it is in the business of security in the Marshal \nService. Protecting our airports and protecting the traveling public is \na law enforcement and a security function. It is a function, I believe, \nbest handled by the Department of Justice.\n  The fact is, those in charge of law enforcement have a different way \nof looking at things. I first understood that when I became an \nassistant county prosecuting attorney at the age of 25. I could not \nbelieve how the police officers in Xenia, OH, or the sheriff's office \nin Fairborn, OH, saw things differently than I saw them.\n  They saw things through the eyes of a trained officer. They saw \nthings from the law enforcement point of view. They saw things from a \nsecurity point of view. We would go to crime scenes, and they would \nexplain what they saw. We would look at situations where we were \nworried about security, and they would see things that I would never \nsee.\n  It is not just training. It is not just experience. It also is a \nculture. I guess we use the word ``culture'' when we do not know \nanother word to explain it, but it is a fundamental way of approaching \nthings.\n  I believe it makes eminent sense to take an agency that is concerned \nevery single day about the security of Americans--that is what they get \npaid to do--and say we are going to put you in charge of the flying \npublic's security while they are on the ground. We are going to leave \nit up to the FAA, the experts, about how to fly, when those planes fly, \nwhen they do not fly, and things that go on in the air. But when we are \ntalking about ground security, we are going to leave that up to other \nexperts, and those experts are in the Justice Department.\n  We have an example of how this is done. Justice really does two \nthings: They do law enforcement, but they also do security. The Marshal \nService does security every single day. They break it down. They make a \ndistinction between the sworn officers and the contract employees. \nLater on in this debate, before final passage, I am going to have a \nlittle more to say about that.\n  When you go in, for example, to a Federal courthouse, or when you go \ninto a Federal building, it is the U.S. Marshal Service that is in \ncharge of that security. So there is precedent for doing this. There is \nan experience level that exists in the Justice Department.\n  I do not want to take a lot of the time of my colleagues, but I again \ncongratulate my colleague, Senator Burns, for this idea. I think it is \nthe right idea. It basically says the whole issue of security on the \nground--not just the checking of the baggage, not just the checking of \nthe passengers, but the whole view and concept of what should be done \nin regard to each individual airport in this country--should be in the \nhands of the experts. And I believe those experts are in the Justice \nDepartment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment in order to address some amendments that have been \nagreed to on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I think we are very close to an agreement \nbetween myself and the principals.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1878\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Thompson, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Thompson, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1878.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The attacks of September 11 demonstrated \nthat we had not done all we could to prevent or mitigate them. But even \nthese events weren't necessary to show us that. We have known for some \ntime that airport security was less than acceptable, and we all agree \nthat the system used to screen airline passengers and baggage needs to \nbe overhauled. However, in the rush to fix the problem by \n``federalizing'' the security workforce, I am concerned that not enough \nattention is being given to a critical flaw in existing security \noperations, that is, the failure to set and insist on performance \nstandards. It doesn't matter who does this work, if we continue to fail \nto hold those responsible for security, from top to bottom, \naccountable. In the past, some fines were levied, but no one was held \naccountable for improvement.\n  Passenger and baggage screeners and their employers, whether civil \nservants or contractors, must be required to meet performance \nstandards, and then must be subject to meaningful sanctions if those \nstandards are not met. This has not occurred in the past. The General \nAccounting Office has issued several reports that document the Federal \nAviation Administration's failure to hold airlines accountable for the \ndeclining performance of their baggage screeners over the last decade. \nNote that I said detection rates have declined virtually every year \nover the last decade.\n  It's important to note that we have been trying to implement \nperformance-based management in the Federal Government for some time. \nSince 1994, agencies of the Federal Government have been required to \nset goals for what they do and report to Congress and the American \npeople on whether agencies are meeting those goals. Oddly, the \nDepartment of Transportation has been a leader in setting goals. It's \njust that in the area of aviation security, they haven't been meeting \nthem.\n  In 1997, we asked the Department of Transportation Inspector General \nto identify the Department's worst management challenges. Since that \ntime, the Inspector General has routinely identified aviation security \nas the Department's greatest management challenge. And since 1999, I've \nbeen asking the Department of Transportation to set goals to address \nand improve aviation security. The Department did set a goal for the \nrate at which screeners detect dangerous objects, and it reported as \nrecently as April of this year that it failed to meet its goal.\n  Let me read to you from the Department of Transportation's \nPerformance Report, which it issued this spring:\n\n       DOT did not meet this year's performance target [for \n     aviation security, which specifically measures the detection \n     rate for explosives and weapons that may be brought aboard \n     aircraft.] The technology is functioning well and provides \n     superior security protection, but screener performance has \n     not improved enough.\n\n  The report states further: FAA may face a greater challenge than \nexpected to meet the FY 2001 performance targets in some areas of \nscreening.\n  Like so many things in Washington, we have known this was a problem \nfor some time. Detection rates at the Nation's airports have been \ndeclining steadily since 1993. But clearly, we weren't holding those \nresponsible for aviation security accountable for their performance. \nSo, I have to ask, what assurances do we have that the Department of \nTransportation will hold new screeners, under this bill, more \naccountable?\n  Lax enforcement of standards inevitably leads to lax security, \nregardless of who hires those screeners. This amendment will ensure \nthat results-oriented management is a key component of whatever changes \nare made to our airport security system. We can not afford more \nbusiness as usual. We have to insist that the traveling public is safe \nfrom those who would perpetrate evil deeds like those of September 11.\n  First, my amendment requires the Federal Government to set and \nenforce goals for aviation security. It requires the head of aviation \nsecurity, within 60 days of enactment, to establish acceptable levels \nof performance and provide Congress with an action plan to achieve that \nperformance. Over the long-term, the head of aviation security must \nestablish a process for performance planning and reporting that informs \nCongress and the American people about how the Government is meeting \nits goals. By creating this process, we will be constantly assessing \nthe threats we face and ensuring that we have the means to measure our \nprogress in preparing for those threats. This is a new, detailed method \nfor ensuring that performance management is in place specifically in \nthe Government's aviation security programs.\n  I firmly believe that good people, well managed, can substantially \nimprove our aviation security. So this amendment gives those \nresponsible for aviation security enhanced tools to regain the \nconfidence of America's flying public. We employ a good mix of carrots \nand sticks to drive performance. For instance: This amendment \nestablishes an annual staff performance management system that includes \nsetting individual, group, and organizational performance goals \nconsistent with an annual performance plan. Managers and employees \nwould be eligible for bonuses for good performance. The amendment \nallows management to hold employees, whether public, private, or a mix \nthereof, accountable for meeting their performance standards.\n  This approach is not new. Agencies like IRS, the Patent and Trademark \nOffice, and the Office of Student and Financial Assistance, have \nperformance-based management systems. But this will be the first time \nthat performance-based management has been used to better government \nperformance at every level of a government agency.\n  I've been trying for many years to get agencies to set goals and \nstrive to meet them. It seems so commonsensical, but for so many years, \nthe Federal Government did not do that. And we in the Congress, \nadmittedly, have not really held agencies' feet to the fire as far as \nperformance goes.\n  There has never been, in my opinion, a clearer example of good goals, \nbut poor performance, as in the area of aviation security. This \namendment will restore confidence in air travel. With my amendment, we \nwill say, if you are not meeting your goals, whether it be detecting \ndangerous objects that people try to get on planes or preventing access \nto secure areas of an airport or airplane, you can be held accountable. \nAnd those who meet their goals can be rewarded.\n  This amendment makes sense. I hope we can assure the American people \nthat we are doing all we can, remaining vigilant, by strictly enforcing \nstandards for the safety and security of the Nation's airports and \nairplanes. I urge the adoption of this simple, but critical, \nperformance-based amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is an important amendment. It \ndeserves a couple minutes of explanation.\n  One of the difficulties we have had in the past is we passed \nlegislation and authorized certain activities, and then we forgot about \nthem as a Congress. We do not pay enough attention to the performance \nof the bureaucracies that we either create or designate to carry out \ncertain programs.\n  Senator Thompson's amendment is basically results-based management. \nIt is going to require reporting. It is going to require performance \nreports. It is going to require performance plans. It is going to \nestablish a system for measuring staff performance, management \naccountability for meeting performance goals, compensation, the Deputy \nSecretary for Transportation Security, et cetera.\n  It is comprehensive performance-based management and results-based\n\n[[Page S10519]]\n\nmanagement. I believe it is an important amendment in making sure this \nlegislation is accountable to the American people as well as the \nCongress. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1878) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1879\n\n     (Purpose: To require expanded utilization of current security \n    technologies, establish short-term assessment and deployment of \n        emergency security technologies, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, finally, on behalf of Senator Lieberman, I \nsend an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Lieberman, \n     for himself, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1879.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nDurbin to offer an amendment to S. 1447, the Aviation Security Act, to \nimprove airport and aircraft safety through heightened screening of \npassengers, carry-on luggage, checked baggage, and those entering \nsecure areas of airports. The overriding purpose of my amendment is to \nput our superior technological knowledge to better, more accurate, more \nwidespread, and, therefore, more effective use.\n  In the wake of the horrific attacks of September 11, the Nation's \nconfidence in the safety of our skies has been deeply shaken. Apart \nfrom the thousands of lives lost, public trust in airport security has \nsuffered a severe blow, which in turn has had a devastating impact on \nthe fortunes of the airline sector as well as the general economy. \nThree weeks ago, Congress approved a $15 billion bailout plan for the \nairline industry, which we all hope will keep the nation's carriers \nfinancially and operationally viable for at least the immediate future. \nUltimately, however, the long-term recovery of air commerce will \nrequire nothing less than developing ironclad confidence in the safety \nof our airports and air carriers. My amendment and the bill now under \ndiscussion are first steps toward achieving that goal.\n  On September 25, the Governmental Affairs Committee, which I chair, \nheld a joint hearing with the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, chaired by Senator Durbin, to explore the adequacy of \nairline and airport screening. Witnesses from the airline industry, the \naviation security industry, major airports, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, the Department of Transportation Inspector General's \nOffice, and the General Accounting Office provided sobering testimony \non shortcomings in our current airport security system. The amendment I \nam offering today is derived in large part from the expert advice and \nrecommendations the Committee received at the hearing.\n  The amendment has three general aims: First, to expand the use of \ncurrent security technologies and procedures; second, to improve upon \nand upgrade those existing technologies and procedures; and, third, to \nfund development of newer, better, and more cost-effective technologies \nand procedures.\n  The very first step that must be taken in order to accomplish these \nends must be to ensure that those working in and around airports are \nbeyond reproach, because the best technologies and procedures are, \nfrankly, useless if the people employing them cannot be trusted. My \namendment, therefore, would require completion of intensive background \nchecks on all airport personnel who have access to secure areas at \ncommercial airports. This includes FBI criminal checks for all workers, \nnot just for new hires but for current employees as well.\n  Next, the amendment would require the Federal Aviation Administration \nto expand the use of bulk explosive detection technology already being \ndeployed at most major airports. We would require the technology to be \nused more precisely, more cost effectively, and more often than is \ncurrently the case. To ensure that every link in the chain of security \nis strong, the FAA would also be asked to establish goals for the \npurchase of additional detection machines for certain mid-sized \nairports.\n  Carriers would be required to increase the number of checked bags \nthat are positively matched with a boarded passenger, until airports \nare scanning 100 percent of checked baggage with explosive detection \ntechnology. The purpose here is to prevent a situation in which a \nterrorist loads explosives onto a plane in his baggage, without \nactually boarding the plane himself.\n  The measure would require carriers to build upon the Computer-\nAssisted Passenger Pre-Screening System, (CAPPS), which now uses a \nrange of criteria to identify passengers who may present a threat. The \nway it works now, baggage checked by selected passengers is subjected \nto scanning for possible explosives. Under this amendment I am \noffering, passengers identified under this system would be subject to \nadditional security checks of their persons and their carry-on luggage, \nwhether or not they had checked baggage.\n  Additionally, to improve and upgrade existing procedures, the \namendment focuses on the ease with which people may obtain unauthorized \naccess to restricted areas within airports. This is a widespread and \npotentially lethal problem that can be easily remedied. In 1998 and \n1999, undercover investigators working for the Department of \nTransportation Inspector General's office were able to access secure \nareas in airports a whopping 68 percent of the time. Once the \ninvestigators entered the secure areas, they were able to board \naircraft in 117 cases, an astonishing number.\n  The amendment calls on the Department of Transportation to recommend \nways to prevent unauthorized access to restricted areas--for example, \nby employing so-called biometrics systems, systems that employ retinal, \nfacial, and hand identification technologies or similar scanning \nmethods, that are currently in use at several U.S. airports; or by \nincreasing surveillance at access points; upgrading card- or keypad-\nbased access systems; improving airport emergency exit systems; and \neliminating the practice commonly referred to as ``piggy-backing,'' \nwhere an unauthorized person follows an authorized person through a \nsecurity access point.\n  Further, the amendment calls for better coordinating the distribution \nof information about passengers on law enforcement ``watch lists.'' \nAnd, it requests a review of options for improving the positive \nidentification of passengers, through biometrics and smart cards.\n  Finally, the amendment would set aside $50 million for researching \nand developing new technologies to improve aviation safety in the \nfuture; and, $20 million for research and development of longer-term \nsecurity improvements, including further advances in biometrics, \nadvanced weapons detection, and improved systems for the sharing of \ninformation among law enforcement entities.\n  I believe that these provisions together represent a substantial \nimprovement on the present state of passenger and baggage screening and \nother elements of the aviation security system. In conjunction with the \nlarger changes contemplated in the underlying bill, I am confident that \nthe measures I call for in this amendment will take us along the path \ntoward real and measurable safety and security for our airways. Like \nall Americans, I look forward to the day when each of us can once again \nenter an airport, and board an airplane, knowing that terror has been \nbanished from our skies.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Lieberman, this \namendment requires expanded utilization of current security \ntechnologies, establishes short-term assessment and deployment of \nemergency security technologies, and for other purposes.\n\n[[Page S10520]]\n\n  This has been agreed to by both sides. I think it is a good amendment \nand, again, along with the amendment on the part of Senator Thompson, I \nthink it would give an efficient reporting and accountability aspect to \nthis amendment which was lacking in its original form.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1879) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1880\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murray, Senator \nShelby, Senator Byrd, myself, and the managers, I send an amendment to \nthe desk with respect to the language clarification subjecting, of \ncourse, the fees and amounts under this particular measure to the \nappropriations process. I think it is clear in the bill but we wanted \nto make it absolutely clear, and on behalf of Senator Murray, Senator \nByrd, and Senator Shelby, we are pleased to present the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for Mrs. \n     Murray, for herself, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Shelby, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1880.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n          (Purpose: To clarify the user fee funding mechanism)\n\n       On page 43, line 19, add the words ``annual appropriations \n     for'' after the word ``offset'';\n       On page 43, line 20, strike the sentence beginning with the \n     word ``The'' and ending with the word ``expended.'' on line \n     23;\n       On page 43, at the end of line 25, insert the following new \n     subsection:\n       (c) User of Fees.--A fee collected under this section shall \n     be used solely for the costs associated with providing \n     aviation security services and may be used only to the extent \n     provided in advance in an appropriation law.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1880) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to reconsider.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1881\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, I send a technical \namendment to the desk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1881.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To authorize the employment, suspension, and termination of \n airport passenger security screeners without regard to the provisions \nof title 5, United States Code, otherwise applicable to such employees)\n\n       On page 32, beginning with line 9, strike through line 2 on \n     page 35 and insert the following:\n       (d) Screener Personnel.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the Secretary of Transportation may employ, \n     appoint, discipline, terminate, and fix the compensation, \n     terms, and conditions of employment of such a number of \n     individuals as the Secretary determines to be necessary to \n     carry out the passenger security screening functions of the \n     Secretary under section 44901 of title 49, United States \n     Code.\n       (e) Strikes Prohibited.--An individual employed as a \n     security screener under section 44901 of title 49, United \n     States Code, is prohibited from participating in a strike or \n     asserting the right to strike pursuant to section 7311(3) or \n     7116(b)(7) of title 5, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment has to do with the \nmanagement of the programs and the terms of employment. It has been \ndiscussed by both sides. I ask for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1881) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1875\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Kentucky, \nMr. McConnell, is on his way over to speak on the pending amendment. I \nask that we return to the pending amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I announce on behalf of Senator Hollings \nand myself we are now down to just a couple or three amendments. If \nthere are Senators who have amendments, we would like for them to come \nto the Chamber and offer them because I think we are about ready to \nwrap up. I understand there may be at least two amendments on this side \nbut we would like to get them considered and disposed of.\n  It would be very helpful if we could move from this legislation to \nthe antiterrorism legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. As I announced today on behalf of Senator Daschle, there \nare some really important things to do. This bill is extremely \nimportant. The two managers of this bill have been talking about its \nimportance for 1 week. It seems at least people with amendments could \ncome and offer them. If they do not, the majority leader and the \nminority leader are going to move from this legislation, finish it, \nbecause we have waiting in the wings the very important \nantiterrorism legislation which the Attorney General and the President \nof the United States and all of us think is vitally important. So \npeople do not have the luxury of finishing their appointments or \nwhatever else they are doing. The business of the Senate is proceeding \nand we are going to move to third reading.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada. If it is agreeable, in \nabout 20 minutes--it is now 25 after 3--we will move that no further \namendments be considered. That gives Senators 20 minutes to come over \nand propose their amendments.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Very good.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1875\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding the amendment of \nmy good friend from Montana, Senator Burns, has been agreed to on both \nsides. It is that amendment to which I want to speak for a few moments \nprior to its adoption.\n  Immediately after the terrorist attacks of September 11, airline \nsecurity suddenly became a national law enforcement priority, shedding \nits former status as a routine administrative function of the airlines. \nOnce this occurred, it became imperative that we enlist the expertise \nof our Nation's top law enforcement agencies to prevent further attacks \non America through our aviation system.\n  Three weeks ago, and before Senators Hollings and McCain introduced \ntheir first comprehensive airline security bill, I also introduced S. \n1444, the Federal Air Marshal and Safe Sky Act. My bill had two \nimportant objectives that I felt strongly about. One, to make airport \nsecurity a national priority by having Federal standards, Federal \ntraining, and Federal oversight of all airport security functions and, \ntwo, to make airport security a law enforcement responsibility in the \nhands of the Attorney General, our Nation's top law enforcement \nofficial.\n  Since I introduced my bill, which was cosponsored by Senators \nBrownback, Gregg, Thurmond, and Helms, we have worked closely with both \nthe chairman\n\n[[Page S10521]]\n\nand ranking member of the Commerce Committee, as well as Senator Burns \nand Senator DeWine, on these important issues. That is why I am proud \nto be a cosponsor of Senator Burns' amendment, which would transfer \nairport screening and armed personnel to the Department of Justice and \nallow the Department of Justice to set standards of training for \nFederal air marshals.\n\n  For a comprehensive air marshal program to be most effective, we need \nto relieve the obligations of airport security from the FAA and the \nairlines, where the primary purpose is to facilitate the managed air \ntravel, and entrust that responsibility to the Department of Justice, \nwhose primary mission is to enforce Federal law and, most importantly, \nto safeguard and protect us from further acts of terrorism.\n  The Justice Department already has a model in place for Federal \nsecurity. That model is our Federal courthouses which are currently \nsecured by the U.S. marshals who employ court security officers, \ncommonly referred to as CSOs, to provide security around the perimeter \nof the building, at each point of entry, and in the courtrooms \nthemselves. These court security officers are themselves retired \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement personnel.\n  Part of the reason our courthouses enjoy such security today is that \nthis unified system provides for layers of security far before when one \nenters the actual courtroom. Our democracy demands, in the interests of \nour national security, that we make sure our airports are every bit as \nsecure as our courthouses.\n  Finally, I would add that it is important both substantively and \nsymbolically for the American people to know that one of our nation's \ntop law enforcement priorities will now be handled by our nation's top \nlaw enforcement agency.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana, Mr. Burns, for his \nleadership and hard work on this amendment. I also thank the chairman \nand ranking member for their hard work on this important piece of \nlegislation and express my enthusiastic support for the Burns amendment \nand indicate my pride in being added as a cosponsor. I enjoyed working \nwith the Senator from Montana on this matter and am glad the amendment \nwill be accepted. It is an outstanding amendment and will add \nsubstantially to the goal of ensuring we have airports that are as safe \nas possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my good friend, the Senator from Kentucky. I also \nthank him for his legislation issuing war bonds to pay for this \noperation, this antiterrorism effort, and to bring fugitives to justice \nand to fulfill this operation.\n  Since he introduced that legislation--and I was a cosponsor of it--I \nhave been getting mail from all over the State of Montana wanting to \nknow where to buy a war bond because they want to participate in the \nsecurity of this country. Since September 11, we as a society have \nchanged a lot of our priorities and agenda.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As Senator Burns pointed out, this legislation has now \npassed the Senate and was added as an amendment to the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill. We are optimistic that the conferees will keep \nthat amendment since it was not in the House version and it could be on \nthe way, hopefully, for the President's signature downtown. We are \noptimistic that the Treasury Department will pick up this device which \ngives Americans a great opportunity.\n  One hears the question, What can I do? As the Senator from Montana \npointed out, this is the answer to that.\n  Mr. BURNS. It was a great amendment. Americans want to participate. \nThey want to do their share. Knowing we are in a crisis in this \ncountry, this is a way to help.\n  The operations we have going on are very expensive. This is a way we \nask Americans to help us get the job done, help this President who has \ndedicated himself to getting this job done.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't believe there is further debate on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1875) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the leadership for their courtesy and their staffs \nwho worked with my staff closely in passing this amendment. It does \nenhance the legislation. We hope what we have done gives a bright line \nof accountability. I appreciate the leadership of the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, the ranking member, and their staffs.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator from Montana for his leadership and \nhelp in enhancing security with respect to airline travel.\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the manager and the Senator McCain \nare working very hard to resolve the final issues on this legislation. \nI take the floor again to say thank them for their hard work on this \nlegislation. It has been a long, tortured trail to get this aviation \nsecurity bill to the floor of the Senate; and, second, to begin to \nresolve all of the difficulties and hopefully get it passed as quickly \nas possible.\n  I mention one issue that will not hang up the bill for me. I will \nstrongly support this bill because of the work they have done. The one \nissue I talked to both Senator Hollings and Senator McCain about is \nsomething that they have agreed to discuss in conference to see if we \ncan make some adjustments.\n  Here is the situation with respect to the enplanement fee of $2.50. \nIf you are flying in this country from one of the spokes in the system \nand fly from the spoke to a hub and to another hub--for example, from \nBismark you go to Minneapolis, get on another plane, fly to Washington, \nDC, and then you fly back--you are going to pay four enplanement fees \ntotaling $10.\n  The problem with respect to that enplanement fee is one in which if \nyou start at a spoke in this system and fly to a hub and then to \nanother hub, which many people do, they are going to always pay $10, \nbecause they will have taken four segments at $2.50 per segment.\n  Those who live in the big cities that fly to another major city will \npay $5. If you are from a small airport and go to a hub and then \nanother big city, which most travelers do--I do for every trip to North \nDakota; I fly from here to Minneapolis, and either from there to Minot, \nor Grand Forks, or Fargo--for every one of those tickets, my \nconstituents will always pay four $2.50 enplanement fees. Someone who \nlives in Chicago or Minneapolis and flies to Washington, DC will always \npay a $5 fee. They will pay a fee when they leave Chicago, then a fee \nwhen they leave Washington, DC because they do not have to change \nplanes. They only have two segments, not four. We have a circumstance \nwhere the current fee will double for those who are on the spokes part \nof the hub in the spoke system. That is just not fair.\n\n  So I visited just in this Chamber today with Senator Hollings and \nSenator McCain and described that circumstance. They have agreed to \ntake a look at that in conference. I understand we cannot modify that \nat this moment, but they have said, yes, they understand that \ncircumstance, and they would be willing to take a look at that in \nconference. I appreciate that.\n  It is just a circumstance where, in one more situation, those at the \nend of the line, those in the smaller airports who have to fly to a hub \nand then change planes to go someplace are going to end up paying more. \nThey already pay too much, in my judgment.\n\n[[Page S10522]]\n\n  Those who have the satisfaction of flying between pairs of the \nlargest cities in the country have the wonderful treat of being able to \nsee multiple carriers competing around price for those seats; and they \nget a pretty good deal under deregulation. That has not been the case \nfor a lot of other consumers.\n  When we add to the airline tickets some fee to recover the charge for \naviation security, we must do it in a manner that is fair. I submit, as \nI have indicated to Senator Hollings and Senator McCain, it is not, in \nmy judgment, good policy for us to say to all of those who live out on \nthe end of a spoke in the hub-and-spoke system pay twice as much as \nthose who live in the hub. That is not something that would make sense, \nnot something that would be fair to a lot of folks around this country \nwho fly from the smaller airports.\n  So let me again say, I wanted to call this to the attention of my \ncolleagues today. I did today, with a discussion with Senator Hollings \nand Senator McCain. They have agreed to take a good look at that in \nconference. That is all I can ask at this point.\n  Let me conclude, as I started, by saying this bill has an urgency to \nit. It has been frustrating that it has taken so long to get to the \nfloor, but it is here. I will take great satisfaction in the work that \nmy colleague from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, has done; my \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, has done; along with many \nothers--Senator Rockefeller, Senator Hutchison, myself, and so many \nothers who worked on this bill in the Commerce Committee. Thanks to \ntheir good work, we will pass an aviation security bill now--I hope \ntoday--and get to conference, make the changes necessary, and get this \nbill to the President's desk.\n  This country needs this bill. The airline industry needs it. This \neconomy needs it. It is much more than just this piece of legislation. \nIt is about confidence. This economy and this country, and especially \nthe airline industry at this point, desperately need that cushion of \nconfidence that a number of steps, including this piece of legislation, \nwill offer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1863\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I now offer the amendment that I spoke \nof earlier in the afternoon, which would allow pilots under Part 121--\nwho are now required to retire at the age of 60--to continue to pilot \ncommercial airlines until the age of 63.\n  It is my intention, at the end of my statement, to ask for the yeas \nand nays on the amendment. My understanding is that the floor managers \nare reviewing the amendment.\n  If procedure allows, I would like to speak on the amendment at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment is currently pending.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am sorry; I did not hear the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment is currently pending.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, earlier today I spoke of an amendment that I planned \nto offer that would repeal the Federal Aviation Administration's rule \nwhich requires pilots who fly under Part 121 to retire at the age of \n60. This is a mandatory retirement.\n  It is kind of interesting to note that foreign airlines--Lufthansa, \nand others--allow pilots to fly beyond age 60; in some cases 65, in \nsome cases longer.\n  Under the amendment, pilots in excellent health--and I mean subject \nto not just the regular physical exams which they have to undergo now \nto fly under age 60--but, as a consequence of extending this to age 63, \nwould be allowed to continue to pilot commercial airlines. It would \nallow the FAA to require those pilots to undergo additional medical and \ncognitive testing for certification as well as establish standards for \ncrew pairings.\n  I live in Alaska. I fly a great deal. To suggest that suddenly, when \nan experienced pilot reaches age 60, he or she is no longer fit to fly, \nflies in the face of age discrimination certainly. It flies in the face \nof the value that an experienced pilot has.\n  Some might suggest that this is not germane to aviation safety. Well, \nif anything is germane to aviation safety, it is an experienced pilot. \nHow do you get experience? You get experience in aviation by flying, \nyou gain experience in what to do during mechanical difficulties, you \ngain experience in what to do during weather difficulties. It is \nexperience, Mr. President. And it is germane to this legislation, which \nis airline safety.\n  I do not want to fly, necessarily, in adverse weather, under IFR \nconditions, in an unpressurized aircraft in my State of Alaska without \nan experienced pilot.\n  The former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hale Boggs, and \nthe Representative for the State of Alaska in the House of \nRepresentatives, Nick Begich, were flying in adverse weather in an \nunpressurized aircraft. It was the largest aerial search ever \nundertaken. They have never found any remains, any evidence of where \nthe aircraft crashed.\n  My point is, experience counts. This particular amendment is germane. \nThis particular amendment has had a hearing in the Commerce Committee. \nThe protections that we provide, by requiring commercial airline pilots \nto undergo additional medical and cognitive testing for certification \ncovers the exposure.\n  As I look around this Chamber, with the exception of a few of our \ncolleagues who happen to be in the candy drawer right now, virtually \neveryone is over 60 years old. Suddenly, at their 60th birthday, are \nthey no longer fit to represent their constituents? They are certainly \nexperienced. And this measure is applicable here.\n  There is an objection from the unions, and I recognize their \nobjection, but it is a matter of retirement. That is an agreement \nbetween the unions and the airlines. What we are talking about is \nairline safety. We are talking about experience. You have a legitimate \ncomplaint about the unions wanting to move these pilots out, to make \nroom for others.\n  But what we are doing in this country today is, we are calling our \npilots back to the military because we have a crisis. We need them. For \nall practical purposes, we have a pilot shortage in this country.\n  The European airlines recognize reality. Experience counts. \nExperience counts in my State. This measure was subject to a full \nCommerce Committee hearing. It was voted out of committee by a majority \nin March of this year. We have had numerous studies sponsored by the \nFAA. None have ever produced concrete evidence that pilots over 60 \nyears of age are a threat to the flying public. In fact, the studies \nhave not even included pilots over 60. So where is this coming from?\n  Experience does count. If you are in good physical condition--you \nlive longer; you take better care of yourself; you have a better health \nprovider--what is wrong here? We have age discrimination against pilots \nwho are 60 years old; you do not let them fly anymore. That is \ndiscrimination of the worst kind. If they can pass a physical, why not?\n\n  Advanced psychological and neurobehavioral testing methods do exist \nto test pilots of any age. More importantly, we have simulator training \nthat can estimate the risk of any number of things--such as cardiac \ncomplaints as evidence shows that there is one event in more than 20 \nmillion hours of flight time. Sudden flight incapacitation is clearly \nless a threat to aviation safety than are mishaps due to inexperienced \npilot error.\n  Let's go through the list of accidents. We recognize that most \naccidents associated with aviation in the area of qualifications under \npilot error are due to inexperienced pilots, not experienced pilots. \nThat can only come with time and age. That is why it is so important to \nrecognize that when a pilot becomes 60 years of age, he or she should \nnot be simply eliminated from commercial aviation.\n  The European countries recognize this and take experience into \nconsideration and allow pilots to fly until the age of 65. My amendment \nwould allow them to fly until age 63.\n  Medical science has vastly improved since 1959--improvements in \ndiagnosis, which include early detection, prevention, health awareness, \nand diet. All of these factors have increased life expectancy since \n1959.\n  Our airline pilots consistently demonstrate superior task \nperformances across all age groups when compared to\n\n[[Page S10523]]\n\nage-matched non-pilots. Pilots are subjected to comprehensive medical \nexaminations every 6 months. In the 42 years since the rule was \npromulgated, there has not been any evidence that pilots over age 60 \nare not fully capable of handling their flight responsibilities.\n  As an example, pilots who flew in commuter operations were allowed to \nfly past the age of 60 until the end of 1999. This practice ended with \nthe 1995 commuter rule. It mandated that any airline company which \noffered scheduled service using aircraft with nine or more seats had to \nfly under part 121 operations. However, this rule made special \nprovisions to allow pilots who were then flying over 60 to continue to \nfly for 4 more years as pilots in command and allowed companies to \ncontinue to hire pilots 60 and older for 15 months. There were over 100 \npilots over 60 years of age flying at that time. A study of 31 \ndetermined that they flew without a single accident or a single \nincident.\n  In 1999, 69 current and former airline captains organized and \nunderwent extensive medical testing and petitioned the FAA to drop this \nantiquated mandatory retirement. They were tested by a panel of \nnationally and internationally recognized experts in the field of \naerospace medicine, cardiology, internal medicine, geriatrics, and \nneuropsychological medicine. The panel determined that they were all \nqualified to perform airline captain and command duties beyond 60. Do \nyou know what happened? The FAA denied their exemption request.\n  In supporting documents to their petition, they showed that the FAA \nhad relaxed its medical requirements to allow pilots to fly with \nvarious medical problems, including hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, \nspinal cord injury, defective vision, liberalized height and weight \nrestrictions. They allowed that. It was an exemption. They were under \n60. But if you were 60 and in good health, you couldn't fly the next \nday.\n  In the area of cardiovascular special issuances, the American Medical \nAssociation applauded the FAA as having demonstrated an understanding \nof the advances in diagnostic treatment and rehabilitation. So we have \nthe American Medical Association applauding the FAA for allowing \nexemptions for those under 60, but if you are in perfect health and you \nare over 60, you can't fly.\n\n  In 1999, the FAA granted medical certificates to 6,072 airline pilots \nunder the age of 60 who had sufficient medical pathology permitting \nthem to operate as airline crewmen.\n  How does the FAA derive its medical consensus that it is safe for \nthose pilots to continue to fly and not those who have been flying for \n41 years without such medical pathology who happen to just arrive at \nthe age of 60? It is rather interesting. You can go down to the FAA and \nsee who is flying, who is giving check rides. Most of them are over 60 \nbecause they are exempt. Where is the logic in this, if the FAA can \nkeep its pilots on over 60, have them checked out, then you have a \nregulation here that is absolutely inconsistent with reality?\n  Twenty-five countries belonging to the European Joint Aviation \nAuthority raised the mandatory retirement age to 65, joining many Asian \ncountries that increased the age to 63 or 65. I know of no evidence \nthat those foreign pilots have a worse safety record than pilots under \nthe age of 60.\n  The time has come for Congress to repeal the age restriction on \ncommercial pilots. This is age discrimination. Years of medical and \nsafety data have failed to support the position that the chronological \nage of 60 represents a passenger safety concern. Therefore, as long as \na pilot can pass the rigorous medical exam, he or she should be allowed \nto fly.\n  We must, as a legislative body, eliminate age discrimination against \npilots who can and should be flying our commercial aircraft.\n  To suggest that somehow this is not germane to this bill flies in the \nface of reality. This is an aviation safety bill. What is more basic to \naviation safety than having experience? And how do you get experience? \nIt comes with age, whether you like it or not.\n  I think it is time we end this age discrimination once and for all. \nWe need experience in the cockpit. I know that I appreciate it when I \nam flying with a pilot who has seen more than a few thousand hours in \nthe air as well as simulator time. We value the aspects certainly \nassociated with life and maturing, but we should not be hypocritical in \nhow we treat pilots.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, only a month ago, our Nation faced a \nterrible tragedy. We learned loud and clear that we need to improve \naviation security and safety, not decrease it, which is what this \namendment would do. At a time that we need to protect the American \npublic, Congress should not be decreasing safety standards. Even the \nFAA opposes this amendment because of safety concerns.\n  This amendment would eliminate the current rule that commercial pilot \nmust retire at age 60. It was put into place to help ensure safety in \nthe air. It should only be changed if research can prove the effects of \naging do not impact a pilot's ability to fly a commercial jet at age \n60.\n  The ``Age 60 Rule'' for retirement of airline pilots was implemented \nby the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, based on safety concerns \nthat medical evidence showed that as a group pilots begin to \ndemonstrate the affects of aging around age 60.\n  Here is what the medical evidence of aging shows: there is a \nprogressive deterioration of physiological and psychological functions \nand this increases more rapidly as people age; sudden incapacity from \nheart attacks or strokes become more frequent in any group reaching age \n60; there is a the loss in ability to perform highly skilled tasks \nrapidly; it becomes harder to maintain physical stamina; it is more \ndifficult to perform effectively in a complex and stressful environment \nand to apply experience, judgment and reasoning rapidly in new, \nchanging and emergency situations; and, there is an increased \ndifficulty to learn new techniques, skills and procedures.\n  While it is recognized that such losses generally start well before \nage 60, it determined that beyond age 59, the risks associated with \nthese losses become unacceptable for pilots in airline operations.\n  Additionally, the Airline Pilots Association, the largest pilot \nunion, does not support raising the mandatory retirement age. In fact, \nthey oppose it.\n  Also, older pilots with seniority fly the largest, highest \nperformance aircraft that carry the greatest number of passengers with \nthe longest nonstop flights into the highest density air traffic. These \nare concerns as pilots age.\n  Additionally, a mandatory retirement age is not unique in the airline \nfield. For example, air traffic controllers have a congressionally \nmandated retirement age of 56 years old.\n  Yes, I am sure that there are a few pilots who can fly past 60. But, \nour decision should be made to protect the safety of the American \nflying public.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I know the good intentions of the Senator \nfrom Alaska. I have spoken to him on many occasions about this issue. \nThere likely is a time and place for this amendment. It is not on this \nbill.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

I yield to my friend from Alaska for 1 minute without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I share with Members the transcribed \nwords of our President from a few moments ago in an open Cabinet \nmeeting.\n  He urges the Senate to ``move a bill that will help Americans find \nwork and also make it easier for all of us around this table to protect \nthe security of this country. The less dependent we are on foreign \nsources of crude oil, the more secure we are at home.\n  ``We spend a lot of time talking about homeland security. An integral \npiece of homeland security is energy independence. I ask the Senate to \nrespond to the call to get an energy bill moving.''\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I was about to introduce, along with the \nPresiding Officer in the chair, the Senator from New York, as well as \nabout 12 other colleagues, an amendment to this legislation for \nsecurity needs for Amtrak. They are at a minimum of $1.8 billion. Just \nthe six tunnels that go into New York City carry 350,000 people per \nday. They are antiquated, built around 1910, and need significant \nupgrading to protect the safety and security of the people traveling on \nthose rails. I could go down the list. I will not, in the interest of \ntime.\n  The managers of the bill have made an agreement with me and with the \nPresiding Officer and many others to do the following: We will withhold \nthat amendment on this aviation safety bill. The chair and the ranking \nmember of the Commerce Committee are going to attempt to mark up an \nAmtrak security bill and possibly a port security bill in their \ncommittee as early as next Tuesday. God willing and the creek not \nrising, as my grandfather would say, there is a possibility they will \nbe able to report that to the floor sometime next week. I have spoken \nto the leadership on our side and have not had a chance to speak with \nthe leadership on the Republican side. It is our hope to bring that \nbill up and vote on that piece of legislation.\n  In addition to that, I have had an opportunity to speak with the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee and others who have indicated \nthere would be an attempt as we deal with the appropriated money for \nthis legislation we are about to pass, as well as other security needs, \nthat Amtrak would be considered in that process. I particularly thank \nmy friend from Arizona who is all for safety but not so much all for \nAmtrak. He has been very helpful here and has indicated if we are not \nable to get--I ask him to correct me if I am wrong--if for some reason \nwe are prevented from getting the authorizing legislation up before the \nappropriators do their job, he will not object to the appropriators \ngoing forward, notwithstanding his long-held view, as I have as \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, of not wanting the \nappropriators to do the work of the authorization committee.\n  I ask my friend, is that basically correct?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No.\n  The Senator from Delaware is correct, but I would like to emphasize \nthat we do have a safety and security problem with the railway system \nin America. It isn't just Amtrak; it is railway, railroad stations, it \nis railway centers and hubs all over America. So we need to take care \nof security and safety requirements so that people can ride on \nrailroads just as we are attempting with this aviation legislation so \nthat people can ride on airplanes in safety and security.\n  Yes, I am sorry to say, the Senator from Delaware is correct. I would \nsupport an appropriation for safety and security, but I certainly \nwould, as usually has been my custom, resist the appropriations that \nwould have to do with other matters, including additional track, rail, \nsalary, pay, union, and almost anything that can ever be imagined is \nusually proposed on one of these bills.\n  I thank the Senator. I thank my dear friend from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think it is more appropriate to refer to this as rail \nsafety. To give an example, the 350,000 people who go through the \ntunnels are not all on Amtrak trains. They are on the Long Island \nRailroad, they are on the New Jersey transit, using the Baltimore \ntunnel, for example, the Maryland transit, et cetera. It is rail \nsafety. It is not just Amtrak. But Amtrak is responsible for the rail \nsafety provisions of that. That is the reason I refer to it as Amtrak.\n  I thank Members on behalf of my 11 other colleagues. I see my \ncolleague from Delaware, a former board member of Amtrak. I am \ndelighted to yield to him for a few moments if he would like to make \ncomments on why we are not moving forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I thank the senior Senator for yielding. \nTo Senator Biden, to Senator McCain, to Senator Hollings, and others \nwho have been part of getting us to this rather extraordinary \ncompromise and position to go forward on the authorizing track and on \nthe appropriations track as well: Well done.\n\n[[Page S10527]]\n\n  Mario Cuomo, when he was Governor of New York, would talk about \ncampaigning and governing. He used to say:\n\n       We campaign in poetry, we govern in prose.\n\n  Here in the Senate, here in Congress, we authorize in poetry, but we \nappropriate in prose.\n  As important as this authorization is, and it is important that we \nget the authorization for work on the tunnels, for work on having more \nsecurity onboard our trains and in our stations, and I think some help \nin refurbishing some of the older rolling stock, locomotives and cars \nthat are needed to carry the extra people who are riding the trains \nnow, as important as the authorizing is, the appropriations is where \nthe rubber hits the road.\n  I pledge to work with Senator Biden and Senator Hollings and Senator \nMcCain and Senator Hutchison and others to make sure we get the work \ndone, not just on the poetry side but the hard work on the prose side \nas well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me affirm the exchange between the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware and our ranking member, the Senator \nfrom Arizona. The fact is, a railroad infrastructure enhancement bill \nwas introduced today, with some 10 cosponsors. The reason I mention \nthat is because we have been working long before September 11 on that \nneed of the Nation.\n  With respect to stimulus, there is no better stimulus than \nconstruction, and there is no more needed construction than to \nrefurbish the Amtrak line itself. Extend that: America needs high-speed \nrail.\n  Of course my distinguished colleague from Arizona, our ranking \nmember, is disposed at the moment only for safety. We will call up the \nbill and we will mark up what we can, facilitate, if necessary, and try \nto separate perhaps a bill. But I hope to move next week in committee \non this matter, as was indicated in our previous conversations, on \nTuesday morning at 10 o'clock when we can get a quorum and mark that \nbill up and report authorization out here so we will not be confronted \nlater on with obstacles. I think long before any passage of an \nauthorization bill we are going to be hitting appropriations on the \nstimulus bill or some other bill because we need to immediately take \ncare of safety and rail transportation.\n  The frustration of both Senators from Delaware is well understood. \nWhen we adjourned last year, we had everybody running around--\nRepublican, Democrat, leader and plebeians like myself--saying: Oh, the \nfirst thing we are going to do next year, the first thing we are going \nto do is take up Amtrak. It is now October.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I hope my distinguished friend and colleague from South \nCarolina did not include me in that group.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I again thank the Senator from Delaware. I believe we can \nmark up a bill on Tuesday with the chairman's leadership. I think we \nalso need to address seaport security as well. I believe seaport \nsecurity is a very serious issue as well as rail security. I hope we \nwill understand those are priority items that need to be addressed.\n  Senator Hollings is far more knowledgeable than I am. But some of the \ninformation we have about the amount of cargo, the amount of shipping, \nthe people and trafficking that goes in and out of the seaports in \nAmerica is also a very important issue that we need to address.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate the Senator's leadership and support. \nArizona obviously doesn't have very many seaports. But Senator Graham \nof Florida and myself have been on this issue for at least 2 years. We \nhave had all kinds of hearings long before September 11, and we have \nproduced a seaport security bill that we have been trying to fashion \nbecause it is a many-splendored thing. You have to get the entities, \nnamely the Port Authorities, to connect with the Customs, Drug \nEnforcement Administration, the Coast Guard, and the captain of the \nport, who really has legal authority and responsibility. We have to get \nthem all working together rather than just moving, moving, moving cargo \nbut actually having as a primary concern, safety and security.\n  We will be moving that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will just take another second. I note the Senator from \nSouth Carolina said the distinguished Senator from Arizona doesn't have \na port.\n  I am reminded when I first got here as a young Senator, I went to \nSenator Eastland, who I served under on the Judiciary Committee. \nSitting in his office one day, as I often did, with Senator Thurmond, \nasking him anything a young kid, a 30-year-old Senator would ask, I \nasked: Who is the most powerful man you ever served with?\n  He said: Senator Kerr.\n  I said: Senator Kerr, Senator Kerr of Oklahoma?\n  He said: Yeah--in his southern drawl which I will not attempt to \nimitate on the floor as I often do off the floor.\n  He said: Who in the heck else could bring up the Gulf of Mexico in \nthe middle of his State if he wasn't powerful?\n  I think, as the Senator's power continues to increase, he may bring \nthe Pacific Ocean to Arizona, but I am not sure how he will do it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The most entertaining man I ever knew was Morris Udall, \nwho often was heard saying: We in Arizona eagerly await the next \nearthquake so Arizona would be a coastal State.\n  That is not as amusing as it was once, since there was one out there. \nBut perhaps the Port of Yuma will still be a place the Senator from \nDelaware can help us with.\n  In case our colleagues are wondering what we are doing, we are hoping \nto resolve one remaining issue before final passage. Negotiations are \ngoing on as we speak so we would be able to move to final passage. We \nhope within minutes that we will have that issue resolved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1894\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Vermont, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for Mr. \n     Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 1894.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

Mr. President, it has been cleared on both sides. This \nis just to conform the Burns amendment relative to the Department of \nJustice having certain authorities. This is to conform, then to report \nback to the Judiciary Committees of both Houses.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1894) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1895\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

PAYMENT FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM LIMITATIONS ON \n                   USE OF RONALD REAGAN WASHINGTON NATIONAL \n                   AIRPORT FOLLOWING TERRORIST ATTACKS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, of the amounts appropriated or otherwise made available \n     immediately by the 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations \n     Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on \n     the United States (Public Law 107-38) that are available for \n     obligation, $65,648,183 shall be available to the Secretary \n     of Transportation for payment to the Metropolitan Washington \n     Airports Authority (MWAA) and concessionaires at Ronald \n     Reagan Washington National Airport for losses resulting from \n     the closure, and subsequent limitations on use, of the \n     airport following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \n     and subsequent reopening of other United States airports \n     after September 13, 2001.\n       (b) Allocation of Funds.--The amount available under \n     subsection (a) shall be allocated as follows:\n\n[[Page S10529]]\n\n       (1) $37,816,093 shall be available for payment for losses \n     of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority that \n     occurred as a result of the closure of Ronald Reagan \n     Washington National Airport after September 13, 2001.\n       (2) $27,832,090 shall be available for payment for losses \n     of concessionaires at Ronald Reagan Washington National \n     Airport that occurred as a result of the closure of Ronald \n     Reagan Washington National Airport after September 13, 2001.\n       (c) Application.--A concessionaire at Ronald Reagan \n     Washington National Airport seeking payment under this \n     section for losses described in subsection (a) shall submit \n     to the Secretary an application for payment in such form and \n     containing such information as the Secretary shall require. \n     The application shall, at a minimum, substantiate the losses \n     incurred by the concessionaire described in subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my colleague from the State of Virginia \nand I do this on behalf of the Metropolitan Washington Airports \nAuthority. It is all very clear to each and every one of us in the \nSenate that for reasons which are justifiable--because of security \nconsiderations--this airport had to be closed the longest of all. As a \nconsequence, the Airports Authority has an extensive financial package \nthat has been in place for several years. The ability to gain revenue \nto service that package has been taken away from it.\n  We have a number of small businesses and others associated with \nconducting, in the physical plant, the airport itself, their business \nactivities; they have suffered just irreparable injury. We all know \nthat. And we all want to help. There are various ways by which this can \nbe done.\n  I am prepared to hear from the distinguished manager, who I believe \nwill be speaking on behalf of the leadership, about how this serious \nfinancial situation at this particular airport--mind you, all other \nairports were able to open shortly afterwards. I am not quarreling at \nall with the justification for closing it, but this one remained \nclosed, and also it is functioning at somewhere between 15 and 25 \npercent of flight capacity as of now. The projections are, as we go to \nadditional phases, that capacity will be increased, but we have no \nassurance at what point we reach 50 percent, 60 percent, and are able \nto gain the revenue to service the necessary financial requirements.\n  So if I might, for the moment, yield the floor in hopes that the \nmanagers, who have been very helpful to me and to others on this \nquestion, will address this issue. I would be happy to consider that \nbefore proceeding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Virginia, I \nappreciate his cooperation on this issue, particularly his appreciation \nof the fact that this is an airport/airline security bill, and the \nissue, as compelling as it is, that the Senator from Virginia raises is \nrelated to the compensation--well-deserved compensation--of the people \nwho live and work at National Airport and who, because of an order of \nthe Federal Government, have been deeply harmed economically and, \nunfortunately, in other ways as well.\n  So I appreciate the sensitivity of the Senator from Virginia to the \nparameters of this bill. The distinguished chairman and I have had to \nturn back a number of amendments because they were not related--\nliability, and a number of others--to airport security.\n  But that does not change the fact that there is still a compelling \nproblem out there. It is an issue that must be addressed. I believe the \nstimulus package is a place where it would be very appropriate. I do \nnot think anyone who is aware of what happened at National Airport--a \n3-week shutdown by direct order of the Federal Government--does not \nrealize that we have some responsibility. The size of that \nresponsibility, and how, I think can be the subject of negotiations and \ndiscussion with the administration, the Finance Committee, members of \nthe Appropriations Committee, et cetera.\n  But I do not know of a Member of this body who isn't totally \nsympathetic and appreciative of the leadership of the Senator from \nVirginia--in fact, both Senators from Virginia--in their commitment on \nthis issue. Since this has happened, I know both Senators have made it \ntheir highest priority to address this issue, so that these people who \nare innocent--innocent of any wrongdoing, and are victims in a very \nreal way of a terrorist attack on America, and who need to receive \ncompensation--receive compensation and help.\n  I am very grateful for your leadership, as I am sure the people in \nthe northern part of Virginia are very appreciative of the Senators' \nefforts.\n  So I would like to join with all of my colleagues in saying we want \nto help, we want to assist, and we think there are ways that must be \nimplemented--not later, but sooner rather than later--to address this \ncompelling problem.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia will yield, not only as chairman of the Commerce Committee but \nalso as a former member of the Metropolitan Washington Airports \nAuthority, I was vitally interested in the whys and wherefores of \nholding back Reagan National Airport.\n  We had the Secretary of Transportation 2 days after this particular \ntragic event. We were allowing, say, Dulles, and other airports, to \nfunction. There was no reason, once we secured the cockpit--I realize \nyou had the general security problems--but once you secured that \ncockpit--and Boeing said they could retrofit immediately sufficient \nplanes to be landing and taking off at Reagan National--that we at \nleast ought to start back the shuttles to New York and then on to \nBoston.\n  So I have been down the path of the Senator from Virginia on this \nparticular score. I endorse his idea 100 percent. It is just that kind \nof situation on airport security. As you know, the junior Senator, Mr. \nAllen, has been vitally interested in it. He is a member of our \ncommittee. He and I have been working on this particular bill, moving \nas much as we possibly can.\n  So in any way I can possibly promise you that you will have my \nsupport on the amounts, and everything else of that kind, I would be \nglad to help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, those are very reassuring comments from my \ntwo long-time friends and associates here in the Senate, colleagues I \ntrust and colleagues who, when they make commitments, follow through.\n  Given that, and the fact that you have entertained the petitions of \nother Senators with respect to facilities in their States----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. WARNER. And that there has been a uniform practice here between \nthe chairman and the distinguished ranking member as to how to deal \nwith those amendments, I am prepared, at this time, to withdraw the \namendment, with those assurances that at the stimulus package juncture, \nthis body will study that.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Very definitely we will be supporting that on the \nstimulus package, or some other bill that comes up that is appropriate \nand germane.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1896 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1897\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe we have one Jeffords amendment \nto which we have agreed. I send it to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Jeffords, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1897.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To give retired pilots the same preference as law enforcement \n                      officers to be air marshals)\n\n       In amendment No. 1858, on page 1, line 8, insert ``or an \n     individual discharged or furloughed from commercial airline \n     cockpit crew position'' after ``age,''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment is going to give pilots the \nsame preference as law enforcement officers to be air marshals. I think \nit is\n\n[[Page S10530]]\n\na good amendment. I think many of our pilots, including those who are \nrequired to retire at age 60, would make excellent air marshals. This \namendment would give them the same preference as law enforcements \nofficers. I think it is a good amendment.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we support the amendment on this side. \nIt has been cleared. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1897) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                          AIR MARSHALS FUNDING\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am concerned that the $2.50 user fee \nin this bill is not sufficient to provide all of the air marshals we \nneed. The $2.50 user fee would only provide between $1.3 billion and \n$1.7 billion annually, in my opinion, enough to fund Federal security \nscreeners at our airports, but not enough to provide additional air \nmarshals.\n  Today, I intended to offer an amendment to give the Secretary of \nTransportation discretion to raise this fee to $5, which would raise \nover $3 billion annually to devote to aviation safety.\n  To ensure that the bill on the Floor passes quickly and we provide \nincreased aviation security as soon as possible, I have decided not to \nproceed with my amendment. I still believe, however, that people are \nwilling to pay more to feel safe on airplanes and the more air marshals \nwe have, the better.\n  I want to thank the Members of the Commerce Committee for their hard \nwork on this bill, and especially the Chairman and Ranking Member of \nthe Committee, Senator Hollings and Senator McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you Senator Feinstein. I too am concerned about \nairline safety and want to be sure we have provided enough funding for \nmarshals. The Senator from California has my full assurance that if \nmore air marshals are needed, I will support providing more funding to \nthe Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation \nAdministration to accomplish that goal.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I too am in agreement with the Senator from Arizona and \nstand with him in support of funding the needed air marshal program.\n\n\n                   airlines honoring airline tickets\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, because of the events of September 11, tens \nof thousands of airline passengers who bought airline tickets before \nand after that date will find that the flight they wanted is \nunavailable. How do these ticket holders get another flight or get \ntheir money back?\n  If they paid cash for their tickets, then, they are out of luck if \nthe airline goes bankrupt. There is no guarantee that another airline \nwill honor the ticket.\n  If they bought their ticket using a credit card, then as I understand \nit, Federal law protects them, but at a tremendous cost to those few \nbanks who process airline tickets. The ticket holder has the right \nunder Federal law, the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, to seek a \nrefund from their credit card issuing bank. If the airline is unable to \ncover such charge-backs, the loss is borne by the acquiring or \nprocessing bank. The burden on the banking system as a result of the \nevents of September 11, and the requirements of Regulation Z, is not \nsmall. About $5 billion of advanced ticket sales by credit card exist \nat any given time. I doubt that anyone anticipated that Regulation Z \nwould be used in this manner after an act of war shut down the entire \nair transportation system and caused the failure of perhaps several \nairlines.\n  There is a simple and equitable way to protect these passengers who \npaid cash and have no recourse. It can also relieve some of the burden \nthat the law puts on a very few banks. I have a letter from Consumers \nUnion that proposes the solution. It says, ``Consumers Union believes \nthat carriers that receive federal funds under H.R. 2926 should be \nobligated to honor the tickets of other carriers, where due to service \nchanges or discontinuation, the issuing carrier is unable to provide \nthe contracted service.''\n  In short, if an airline has empty seats, then let the passengers who \nwould otherwise be denied service use those seats.\n  I intended to offer an amendment to this effect. Instead, I would ask \nthe distinguished floor manager a question. Does he agree that in light \nof the aid this Congress has provided to the airlines, it is not too \nmuch to ask them to honor, to the extent practicable, the tickets of \nother carriers that are unable to provide the contracted service?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I think that is entirely reasonable. This could be done \nby regulation or even by an explicit gentleman's agreement from the \nairlines. I do not think it is too much to ask.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Administration has \ntaken the first step toward an important safety initiative by limiting \ncarry-on bags to one bag plus one personal item such as a purse or a \nbriefcase.\n  In this context, I would like to mention a special issue that has \narisen concerning the safety procedures we promulgate, and the impact \nthey might have on the practice of many musicians and musical artists \ncarrying their instruments with them. I know that many of us have heard \nfrom the American Federation of Musicians, ASCAP, the Music Educators \nNational Conference, the National Association of Music Education, and \nthe Recording Industry Association of America, among others, about this \nissue. These organizations have expressed concerns, in light of recent \nsecurity enhancements, about the ability of their members to continue \ncarrying musical instruments aboard airplanes.\n  Rules promulgated by the Federal Government or by air carriers that \nwould prohibit musicians from traveling with instruments in-cabin \nwould, among other things, severely limit the ability of orchestras to \npresent guest artists, audition musicians, and tour within the United \nStates and internationally, and put at risk valuable, historical \nmusical instruments. Limitations on carry-on bags should not put an \nundue burden on musicians, consistent with the requirements of safety. \nI am certain we can make it clear to those charged with the detailed \nadministration of air safety policies that there is obviously a rule of \nreason and practicality to be observed.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Senators Hollings \nand McCain for this much awaited, much needed piece of legislation and \nto urge my colleagues to help pass it.\n  It is critical to our Nation's economy that we restore the flying \npublic's confidence in the safety of the aviation system. We need to \nget more planes in the air and we need to make sure they are full. \nLegislation that improves and expands security at our airports and on \nplanes is essential to getting citizens back in the air.\n  While it is safer to fly today than it ever has been before, this \npackage, which improves our Nation's aviation security, shows that the \nSenate is making an aggressive and firm commitment to America's \naviation security and America's economy.\n  Two weeks ago I was on a flight from Montana back to Washington. By \nchance, I sat next to a gentleman who I appointed to the Air Force \nAcademy in Colorado Springs 20 years ago. He was an F-16 fighter pilot. \nAnd is now a commercial airline pilot.\n  In the wake of the tragic events of September 11, he had a bunch of \nideas to increase security on airplanes and airports. I asked him to \nwrite his ideas down. He found a scrap of paper and jotted them down. \nThis is the paper he gave me. I am so pleased to see many of his ideas \nin S. 1447.\n  From Federal marshals on domestic flights to protecting our pilots in \nthe cockpit. From vastly improving airport security measures to better \nscreening of airport employees, this legislation takes a giant step \nforward in securing our flying public.\n  And securing our flying public is a giant step closer to securing our \neconomy.\n  I would like to specifically address three items in the bill that I \nbelieve are of vital importance:\n  First, as chairman of the Finance Committee, I am pleased to say that \nthere is no ticket tax levied on airline passengers. I don't believe \nthat this is the time to raise taxes. In my State of\n\n[[Page S10531]]\n\nMontana, people believe they pay enough to fly around the country. \nSince we are relieving the airlines of their security responsibilities, \nit makes perfect sense that the $2.50 per passenger user fee be \nassessed to the airlines, not the passengers.\n  Second, I am pleased to see a temporary expansion of the Airport \nImprovement Program and Passenger Facility Charge funds for use on \nsecurity operations. This flexibility will surely help defray some of \nthe costs for smaller airports.\n  I have been hearing from many airports back home. They are desperate \nfor financial relief. These small, rural airports are faced with \nsignificant increased costs in order to comply with new FAA security \nstandards. These new costs alone would be enough to tap their already \npaltry resources. However, like all airports around the country they \nare also facing declining revenues including landing fees, parking lot \nfees, car rental fees, bars and restaurants and gift shop fees. We need \nto help them, just like we helped the airlines.\n  I enthusiastically supported the airline relief package Congress \npassed 2 weeks ago. We needed to assist the airlines for the good of \nour traveling public and the good of our economy.\n  But relief to the airlines won't do anyone any good, if they don't \nhave airports to land in. We are in danger of many of our airports \nclosing their doors and their gates and their runways because they are \nout of money.\n  The flexibility provided in this bill will make a real dent in the \nairport's economic situation.\n  Third, I am also pleased to see a reimbursement program for these \nairports for completed security-related projects. This program, along \nwith the AIP/PFC flexibility are extremely helpful, but are only a \ntemporary life preserver for the airports. Discussions need to continue \nabout how we can really save them from drowning.\n  I would like to close by once again commending the work done on this \nbill by both staff and Senators and to urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of S. 1447. The public needs it and our economy needs it. Folks \nat home will thank you for it.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the legislation \nbefore the Senate which is designed to overhaul aviation security in \nthis Nation.\n  This is an issue of vital national importance during these dark days \nin America's history, and as a member of the Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, I believe it is critical that we \npass the strongest possible enhancements to our existing system and do \nso as soon as possible.\n  The fact of the matter is, the images of the unspeakable horrors of \nSeptember 11, 2001, will be etched in our minds forever. When the \n``devil incarnate'' hit the United States, he attacked not only \nAmerica, but freedom-loving nations everywhere. We are going to need \nthe resources of the United States coupled with the cooperation of our \nglobal neighbors in order to wage this fight against terrorism. For it \nis a fight we must win, and will win.\n  But there should be no mistake, victory will not come overnight. We \nare here today debating this bill because, as we mourn the tremendous \nloss of life both of those in the air and on the ground, we also know \nthat our transportation system must endure and must be secure if we are \nto move the Nation forward.\n  We must leave no stone unturned in the effort to preserve this \nNation's transportation infrastructure, so that we might both carry on \nthe business of the Nation and ensure our continued economic viability, \nand also ensure that we are in a position of strength to be able to \nwage the kind of war necessary to eradicate terrorism. And, we cannot \nremain strong if we cannot remain mobile.\n  Specifically, we are here today to improve our aviation security \ninfrastructure and policies, to instill the kind of confidence that is \nvital to the health of our country's commercial airline industry. \nClearly, our way of life, our freedom to travel and do so with \nrelatively minimal encroachment, was used against us in the most \nhorrific way imaginable. And it is vital that we take the necessary \nsteps now to prevent such catastrophes from recurring.\n  The debate on this legislation is so critical because aviation \nsecurity will only be addressed with a comprehensive, exhaustive \napproach that recognizes we are dealing with interlocking rings of \nissues, from perimeter security to on-site airport security to on-board \naircraft security to a range of other issues, and that the entire \naviation security system is only as strong as the weakest ring.\n  That is why I have cosponsored Senator Hollings's comprehensive \nlegislation to improve aviation security. This bipartisan legislation \ntakes critical steps to safeguard the security of our airports and \naircraft. It includes provisions to strengthen cockpit doors, increase \nthe number of sky marshals, which is a critical issue also addressed in \nSenator Hutchison's bill, S. 1421, of which I am a cosponsor, to \nincrease the number of sky marshals, federalize security, and improve \ntraining and testing for screening personnel.\n\n  Federalizing security, in particular, is an issue I feel very \nstrongly about. The fact of the matter is, if the flying public does \nnot have confidence in airport security, they will remain reluctant to \nfly, and this will have severe long-term repercussions in the aviation \nsector and in our economy. Imposing stringent Federal control and \noversight over airport security will go a long way to helping instill \nconfidence in the flying public, and will enable the government to \nexercise much greater control over the quality of screening.\n  This is a problem that was identified long ago. In September 1996, \nthe White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security recommended \nthat FAA was, in fact, poised, at the time of the terrorist attacks, to \nissue a final rule, as directed by Congress last year in the Airport \nSecurity Improvement Act of 2000, establishing training requirements \nfor screeners and requiring screening companies to be certified.\n  And in its January 18, 2001, Top DOT Management Challenges Report, \nthe Department of Transportation Inspector General noted that, to close \nthis critical gap in security, the Government ``. . . needs to have a \nmeans to measure screener performance, and methods of providing initial \nand recurrent screener training as well as ensuring that the screeners \nmaintain their proficiency through actual experience with the machines \nin the airport environment.'' The IG also concluded that the ``. . . \nFAA must complete deployment of equipment that will help in the testing \nand training of screeners.''\n  Quite frankly, I am not convinced that we can ever have full \nconfidence in our airport security without stringent Federal controls, \nwhich is why it is vital we resolve the issue of federalization once \nand for all.\n  In addition to addressing the issue of airport security, the Hollings \nlegislation:\n  Establishes a Deputy Administrator within the U.S. DOT for \nTransportation Security,\n  Establishes an Aviation Security Council, comprised of \nrepresentatives from FAA, DOJ, DOD, and the CIA to coordinate national \nsecurity, intelligence, and aviation security information and make \nrecommendations;\n  Stipulates hijack training for flight crews;\n  Requires background checks on students at flight schools; and\n  Increases perimeter security.\n  I would note I am particularly pleased that the legislation before us \nincludes my amendment directing a new Deputy Secretary for \nTransportation Security within U.S. DOT, which is established in the \nunderlying bill, to focus on the critical mission of better \ncoordinating all modes of transportation nationwide during a national \nemergency, such as the tragic events that unfolded on September 11. And \nI thank Senators Hollings and McCain, in particular, for working with \nme and for their support on this important issue.\n\n  I am also very pleased that the Hollings bill addresses the issue of \nbackground checks on students at flight schools. On September 21, I \nintroduced legislation, S. 1455, to regulate the training of aliens to \noperate certain aircraft. Under S. 1455, background checks would be \nrequired before any alien would be permitted to receive jet flight \ntraining.\n  I also commend the President for his leadership. The President's \nproposal addresses many of the same core\n\n[[Page S10532]]\n\nissues. His air travel security plan would expand the sky marshal \nprogram. It urges Governors to deploy the National Guard at Federal \nexpense at all commercial airports. It would provide oversight and \ncontrol of airport screening by the Federal Government. And it would \nprovide $500 million to help airlines fortify cockpit doors, install \nsurveillance cameras and install aircraft tracking devices that cannot \nbe turned off.\n  Under the President's plan, contractors would continue to perform \nscreening. The Federal Government would set standards, supervise \noperations, conduct background checks and training, purchase and \nmaintain equipment, and oversee airport access control.\n  I believe the administration's proposal would be a major step in the \nright direction. And I understand that some have concerns that \nfederalizing the screener workforce could make it difficult to remove \nemployees who are not performing their important duties.\n  It is my hope and my expectation that we will find common ground on \nthis point while coming together to ensure that Americans have complete \nconfidence in the men and women who form the last line of defense when \nit comes to preventing weapons from getting on our aircraft. And I am \nvery pleased that S. 1447 includes provisions to exert federal control \nover security screening once and for all.\n  One way or the other, this issue must be worked out so there is no \ndoubt about the quality of this critical workforce, this has got to \nhappen if we are to restore the American public's confidence in flying \nand, by extension, the health of America's commercial airline industry. \nAt the end of the day, we must have a screening system with stringent \nFederal controls and oversight, so that the government will control \nhiring standards, compensation, training, and re-training. We need a \nreliable, professional force of screeners.\n  We must move heaven and earth to make flying safe. That is our \nmission here today. One national poll, CNN/USA Today/Gallup, found that \n43 percent of Americans are less willing to fly, with the majority of \ntheir concerns centering on the adequacy of airport security. They are \nalso willing to sacrifice convenience for safety, with the same poll \nfinding widespread support for new measures, even if it means checking \nin two to three hours before a flight, or paying more to cover the \nincreased security costs.\n  The failure to correct the existing deficiencies in the aviation \nsecurity system has already cost us dearly, and we no longer have the \nluxury to postpone action. Accordingly, we must pass this bill now.\n  It is critical that we come together, as we did on a resolution \nsupporting the use of force to combat terrorism, as we did on \nlegislation providing emergency funding for the recovery and relief \neffort after the tragic attacks of September 11, as we did on a \nfinancial relief package for the airline industry, and pass legislation \npromptly to address the gaps in aviation security and restore the \nconfidence of the American people in our aviation system.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10532-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2001\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments and \nobservations about the September 11 attacks and about some of the \naviation security issues facing the Senate in the pending legislation.\n  To put these issues in perspective, I'd like to recall the \nextraordinary actions of the passengers on United Flight 93 on \nSeptember 11, the ill-fated flight that crashed in Pennsylvania. In the \nultimate act of self-sacrifice and heroism, a group of passengers \nrushed the cockpit and thwarted the terrorists aboard that flight from \ninflicting additional damage and loss on this great Nation.\n  Without doubt, those fathers, mothers, husbands, and wives, patriots \none and all, saved the lives of hundreds of Americans wherever that \naircraft was targeted. They understood what was happening, that they \nwould probably never again see their loved ones, but they acted \nheroically and, in sacrificing their own lives and dreams, probably \nsaved the lives of hundreds of their fellow citizens.\n  This Nation, and perhaps this Congress on an even more personal \nlevel, owes them a debt of honor and gratitude that is hard to \narticulate.\n  They deserve our recognition and our commitment that we will meet, \naddress, and repel the threat that forced them to pay so great a price.\n  They were among the many Americans in New York, Virginia, \nPennsylvania, and around the Nation who acted courageously during and \nin the aftermath of the terrorist attack on September 11. They brought \nhonor to all who love this country and what it represents, they are \nwhat America is all about.\n  These were not warriors or law enforcement officials. You might say \nthat they were neighbors, members of parishes, or people we might meet \nin our grocery stores. They were just ``average'' Americans. And the \nworld should wonder and our enemies should tremble at their mettle.\n  As devastating as the heinous act of September 11 was, and as \nincalculable as the pain, disruption, and loss inflicted upon the \nvictims at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and onboard the four \nhijacked United and American flights was, America and our very way of \nlife we cherish will endure.\n  No one can make right the loss that the families, the coworkers, the \nfriends and loved ones of the victims suffered because of these \ndespicable acts. I know that all of us here in the Senate and across \nthis great Nation continue to reflect and pray every day for the \naggrieved and the fallen.\n  We must take every step to assure the Nation that this tragedy cannot \nbe repeated. That is a tall order. I commend to your attention the \ncomments made by the pilot of United Flight 564 on Saturday, September \n15 to the passengers aboard that flight after the door closed and as \nthey prepared to depart from Denver International Airport. He is \nreported to have said:\n\n       I want to thank you brave folks for coming out today. We \n     don't have any new instructions from the Federal government, \n     so from now on we're on our own.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Sometimes a potential hijacker will announce that he has a \n     bomb. There are no bombs on this aircraft and if someone were \n     to get up and make that claim, don't believe him.\n       If someone were to stand up, brandish something such as a \n     plastic knife and say ``This is a hijacking'' or words to \n     that effect, here is what you should do: Every one of you \n     should stand up and immediately throw things at that person, \n     pillows, books, magazines, eyeglasses, shoes, anything that \n     will throw him off balance and distract his attention.\n       If he has a confederate or two, do the same with them. Most \n     important: get a blanket over him, then wrestle him to the \n     floor and keep him there. We'll land the plane at the nearest \n     airport and the authorities will take it from there.\n       Remember, there will be one of him and maybe a few \n     confederates, but there are 200 of you. You can overwhelm \n     them.\n       The Declaration of Independence says, ``We, the people . . \n     .'' and that's just what it is when we're up in the air: we, \n     the people, vs. would-be terrorists. I don't think we are \n     going to have any such problem today or tomorrow or for a \n     while, but some time down the road, it is going to happen \n     again and I want you to know what to do.\n       Now, since we're a family for the next few hours, I'll ask \n     you to turn to the person next to you, introduce yourself, \n     tell them a little about yourself and ask them to do the \n     same.\n\n  That pilot's guidance is serious--but these are serious times. \nAmericans are a people who empower themselves to do great things. \nClearly, the actions of the passengers and the crew on the American \nairlines flight earlier this week illustrate that the flying public, \nthe pilots and the crews are willing and committed to maintaining the \nsafety and security of our airways.\n  We should not delude ourselves into thinking that simple \npronouncements from the FAA, with all due respect, or tweaking the \nFederal Aviation Regulations, will allow us to sleep comfortably on \ntranscontinental flights.\n  It is all of our responsibility to ensure the safety of our airways. \nThe passengers aboard United Flight 93 knew that instinctively, the \npilot on the United flight out of Denver merely reminds us of it.\n  Accordingly, as we review and reform our safety and security \nprocedures, we must ask a simple question: would the actions and \ninitiatives we propose to undertake have prevented the recent terrorist \nattacks and will they prevent future acts. Unfortunately, I'm concerned \nthat the bill as currently drafted may fall short of meeting that \nstandard.\n  Our actions must be meaningful, effective, and they must restore the \nconfidence of the American public in the integrity and safety of our \ntransportation systems.\n  If there ever were a time for bold and aggressive steps to improve \nthe safety\n\n[[Page S10534]]\n\nof our transportation systems, now is that time. I believe, no, I know, \nthat this Congress and the American people will accept and embrace \nmeaningful steps toward that end.\n  We only need look at the full measure of sacrifice made by the \npassengers aboard United Flight 93 to know the depths of our \nresponsibility and I am heartened by the fact that I know that same \nspirit is aboard every plane in the sky.\n  I believe that it all starts with our intelligence capability, we \nhave to have the best possible intelligence about potential or imminent \nthreats in order to constantly focus and modify security procedures and \nefforts. Intelligence is the first line of offense in our war against \nterrorism.\n  The principle that should guide us is that through human scrutiny and \ntechnological screening, we should put passengers through sufficient \nsecurity procedures to identify potential threats;\n  For the passenger, that might mean answering computer generated and \ntailored questions at the ticket counter which might be followed by \ninterviews with security personnel; passage through a metal detector \nwhich might be followed by a thorough physical search of carry-on \nbaggage, and perhaps passage through another magnetometer or wanding \nbefore boarding the aircraft.\n  For checked baggage, that should mean passage through various and \nincreasingly sophisticated explosive detection systems followed by \nthorough physical search for any bag that requires further scrutiny, \nthere should also be random physical searches for all bags to improve \nproficiency and to raise the security penetration.\n  In addition, we should accelerate our research into emerging \ntechnologies to improve our ability to detect weapons carried by people \nor explosives secreted away in baggage. We also may need to consider \nstronger limitations on both hand carried and checked bags.\n  For the aircraft, that should mean armed air marshals on flights and \nhardening the cockpit door, as Delta Airlines has already begun, \nrevising access procedures to the cockpit, and increasing the security \ntraining of pilots and crews, including allowing pilots the option of \ndefending themselves.\n  We should require background checks of everyone who has access to the \naircraft: whether pilots, crew, ground personnel, baggage handlers, \ncaterers, and other contract personnel, with regular and periodic \nreviews.\n  For the airport, it entails a more substantial armed police force, \nconspicuously and constantly present in the public areas and \nconcourses. In addition, we need to improve the airport access \nprocedures and technologies to make sure that people are where they are \nsupposed to be and not in places that could present a threat to the \naircraft or passengers.\n  Simply put, we need to expeditiously pursue security technologies and \nprocedures at airport access points that cannot be defeated by even \nwell organized and clever terrorists.\n  And so, we come full circle back to intelligence, without a robust \nand aggressive intelligence effort that is constantly questioning \nwhere, how, and who may plan the next attack, our security measure will \nnot evolve to meet the challenge. Unfortunately, if that is the case, \nwe're merely waiting for the next attack.\n  Clearly, we must approach airline, airport, and aircraft security \nissues in complementary and overlapping ways to establish a security \n``net'' around our aviation system. What do I mean by a ``net?'' If we \nare suspicious about a bag or a passenger, that information is relayed \nand additional, more extensive security measure like I've described \nwould be employed.\n  The increased tempo and breadth of security operations pose dramatic \ncost increases for airlines and airports and for the Federal \nGovernment. I note that the legislation before the Senate contains an \nauthorization to reimburse airports for the direct costs of increased \nlaw enforcement requirements mandated by the FAA.\n  I think this is a legitimate and reasonable approach. The Federal \nGovernment should not place unfunded Federal mandates on our airports \nor any other unit of local government.\n  Clearly, the FAA mandated security directive requiring airports to \nincrease the law enforcement presence is necessary. I intend to work \nwith my colleagues on the appropriations committee to provide funding \nto help defray these costs and I commend the authorizing committee for \nproviding that authorization in this bill.\n  However, notwithstanding that there are some useful provisions in \nthis bill, I'm concerned that this legislation and this debate has \ngotten bogged down about whether we should ``federalize'' the aviation \nscreening functions. I doubt that ``federalizing'' is the panacea that \nsome would have you believe.\n  For some, it is an instinctive response to turn to the Federal \nGovernment in the wake of a crisis without ever questioning if it is \nthe responsible action to take or if the federal bureaucracy will be \nany better. So, ``federalization'' may be a bad idea whose time has \ncome.\n  We're missing the point if we misinterpret the mandate from the \nAmerican people to improve aviation security with a public desire that \nthe people searching our bags or manning the security checkpoint must \nbe receive a paycheck from the U.S. Treasury.\n  Keep in mind, the weapons that the terrorists carried on the aircraft \nwere legal to carry on the aircraft. What failed was intelligence, our \nresponse time, and the lack of security on board the aircraft. Let's \nfix those things. Until September 11, it was legal to take a 4-inch \nknife on board an aircraft, and metal knives were commonplace in first \nclass meal service.\n  The price tag for full Federal assumption of airport security is not \nsmall, in excess of $2 billion annually and that cost will only rise. \nAnd that's forever.\n  We must weigh that commitment of taxpayer dollars against whether it \nwould result in either improved security, or the perception of improved \nsecurity. There are a lot of things that the Federal Government does \nwell, I would argue that this is not one of them.\n  Let's not mislead the public into interpreting ``federalization'' to \nmean that baggage screening is going to be conducted by law enforcement \nofficers.\n  Not even the supporters of full federalization are contemplating \nhaving Federal law enforcement officers search passengers or carry-on \nbaggage.\n  In a federalized world, the metal detectors and bag searches would be \nconducted by Federal bureaucrats. I don't think that over time, the \nAmerican taxpayer is going to look at a bureaucrat bag screener and \nsay, ``I feel safer because a Federal employee is checking my bags.''\n  Remember, the money we spend on replacing private sector employees \nwith government bureaucrats means we will have that much less money for \nother security improvements, and we're talking about hiring as many as \n30,000 new Federal employees. That's three Army divisions.\n  I'm also concerned about the concept of a two-tier airport security \nconstruct. Some have advocated that we ``federalize'' at the largest \nairports while not ``federalizing'' at other smaller airports. That \nlogic is inconsistent with its proponents' other flawed reasoning that \nsecurity will somehow be magically improved and tightened by virtue of \n``federalization.''\n  The simple fact is we must improve aviation security at all airports. \nWe cannot have weaker points and stronger points in the system. \nInstead, we must tailor our security architecture to stop terrorists no \nmatter where they attempt to get into the system.\n  Further, I fail to see how creating a new Deputy Administrator at the \nFAA or a new Deputy or Assistant Secretary at the Department of \nTransportation moves the aviation security ball down the field.\n  Since both the past administration and this administration have had \nsuch difficulty in filling the Deputy Administrator of the FAA \nposition, I'm concerned that we're unnecessarily confusing and \ncomplicating the Federal bureaucracy.\n  I can't remember a case where an additional layer of bureaucracy led \nto the swift, decisive leadership I believe is necessary, especially in \nregards to safety and security. I'm also not certain that either the \nDOT or the FAA are the only, or the best place, for any new security \nfunction to reside.\n  I would hope that the relevant committees of jurisdiction would \nexplore whether these responsibilities wouldn't\n\n[[Page S10535]]\n\nbe better executed at the Department of Justice, the Department of the \nTreasury, or in the new Office of Homeland Security.\n  Personally, I believe that the President got it right in his \nproposal. The Federal Government would assume management and oversight \nof the security function. It is imperative that we have standards for \npersonnel, background checks, and training, as the President proposed, \nto improve the security net.\n  That is the appropriate role of the Federal Government. I'm \ndisappointed that the bill before us today seems to be taking this \nissue in a different direction.\n  When we addressed the imminent financial crisis facing the airline \nindustry 2 weeks ago, we acted expeditiously to restore the confidence \nof the financial markets that Congress and the administration had \nconfidence in the future of air travel in America.\n  Congress and the administration must move expeditiously, but \ndeliberately, to augment the interim security procedures already \ninstituted by the Administration. This is not a one time infusion of \ncapital or liquidity as was necessary in the Airline Stabilization \nlegislation.\n  Make no mistake, we must get this done and get it right before the \nend of this Congress. Taking a few more weeks as this bill moves \nthrough conference will not shake the confidence of the American \npublic.\n  The American people will live with our decisions on aviation security \nfor a long time. It is critical that we address the problems in the \nsystem without rushing to judgment. If we act precipitously we run the \nrisk of failing to address security in a thoughtful and comprehensive \nfashion, and, we may well lose the opportunity to make the meaningful \nimprovements that are essential to provide a system worthy of the \nAmerican public's confidence.\n  In the extreme, we run the risk of perpetrating a fraud on the \nAmerican public by misleading them into a false sense of comfort that \nwe have met the security challenge in this bill.\n  Congress has time to get this right. This is a complicated and \ncrucial issue and we should take the time to get it right. The \nadministration has taken the interim steps to restore public confidence \nand to bolster security at airports; our actions should augment and \ncomplement those steps, not quibble over organization charts and who \nmans the security checkpoints.\n  Clearly, the airlines, the airports, and pilots, such as the United \nAirline captain I quoted earlier, are taking responsible and meaningful \nsteps to improve safety and security. We should follow their example.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will pass \nthe Aviation Security Act. This bill will help restore our Nation's \nconfidence in commercial aviation by boosting the security in our skies \nand our airports. The strengthening of cockpit doors and the deployment \nof sky marshals, among other security measures in this bill, are \nmeaningful and worthwhile steps in making air travel safer.\n  This bill also includes a safety provision based on a bill I recently \nintroduced. The idea is from a couple of Wisconsinites. When I held one \nof my listening sessions following the vicious attacks on September 11, \nFire Chief James Reseburg and Deputy Police Chief Charles Tubbs of \nBeloit, WI, suggested an idea that they thought would help make our \nskies safer. Part of their idea was to create a registration system \nthrough which law enforcement officials, firefighters, and emergency \nmedical technicians could register voluntarily to serve in the event of \nan emergency on a commercial airplane.\n  For example, if an official was going on vacation on an airplane, he \nwould simply register with the airline beforehand to notify them that \nthey would have a public safety official on that flight. Like the sky \nmarshals, only authorized airline personnel would know when one of \nthese volunteers was on the plane. In many cases, these public servants \nalready notify the crew when they board that they are trained for \nemergencies and are willing to help out in the event they are needed. \nThey are trained to respond calmly during emergencies and can be of \ngreat assistance to an airline crew.\n  As many of my colleagues have stated, if the airline industry is to \nrecover fully from the events of September 11, 2001, we must make the \nflying public feel safe once again in our skies. The Aviation Security \nAct will help us do just that.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Aviation \nSecurity Act.\n  On September 11, four civilian airliners from three of our nation's \nairports were used as weapons of war. As were debating this \nlegislation, our military is taking action against those who are \nresponsible. One way to support our troops is to improve safety for all \nAmericans. That is the goal of this legislation. This bill enables us \nto take three concrete actions to improve safety in our skies.\n  First, it federalizes airport security operations. Security is a high \nskill job, yet airport screeners in this country are low paid, poorly \ntrained, and inexperienced. Many of our airport screeners make $6.00 to \n$7.00 an hour. That is a lower wage than many of our fast food workers \nreceive. Our airport screeners receive minimal training. The FAA \ncurrently requires 12 hours of classroom training for our airport \nscreeners, while France requires at least 60 hours of training. \nTurnover rates are also abysmal. From May 1998 through April 1999, \nturnover rates for workers at our nation's nineteen largest airports \naveraged 126 percent, and as high as 416 percent in some instances. \nWhen morale and incentive are low, poor performance follows. FAA \ninspection reports reveal significant weaknesses in the performance of \nour airport screeners. Security inspections showed that B.W.I. ranked \nfifth among major airports in the number of bombs, grenades or other \nweapons that went undetected in federal inspections. This is not a new \nproblem, however. The GAO reports that in 1987 airport screeners missed \n20 percent of the potentially dangerous used in tests, and it's been \ngetting worse over the past decade. That is why this legislation is so \nimportant. We have Federal officials protecting our borders and \nprotecting our President. We also need federal officials protecting our \nflying public. Federal workers can be fully trained and monitored. \nTheir primary goal would be safety, not the economic bottom line. The \nHollings bill does this by federalizing airport security operations, \nrequiring extensive training and deploying law enforcement personnel at \nairport security screening locations.\n  The second item this bill addresses is the safety of our pilots. We \nall know that the safety of our pilots is critical to ensuring the \nsafety of our passengers. The tragedies of September 11 showed that we \nneed to strengthen the cockpit doors and locks to prevent entry by non-\nflight deck crew members. This bill prohibits access to the flight deck \ncockpit by any person other than a flight deck crew member and requires \nthe strengthening of the cockpit door and locks to prevent entry by \nnon-flight deck crew members.\n  The third critical item this bill addresses is the expansion of the \nFederal Air Marshal program. On September 11, some heroic Americans on \nUnited Airlines flight 93 lost their lives as they confronted the \nterrorists. They prevented the plane from possibly flying into the \nCapitol or the White House. These brave citizens lost their lives, yet \nthey saved many others. Perhaps they saved the lives of those of us in \nthis chamber. We can't ask American citizens to risk or lose their \nlives on airplanes. We need federal air marshals on our airplanes to \nprotect our flying public. The Sky Marshal Program dates back to the \nKennedy Administration when the concern of highjackings to Cuba was \nprevalent. In 1970 the program was greatly expanded to include U.S. \nCustoms and military personnel. Two years later the program was phased \nout. Then, in 1985 a 727 flight from Athens was diverted to Beirut, \nwhere terrorists murdered Robert Dean Stetham of Maryland. The \nhighjackings of 1985 prompted Congress to reinstate the Federal Air \nMarshal program, but it's skimpy and spartan. This bill would allow a \nfederal air marshal on every domestic flight and every international \nflight originating in the United States.\n  The events of September 11 were an attack against America and an \nattack against humanity. We are a nation that is grief stricken, but we \nare not paralyzed in our determination to rid\n\n[[Page S10536]]\n\nthe world of terrorism. In the mean time we must act to make \ntransportation safer in the United States. We must exhibit a sense of \nurgency and pass this legislation immediately.\n  Airline security is a crucial part of transportation security, but we \ncan't stop there. We must also improve the safety of our railroads and \nour ports. We must ensure the safety of all components of our rail \nsystem, including: tunnel security, terminal safety, bridge safety and \nprotection of our track switchboards. Over 22 million people a year \nride our railroads and forty percent of all freight is transported on \nour rails. A terrorist attack on our rails could result in catastrophic \nloss of life and paralyze our economy. Amtrak is ready and willing to \nimprove passenger rail safety in this country, but it also must address \nits critical infrastructure needs. For example, the tunnels that run \nthrough Washington, Baltimore, and New York accommodates trains that \ncarry roughly 350,000 people a day. These tunnels don't meet minimum \nsafety standards, they don't have proper ventilation, and there is not \nadequate lighting. Rail safety requires federal help, but annual \nappropriations for Amtrak is frozen at $521 million, about half of its \n$955 million authorization in TEA-21. The Amtrak emergency package \nwould improve safety and security on our trains by: hiring more police \nofficers to patrol trains, stations and railroads; provide anti-\nterrorism training for employees; install cameras to monitor \nfacilities; improve the safety of tunnels, especially in the aging \ntunnels that run through Maryland, Washington, and New York.\n\n  The Amtrak emergency package would also provide additional rail \ncapacity to accommodates increased ridership. In the days following the \nSeptember 11th tragedy, Amtrak employees worked around the clock to \nprovide a safe, viable option to our traveling public. Daily ridership \nfrom September 12 to September 17 jumped 17 percent, and that doesn't \ninclude all of the airline tickets that Amtrak honored to keep America \non the move. On the Northeast Corridor, Amtrak added roughly 30 percent \nmore seating capacity, or 2,000 more seats per day on unreserved \ntrains. Amtrak responded to our national crisis in many ways: they \nhelped carry our mail, they delivered thousand of emergency relief kits \nto New York, and they provided transportation to firefighters, police \nand medical personnel. Some may argue that now is not the time to \ndiscuss Amtrak. I would argue there's never been a better time. Now is \nthe time to give Amtrak the support it needs to keep America moving \nquickly and safely. The simple truth is that we have a National \nPassenger Railroad System in this country that needs our immediate help \nwith security and capacity upgrades. It is our duty to respond.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to rise as a cosponsor of \nthe Carnahan amendment. This important amendment would help those who \nare most hurt by the economic impact of the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11. Thousands of American workers have lost their jobs during \nthis economic downturn. These workers need our help. We need to act \nquickly on a economic stimulus package that targets the American \nworker. Airline and aviation employees have been especially hard hit. \n140,000 thousand of these workers have been laid off since the \nterrorist attacks. Unemployment is steadily rising in the industry. \nLast week, 528,000 people filed for unemployment. That is the nearly \nthe population of Baltimore City, and a figure we haven't seen in nine \nyears. These people are our pilots, our flight attendants, baggage \nhandlers, concessionaires and aircraft builders. These workers have \nlost their paychecks, lost their health care and could lose their \nhomes. They need our immediate help, just as we helped their former \nemployers with a $15 billion stabilization package of grant and loan \nguarantees.\n  I am confident that the airline industry and the U.S. economy will \nrecover, but help is needed today. Senator Carnahan's amendment would \nprovide financial assistance, training and health care coverage to \nemployees of the airline industry who lose their jobs as a result of \nthe attacks on September 11. The Carnahan amendment would provide \nincome support by extending the number of weeks eligible individuals \ncan receive unemployment insurance, from 26 weeks to 79 weeks. These \ncash payments would not create a strain on state budgets, because they \nwould be funded entirely by the Federal Government. Workers who don't \nmeet their states' requirements for unemployment insurance would not be \nleft out. They would receive 26 weeks of federally financed \nunemployment insurance.\n  This amendment also addresses job training. Workers who may not \nreturn to their jobs within the airline industry would be eligible for \nretraining benefits. Other workers would be eligible for training to \nupgrade their skills. This amendment would enable laid off workers to \nkeep their health care by expanding the COBRA program. This would \nenable people who have lost their jobs to retain their health \ninsurance. Madame President, I strongly support the Carnahan amendment. \nIt is a thoughtful and comprehensive airline workers relief package. \nIt's also a good starting point to address the needs of working \nfamilies in America, and provides a good model for a broader economic \nstimulus package.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe in just a minute we will move to \nfinal passage.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, if there are no further amendments, we \nare ready for third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10536-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S.J.

I also thank \nSenator Rockefeller, particularly, and Senator Hutchison, as well, for \nher incredible efforts on this legislation.\n  This is an appropriate day for this legislation and the antiterrorism \nlegislation, given that it has been 1 month since the terrorist attack. \nWe in the Senate are taking a major step in ensuring that this kind of \nthing can never happen again. All of us in this body can be pleased at \nthe effort that has been put forth on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator McCain, for his total cooperation and leadership on \nthis measure, along with Senator Hutchison of Texas and Senator \nRockefeller of West Virginia who lead our Aviation Subcommittee. It is \nnot only an important safety measure but, in a sense, an airport and \nairline stimulus bill because now, if the House can take this up in \njudicious fashion, we can move forward and everyone can be assured \nimmediately of security in air travel.\n  For example, the American people will know once and forever that a \ndomestic airliner is never going to be used as a weapon of mass \ndestruction because we will have that cockpit secured, never to be \nopened in flight, so then we can economize on our requirements for the \nmilitary patrolling over flights, ready to shoot down a domestic \nairline because it cannot be hijacked in the sense of taken over and \ndirected anywhere, beyond a particular discord or disruption in the \ncabin itself. Once that occurs, the pilots will be informed, they will \nland, law enforcement will be there, and that will end hijacking in \nAmerica, as it has in Israel.\n  It is a very important measure with which we move forward promptly. I \nam delighted and pleased, particularly with the cooperation I \nmentioned, the staffs on both sides.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Senate has done a terrific job of \ndoing something on the 1-month anniversary of this tragedy for America \nthat will begin to rehabilitate the economy of our country, and that is \nwith aviation security we can begin to assure the American public they \ncan fly in safety.\n  The Senate has passed its bill. I think it is a terrific bill. It \nwill augment the cockpit. It will give better quality screening. It \nwill put air marshals in the air.\n  The American public needs to know the flying system is safe, and this \naviation bill is a good start in that direction. I hope the House will \nfollow suit and pass its bill. I know there are some differences, but I \nhope they will act expeditiously so we can send a bill to the President \nthat will begin to rehabilitate the whole aviation industry and the \nindustries that depend on it.\n  So I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator \nHollings, Senator McCain, Senator Rockefeller, my counterpart on the \nSubcommittee on Aviation. We could not have done it without the total \nsupport and the total bipartisanship that produced the 100-0 vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me thank, once again, the distinguished Senator, \nMrs. Hutchison of Texas. It is bipartisan, mainly because of her \nleadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10537-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10537-S10538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I, too, compliment the distinguished chair, the ranking \nmember, the subcommittee chair, and the ranking member for their \noutstanding work in getting us to this point.\n  A few days ago people would have been very skeptical about any \nprediction that this bill would have been passed 100-0, but it has been \npassed in large measure because of their leadership, and we are \ngrateful.\n  The next vote, as I think our colleagues are aware, is the resolution \non the day of remembrance.\n  I notify Senators there are three additional votes. There will be a \nvote on the National Day of Remembrance. There will be two additional \nrollcall votes on two judges.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the third and fourth vote in this next \nsequence be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is my hope and expectation we will \ntake up the counterterrorism legislation tonight following these votes. \nIt is my hope we could finish the work tonight. If we cannot, of \ncourse, we will finish the work tomorrow morning. If there is the \npossibility we could finish it tonight, it would be my desire not to \nhave any votes tomorrow. So we will leave that to Senators who wish to \nspeak and wish to debate the bill, but\n\n[[Page S10538]]\n\nwe will go to counterterrorism immediately following the votes to which \nwe have just referred.\n  We have a lot of work yet to do tonight, and I urge Senators to stay \nclose to the Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with regard to the schedule, I support what \nSenator Daschle is trying to do. I think we have done the right thing \nby moving the aviation security bill. We will have an opportunity to \nwork on it further in conference, for those who do have concerns, but \nwe have to say to the American people--in fact, we have to be assured \nwe can tell the American people we have addressed this aviation \nsecurity question as soon as possible. Next week hopefully we will be \nable to get into conference and produce a bill.\n  It is very important that as soon as possible we move this \ncounterterrorism legislation. Good work has been done in the Senate. We \nhave pointed the way in this effort, and so I hope our colleagues will \nwork to complete the bill as soon as possible. I hope all of the \ngeneral debate time will not necessarily be used, although it is up to \n4 hours. We also have as many as four amendments in order under the \nagreement that was reached. I hope we can get through that at a \nreasonable hour and complete the work tonight, but if it becomes \nevident it is going to take 4 or 5 hours to do this, then we will have \nto have the votes in the morning.\n  Even then, I presume the votes would begin at a relatively early \nhour, 9 or 9:30 a.m. Certainly Senator Daschle will announce that. \nWhether there are two or three votes, whatever it would be, we will be \ncompleted after that.\n  Having said that, at the end of this week, if we complete action on \nthese two bills, I think we will have done a great deal to move toward \nrestoring the confidence of the American people. I am proud of the \nprogress I am seeing made.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I understand it is the intention, then, of the \nleadership to complete the counterterrorism bill this evening; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator will yield, I will phrase it by saying it \nis my hope to finish it. We know what the time parameters are. We have \nalready agreed to that. If we are compelled to go through all of the \nvotes and it gets to be too late, we may have to move it into tomorrow. \nSo I am not going to say definitively tonight at this moment we will \nfinish our work on the counterterrorism bill, but that would be my \nhope.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand it, if we can complete work on the \ncounterterrorism bill this evening, then we will not be in tomorrow, or \nat least we will not be transacting business that requires votes \ntomorrow. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct. We would not have votes tomorrow. We \nwould have completed our work. I assume we could be in for morning \nbusiness to accommodate Senators who may wish to speak, but it is my \nintention not to have any rollcall votes tomorrow.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I express the hope our leadership on both sides of the \naisle can help to press hard to get the remaining appropriations bills \ncompleted and sent to the President singly and not as an omnibus bill. \nThe Appropriations Committee in the Senate today reported out the D.C. \nappropriations bill and the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. This makes \n12 of the 13 appropriations bills that the Appropriations Committee in \nthe Senate has reported out.\n  The House, I understand, is working on the Defense appropriations \nbill and will soon act on it and will shortly send over the conference \nreport on the Department of the Interior.\n  We will have to have another CR. That will be coming along probably \ntoday. In any event, our committee and our chairmen and ranking members \non all the subcommittees have worked diligently and hard, and I hope \nthe leadership will help us to bring pressure on both sides of the \nCapitol to move these appropriations conferences. The staffs have done \nthe preliminary work, a good bit of it in many instances.\n\n  It is absolutely necessary we show the American people that this \nCongress can do its work, is doing its work, but it is going to take \nsome effort on the part of all of us, I say to the distinguished \nminority leader and the majority leader, to bring these remaining \nconference reports to the floor. We shouldn't have to have another \ncontinuing resolution after this next one. We ought to complete these \nappropriations bills in the remaining days of this month.\n  Let's go home, for Heavens' sake, and see our families and \nconstituents and not delay further. I don't think it is intentional, \nbut it amounts to delay.\n  I thank both leaders for the efforts they made. We have some work yet \nto be done. We can do it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I say to the distinguished Chairman, I share his \ndetermination to complete our work on the appropriations bills. He and \nI have had many private conversations, and if I recall, even \nconsiderations on the floor.\n  I informed him and our colleagues on Monday there will be a vote on \nan appropriations bill, either the Interior conference report or on \ncloture on the motion to proceed to foreign operations. I share his \ndetermination to continue to plow through these bills and to accomplish \nas much as we can in the next 2 weeks.\n  As I understand it, the next continuing resolution will be for 1 \nweek. If that is the case, we have 2 weeks within which to complete our \nwork so as not to pass yet another continuing resolution. We have a lot \nto do. I appreciate very much his willingness to call attention again \nto that fact tonight.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished majority leader. We must show the \nAmerican people that we can pass these bills. We owe it to ourselves, \nwe owe it to the country, we owe it to the President of the United \nStates to send him individual appropriations bills, no omnibus bill. \nLet him have his opportunity to sign or veto the bills as he sees fit.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I might say briefly--I don't want to drag this out--\nobviously we need to be able to move our appropriations bills.\n  I must say, of course, how quickly we do that depends on several \nthings: One, how many controversial issues are in these bills when they \ncome out of the committee. I don't know what happened, for instance, on \nthe D.C. appropriations bill, but it had difficult and time-consuming \nissues in it. There may not be now.\n  The other thing is several of the bills, including Labor-HHS, often \ntake a week or two; Defense quite often takes 3 or 4 days. Part of it \ndepends on the willingness of Senators to withhold controversial \namendments to move the process along. We have been doing that \nmagnificently over the past month. Hopefully, we can do that even with \nappropriations bills--even though these are big bills, important bills, \nand Senators may want to be heard and offer amendments.\n  We also have to continue to work together on other issues that become \nproblematic, such as getting judicial confirmations moving because \nthere is a need for that, too.\n  Senator Daschle and I are working on this on all fronts. I talked to \nSenator Stevens about it. I want to get the appropriations bills \ncompleted. It will take a lot of cooperation. We are prepared to give \nit that cooperation and time.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank both leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10538-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10538-S10539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport Senate Joint Resolution 25.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 25) designating September 11, \n     2001, as a National Day of Remembrance.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, one month ago today, more than 6,000 \ninnocent men and women had their lives stolen from them in an act of \nterrorism so hideous and cruel that it still almost defies belief.\n  In the days since, we have come together--not as Democrats or \nRepublicans--as Americans, to honor the memory of all those who died at \nthe World Trade Center, the Pentagon and\n\n[[Page S10539]]\n\nin that lonely field in western Pennsylvania.\n  We have come together to tell their families they are not alone. They \nare part of our American family and we are with them--now in their hour \nof grief, and in the days and years to come.\n  And we have also come together to say, in the strongest possible \nterms, that we stand with President Bush in his determination to find \nthose who committed these hideous attacks and hold them accountable, \nand to destroy their global network of hate and terror.\n  I had the opportunity to join many of my Senate colleagues in the \ndays after the attack to visit Ground Zero in New York City. There, in \na mountain of rubble and wreckage that is beyond my ability to \ndescribe, I saw a sign scrawled on a wall. It read simply: ``We will \nnever forget.''\n  That is true. Whether we live another hundred months, or another \nhundred years, we will never forget the thousands of innocent victims \nwho lost their lives on September 11th.\n  We will never forget the heartbreak of those they left behind, or the \nstunning bravery of those who tried to save them.\n  And we will never forget our responsibility to find those who \ncommitted these evil acts and stop them.\n  That is our promise.\n  In the aftermath of the attacks, America has searched for words to \ndescribe the enormity of what happened.\n  Every description has fallen short--and so we simply refer to the \nday: September 11th.\n  This day has become hallowed in our memories, and in our history.\n  Today, Senator Lott and I are introducing a resolution to honor it on \nour calendars, as well.\n  This resolution designates September 11 as our national day of \nmourning and remembrance.\n  We ask that each year on September 11, the President issue a \nproclamation, the flags be lowered to half-mast, and that America \nobserve a moment of silence.\n  It is yet another guarantee that as years pass, and wounds heal, that \nwe will never forget what happened on that day.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MILLS, OF MISSISSIPPI, TO BE UNITED STATES \n        DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the Senate confirms Barrington Parker \nto the Second Circuit, we will have confirmed more Court of Appeals \njudges since July of this year than were confirmed in the entire first \nyear of the Clinton administration. When the committee completes its \nconsideration of Edith Brown Clement and she is confirmed to the Fifth \nCircuit, we will match the total confirmed Court of Appeals judges for \nthe entire first year of the first Bush administration.\n  When we confirmed Judge Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit on July \n20, the Senate had confirmed more Court of Appeals judges than a \nRepublican-controlled Senate was willing to confirm in all of the 1996 \nsession--a year in which not a single nominee to the Courts of Appeals \nwas confirmed, not one all session.\n  Until I became chairman and began holding hearings in July, no \njudicial nominations had hearings or were confirmed by the Senate this \nyear. We are now ahead of the pace of confirmations for judicial \nnominees in the first year of the Clinton administration and the pace \nin the first year of the first Bush administration.\n  In the first year of the Clinton administration, 1993, without all \nthe disruptions, distractions and shifts in Senate majority that we \nhave experienced this year through July and without the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, the first Court of Appeals judge was not \nconfirmed until September 30, the third was not confirmed until \nNovember and, as I have noted, the Senate never confirmed a fourth \nCourt of Appeals nominee.\n  In the entire first year of the first Bush administration, 1989, \nwithout all the disruptions, distractions and shifts of Senate majority \nthat we have experienced this year through July and without the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, the fourth Court of Appeals nominee \nwas not confirmed until November 8. Today, on October 11, the Senate \nwill confirm its fourth Court of Appeals nominee since July 20 of this\n\n[[Page S10540]]\n\nyear. Thus, in spite of everything we are more than one month ahead of \nthe pace in 1989.\n  During the more than 6 years in which the Republicans most recently \ncontrolled the Senate schedule, there were 34 months with no hearing at \nall, 30 months with only one hearing and only 12 times in almost 6\\1/2\\ \nyears did the Judiciary Committee hold as many as two hearings \ninvolving judicial nominations during a month. I held two hearings in \nJuly involving judicial nominations and two unprecedented hearings in \nAugust, during the traditional recess. I held a fifth hearing in \nSeptember, the sixth last week, and have scheduled a seventh hearing \nand second for October for next week. Thus, during the 4 months that I \nhave been chairman with a reconstituted Judiciary Committee we will \nhave held seven hearings involving judicial nominees and held two \nhearings in three of those 4 months.\n  A fair assessment of the circumstances of this year--in this \nshortened time frame of only a few months in session, with the \nobstruction in reorganization, the Republican objection that required \nall judicial nominations to be returned to the White House over the \nAugust recess, the President's unprecedented change in the process that \nshunted ABA peer review to the back end after the nomination, and now \nwith the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks--the committee \nand the Senate should be commended, not criticized, for our efforts to \nout pace the confirmations in the first years of the Clinton \nadministration and the first year of the first Bush administration. \nAlthough we have redirected much of the committee work and attention to \nhearings and a legislative response following the terrible terrorist \nattacks on September 11, I have continued to hold confirmation hearings \nfor judicial nominations at a pace far in excess of that maintained by \nmy Republican predecessor.\n  In spite of unfair and unfounded criticism, I have continued to \nproceed with additional hearings and press onward as best I can to have \nthe committee work to fulfil its role in the confirmation process. With \ncooperation from the White House and all Senators, both Republican and \nDemocratic, I have no doubt that we can match and likely better the \nconfirmation totals for the first year of the first Bush administration \nin 1989 by the end of the month.\n  I was encouraged to hear the White House sound a different tune \nrecently when its spokesperson suggested that the point at which to \nassess our progress on judicial nominations will be at the end of the \nsession. That is a far cry from the predictions earlier that there \nwould be no confirmations by the Democratic majority and the subsequent \nWhite House prediction, which we have already topped, that there would \nbe only five confirmations all year. I think that is a sensible thought \nand that we would be in position to compare apples with apples at the \nend of the first year of this administration.\n  Some Republican Senators have worked with me to expedite \nconsideration of judicial nominees needed for their States and I \nappreciate their courtesy and have tried to accommodate them and the \nneeds of the Federal courts in their States at the earliest \nopportunity. Others will carp and criticize no matter what we are able \nto achieve. I only wish those who now are rushing forward in the first \nweeks of my chairmanship to ``champion'' the cause of the Federal \njudiciary and see the current vacancies as a crisis would have sounded \nthe call during the slowdown over the last 7 years. Had they joined \nwith me in my efforts when they were in the majority, we would not have \nthe vacancies we have now around the country. Many more would have been \nfilled more quickly. I welcome them to the cause of the administration \nof justice but have to wonder whether their conversion is one of \nprinciple or partisanship. With few exceptions--Senator Specter comes \nto mind as someone who urged prompt action on nominees over the course \nof his Senate career including during the last several years--today's \ncritics were comfortable defenders of slower confirmation hearings, \nlong-delayed action on scores of nominees and no action on many others. \nGiven that none of the current critics has yet admitted that \nRepublicans did anything wrong over the last 7 years and has \nsteadfastly defended the pace at which the Republican majority chose to \nact then, I would think they would be praising our current efforts that \nexceed the confirmation pace and hearing schedule that Republicans \nmaintained when they held the Senate majority.\n  When I became chairman in June, I expressed my commitment to \nimproving upon the inefficiency and lack of bipartisanship displayed by \nthe committee in recent years. With respect to judicial nominations, \nour first hearing was noticed within 10 minutes of the adoption of the \nreorganization resolution and within a day of the committee's \nmembership being set on July 10. I have alluded to the two \nunprecedented August recess hearings I chaired last month involving \njudicial nominations.\n  Indeed, at the first on August 22, no Republican member of the \ncommittee even attended. In addition to taking place during the August \nrecess, those August hearings were unusual in that they were held \nwithout having nominations pending before the committee.\n  Just before the Senate recessed in early August, the Senate \nleadership requested that nominations, including all pending \nnominations for judicial appointment, be retained through the August \nrecess. This proposal was made by the Democratic leadership \nnotwithstanding the Senate rule that nominations should be returned to \nthe President when the Senate recesses for a period of more than 30 \ndays.\n  It was the objection of the Republican leader to that unanimous \nconsent request that resulted in the return of all nominations, \nincluding all judicial nominations, to the President in early August. \nThat Republican objection has resulted in the strict application of the \nSenate rules which has required needless paperwork and occasioned more \nunnecessary delay.\n  Given the objection by the Republican leader, no nominations were \npending before the Senate or the Judiciary Committee on August 22 or \nAugust 27 when we convened our recess hearings. In order to proceed \nlast month, we did so in a highly unusual manner. I did so with a high \nlevel of concern about that unusual procedure and noting the \nexceptional nature of those hearings.\n  Like the month-long delay in reorganizing the Senate, the objection \nof the Republican leader to the Senate retaining pending nominations \nthrough the August recess served to complicate and delay consideration \nof nominations. The bumps in the road created by the other side are \nespecially frustrating. Similarly, President Bush's decision to delay \nthe American Bar Association's evaluation of a judicial nominee's \nqualifications until the nomination is made public, has forced delays \nin the rest of the process as well.\n  As a result of this administration's break with the 50-year-old \nprecedent established under President Eisenhower, the confirmation \nprocess of even the least controversial and most qualified candidates \nis necessarily delayed by several weeks after nominations are received \nby the Senate. There were no District Court nominees who had been \nevaluated in time for the confirmation hearing I convened on July 24.\n  With the return to the President of the District Court nominees the \nPresident sent to the Senate in early August and the delay in ABA peer \nreview that results from the White House's decision to change the \nprocess that had worked for more than 50 years for Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents alike, we have continued to have a limited pool \nof District Court nominees available for consideration at hearings.\n  Likewise, this administration's failures early on to consult with \nSenators from both parties and to seek nominees who would enjoy broad \nbipartisan support remains a source of concern. We have nominees \npending whom the home State Senators do not know, and with whom they \nare not familiar and have never met.\n  In spite of these difficulties, we continue to move forward and \nexceed the pace set by both the Bush administration in 1989 and the \nClinton administration in 1993. Under Democratic leadership, the \nJudiciary Committee is making important strides toward replenishing our \nFederal judiciary. I have adhered, and will continue to adhere,\n\n[[Page S10541]]\n\nto a rigorous schedule, despite the terrorist attacks of September 11, \nand despite the limited opportunities provided by my not assuming the \nchairmanship until mid-session.\n  The Federal courts remain a symbol of justice to our citizens and to \nbelievers in peace and democracy throughout the world, and therefore, I \nwill work diligently to keep the judicial nominations process on track.\n  Judge Parker will be a good addition to the Second Circuit. He is \nuniversally praised by the Senators from New York and Connecticut. He \nhas been an outstanding District Court Judge. He is another from among \nthe first group of nominees sent to the Senate by President Bush in May \nand resubmitted in September. He was reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee, received the highest possible review from the ABA, \nand comes from a distinguished family of jurists.\n  Justice Mills is strongly supported by his home State Senators. He \nliterally went the extra mile and drove from Mississippi to his \nconfirmation hearing on September 13 when the air travel system in the \ncountry was still recovering from the terrorist hijackings of September \n11. I was gratified to hear Justice Mills testify that he will follow \nthe time-honored principles of stare decisis and respect the settled \nlaw establishing a woman's right to choose.\n  I had been concerned about his interpretation of binding precedent \nand the law given his dissent in McMillan v. City of Jackson. In his \ndissent he concluded that a protester convicted of trespassing at a \nfamily planning clinic should have been permitted to present a defense \nof necessity--in other words to justify his unlawful conduct by arguing \nthat the protester had a reasonable belief that such action was \nnecessary to prevent a significant evil.\n  Having heard Justice Mills state at his hearing that he will have the \nutmost respect for judicial precedent as a judge on the federal bench, \nI am prepared to support his nomination in spite of his dissent in \nMcMillan and out of respect for Senator Cochran and Senator Lott.\n  In addition to the judicial nominees the Senate is considering, we \nare also considering the nominations of 14 men and women to become \nUnited States Attorneys across the country, as well as the nomination \nof Benigno Reyna to be the Director of the United States Marshals \nService.\n  Earlier this year I raised the problem created by the administration \nbeing so slow to nominate United States Attorneys after calling upon \nthose holding those critical law enforcement posts to tender their \nresignations. I am glad that the White House took those observations to \nheart and began sending us nominees to be the Justice Department \nrepresentatives in districts in each of our States all across the \ncountry.\n  The President did not nominate anyone to be a United States Attorney \nuntil July 31, just before the August recess. Unfortunately, due to the \nobjection of the Republican leader even those few nominations were \nrequired under Senate rules to be returned to the White House during \nthe recess. In essence, we are working through nominees effectively \nreceived on September 5 and thereafter.\n  Since that time the Judiciary Committee has already reported almost \nhalf of the nominations received between September 5 and September 19 \nand will continue to press the administration to complete the paperwork \nrequirements on these nominations as soon as possible. The paperwork on \nthe first group of nominees was not completed until the second week of \nSeptember. They were then reported out and confirmed.\n  This second large group of 14 United States Attorneys will bring to \n26 the United States Attorneys confirmed in the period between \nSeptember 14 and October 11. I am proud of our record. We have managed \nto work through almost half of the 54 nominations for United States \nAttorney in a short period. Of course, the President has yet to \nnominate as many as 40 United States Attorneys. We will continue to try \nto work with the administration to make progress on these nominations.\n  I remain disturbed that the administration has yet to nominate a \nsingle United States Marshal for the 95 Districts across the country. \nThe Marshals Service is older than the Department of Justice itself and \nhas long been an essential component in Federal law enforcement. Yet \nhere we are in mid-October without a single nominee. It was created by \nthe first Congress in the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n  When we are calling upon the Marshal Offices and their deputies to \nhelp with security at airports, to contribute to the sky marshal \nprogram, to provide security at Federal buildings and for the Federal \ncourts and to protect us in so many ways, we need to take these matters \nseriously and move forward.\n  I know that Deputy Marshals from Vermont, for example, are helping \nwith operations in Vermont and in other parts of New England to ensure \nairport security and to protect government operations and all \nAmericans. Senators can be helpful to the administration in the \nselection of United States Marshals and trust that the administration \nwill begin consulting with Senators so that we can move forward to fill \nthese vital positions.\n  Today the Senate does have before it the nomination of Benigno Reyna \nto head the United States Marshals Service as its new Director. He will \ndirect a crucial component of our Federal law enforcement family, the \nUnited States Marshals Service. In this difficult time for America in \nthe wake of the attacks on September 11, I am pleased that we have been \nable to expedite his consideration by the Senate.\n  Having received his nomination on September 12, we proceeded to \ninclude him in a confirmation hearing on September. Even though we did \nnot receive his nomination until September 12, we were able to move him \nquickly to a hearing within a week and he is being considered by the \nSenate less than one month after his nomination.\n  I thank the Acting Director of the United States Marshals Service, \nLouie T. McKinney, and all of the acting United States Marshals and \nDeputy Marshals from around the country for their service in the past \ndifficult days and for their continuing dedication and sacrifice.\n  I wish Director Reyna, as well as the 14 new United States Attorneys \naround the country success in their new challenges.\n  I am proud of the hard work the Judiciary Committee has been doing to \nconfirm these and others of the President's nominees to the Department \nof Justice. Since the committee was reassigned members on July 10, we \nhave held ten nomination hearings for executive branch nominees.\n  We have proceeded expeditiously with hearings for the FBI Director, \nthe Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the \nCommissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the \nAssistant Attorney General for the Tax Division, the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Office of Justice Programs, the Director of the \nNational Institute of Justice, the Director of the Bureau of Justice \nAssistance, the Director of the Office for Victims of Crime, the \nDirector of the United States Marshals Service, the Associate Attorney \nGeneral, and the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \nCounsel.\n  Further, we have proceeded to confirm Assistant Attorneys General to \nhead the Civil Rights, Antitrust, Civil and Tax Divisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me just say, if I may, in the first \nyear of the Clinton administration the committee was controlled by \nDemocrats. In the last year of the Bush administration the committee \nwas controlled by Democrats. I have to say--when the all-time champion, \nwith 382 confirmed judges, was Ronald Reagan--that it seems to me the \nmoaning should quit at this point because we confirmed 377, 5 fewer \nthan Reagan, including the time Senator Biden was chairman; and he did \na good job. There were five fewer than Reagan during the Clinton years. \nIn my opinion, they would have had at least three more than Reagan, had \nit not been for Democratic holds and objections to their own nominees.\n  So let's just understand something: We are not putting these judges \nthrough anywhere near as fast as we should be putting them through. \nMost of the statistics show that the judges who were nominated in the \nfirst year of a President, up to August 1st, basically went through.\n  When we have had confirmation of these two judges, there will be \neight\n\n[[Page S10542]]\n\nwho will have gone through, three of whom are Democrats, whom I \nsupport. I think we have to do a better job because the Federal \njudiciary is one-third of the separated powers of this country. We now \nhave 110 vacancies. With these 2, it will be 108. We have 51 judges, \nnominees, sitting here, not getting hearings.\n  I happen to appreciate the work the distinguished Senator from \nVermont has done with the ones who have gone through, but we have not \ndone nearly what we should do before the end of this particular session \nof Congress. I hope we can do a better job in the last week or so of \nthis Congress to get more judges confirmed.\n  It isn't a matter of politics; it is a matter of doing what is right \nfor a third of the separated powers of our Government. I have to say, I \ndo get a little tired of hearing that we put through as many as the \nfirst year of the Clinton administration and the last year of the Bush \nadministration, both of which were controlled by Democrats.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, let me say to Senator Leahy from Vermont, for those who have \nbeen confirmed and those who are going to be reported out, I say thank \nyou very much. We do appreciate that sincerely. I am convinced that \nSenator Leahy, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and the \nJudiciary Committee, working with the leadership, will be having more \nhearings and will be reporting out additional judges. I certainly hope \nthat is the case.\n  Our concern, though, is some of the statistics that I think are not \ndisputable. For instance, since the August recess, I believe we have \nonly confirmed two judges--one circuit, one district. I understand \nthere have been two more reported, and we will be voting on those two. \nSo that is four.\n  I understand there has been a hearing, and maybe five more may be \nreported out this week, and then that they would be voted on, I assume, \nnext week. But it is a fact that there are 110 vacancies, and there are \n49 nominees pending before the committee. I believe that is right.\n  Mr. HATCH. Fifty-three.\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, I keep hearing different numbers. The fact is, there \nis a large number pending. But here is what really does concern me. Of \nthe judges whose names were submitted as far back as May and June, of \nthat group of circuit judges, which included 19 of them, and including \nJudge Gregory, who clearly is a Democratic nominee, only 3 have been \nconfirmed. One more has been reported. And there has been 1 hearing, \nleaving 14 of the 19 circuit judges' names submitted in May or early \nJune. I understand the ABA reports are completed. They have had no \nhearing and have not been reported.\n  On the circuit judges, of those who were reported in May and June, \nthree have been confirmed. None is on the calendar. Two hearings have \nbeen completed. And there are two on which there has been no action.\n  So there are 16 judges--circuit and district--who have been there \nsince May and June.\n  Having said that, I know the chairmanship changed in June, and it \ntook time to get organized in July, and we were out in August, and we \nhad an incident on September 11 that affected our schedule, and the \nSenator from Vermont and the committee have been involved in the \ncounterterrorism.\n  But that is as it is.\n  What I have asked Senator Daschle and Senator Leahy is to give me \nsome indication of how the hearings will proceed, how the reports will \nproceed throughout the rest of October and into November.\n  You know, it is so funny. One final point.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator like an answer?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would. One final point: It is amazing how history repeats \nitself. What you were saying last year we are saying this year. I guess \nbefore that, we were saying it or you were saying it.\n  So I would like to submit for the Record--and I ask unanimous consent \nto have this printed in the Record--quotes that were being offered just \n1 year ago on this same subject. There were complaints from me that the \nintelligence authorization bill was being held up, appropriations bills \nwere being delayed, not enough judges were being moved. So this is not \nnew. But I just ask that we continue to work together to try to move \nthe judicial nominations forward.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    A Year Ago, It Was Democrats Pushing For Judicial Confirmations\n\n       ``I was in the Minority for a number of years in my present \n     position and . . . I worked very hard in moving legislation, \n     and we did not hold up legislation based on judges. We did \n     not do that. . . . We did not hold up legislation based upon \n     judges . . . we had a right to do so, but I felt, and Senator \n     Daschle felt as minority leader that we had an obligation to \n     move legislation. . . .''--Senator Harry Reid, Congressional \n     Record, 10/10/2001, S10405\n       Compare the Majority Whip's remarks yesterday with the \n     following statements he and the then Minority Leader made a \n     year ago when they were in the minority and their party's \n     president was in the White House.\n       Exhibit No. 1: On July 21, 2000, while objecting to \n     Majority Leader Lott's attempt to proceed to S. 2507, the \n     Intelligence Authorization Bill, Minority Leader Daschle \n     stated: ``I hope we can accommodate this unanimous consent \n     request for the intelligence authorization. As [does] Senator \n     Lott, I recognize that it is important, and I hope we can \n     address it. I also hope we can address the additional \n     appropriations bills. There is no reason we can't. We can \n     find a compromise if there is a will, and I am sure there is. \n     But we also want to see the list of what we expect will \n     probably be the final list of judicial nominees to be \n     considered for hearings in the Judicial Committee this year. \n     I am anxious to talk with him and work with him on that \n     issue. All of this is interrelated, as he said, and because \n     of that, we take it slowly.'' [Congressional Record, S7426]\n       Exhibit No. 2: On July 24, 2000, while objecting to Senator \n     Lott's repeated attempt to proceed to S. 2507, the \n     Intelligence Authorization Bill, Minority Whip Reid stated: \n     ``I think it is unfortunate that we have been unable today to \n     deal with [Judiciary Committee Chairman] Hatch. . . . I hope \n     this evening or tomorrow we can sit down and talk. For \n     example, I believe the judge's name is White . . . who has \n     been before the committee and has not had a hearing. . . . In \n     short, we hope in the meeting with Senator Hatch, either \n     tonight or tomorrow, we will be in a position where we can \n     expedite the rest of the work this week and move on to other \n     things.'' [Congressional Record, S7469]\n       Exhibit No. 3: On July 25, 2000, while discussing with \n     Senator Domenici the delays in proceeding to the Energy and \n     Water Appropriations Bill, Senator Reid stated: ``We believe \n     there should be certain rights protected. Also under [the] \n     Constitution, we have a situation that was developed by our \n     Founding Fathers in which Senators would give the executive \n     branch--the President--recommendations for people to serve in \n     the judiciary. Once these recommendations were given, the \n     President would send the names back to the Senate and we \n     would confirm or approve those names. One of the problems we \n     are having here is it is very difficult to get people \n     approved, confirmed. This has nothing to do with the energy \n     and water bill. It does, however, have something to do with \n     the other bills. We could have moved forward on the energy \n     and water bill on Friday until this glitch came up.'' \n     [Congressional Record, S7525]\n       Exhibit No. 4: On July 25, 2000, while discussing with \n     Senator Wellstone the need to ``do the Senate's business'' \n     and the then-current status of bills under the Republican-\n     lead Senate, Senator Reid stated: ``We have a very simple \n     situation here. We in the minority believe we have had the \n     right to have a few judges approved by the Senate. . . . We \n     also believe we have some appropriation bills that need to \n     move forward, and there are some strings on that. We want to \n     work, but there are some things that we think, in fairness, \n     we deserve. As a result of that, things have slowed down, \n     which is too bad.'' [Congressional Record, S7504]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand that a judge whose name was \nsubmitted in June, and had his ABA rating of ``excellent'' in July, has \nnot had a hearing. But, as a matter of fact, he is going to have one \nnext week. So the process is moving. I hope we will continue to get \nthat done. But we have a lot of them who have been here since May and \nJune on whom we do need action. I hope we can get a commitment to get \nthat action soon.\n  With that, I yield for a question or comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished Republican leader and I have been \nfriends for over 20 years. He is a year younger, so I think of him as \nstill a good friend. I must admit that he is ahead of me in one area, \nespecially: He has two grandchildren now, and will be happy to show any \nSenators pictures. I only have one.\n  But he asked where we are going to go. I will tell him there is a \ncouple\n\n[[Page S10543]]\n\nthings we will not do. We had 34 months the Republicans controlled the \nSenate during the Clinton years where there were no hearings at all. I \nhave no idea how many months or years I might be chairman of this \ncommittee, but I have no intention of having a record like that.\n  In fact, when we reorganized committees, we actually had a committee \nwithin 10 minutes of the time--10 minutes--and the notice of the first \nhearing in a matter of days. When Senators have told me there was a \nproblem--the Senator from Mississippi had no problem getting his judges \nup. We are going to vote on one in just a few minutes. There were \nearlier objections because of rulings that judge made. I helped clear \nthose objections. I believe the Senator from Mississippi has another \njudge up for a hearing next week.\n  So, one, I will not go 34 months; two, I have been trying to \naccommodate Senators when they have told me they have had a problem. I \neven had hearings in the August recess to help out with this.\n  Now the Republicans did control the Senate for a while this year. \nThey did not have any hearings. I had 2 days of hearings during the \nAugust recess. Ironically enough, no Republican even showed up for one \nof them, for judges; and one Republican member of the committee \nissued--actually two members criticized us for even holding the \nhearings in August on President Bush's nominees.\n  So I think you are kind of in a ``damned if you do, damned if you \ndon't'' situation. One Republican Senator announced to the whole Senate \nthat I had announced in the press that one of these nominees would \nnever get a hearing. When I asked him where that was in the press, he \nsaid, well, maybe somebody else said it; but he did nothing to retract \nthat, of course.\n  So it is kind of a difficult thing, I tell my good friend. But I am \nnot going to do as the Republicans did in 1996, where we had no courts \nof appeals hearings. I do recognize there are some vacancies. Of \ncourse, there were nominees for those vacancies. Some sat here for 3 or \n4 years without having any hearing or vote under the Republican \nadministration of the Senate; 3 or 4 years unable to even get a hearing \nor vote.\n\n  We are moving. We will have more hearings next week. I will probably \ncontinue to have hearings during recesses. I will probably continue to \nhave complaints from Republican Senators or their offices when I have \nthose hearings during a recess, and some will probably not bother to \nshow up. But because I have told my friend from Mississippi we will \nkeep moving, we will. He should rest assured that, as tonight, when his \njudge is here, in a couple more weeks, his judge will be here again. I \ndon't know if that helps as an answer to him.\n  I also suspect, I say to my friend from Mississippi, we have a \nterrorism bill to go to tonight. He would probably like us to get to \nvotes on his judge and another judge so we can get to terrorism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will take another couple minutes. I want \nto set the record straight. During the first year of the Clinton \nadministration, only five court of appeals nominees were nominated \nduring the first year. Of those five nominees, three were reported out \nthe same year. That is 60 percent of President Clinton's court of \nappeals nominees in his first year that were reported. In contrast, \nPresident Bush has nominated 25 circuit court nominees, and the \ncommittee has reported 4. That is 16 percent. There were only two \ncircuit court nominees at the end of President Clinton's first year \nleft in the committee. There are currently 21 of President Bush's \ncircuit court nominees pending in committee and who will be left at the \nend of his first year if the committee does not act soon.\n  It is an unfair comparison when you take into account the fact that \nPresident Bush has chosen to nominate 20 more circuit court nominees \nthan President Clinton did in his first year.\n  The fact is, most of these circuit court nominees have well-qualified \nratings, meaning they have the highest ratings the American Bar \nAssociation can give. I can point to a lot of instances where the ABA \nhas not done a fair job. You have to presume they really have to be \ngood to get well-qualified ratings. It is absolutely wrong that we are \nnot moving on those circuit court nominees as well as the district \ncourt nominees. I hope we can get that done in the near future.\n  I will work with Senator Leahy to try to get it done. We have to do \nbetter than we are doing.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree, we want to do better than we did \nin the last 6 years. I will certainly try to move faster on these than \nthe Senator from Utah did when he was chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in light of the conversations just \nensued, I say to the Senator from Vermont that he has done an \nabsolutely superb job over the last month since September 11 in being \nable to put together the antiterrorism bill we will be considering \nlater this evening. I, for one, think this should have been clearly the \nfirst and only priority of the committee over that period of time.\n  We have had this long discussion. Certainly for the period since \nSeptember 11, the accomplishments of the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and his colleagues on that committee in shaping that \nlegislation and getting it before us tonight were splendid.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Judge \nBarrington Parker to be United States Circuit Judge for the Second \nCircuit. It is a distinct pleasure for me to recommend Judge Parker to \nthe Senate.\n  I would like to point out that this is not the first time that the \nSenate has been called upon to confirm Judge Parker. On September 14, \n1994, he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to serve as judge for \nthe United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n  Judge Parker is a distinguished jurist. He has proven that the \nSenate's trust in his abilities were well placed. He has accumulated a \nsuperb record as a Federal jurist. His career on the bench has been \nmarked by the same character of excellence and the same principled work \nethic that marked his career as a lawyer first at the New York law firm \nof Sullivan & Cromwell, Parker Auspitz Neesemann & Delehanty and \nfinally at the firm of Morrison & Foerster.\n  I suppose we shouldn't be surprised that Judge Parker has made such \ngreat contributions to the legal community in New York and to the \nFederal bench. After all, he was educated at an extraordinary college \nand law school in the great state of Connecticut. The time he spent at \nYale equipped him to serve with distinction. And incidentally, his \nchoice of residence in the State of Connecticut further demonstrates, \nat least to me, that he possesses excellence judgement.\n  Members of law enforcement sometimes refer to themselves as the \n``thin blue line.'' In a similar way, members of the judicial branch \ncan be considered the ``thin black line.'' Judges stand as the critical \nbulwarks in our society against forces that can break down a society, \nagainst injustice, against prejudice and against the neglect of \nindividual rights. They take the high and lofty principles upon which \nour republic is founded and hand them down to all, the rich and the \npoor, the high and the low, all alike.\n  It has been said that the Constitution and the laws that are enacted \nunder the Constitution comprise living, breathing documents. That is, \nof course, true. But it's also true that it is the labor of people who \nlive, professionally speaking, in the law, the students, the \npractitioners, and especially the adjudicators of the law, that \nconstantly breath new life into what would otherwise be fine but \nineffectual words on a page.\n  The rights and freedoms that we each enjoy as Americans are an \ninheritance, not an entitlement. They exist for us only to the degree \nthat we are willing to struggle to retain them and to constantly define \nwhat they mean for our times.\n  Judges are indispensable actors in this struggle. In Judge Parker I \nbelieve we have a jurist whose experience and temperament will prove a \nvaluable asset to the Second Circuit and the great and enduring cause \nof equal justice under law. Especially now, when that cause has come \nunder unprecedented attack from acts of terror, our\n\n[[Page S10544]]\n\nnation needs the commitment and service of people like Barrington \nParker. Based on everything I know about Judge Parker, he meets the \nhighest standards of judicial professionalism.\n  I hope and trust that the Senate will reach the same conclusion that \nI have reached and Judge Parker will confirm him as United States \nCircuit Judge for the Second Circuit.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to respond to three points \nraised earlier this evening concerning judicial nominations. The first \nis the assertion that the Judiciary Committee has acted on as many \nnominations this year as it did during President Clinton's first year \nin office. That assertion is not only incorrect, but also ignores \nseveral important facts.\n  President Clinton nominated 32 judges before October 31, 1993, his \nfirst year in office. Twenty-eight were confirmed that year. That's an \n88 percent confirmation rate. It's similar to the confirmation rate \nduring the first year of President G.H.W. Bush's presidency--89 \npercent--and compares to President Reagan's 100 percent rate of \nconfirmation for nominees sent to the Senate before October 31, 1981.\n  Compare these rates to where we are under President Bush and Chairman \nLeahy. President Bush has nominated 59 judicial nominees. Only eight \nhave been confirmed--including the two the Senate confirmed tonight. \nThat's a rate of 13.5 percent. If the Senate completes this session \nwithout raising this rate to the range of 88 to 100 percent, it will be \na dramatic break with precedent and a great embarrassment to this \nentire body. This is especially true because today we have 108 \nvacancies in the federal judiciary. That means that 12.6 percent of \nfederal judgeships are unfilled. These empty seats should especially \nconcern us in light of the enormous law enforcement effort underway to \ninvestigate the recent terrorist attacks and to prevent any future \nterrorist events.\n  Today's 12.6 percent vacancy is atypical. Compare it to the rates at \nthe conclusion of the three Congresses when Bill Clinton was President \nand I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. At the end of the 104th \nCongress, the vacancy rate was 7.7 percent. At the end of the 105th, it \nwas 5.9 percent. And last year at the end of the 106th Congress, it was \n7.9 percent. Ironically, some of the same people who constantly \nbemoaned the judicial vacancies when Bill Clinton was President are \nsilent today despite the much larger number of vacancies.\n  Mr. President, the second point to which I want to respond is the \nimplication that the lack of a Senate organizational resolution in June \nof this year precluded the Judiciary Committee from holding \nconfirmation hearings on judicial nominees during the three weeks that \nelapsed between June 5, the date our Democratic colleagues assumed \ncontrol of the Senate, and June 29, the date the Senate reached an \nagreement on reorganization. That implication arises from the statement \nthat the Committee scheduled a hearing within minutes of the Senate \nreorganization. I am puzzled by these remarks, because I see no reason \nwhy the Committee could not have held confirmation hearings under \nDemocratic control prior to reorganization.\n  The lack of an organizational resolution did not stop other Senate \ncommittees from holding confirmation hearings. In fact, by my count, \nafter the change in Senate control, nine different Senate Committee \nChairmen held 16 different nomination hearings for 44 different \nnominees before reorganization. One of these committees--Veterans' \nAffairs--even held a mark-up on a pending nomination. But in the same \nperiod of time, the Judiciary Committee did not hold a single \nconfirmation hearing for any of the then 39 judicial and executive \nbranch nominees pending before us--despite the fact that some of those \nnominees had been waiting nearly two months.\n  What's more, the lack of an organizational resolution did not prevent \nthe Judiciary Committee from holding five hearings in three weeks on a \nvariety of other issues besides pending nominations. Between June 5 and \nJune 27, the Committee held hearings on the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, the faith-based initiative, and death penalty cases. \nThere were also subcommittee hearings on capital punishment and on \ninjecting political ideology into the Committee's process of reviewing \njudicial nominations.\n  Although several members were not technically on the Committee until \nthe Senate reorganization was completed, there was no reason why \nSenators who were slated to become official members of the Committee \nupon reorganization could not have been permitted to participate in any \nnomination hearings. This was successfully accomplished in the case of \nthe confirmation hearing of Attorney General John Ashcroft, which was \nheld when the Senate was similarly situated in January of this \nyear. So, while I appreciate the Chairman's efforts, I am compelled to \nclarify that neither the lack of an organizational resolution nor any \nother factor prevented this Committee from holding confirmation \nhearings in June. Consequently, there is simply no significance to the \nfact that the scheduling of a hearing occurred in proximity to the \nadoption of the resolution.\n\n  Mr. President, the third point to which I want to respond is the use \nof a statistic: the number of months during my chairmanship in which no \nnominations hearings were held. I am not going to quibble over that \nparticular number here tonight because I disagree with the whole idea \nthat such a statistic could be relevant to any analysis of whether the \nSenate is performing its constitutional advice and consent function \nsufficiently.\n  Perhaps an analogy would help. Say you had a fire that is going to \nrequire 108 gallons of water to extinguish. And say that the person in \ncharge of supplying you the water prefers to count in ``containers'' \nrather than gallons--but won't tell you how big the containers are or \nhow much water is in them. Every time you say ``I need 108 gallons of \nwater,'' he responds, ``I've already delivered several containers.''\n  My point is that, with 108 judicial vacancies in our courts, and only \n8 of 59 nominees confirmed this year, it is not particularly useful to \nmeasure progress in terms of the number of hearings held. I suppose the \nCommittee could hold 8 hearings to confirm 8 nominees if it wanted to, \nbut the result would be no different than having a single hearing with \n8 nominees. Although we cannot have confirmations without hearings, \nhearings are not an end in themselves. What matters is the number of \njudges confirmed to the bench.\n  The bottom line of the Chairmanship is that the Senate confirmed \nessentially the same number of judges for President Clinton as it did \nfor President Reagan--only 5 fewer. This proves the Republicans were \nfair--especially because it was a six-year Republican-controlled Senate \nthat confirmed 382 Reagan nominees, and a six-year Republican \ncontrolled Senate that confirmed 377 Clinton nominees. Some Democrats \navoid discussing this bottom-line fairness because they know there is \nno partisan retort. So instead of working toward their own bottom-line \nnumber proving fairness to President Bush, some are focusing instead on \nthe number of hearings held. In the end, the only statistic that \nmatters is the number of confirmations. I urge the Democrats to get to \nwork.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the nomination of Barrington D.

Mr. President, let me first thank Senator Hollings and \nSenator McCain for their hard work and diligence in getting the \naviation security bill passed this evening. I congratulate them for \nthis accomplishment.\n  Let me also thank and commend my colleague from Montana, Senator \nBurns, for his contribution to this bill. I cosponsored and I spoke \nearlier today in support of his amendment to put certain aspects of \naviation security in the hands of the Justice Department.\n  I support this effort because the Justice Department is in the law \nenforcement and security business. The Department has a law enforcement \nmindset, a security mindset, and that is the mindset, a way of \nthinking, that is essential to making sure our airports and aircraft \nare safe and our people are secure.\n  Having said that, the bill we passed today, though it has some very \ngood and very important provisions, also has, in my opinion, a very \nsignificant problem. That problem is the bill as currently written \nmandates all security functions at the Nation's major airports be \nhandled exclusively by Federal employees. I believe this is a problem \nbecause this provision does not allow for the hiring flexibility \nnecessary to protect the traveling public. How can this Congress say \nwith absolute certainty that a 100-percent federalized security force \nwill in every case do the best job in carrying out security measures? I \ndo not think we really can say that.\n  The reality is we do not know right now. Yes, we do know we need the \nFederal Government to be in charge at our airports, and this bill, \nthank Heavens, does that. I also believe strongly that flexibility is \nkey to determining the best makeup of the security workforce. \nFlexibility in hiring between Federal workers and private contractors \nis absolutely essential.\n  At the same time, we need the Government to establish and enforce \nhigher, more stringent security standards. That is clear. The \nGovernment must set the security standards. The Government must be in \ncharge. The Government must assess the risks, set the standards, and \nthen test compliance with those standards. The standards, yes, must be \nstrict and they must be tough and they must be comprehensive.\n  The public demands we do this, and the public is right. That does not \nnecessarily mean a 100-percent federalized security workforce at our \nairports is in every case going to be the best security; that somehow a \nFederal takeover and full Government presence at our airports will \nrestore the public's confidence in air travel. Rather, higher standards \nand enforcement of those standards by our Government will give the \npublic back its trust in the system.\n  There are certainly gaps in our current airport security system. The \nway security works now is the airlines that have the biggest presence \nat a given airport usually are the ones responsible for hiring contract \nsecurity employees. Not surprisingly, the jobs normally go to the \nlowest bidders. It should come as no shock that current security is not \nwhat it should be. Screeners of baggage are low-skilled, low-paid \nemployees. Turnover is subsequently often as high as 100 percent in a \ngiven year, with the average employee today staying no longer than 6 \nmonths in that job.\n\n  The fact is, unless there is accountability, unless there is a way to \nensure the security personnel are doing their jobs, we cannot protect \nthe traveling public. If private sector personnel are not doing the \njob, we will and can cancel their contract. It is that simple. They \nhave a very real and very practical incentive to do a good job.\n  Further, it is difficult for the Government to be in the business of \n``regulating security'' and carrying out its actual operation. Other \nnations around the world don't do it that way. Israel, with one of the \nbest security records and one of the most dangerous terrorist-ridden \nparts of the world, does not do it that way. They do not do what this \nbill mandates.\n  Most nations in Europe had total federalization, and now they have \nchanged to a mixed system. Most of the countries in Europe, as the \nchart indicates, contract out well over a majority of the security \noperations while the government maintains the regulatory role.\n  The average Federal private personnel split in airport security \nacross Europe is 85-percent private employees, mostly handling \nscreening; 15 percent are government employees, performing the main law \nenforcement duties. The chart clearly shows this. European passenger \nscreening is the responsibility of the government, not the airlines, \nbut the European governments, in turn, have the flexibility to use \neither civil servants or private contractors to do the job. This works \nand it works very well. It is a public-private mix.\n  A recent FAA study found airport screeners in an unnamed European \ncountry were twice as likely as their American counterparts to spot \ndangerous items in scanned baggage. Additionally, in European airports \nthey have a 2.5 times greater personnel outlay than in the United \nStates. They pay more. The cost is 2\\1/2\\ times for security in Europe \nthan in the United States. We see the results.\n  The fact is, privately contracted security personnel in Europe are \nseen as\n\n[[Page S10546]]\n\nprofessionals. They take their jobs very seriously and the public \nrespects that. It is no secret that there is a perception problem at \nhome at our airports about the image of the current airport screening \nworkforce. I understand that. But the way to repair that image is by \nsetting better standards, repair that by raising the bar.\n  Like the U.S. Marshals I spoke about earlier today, the men and women \ntasked with protecting our Federal buildings and our courtrooms, we \nrespect them. They do a fine job. The Marshal Service is able to do \nthis great job largely because it sets high standards and then \ncontracts out many of the functions of its security in the protection \nof our courtrooms and courthouses. For example, the Federal Marshal \nService hires and manages about 3,300 contracted court security \nofficers, CSOs. They are mostly, as we would expect, former law \nenforcement personnel who assist with the court security. They get the \njob done. They do it well. That blend works very well. The Marshal \nService stays in charge, they are the professionals, but they contract \nout a portion of what they do.\n  There is no question we need to pay people better. We need to train \nthem better, and we need to make this a professionalized workforce, one \nthat gets respect and reflects the importance of the work they do. We \nneed to think about things differently. The first step in doing so \ninvolves improving and enhancing security measures at our airports. \nThat means we need better standards; we need better enforcement.\n  I hope by the time this bill reaches the President, we will have \ngiven the executive branch more flexibility. What we really need to do \nis to say to the executive branch and through our legislation, set \nhigher standards. Then give them the job. Whether that is the Justice \nDepartment, the FAA, give the administration the job to get that job \ndone and then hold them accountable.\n  When you give someone a job, when you say you are going to hold them \naccountable and when you set high standards but give them the \nobligation to get the job done, it only makes sense to allow them some \nflexibility in deciding how best to get that job done. Judge them by \nthe results but give them the flexibility.\n  I hope we will look at this again, and by the time this bill finally \nreaches the President of the United States, we will give the President \nthe tools he needs to get the job done for our security.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10546-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CARNAHAN AMENDMENT NO. 1855\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about fiscal \nresponsibility. Before I begin, I take a moment to discuss the Carnahan \namendment to the aviation security bill. First, I congratulate Senator \nMcCain and Senator Hollings for the passage of the airport security \nbill. The passage of that bill is long overdue. It is needed to secure \nour airports and aviation and to build confidence in the American \npublic.\n  One of the things that has gone unmentioned is most economists agree \none of the best things we can do to get the economy off the ground is \nto get our airlines into the air.\n  My constituents in Ohio have a significant stake in this bill because \nOhio has a significant aviation presence. In fact, with no disrespect \nto my good friends from North Carolina, Ohio is the birth place of \naviation since the Wright brothers hailed from Dayton and honed their \nskills in Ohio. They just happened to test out the ``flyer'' at Kitty \nHawk.\n  Today, a number of airlines have hubs in Ohio: Continental in \nCleveland, Delta in Cincinnati, America West has a big presence in \nColumbus.\n  Thousands of men and women working in the airline industry are \nhurting. I greatly appreciate the effort of my colleague from Missouri \nto aid them. There is no question the aviation sector has suffered \nparticularly hard from this economic downturn and was hit right in the \neye with the terrorist attack on September 11. However, as my \ncolleagues well know, there are tens of thousands around the country \nwho have lost their jobs in the past few months. There are tens of \nthousands more who are facing tough times, particularly in \nmanufacturing States such as Ohio. There are thousands of Ohioans who \nlost their jobs in the steel mills, in the polymer industry, and in the \nauto plants. According to the most recent statistics from the Ohio \nDepartment of Jobs and Family Services, 250,000 Ohioans today are \nunemployed. This figure is before September 11. Now, undoubtedly that \nnumber is larger. The vast majority of these workers would not benefit \nfrom the provisions of the Carnahan amendment.\n  It is very important that whatever assistance Congress renders to the \nworkers of this Nation, it is not just restricted to a set of workers.\n  I would have offered an amendment to the airport security bill, but I \nfelt it would delay the bill and I also felt it would be more properly \na part of the economic stimulus package. I intend to offer an amendment \nto that package when it comes before the Senate. I hope that happens \nquite soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10546-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10546-S10547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ALTERED FISCAL PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, discussions of the budget that once \ndominated the news headlines have been eclipsed since the world was \nforever changed by the horrendous events of September 11, and no one \nknows more about those events than the Presiding Officer.\n  Perhaps one of the most significant changes resulting from the \nterrorist attacks is how significantly our fiscal priorities have been \naltered. Almost instantly the debate shifted from how to protect the \nSocial Security surplus to how we should spend it to pay for \ncounterterrorism and homeland defense efforts and stimulate the \neconomy.\n  By necessity, this dramatic change in our fiscal situation calls for \nCongress to sort out our top priorities between those that existed \nbefore September 11 and which continue to demand our attention and our \nnew priorities, defending our homeland, fighting terrorism, and \nboosting the economy. We will commit the resources that are needed to \nsucceed in this challenge and we will obtain those resources in \nwhatever way is necessary.\n  Some of my colleagues will remember that prior to the events of \nSeptember 11 I was working closely with the administration and several \nof my colleagues on a bill designed to protect the Social Security \nsurplus, control spending, and ensure debt reduction. That legislation \nhad two exceptions: recession and war. If it had been in place, both of \nthese exceptions would apply.\n  Having said that, I emphatically say to my colleagues that the need \nfor fiscal discipline is greater now than ever before. It must not be a \ncasualty of September 11. We still need to prioritize our spending and \nwe still need to make hard choices. As I said, the events of September \n11 changed everything, and they have also changed our fiscal outlook \nfor years to come.\n  Over the past few fiscal years, sustained by peace, prosperity, and \nassuredness, our Nation has had record budget surpluses. Unfortunately, \nthe existence of surpluses has had an undesirable effect. Congress has \nexpanded the Government, created new programs, and dramatically \nincreased spending in others. The speed at which the fiscal fortunes of \nthe Federal Government have shifted is astounding. Almost 8 months ago, \nCBO projected we would run an on-budget surplus for fiscal year 2001 of \n$125 billion, as well as a $156 billion Social Security surplus--a \ntotal of $281 billion that was supposed to be used for debt reduction.\n  However, on September 26, the CBO released its monthly budget review \nand revealed a much different story. According to the CBO, when all is \nsaid and done the total unified budget surplus in fiscal year 2001 will \nbe $121 billion, a change of $160 billion from the January estimate. \nThis means Congress used $40 billion of the Social Security surplus to \nfund the general Government activities.\n  The news for fiscal year 2002 is equally sobering. Last week the \nSenate Budget Committee, working in a bipartisan manner, released new \nfigures on the budget outlook for fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year \n2011. The committee predicts that we are on track to spend the entire \nSocial Security surplus in the 2002 fiscal year, and most or part of \nthe Social Security surplus in the following year.\n\n[[Page S10547]]\n\n  We see that on this chart. We show a $52 billion surplus, but the \nfact is, we are truly in deficit because we will be using $122 billion \nof Social Security in 2002, $125 billion in 2003, and so forth. So we \nare going to be using the Social Security surplus, according to this \nchart, all the way out to the year 2006.\n  I remind my colleagues the projected $52 billion unified surplus is a \ngross exaggeration of the possible surplus this year because we have \npledged we are going to use $60 to $75 billion to stimulate the \neconomy, which means we are going to wipe out this $52 billion surplus \nin 2002. In fact, we are going to have to borrow the money from the \npublic to pay for the things we want to do.\n\n  I would like to remind my colleagues the bleak budget outlook I \ndescribed goes way out into future years. The Senate Budget Committee \nprojected we will spend significant portions of Social Security \nsurpluses, as I mentioned, in 2003 to 2006.\n  I further remind my colleagues that these figures on this chart, as \nbad as they are, do not tell the whole story. These we are showing are \nbased on a cost-of-living increase in spending based on inflation. \nRemember Congress spent 14.5 percent more in fiscal 2001 on nondefense \ndiscretionary spending than they did in fiscal year 2000. We should \nhave no illusions that Congress is going to spend at the rate of \ninflation. I don't know of any time that Congress has spent money at \nthe rate of inflation. As to these numbers on this chart, you might as \nwell forget them. They are gone because the projections are based on \ninflationary increases and we know that is not going to be the case.\n  Our current crisis should not be used as an excuse to run up the tab \nfor programs and projects not related to the war on terrorism or \nstimulating our economy. Now more than ever before we have to \nprioritize our funding and make tough choices. Do our spending choices \nput the safety of American lives at home and abroad front and center? \nWill they truly boost the economy? These are the questions that should \nbe applied to every dollar Congress spends. Our current fiscal position \ndoes not allow for any unnecessary spending. Domestic needs must be \nreprioritized. Those of us who have been concerned about fiscal \nresponsibility have to recommit ourselves to fiscal discipline. We have \nto make the tough choices to keep in check the urge to spend, keeping \nin mind we are spending the Nation's Social Security money with every \nadditional dollar that goes out the door. Once it has gone out the \ndoor, we are then going to borrow that money from the public.\n  I am concerned that some proposals being considered in this Senate \nare inappropriate, given the long-term budget pressures we face. You \nwill be hearing from me and hopefully many others about some of those \nproposals. If the stimulus package we put in place results in chronic \nbudget deficits, it is going to drive up interest rates. And make no \nmistake about it, the financial markets are closely watching what we \ndo. If they see Congress taking actions that will steer the Federal \nGovernment towards persistent deficits, they will drive interest rates \nhigher. Higher interest rates will have exactly the opposite effect on \nthe economy from what we want. They would put a brake on the economy by \nraising consumers' interest payments and discouraging economic \nactivity.\n  Remember, low interest rates are important to the economy. In fact, \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has been quite clear about this \nas he has highlighted this to many of us.\n  I think this is very important. This is not merely an academic \nexercise. The recent rise in long-term interest rates is attributed to \nthe deteriorating budget condition of the Federal Government in the \npast few weeks. As my colleagues know, Congress will consider a true \nstimulus package in the near future. Helping America's workers, all \nworkers, should be and will be a part of that package and should be our \nNo. 1 priority.\n  The stimulus package can only be so big. So it is critical that we \ntouch as many Americans as possible. All of them should participate in \nthat economic stimulus package. That same message applies to the money \nwe allocate to fight terrorism at home and abroad. We need to \nprioritize and we need to get the biggest bang for our buck, literally \nand figuratively.\n  We in this body must never lose sight that the day of reckoning with \nthe baby boomer retirement has not been put off by our current crisis. \nLike it or not, the baby boomers will begin to retire in about 10 \nyears, and if we fail to act, we will put an unacceptable burden on our \nchildren and grandchildren. We face an important challenge in preparing \nfor that day. Our goal should be to fund our war on terrorism at home \nand abroad, respond to the needs of the victims of the terrorist attack \nin New York and here in Washington, get our economy going, and as soon \nas possible end deficit spending. We owe it to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation under \nthe unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is nothing pending before the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  On behalf of Senator Daschle, I now ask that the Senate consider S. \n1510.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10547-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10547-S10630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNITING AND STRENGTHENING AMERICA ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1510) to deter and punish terrorist acts in the \n     United States and around the world, to enhance law \n     enforcement investigatory tools, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the time agreement that we are now \noperating under?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 hours equally divided. In \naddition, there are 40 minutes on each of the four amendments to be \noffered by the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  I cannot help but think in looking at our distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, the senior Senator from New York, how much his State has \nsuffered. Both he and his distinguished colleague, Senator Clinton, \nhave spoken so eloquently, both on the floor and elsewhere, about that. \nI know in my own private conversations with the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer I felt the depth of his grief and emotion for a city that he \nobviously and unabashedly loves. His references to New York City over \nthe years are almost similar to the kind of comments I make about \nVermont. But I do note the accent is somewhat different. I assume it is \nbecause of the Vermont accent.\n  But I think the Senators from New York, and the Senators from New \nJersey and Connecticut have especially spoken of the effect on families \nand loved ones in the New York City area. People who work there are \nfrom New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. I know how sad they feel.\n  I think of the people who died in Pennsylvania in an airplane that \nwas probably planning to strike the very building we are in--this \nsymbol of democracy. Only with a great loss of life did it not happen. \nBut there would be an enormous disruption in our Government. The next \nday, the view that most people around the world have--our symbol of \ndemocracy--would be gone.\n  I think of the brave men and women who died, as the President and \nothers have said, doing their duty at the Pentagon, and the hundreds--\neven thousands--of children who went to school happily in the morning \nand came home to find that they were orphans.\n  It was a terrible, terrible day.\n  I think back to what happened in Oklahoma City in 1995 and the \nactions we took then. We are moving, of course, much faster now than we \ndid at that time, and I hope perhaps with more care on legislation.\n  We have before us the USA Act of 2001. I worked with Chairman \nSensenbrenner and Congressman Conyers\n\n[[Page S10548]]\n\nand Republican and Democratic leaders in the House because I hope \nCongress can act swiftly to enact this measure.\n  Some may be concerned if we have a conference--because the House is \nsomewhat different than the Senate--that we could take a year or more \nto resolve these issues. That happened after Oklahoma City. That \nlegislation took nearly a year to reconcile.\n  I believe the American people and my fellow Senators, both Republican \nand Democratic, deserve faster final action.\n  I assure the Senate, when we go to conference, we will complete that \nconference very quickly. We have demonstrated the ability in this \nbody--and also Senators who have worked with me on both sides of the \naisle and our staff--that we can work around the clock.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and I have \nbeen working together in constant communication with our staffs.\n  Last Thursday, October 4, I was pleased to introduce, along with the \nmajority leader, Senator Daschle, and the Republican leader, Senator \nLott, also the chairmen of the Banking and Intelligence Committees, \nSenator Sarbanes, Senator Graham of Florida, Senator Hatch, and Senator \nShelby, the USA Act.\n  I must say this bill is not the bill I would have written if I were \nthe only one writing it. I daresay it is not the bill the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, one of the brightest and most accomplished people I \nknow, would have written, if he were writing it. It is not the bill the \ndistinguished chairman of the Banking Committee would have written if \nhe were writing it. It is not the bill the distinguished ranking \nmember, Mr. Hatch, would have written when he was chairman, if he was \nsolely writing the bill. It is really not the bill that any one of the \nother Members would have written. We can't pass 100 bills.\n  We have tried to put together the best possible bill. Of course, \nRepublican and Democratic colleagues must come together, and that is \nwhat we did.\n  I should point out that this is not the bill the administration, \nthrough the Attorney General, delivered to us and asked for immediate \npassage. We actually did the administration a favor because rather than \ntake the bill they dropped in our laps and said pass immediately, we \ndid something that apparently they had not done. We read it and were \nable to refine and supplement their proposal in a number of ways. We \nwere able to remove a number of unconstitutional parts. The \nadministration accepted a number of practical steps that I proposed to \nimprove our security on the Northern Border to assist our State, \nFederal, and local law enforcement officers and provide compensation to \nthe victims of terrorist acts and to the public safety officers that \ngave their lives to protect us.\n  It also provides proposed checks on Government powers--checks that \nwere not contained in the Attorney General's initial proposal.\n  In negotiations with the administration, I have done my best to \nstrike a reasonable balance between the need to address the threat of \nterrorism, which we all keenly feel at the present time, and the need \nto protect our constitutional freedoms. Despite my misgivings, I have \nacquiesced in some of the administration's proposals because it is \nimportant to preserve national unity in this time of national crisis \nand to move the legislative process forward.\n  We still have room for improvement. Even after the Senate passes \njudgment on this bill--I believe it will tonight--the debate is not \ngoing to be finished because we have to consider those important things \ndone in the other body.\n  What I have done throughout this time is to remember the words of \nBenjamin Franklin--when he literally had his neck on the line because \nif the Revolution had failed, he and the others would have been \nhanged--when he said: A people who would trade their liberty for \nsecurity deserve neither.\n  We protected our security, but I am not going to give up the \nliberties that Americans have spent 220 years to obtain.\n  Moreover, our ability to make rapid progress was impeded because the \nnegotiations with the Administration did not progress in a straight \nline. On several key issues that are of particular concern to me, we \nhad reached an agreement with the Administration on Sunday, September \n30. Unfortunately, within two days, the Administration announced that \nit was reneging on the deal. I appreciate the complex task of \nconsidering the concerns and missions of multiple federal agencies, and \nthat sometimes agreements must be modified as their implications are \nscrutinized by affected agencies. When agreements made by the \nAdministration must be withdrawn and negotiations on resolved issues \nreopened, those in the Administration who blame the Congress for delay \nwith what the New York Times described last week as ``scurrilous \nremarks,'' do not help the process move forward.\n  Hearings. We have expedited the legislative process in the Judiciary \nCommittee to consider the Administration's proposals. In daily news \nconferences, the Attorney General has referred to the need for such \nprompt consideration. I commend him for making the time to appear \nbefore the Judiciary Committee at a hearing September 25 to respond to \nquestions that Members from both parties have about the \nAdministration's initial proposals. I also thank the Attorney General \nfor extending the hour and a half he was able to make in his schedule \nfor the hearing for another fifteen minutes so that Senator Feinstein \nand Senator Specter were able to ask questions before his departure. I \nregret that the Attorney General did not have the time to respond to \nquestions from all the Members of the committee either on September 25 \nor last week, but again thank him for the attention he promised to give \nto written questions Members submitted about the legislation. We have \nnot received answers to those written questions yet, but I will make \nthem a part of the hearing whenever they are sent.\n  The Chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, Senator Feingold, also \nheld an important hearing on October 3 on the civil liberties \nramifications of the expanded surveillance powers requested by the \nAdministration. I thank him for his assistance in illuminating these \ncritical issues for the Senate.\n  Rule 14. To accede to the Administration's request for prompt \nconsideration of this legislation, the Leaders decided to hold the USA \nAct at the desk rather than refer the bill to the Committee for mark-\nup, as is regular practice. Senator Hatch specifically urged that this \noccur and I support this decision. Indeed, when the Senate considered \nthe anti-terrorism act in 1995 after the Oklahoma City bombing, we \nbypassed Committee in order to deal with the legislation more promptly \non the floor.\n  Given the expedited process that we have used to move this bill, I \nwill take more time than usual to detail its provisions.\n  Victims. The heart of every American aches for those who died or have \nbeen injured because of the tragic terrorist attacks in New York, \nVirginia, and Pennsylvania on September 11th. Even now, we cannot \nassess the full measure of this attack in terms of human lives, but we \nknow that the number of casualties is extraordinarily high.\n  Congress acted swiftly to help the victims of September 11th. Within \n10 days, we passed legislation to establish a Victims Compensation \nProgram, which will provide fair compensation to those most affected by \nthis national tragedy. I am proud of our work on that legislation, \nwhich will expedite payments to thousands of Americans whose lives were \nso suddenly shattered.\n  But now more than ever, we should remember the tens of thousands of \nAmericans whose needs are not being met--the victims of crimes that \nhave not made the national headlines. Just one day before the events \nthat have so transformed our nation, I came before this body to express \nmy concern that we were not doing more for crime victims. I noted that \nthe pace of victims legislation has slowed, and that many opportunities \nfor progress had been squandered. I suggested that this year, we had a \ngolden opportunity to make significant progress in this area by passing \nS. 783, the Leahy-Kennedy Crime Victims Assistance Act of 2001.\n  I am pleased, therefore, that the antiterrorism package now before \nthe Senate contains substantial portions of S. 783 aimed at refining \nthe Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA), and improving the manner in \nwhich the Crime Victims Fund is managed and preserved. Most \nsignificantly, section 621\n\n[[Page S10549]]\n\nof the USA Act will eliminate the cap on VOCA spending, which has \nprevented more than $700 million in Fund deposits from reaching victims \nand supporting essential services.\n  Congress has capped spending from the Fund for the last two fiscal \nyear, and President Bush has proposed a third cap for fiscal year 2002. \nThese limits on VOCA spending have created a growing sense of confusion \nand unease by many of those concerned about the future of the Fund.\n  We should not be imposing artificial caps on VOCA spending while \nsubstantial unmet needs continue to exist. Section 621 of the USA Act \nreplaces the cap with a self-regulating system that will ensure \nstability and protection of Fund assets, while allowing more money to \nbe distributed to the States for victim compensation and assistance.\n  Other provisions included from S. 783 will also make an immediate \ndifference in the lives of victims, including victims of terrorism. \nShortly after the Oklahoma City bombing, I proposed and the Congress \nadopted the Victims of Terrorism Act of 1995. This legislation \nauthorized the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) to set aside an \nemergency reserve of up to $50 million as part of the Crime Victims \nFund. The emergency reserve was intended to serve as a ``rainy day'' \nfund to supplement compensation and assistance grants to States to \nprovide emergency relief in the wake of an act of terrorism or mass \nviolence that might otherwise overwhelm the resources of a State's \ncrime victim compensation program and crime victim assistance services. \nLast month's disaster created vast needs that have all but depleted the \nreserve. Section 621 of the USA Act authorizes OVC to replenish the \nreserve with up to $50 million, and streamlines the mechanism for \nreplenishment in future years.\n  Another critical provision of the USA Act will enable OVC to provide \nmore immediate and effective assistance to victims of terrorism and \nmass violence occurring within the United States. I proposed this \nmeasure last year as an amendment to the Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act, but was compelled to drop it to achieve bipartisan \nconsensus. I am pleased that we are finally getting it done this year.\n  These and other VOCA reforms in the USA Act are long overdue. Yet, I \nregret that we are not doing more. In my view, we should pass the Crime \nVictims Assistance Act in its entirety. In addition to the provisions \nthat are included in today's antiterrorism package, this legislation \nprovides for comprehensive reform of Federal law to establish enhanced \nrights and protections for victims of Federal crime. It also proposes \nseveral programs to help States provide better assistance for victims \nof State crimes.\n  I also regret that we have not done more for other victims of recent \nterrorist attacks. While all Americans are numbed by the heinous acts \nof September 11th, we should not forget the victims of the 1998 embassy \nbombings in East Africa. Eleven Americans and many Kenyan and Tanzanian \nnationals employed by the United States lost their lives in that tragic \nincident. It is my understanding that compensation to the families of \nthese victims has in many instances fallen short. It is my hope that \nOVC will use a portion of the newly replenished reserve fund to remedy \nany inequity in the way that these individuals have been treated.\n  Hate crimes. We cannot speak of the victims of the September 11 \nwithout also noting that Arab-Americans and Muslims in this country \nhave become the targets of hate crimes, harassment, and intimidation. I \napplaud the President for speaking out against and condemning such \nacts, and visiting a mosque to demonstrate by action that all religions \nare embraced in this country. I also commend the FBI Director for his \nperiodic reports on the number of hate crime incidents against Arab-\nAmerican and Muslims that the FBI is aggressively investigating and \nmaking clear that this conduct is taken seriously and will be punished.\n  The USA Act contains, in section 102, a sense of the Congress that \ncrimes and discrimination against Arab and Muslim Americans are \ncondemned. Many of us would like to do more, and finally enact \neffective hate crimes legislation, but the Administration has asked \nthat the debate on that legislation be postponed. One of my greatest \nregrets regarding the negotiations in this bill was the objections that \nprevented the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, S. 625, from being \nincluded in the USA Act.\n  State and local law enforcement. The Administration's initial \nproposal was entirely focused on Federal law enforcement. Yet, we must \nremember that state and local law enforcement officers have critical \nroles to play in preventing and investigating terrorist acts. I am \npleased that the USA Act we consider today recognizes this fact.\n  As a former State prosecutor, I know that State and local law \nenforcement officers are often the first responders to a crime. On \nSeptember 11th, the nation saw that the first on the scene were the \nheroic firefighters, police officers and emergency personnel in New \nYork City. These New York public safety officers, many of whom gave the \nultimate sacrifice, remind us of how important it is to support our \nState and local law enforcement partners. The USA Act provides three \ncritical measures of Federal support for our State and local law \nenforcement officers in the war against terrorism.\n  First, we streamline and expedite the Public Safety Officers' \nBenefits application process for family members of fire fighters, \npolice officers and rescue workers who perish or suffer a disabling \ninjury in connection with prevention, investigation, rescue or recovery \nefforts related to a future terrorist attack.\n  The Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program provides benefits for \neach of the families of law enforcement officers, firefighters, and \nemergency response crew members who are killed or disabled in the line \nof duty. Current regulations, however, require the families of public \nsafety officers who have fallen in the line of duty to go through a \ncumbersome and time-consuming application process. In the face of our \nnational fight against terrorism, it is important that we provide a \nquick process to support the families of brave Americans who selflessly \ngive their lives so that others might live before, during and after a \nterrorist attack.\n  This provision builds on the new law championed by Senator Clinton, \nSenator Schumer and Congressman Nadler to speed the benefit payment \nprocess for families of public safety officers killed in the line of \nduty in New York City, Virginia, and Western Pennsylvania, on September \n11.\n  Second, we have raised the total amount of Public Safety Officers' \nBenefit Program payments from approximately $150,000 to $250,000. This \nprovision retroactively goes into effort to provide much-needed relief \nfor the families of the brave men and women who sacrificed their own \nlives for their fellow Americans during the year. Although this \nincrease in benefits can never replace a family's tragic loss, it is \nthe right thing to do for the families of our fallen heroes. I want to \nthank Senator Biden and Senator Hatch for their bipartisan leadership \non this provision.\n  Third, we expand the Department of Justice Regional Information \nSharing Systems Program to promote information sharing among Federal, \nState and local law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute \nterrorist conspiracies and activities and authorize a doubling of \nfunding for this year and next year. The RISS Secure Intranet is a \nnationwide law enforcement network that already allows secure \ncommunications among the more than 5,700 Federal, State and local law \nenforcement agencies. Effective communication is key to effective law \nenforcement efforts and will be essential in our national fight against \nterrorism.\n  The RISS program enables its member agencies to send secure, \nencrypted communications--whether within just one agency or from one \nagency to another. Federal agencies, such as the FBI, do not have this \ncapability, but recognize the need for it. Indeed, on September 11, \n2001, immediately after the terrorist attacks, FBI Headquarters called \nRISS officials to request ``Smartgate'' cards and readers to secure \ntheir communications systems. The FBI agency in Philadelphia called \nsoon after to request more Smartgate cards and readers as well.\n  The Regional Information sharing Systems Program is a proven success \nthat we need to expand to improve secure information sharing among \nFederal, State and local law enforcement\n\n[[Page S10550]]\n\nagencies to coordinate their counter-terrorism efforts.\n  Our State and local law enforcement partners welcome the challenge to \njoin in our national mission to combat terrorism. We cannot ask State \nand local law enforcement officers to assume these new national \nresponsibilities without also providing new Federal support. The USA \nAct provides the necessary Federal support for our State and local law \nenforcement officers to serve as full partners in our fight against \nterrorism.\n  I am deeply troubled by continuing reports that information is not \nbeing shared with state local law enforcement. In particular, the \ntestimony of Baltimore Police Chief Ed Norris before the House \nGovernment Reform Committee last week highlighted the current problem.\n  Northern borders. The unfolding facts about how the terrorists who \ncommitted the September 11 attack were able to enter this country \nwithout difficulty are chilling. Since the attacks many have pointed to \nour northern border as vulnerable to the entry of future terrorists. \nThis is not surprising when a simple review of the numbers shows that \nthe northern border has been routinely short-changed in personnel. \nWhile the number of border patrol agents along the southern border has \nincreased over the last few years to over 8,000, the number at the \nnorthern border has remained the same as a decade ago at 300. This \nremains true despite the fact that Admad Ressam, the Algerian who \nplanned to blow up the Los Angeles International Airport in 1999, and \nwho has been linked to those involved in the September 11 attacks, \nchose to enter the United States at our northern border. It will remain \nan inviting target until we dramatically improve our security.\n  The USA Act includes my proposals to provide the substantial and long \noverdue assistance for our law enforcement and border control efforts \nalong the Northern Border. My home state of Vermont has seen huge \nincreases in customs and INS activity since the signing of NAFTA. The \nnumber of people coming through our borders has risen steeply over the \nyears, but our staff and our resources have not.\n  I proposed--and this legislation authorizes in section 402--tripling \nthe number of Border Patrol, INS inspectors, and customs Service \nemployees in each of the States along the 4,000-mile Northern Border. I \nwas gratified when 22 Senators--Democrats and Republicans--wrote to the \nPresident supporting such an increase, and I am pleased that the \nAdministration agreed that this critical law enforcement improvement \nshould be included in the bill. Senators Cantwell and Schumer in the \nCommittee and Senators Murray and Dorgan have been especially strong \nadvocates of these provisions and I thank them for their leadership. In \naddition, the USA Act, in section 401, authorizes the Attorney General \nto waive the FTE cap on INS personnel in order to address the national \nsecurity needs of the United States on the northern border. Now more \nthan ever, we must patrol our border vigilantly and prevent those who \nwish America harm from gaining entry. At the same time, we must work \nwith the Canadians to allow speedy crossing to legitimate visitors and \nfoster the continued growth of trade which is beneficial to both \ncountries.\n  In addition to providing for more personnel, this bill also includes, \nin section 402(4), my proposal to provide $100 million in funding for \nboth the INS and the Customs Service to improve the technology used to \nmonitor the Northern Border and to purchase additional equipment. The \nbill also includes, in section 403(c), an important provisions from \nSenator Cantwell directing the Attorney General, in consultation with \nother agencies, to develop a technical standard for identifying \nelectronically the identity of persons applying for visas or seeking to \nenter the United States. In short, this bill provides a comprehensive \nhigh-tech boost for the security of our nation.\n\n  This bill also includes important proposals to enhance data sharing. \nThe bill, in section 403, directs the Attorney General and the FBI \nDirector to give the State Department and INS access to the criminal \nhistory information in the FBI's National Crime Information Center \n(NCIC) database, as the Administration and I both proposed. The \nAttorney General is directed to report back to the Congress in two \nyears on progress in implementing this requirement. We have also \nadopted the Administration's language, in section 413, to make it \neasier for the State Department to share information with foreign \ngovernments for aid in terrorist investigations.\n  Criminal justice improvements. The USA Act contains a number of \nprovisions intended to improve and update the federal criminal code to \naddress better the nature of terrorist activity, assist the FBI in \ntranslating foreign language information collected, and ensure that \nfederal prosecutors are unhindered by conflicting local rules of \nconduct to get the job done. I will mention just a few of these \nprovisions.\n  FBI translators. The truth certainly seems self-evident that all the \nbest surveillance techniques in the world will not help this country \ndefend itself from terrorist attack if the information cannot be \nunderstood in a timely fashion. Indeed, within days of the September \n11, the FBI Director issued an employment ad on national TV by calling \nupon those who speak Arabic to apply for a job as an FBI translator. \nThis is a dire situation that needs attention. I am therefore gratified \nthat the Administration accepted by proposal, in section 205, to waive \nany federal personnel requirements and limitations imposed by any other \nlaw in order to expedite the hiring of translators at the FBI.\n  This bill also directs the FBI Director to establish such security \nrequirements as are necessary for the personnel employed as \ntranslators. We know the effort to recruit translators has a high \npriority, and the Congress should provide all possible support. \nTherefore, the bill calls on the Attorney General to report to the \nJudiciary Committees on the number of translators employed by the \nJustice Department, any legal or practical impediments to using \ntranslators employed by other Federal, State, or local agencies, on a \nfull, part-time, or shared basis; and the needs of the FBI for specific \ntranslation services in certain languages, and recommendations for \nmeeting those needs.\n  Federal crime of terrorism. The Administration's initial proposal \nassembled a laundry list of more than 40 Federal crimes ranging from \ncomputer hacking to malicious mischief to the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and designated them as ``Federal terrorism offenses,'' \nregardless of the circumstances under which they were committed. For \nexample, a teenager who spammed the NASA website and, as a result, \nrecklessly caused damage, would be deemed to have committed this new \n``terrorism'' offense. Under the Administration's proposal, the \nconsequences of this designation were severe. Crimes on the list would \ncarry no statute of limitations. The maximum penalties would shoot up \nto life imprisonment, and those released earlier would be subject to a \nlifetime of supervised release. Moreover, anyone who harbored a person \nwhom he had ``reasonable grounds to suspect'' had committed, or was \nabout to commit, a ``Federal terrorism offense''--whether it was the \nTaliban or the mother of my hypothetical teenage computer hacker--would \nbe subject to stiff criminal penalties. I worked closely with the \nAdministration to ensure that the definition of ``terrorism'' in the \nUSA Act fit the crime.\n  First, we have trimmed the list of crimes that may be considered as \nterrorism predicates in section 808 of the bill. This shorter, more \nfocused list, to be codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332(g)(5)(B), more \nclosely reflects the sorts of offenses committed by terrorists.\n  Second, we have provided, in section 810, that the current 8-year \nlimitations period for this new set of offenses will remain in place, \nexcept where the commission of the offense resulted in, or created a \nrisk of, death or serious bodily injury.\n  Third, rather than make an across-the-board, one-size-fits-all \nincrease of the penalties for every offense on the list, without regard \nto the severity of the offense, we have made, in section 811, more \nmeasured increases in maximum penalties where appropriate, including \nlife imprisonment or lifetime supervised release in cases in which the \noffense resulted in death. We have also added, in section 812, \nconspiracy provisions to a few criminal statutes where appropriate, \nwith penalties equal to the penalties for the object offense, up to \nlife imprisonment.\n\n[[Page S10551]]\n\n  Finally, we have more carefully defined the new crime of harboring \nterrorists in section 804, so that it applies only to those harboring \npeople who have committed, or are about to commit, the most serious of \nfederal terrorism-related crimes, such as the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Moreover, it is not enough that the defendant had \n``reasonable grounds to suspect'' that the person he was harboring had \ncommitted, or was about to commit, such a crime; the government must \nprove that the defendant knew or had ``reasonable grounds to believe'' \nthat this was so.\n  McDade fix. The massive investigation underway into who was \nresponsible for and assisted in carrying out the September 11 attacks \nstretches across state and national boundaries. While the scope of the \ntragedy is unsurpassed, the disregard for state and national borders of \nthis criminal conspiracy is not unusual. Federal investigative officers \nand prosecutors often must follow leads and conduct investigations \noutside their assigned jurisdictions. At the end of the 105th Congress, \na legal impediment to such multi-jurisdiction investigations was \nslipped into the omnibus appropriations bill, over the objection at the \ntime of every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I have spoken many times over the past two years of the problems \ncaused by the so-called McDade law, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 530B. According to \nthe Justice Department, the McDade law has delayed important criminal \ninvestigations, prevented the use of effective and traditionally-\naccepted investigative techniques, and served as the basis of \nlitigation to interfere with legitimate federal prosecutions. At a time \nwhen we need federal law enforcement authorities to move quickly to \ncatch those responsible for the September 11th attacks, and to prevent \nfurther attacks on our country, we can no longer tolerate the drag on \nfederal investigations and prosecutions caused by this ill-considered \nlegislation.\n  On September 19th, I introduced S. 1437, the Professional Standards \nfor Government Attorneys Act of 2001, along with Senators Hatch and \nWyden. This bill proposes to modify the McDade law by establishing a \nset of rules that clarify the professional standards applicable to \ngovernment attorneys. I am delighted that the Administration recognized \nthe importance of S. 1437 for improving federal law enforcement and \ncombating terrorism, and agreed to its inclusion as section 501 of the \nUSA Act.\n  The first part of section 501 embodies the traditional understanding \nthat when lawyers handle cases before a Federal court, they should be \nsubject to the Federal court's standards of professional \nresponsibility, and not to the possibly inconsistent standards of other \njurisdictions. By incorporating this ordinary choice-of-law principle, \nthe bill preserves the Federal courts' traditional authority to oversee \nthe professional conduct of Federal trial lawyers, including Federal \nprosecutors. It thus avoids the uncertainties presented by the McDade \nlaw, which potentially subjects Federal prosecutors to State laws, \nrules of criminal procedure, and judicial decisions which differ from \nexisting Federal law.\n  Another part of section 501 specifically addresses the situation in \nOregon, where a state court ruling has seriously impeded the ability of \nFederal agents to engage in undercover operations and other covert \nactivities. See In re Gatti, 330 Or. 517 (2000). Such activities are \nlegitimate and essential crime-fighting tools. The Professional \nStandards for Government Attorneys Act ensures that these tools will be \navailable to combat terrorism.\n  Finally, section 501 addresses the most pressing contemporary \nquestion of government attorney ethics--namely, the question of which \nrule should govern government attorneys' communications with \nrepresented persons. It asks the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates to submit to the Supreme Court a proposed uniform national rule \nto govern this area of professional conduct, and to study the need for \nadditional national rules to govern other areas in which the \nproliferation of local rules may interfere with effective Federal law \nenforcement. The Rules Enabling Act process is the ideal one for \ndeveloping such rules, both because the Federal judiciary traditionally \nis responsible for overseeing the conduct of lawyers in Federal court \nproceedings, and because this process would best provide the Supreme \nCourt an opportunity fully to consider and objectively to weigh all \nrelevant considerations.\n  The problems posed to Federal law enforcement investigations and \nprosecutions by the McDade law are real and urgent. The Professional \nStandards for Government Attorneys Act provides a reasonable and \nmeasured alternative: It preserves the traditional role of the State \ncourts in regulating the conduct of attorneys licensed to practice \nbefore them, while ensuring that Federal prosecutors and law \nenforcement agents will be able to use traditional Federal \ninvestigative techniques. We need to pass this corrective legislation \nbefore more cases are compromised.\n\n  Terrorist attacks against mass transportation systems. Another \nprovision of the USA Act that was not included in the Administration's \ninitial proposal is section 801, which targets acts of terrorism and \nother violence against mass transportation systems. Just last week, a \nGreyhound bus crashed in Tennessee after a deranged passenger slit the \ndriver's throat and then grabbed the steering wheel, force the bus into \nthe oncoming traffic. Six people were killed in the crash. Because \nthere are currently no federal law addressing terrorism of mass \ntransportation systems, however, there may be no federal jurisdiction \nover such as case, even if it were committed by suspected terrorists. \nClearly, there is an urgent need for strong criminal legislation to \ndeter attacks against mass transportation systems. Section 801 will \nfill this gap.\n  Cybercrime. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030, is \nthe primary federal criminal statue prohibiting computer frauds and \nhacking. I worked with Senator Hatch in the last Congress to make \nimprovements to this law in the Internet Security Act, which passed the \nSenate as part of another bill. Our work is included in section 815 of \nthe USA Act. This section would amend the statute to clarify the \nappropriate scope of federal jurisdiction. First, the bill adds a \ndefinition of ``loss'' to cover any reasonable cost to the victim in \nresponding to a computer hacker. Calculation of loss is important both \nin determining whether the $5,000 jurisdictional hurdle in the statute \nis met, and, at sentencing, in calculating the appropriate guideline \nrange and restitution amount.\n  Second, the bill amends the definitions of ``protected computer'' to \ninclude qualified computers even when they are physically located \noutside of the United States. This clarification will preserve the \nability of the United States to assist in internal hacking cases.\n  Finally, this section eliminates the current directive to the \nSentencing Commission requiring that all violations, including \nmisdemeanor violations, of certain provisions of the Computer Fraud and \nAbuse Act be punished with a term of imprisonment of at least six \nmonths.\n  Biological weapons. Borrowing from a bill introduced in the last \nCongress By Senator Biden, the USA Act contains a provision in section \n802 to strengthen our federal laws relating to the threat of biological \nweapons. Current law prohibits the possession, development, or \nacquisition of biological agents or toxins ``for use as a weapon.'' \nThis section amends the definition of ``for use as a weapon'' to \ninclude all situations in which it can be proven that the defendant had \nany purpose other than a peaceful purpose. This will enhance the \ngovernment's ability to prosecute suspected terrorists in possession of \nbiological agents or toxins, and conform the scope of the criminal \noffense in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 175 more closely to the related forfeiture \nprovision in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 176. This section also contains a new \nstatute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 175b, which generally makes it an offense for \ncertain restricted persons, including non-resident aliens from \ncountries that support international terrorism, to possess a listed \nbiological agent or toxin.\n  Of greater consequence, section 802 defines another additional \noffense, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, of possessing a \nbiological agent, toxin, or delivery system ``of a type or in a\n\n[[Page S10552]]\n\nquantity that, under the circumstances,'' is not reasonably justified \nby a peaceful purpose. As originally proposed by the Administration, \nthis provision specifically stated that knowledge of whether the type \nor quantity of the agent or toxin was reasonably justified was not an \nelement of the offense. Thus, although the burden of proof is always on \nthe government, every person who possesses a biological agent, toxin, \nor delivery system was at some level of risk. I am pleased that the \nAdministration agreed to drop this portion of the provision.\n  Nevertheless, I remain troubled by the subjectivity of the \nsubstantive standard for violation of this new criminal prohibition, \nand question whether it provides sufficient notice under the \nConstitution. I also share the concerns of the American Society for \nMicrobiology and the Association of American Universities that this \nprovision will have a chilling effect upon legitimate scientific \ninquiry that offsets any benefit in protecting against terrorism. While \nwe have tried to prevent against this by creating an explicit exclusion \nfor ``bona fide research,'' this provision may yet prove unworkable, \nunconstitutional, or both. I urge the Justice Department and the \nresearch community to work together on substitute language that would \nprovide prosecutors with a more workable tool.\n  Secret Service jurisdiction. Two sections of the USA Act were added \nat the request of the United States Secret Service, with the support of \nthe Administration. I was pleased to accommodate the Secret Service by \nincluding these provisions in the bill to expand Electronic Crimes Task \nForce and to clarify the authority of the Secret Service to \ninvestigator computer crimes.\n  The Secret Service is committed to the development of new tools to \ncombat the growing areas of financial crime, computer fraud, and \ncyberterrorism. Recognizing a need for law enforcement, private \nindustry and academia to pool their resources, skills and revision to \ncombat criminal elements in cyberspace, the Secret Service created the \nNew York Electronic Crimes Task Force (NYECTF). This highly successful \nmodel is comprised of over 250 individual members, including 50 \ndifferent Federal, State and local enforcement agencies, 100 private \ncompanies, and 9 universities. Since its inception in 1995, the NYECTF \nhas successfully investigated a range of financial and electronic \ncrimes, including credit card fraud, identify theft, bank fraud, \ncomputer systems intrusions, and e-mail threats against protectees of \nthe Secret Service. Section 105 of the USA Act authorizes the Secret \nService to develop similar task forces in cities and regions across the \ncountry where critical infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks from \nterrorists or other cyber-criminals.\n  Section 507 of the USA Act gives the Secret Service concurrent \njurisdiction to investigate offenses under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030. \nrelating to fraud and related activity in connection with computers. \nPrior to the 1996 amendments to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the \nSecret Service was authorized to investigate any an all violations of \nsection 1030, pursuant to an agreement between the Secretary of \nTreasury and the Attorney General. The 1996 amendments, however, \nconcentrated Secret Service jurisdiction on certain specified \nsubsections of section 1030. The current amendment would return full \njurisdiction to the Secret Service and would allow the Justice and \nTreasury Departments to decide on the appropriate work-sharing balance \nbetween the two. This will enable the Secret Service to investigate a \nwide range of potential White House network intrusions, as well as \nintrusions into remote sites (outside of the White House) that could \nimpact the safety and security of its protectees, and to continue its \nmission to protect the nation's critical infrastructure and financial \npayment systems.\n  Counter-terrorism Fund. The USA Act also authorizes, for the first \ntime, a counter-terrorism fund in the Treasury of the United States to \nreimburse Justice Department for any costs incurred in connection with \nthe fight against terrorism.\n  Specifically, this counter-terrorism fund will: (1) reestablish an \noffice or facility that has been damaged as the result of any domestic \nor international terrorism incident; (2) provide support to counter, \ninvestigate, or prosecute domestic or international terrorism, \nincluding paying rewards in connection with these activities; (3) \nconduct terrorism threat assessments of Federal agencies; and (4) for \ncosts incurred in connection with detaining individuals in foreign \ncountries who are accused of acts of terrorism in violation of United \nStates law.\n  I first authored this counter-terrorism fund in the S. 1319, the 21st \nCentury Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, which \nSenator Hatch and I introduced in August.\n  Enhanced surveillance procedures. The USA Act provides enhanced \nsurveillance procedures for the investigation of terrorism and other \ncrimes. The challenge before us has been to strike a reasonable balance \nto protect both security and the liberties of our people. In some \nrespects, the changes made are appropriate and important ones to update \nsurveillance and investigative procedures in light of new technology \nand experience with current law. Yet, in other respects, I have deep \nconcerns that we may be increasing surveillance powers and the sharing \nof criminal justice information without adequate checks on how \ninformation may be handled and without adequate accountability in the \nform of judicial review.\n  The bill contains a number of sensible proposals that should not be \ncontroversial.\n  Wiretap predicates. For example, sections 201 and 202 of the USA Act \nwould add to the list of crimes that may be used as predicates for \nwiretaps certain offenses which are specifically tailored to the \nterrorist threat. In addition to crimes that relate directly to \nterrorism, the list would include crimes of computer fraud and abuse \nwhich are committed by terrorists to support and advance their illegal \nobjectives.\n  FISA roving wiretraps. The bill, in section 206, would authorize the \nuse of roving wiretaps in the course of a foreign intelligence \ninvestigation and brings FISA into line with criminal procedures that \nallow surveillance to follow a person, rather than requiring a separate \ncourt order identifying each telephone company or other communication \ncommon carrier whose assistance is needed. This is a matter on which \nthe Attorney General and I reached early agreement. This is the kind of \nchange that has a compelling justification, because it recognizes the \nease with which targets of investigations can evade surveillance by \nchanging phones. In fact, the original roving wiretap authority for use \nin criminal investigations was enacted as part of the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act (ECPA) in 1986. I was proud to be the \nprimary Senate sponsor of that earlier law.\n\n  Paralleling the statutory rules applicable to criminal \ninvestigations, the formulation I originally proposed made clear that \nthis roving wiretap authority must be requested in the application \nbefore the FISA court was authorized to order such roving surveillance \nauthority. Indeed, the Administration agrees that the FISA court may \nnot grant such authority sua sponte. Nevertheless, we have accepted the \nAdministration's formulation of the new roving wiretap authority, which \nrequires the FISA court to make a finding that the actions of the \nperson whose communications are to be intercepted could have the effect \nof thwarting the identification of a specified facility or place. While \nno amendment is made to the statutory directions for what must be \nincluded in the application for a FISA electronic surveillance order, \nthese applications should include the necessary information to support \nthe FISA court's finding that roving wiretap authority is warranted.\n  Search warrants. The USA Act, in section 219, authorizes nationwide \nservice of search warrants in terrorism investigations. This will allow \nthe judge who is most familiar with the developments in a fast-breaking \nand complex terrorism investigation to make determinations of probable \ncause, no matter where the property to be searched is located. This \nwill not only save time by avoiding having to bring up-to-speed another \njudge in another jurisdiction where the property is located, but also \nserves privacy and Fourth Amendment interests in ensuring that the most \nknowledgeable judge makes the determination of probable cause. The \nbill, in section 209, also authorizes voice mail messages to be seized \non the authority\n\n[[Page S10553]]\n\nof a probable cause search warrant rather than through the more \nburdensome and time-consuming process of a wiretap.\n  Electronic records. The bill updates the laws pertaining to \nelectronic records in three primary ways. First, in section 210, the \nbill authorizes the nationwide service of subpoenas for subscriber \ninformation and expands the list of items subject to subpoena to \ninclude the means and source of payment for the service.\n  Second, in section 211, the bill equalizes the standard for law \nenforcement access to cable subscriber records on the same basis as \nother electronic records. The Cable Communications Policy Act, passed \nin 1984 to regulate various aspects of the cable television industry, \ndid not take into account the changes in technology that have occurred \nover the last fifteen years. Cable television companies now often \nprovide Internet access and telephone service in addition to television \nprogramming. This amendment clarifies that a cable company must comply \nwith the laws governing the interception and disclosure of wire and \nelectronic communications just like any other telephone company or \nInternet service provider. The amendments would retain current \nstandards that govern the release of customer records for television \nprogramming.\n  Finally, the bill, in section 212, permits, but does not require, an \nelectronic communications service to disclose the contents of and \nsubscriber information about communications in emergencies involving \nthe immediate danger of death or serious physical injury. Under current \nlaw, if an ISP's customer receives an e-mail death threat from another \ncustomer of the same ISP, and the victim provides a copy of the \ncommunication to the ISP, the ISP is limited in what actions it may \ntake. On one hand, the ISP may disclose the contents of the forwarded \ncommunication to law enforcement (or to any other third party as it \nsees fit). See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2702(b)(3). On the other hand, current \nlaw does not expressly authorize the ISP to voluntarily provide law \nenforcement with the identity, home address, and other subscriber \ninformation of the user making the threat. See 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 2703(c)(1)(B),(C) (permitting disclosure to government entities \nonly in response to legal process). In those cases where the risk of \ndeath or injury is imminent, the law should not require providers to \nsit idly by. This voluntary disclosure, however, in no way creates an \naffirmative obligation to review customer communications in search of \nsuch imminent dangers.\n  Also, under existing law, a provider (even one providing services to \nthe public) may disclose the contents of a customer's communications--\nto law enforcement or anyone else--in order to protect its rights or \nproperty. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2702(b)(5). However, the current statute \ndoes not expressly permit a provider voluntarily to disclose non-\ncontent records (such as a subscriber's login records) to law \nenforcement for purposes of self-protection. See 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 2703(c)(1)(B). Yet the right to disclose the content of \ncommunications necessarily implies the less intrusive ability to \ndisclose non-content records. Cf. United States v. Auler, 539 F.2d 642, \n646 n.9 (7th Cir. 1976) (phone company's authority to monitor and \ndisclose conversations to protect against fraud necessarily implies \nright to commit lesser invasion of using, and disclosing fruits of, pen \nregister device) (citing United States v. Freeman, 524 F.2d 337, 341 \n(7th Cir. 1975)). Moreover, as a practical matter providers must have \nthe right to disclose the facts surrounding attacks on their systems. \nWhen a telephone carrier is defrauded by a subscriber, or when an ISP's \nauthorized user launches a network intrusion against his own ISP, the \nprovider must have the legal ability to report the complete details of \nthe crime to law enforcement. The bill clarifies that service providers \nhave the statutory authority to make such disclosures.\n  Pen registers. There is consensus that the existing legal procedures \nfor pen register and trap-and-trace authority are antiquated and need \nto be updated. I have been proposing ways to update the pen register \nand trap and trace statutes for several years, but not necessarily in \nthe same ways as the Administration initially proposed. In fact, in \n1998, I introduced with then-Senator Ashcroft, the E-PRIVACY Act, S. \n2067, which proposed changes in the pen register laws. In 1999, I \nintroduced the E-RIGHTS Act, S. 934, also with proposals to update the \npen register laws.\n  Again, in the last Congress, I introduced the Internet Security Act, \nS. 2430, on April 13, 2000, that proposed (1) changing the pen register \nand trap and trace device law to give nationwide effect to pen register \nand trap and trace orders obtained by Government attorneys and obviate \nthe need to obtain identical orders in multiple federal jurisdictions; \n(2) clarifying that such devices can be used for computer transmissions \nto obtain electronic addresses, not just on telephone lines; and (3) as \na guard against abuse, providing for meaningful judicial review of \ngovernment attorney applications for pen registers and trap and trace \ndevices.\n  As the outline of my earlier legislation suggests, I have long \nsupported modernizing the pen register and trap and trace device laws \nby modifying the statutory language to cover the use of these orders on \ncomputer transmissions; to remove the jurisdictional limits on service \nof these orders; and to update the judicial review procedure, which, \nunlike any other area in criminal procedure, bars the exercise of \njudicial discretion in reviewing the justification for the order. The \nUSA Act, in section 216, updates the pen register and trap and trace \nlaws only in two out of three respects I believe are important, and \nwithout allowing meaningful judicial review. Yet, we were able to \nimprove the Administration's initial proposal, which suffered from the \nsame problem as the provision that was hastily taken up and passed by \nthe Senate, by voice vote, on September, 13, 2001, as an amendment to \nthe Commerce Justice State Appropriations Act.\n  Nationwide service. The existing legal procedures for pen register \nand trap-and-trace authority require service of individual orders for \ninstallation of pen register or trap and trace device on the service \nproviders that carried the targeted communications. Deregulation of the \ntelecommunications industry has had the consequence that one \ncommunication may be carried by multiple providers. For example, a \ntelephone call may be carried by a competitive local exchange carrier, \nwhich passes it at a switch to a local Bell Operating Company, which \npasses it to a long distance carrier, which hands it to an incumbent \nlocal exchange carrier elsewhere in the U.S., which in turn may finally \nhand it to a cellular carrier. If these carriers do not pass source \ninformation with each call, identifying that source may require \ncompelling information from a host of providers located throughout the \ncountry.\n  Under present law, a court may only authorize the installation of a \npen register or trap device ``within the jurisdiction of the court.'' \nAs a result, when one provider indicates that the source of a \ncommunication is a carrier in another district, a second order may be \nnecessary. The Department of Justice has advised, for example, that in \n1996, a hacker (who later turned out to be launching his attacks from a \nforeign country) extensively penetrated computers belonging to the \nDepartment of Defense. This hacker was dialing into a computer at \nHarvard University and used this computer as an intermediate staging \npoint in an effort to conceal his location and identity. Investigators \nobtained a trap and trace order instructing the phone company, Nynex, \nto trace these calls, but Nynex could only report that the \ncommunications were coming to it from a long-distance carrier, MCI. \nInvestigators then applied for a court order to obtain the connection \ninformation from MCI, but since the hacker was no longer actually using \nthe connection, MCI could not identify its source. Only if the \ninvestigators could have served MCI with a trap and trace order while \nthe hacker was actively on-line could they have successfully traced \nback and located him.\n  In another example provided by the Department of Justice, \ninvestigators encountered similar difficulties in attempting to track \nKevin Mitnick, a criminal who continued to hack into computers attached \nto the Internet despite the fact that he was on supervised release for \na prior computer crime conviction. The FBI attempted to trace\n\n[[Page S10554]]\n\nthese electronic communications while they were in progress. In order \nto evade arrest, however, Mitnick moved around the country and used \ncloned cellular phones and other evasive techniques. His hacking \nattacks would often pass through one of two cellular carriers, a local \nphone company, and then two Internet service providers. In this \nsituation, where investigators and service providers had to act quickly \nto trace Mitnick in the act of hacking, only many repeated attempts--\naccompanied by an order to each service provider--finally produced \nsuccess. Fortunately, Mitnick was such a persistent hacker that he gave \nlaw enforcement many chances to complete the trace.\n  This duplicative process of obtaining a separate order for each link \nin the communications chain can be quite time-consuming, and it serves \nno useful purpose since the original court has already authorized the \ntrace. Moreover, a second or third order addressed to a particular \ncarrier that carried part of a prior communication may prove useless \nduring the next attack: in computer intrusion cases, for example, the \ntarget may use an entirely different path (i.e., utilize a different \nset of intermediate providers) for his or her subsequent activity.\n  The bill would modify the pen register and trap and trace statutes to \nallow for nationwide service of a single order for installation of \nthese devices, without the necessity of returning to court for each new \ncarrier. I support this change.\n  Second, the language of the existing statute is hopelessly out of \ndate and speaks of a pen register or trap and trace ``device'' being \n``attached'' to a telephone ``line.'' However, the rapid \ncomputerization of the telephone system has changed the tracing \nprocess. No longer are such functions normally accomplished by physical \nhardware components attached to telephone lines. Instead, these \nfunctions are typically performed by computerized collection and \nretention of call routing information passing through a communications \nsystem.\n  The statute's definition of a ``pen register'' as a ``device'' that \nis ``attached'' to a particular ``telephone line'' is particularly \nobsolete when applied to the wireless portion of a cellular phone call, \nwhich has no line to which anything can be attached. While courts have \nauthorized pen register orders for wireless phones based on the notion \nof obtaining access to a ``virtual line,'' updating the law to keep \npace with current technology is a better course.\n  Moreover, the statute is ill-equipped to facilitate the tracing of \ncommunications that take place over the Internet. For example, the pen \nregister definition refers to telephone ``numbers'' rather than the \nbroader concept of a user's communications account. Although pen \nregister and trap orders have been obtained for activity on computer \nnetworks, Internet service providers have challenged the application of \nthe statute to electronic communications, frustrating legitimate \ninvestigations. I have long supported updating the statute by removing \nwords such as ``numbers . . . dialed'' that do not apply to the way \nthat pen/trap devices are used and to clarify the statute's proper \napplication to tracing communications in an electronic environment, but \nin a manner that is technology neutral and does not capture the content \nof communications. That being said, I have been concerned about the FBI \nand Justice Department's insistence over the past few years that the \npen/trap devices statutes be updated with broad, undefined terms that \ncontinue to flame concerns that these laws will be used to intercept \nprivate communications content.\n  The Administration's initial pen/trap device proposal added the terms \n``routing'' and ``addressing'' to the definitions describing the \ninformation that was authorized for interception on the low relevance \nstandard under these laws. The Administration and the Department of \nJustice flatly rejected my suggestion that these terms be defined to \nrespond to concerns that the new terms might encompass matter \nconsidered content, which may be captured only upon a showing of \nprobable cause, not the mere relevancy of the pen/trap statute. \nInstead, the Administration agreed that the definition should expressly \nexclude the use of pen/trap devices to intercept ``content,'' which is \nbroadly defined in 18 U.S.C. 2510(8).\n  While this is an improvement, the FBI and Justice Department are \nshort-sighted in their refusal to define these terms. We should be \nclear about the consequence of not providing definitions for these new \nterms in the pen/trap device statutes. These terms will be defined, if \nnot by the Congress, then by the courts in the context of criminal \ncases where pen/trap devices have been used and challenged by \ndefendants. If a court determines that a pen register has captured \n``content,'' which the FBI admits such devices do, in violation of the \nFourth Amendment, suppression may be ordered, not only of the pen \nregister evidence but any other evidence derived from it. We are \nleaving the courts with little or no guidance of what is covered by \n``addressing'' or ``routing.''\n  The USA Act also requires the government to use reasonably available \ntechnology that limits the interceptions under the pen/trap device laws \n``so as not to include the contents of any wire or electronic \ncommunications.'' This limitation on the technology used by the \ngovernment to execute pen/trap orders is important since, as the FBI \nadvised me June, 2000, pen register devices ``do capture all electronic \nimpulses transmitted by the facility on which they are attached, \nincluding such impulses transmitted after a phone call is connected to \nthe called party.'' The impulses made after the call is connected could \nreflect the electronic banking transactions a caller makes, or the \nelectronic ordering from a catalogue that a customer makes over the \ntelephone, or the electronic ordering of a prescription drug.\n  This transactional data intercepted after the call is connected is \n``content.'' As the Justice Department explained in May, 1998 in a \nletter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, ``the \nretrieval of the electronic impulses that a caller necessarily \ngenerated in attempting to direct the phone call'' does not constitute \na ``search'' requiring probable cause since ``no part of the \nsubstantive information transmitted after the caller had reached the \ncalled party'' is obtained. But the Justice Department made clear that \n``all of the information transmitted after a phone call is connected to \nthe called party . . . is substantive in nature. These electronic \nimpulses are the `contents' of the call: They are not used to direct or \nprocess the call, but instead convey certain messages to the \nrecipient.''\n  When I added the direction on use of reasonably available technology \n(codified as 18 U.S.C. 3121(c)) to the pen register statute as part of \nthe Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) in 1994, \nI recognized that these devices collected content and that such \ncollection was unconstitutional on the mere relevance standard. \nNevertheless, the FBI advised me in June, 2000, that pen register \ndevices for telephone services ``continue to operate as they have for \ndecades'' and that ``there had been no change . . . that would better \nrestrict the recording or decoding of electronic or other impulses to \nthe dialing and signaling information utilized in call processing.'' \nPerhaps, if there were meaningful judicial review and accountability, \nthe FBI would take the statutory direction more seriously and actually \nimplement it.\n  Judicial review. Due in significant part to the fact that pen/trap \ndevices in use today collect ``content,'' I have sought in legislation \nintroduced over the past few years to update and modify the judicial \nreview procedure for pen register and trap and trace devices. Existing \nlaw requires an attorney for the government to certify that the \ninformation likely to be obtained by the installation of a pen register \nor trap and trace device will be relevant to an ongoing criminal \ninvestigation. The court is required to issue an order upon seeing the \nprosecutor's certification. The court is not authorized to look behind \nthe certification to evaluate the judgment of the prosecutor.\n  I have urged that government attorneys be required to include facts \nabout their investigations in their applications for pen/trap orders \nand allow courts to grant such orders only where the facts support the \nrelevancy of the information likely to be obtained by the orders. This \nis not a change in the applicable standard, which would remain the very \nlow relevancy standard.\n\n[[Page S10555]]\n\nInstead, this change would simply allow the court to evaluate the facts \npresented by a prosecutor, and, if it finds that the facts support the \ngovernment's assertion that the information to be collected will be \nrelevant, issue the order. Although this change will place an \nadditional burden on law enforcement, it will allow the courts a \ngreater ability to assure that government attorneys are using such \norders properly.\n  Some have called this change a ``roll-back'' in the statute, as if \nthe concept of allowing meaningful judicial review was an extreme \nposition. To the contrary, this is a change that the Clinton \nAdministration supported in legislation transmitted to the Congress \nlast year. This is a change that the House Judiciary Committee also \nsupported last year. In the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, H.R. \n5018, that Committee proposed that before a pen/trap device ``could be \nordered installed, the government must first demonstrate to an \nindependent judge that `specific and articulable facts reasonably \nindicate that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed, and \ninformation likely to be obtained by such installation and use . . . is \nrelevant to an investigation of that crime.'' (Report 106-932, 106th \nCong. 2d Sess., Oct. 4, 2000, p. 13). Unfortunately, the Bush \nAdministration has taken a contrary position and has rejected this \nchange in the judicial review process.\n  Computer trespasser. Currently, an owner or operator of a computer \nthat is accessed by a hacker as a means for the hacker to reach a third \ncomputer, cannot simply consent to law enforcement monitoring of the \ncomputer. Instead, because the owner or operator is not technically a \nparty to the communication, law enforcement needs wiretap authorization \nunder Title III to conduct such monitoring. I have long been interested \nin closing this loophole. Indeed, when I asked about this problem, the \nFBI explained to me in June, 2000, that:\n\n       This anomaly in the law creates an untenable situation \n     whereby providers are sometimes forced to sit idly by as they \n     witness hackers enter and, in some situations, destroy or \n     damage their systems and networks while law enforcement \n     begins the detailed process of seeking court authorization to \n     assist them. In the real world, the situation is akin to a \n     homeowner being forced to helplessly watch a burglar or \n     vandal while police seek a search warrant to enter the \n     dwelling.\n\n  I therefore introduced as part of the Internet Security Act, S. 2430, \nin 2000, an exception to the wiretap statute that would explicitly \npermit such monitoring without a wiretap if prior consent is obtained \nfrom the person whose computer is being hacked through and used to send \n``harmful interference to a lawfully operating computer system.''\n  The Administration initially proposed a different formulation of the \nexception that would have allowed an owner/operator of any computer \nconnected to the Internet to consent to FBI wiretapping of any user who \nviolated a workplace computer use policy or online service term of \nservice and was thereby an ``unauthorized'' user. The Administration's \nproposal was not limited to computer hacking offenses under 18 U.S.C. \n1030 or to conduct that caused harm to a computer or computer system. \nThe Administration rejected these refinements to their proposed wiretap \nexception, but did agree, in section 217 of the USA Act, to limit the \nauthority for wiretapping with the consent of the owner/operator to \ncommunications of unauthorized users without an existing subscriber or \nother contractual relationship with the owner/operator.\n  Sharing criminal justice information. The USA Act will make \nsignificant changes in the sharing of confidential criminal justice \ninformation with various Federal agencies. For those of us who have \nbeen concerned about the leaks from the FBI that can irreparably damage \nreputations of innocent people and frustrate investigations by alerting \nsuspects to flee or destroy material evidence, the Administration's \ninsistence on the broadest authority to disseminate such information, \nwithout any judicial check, is disturbing. Nonetheless, I believe we \nhave improved the Administration's initial proposal in responsible \nways. Only time will tell whether the improvements we were able to \nreach agreement on are sufficient.\n  At the outset, we should be clear that current law allows the sharing \nof confidential criminal justice information, but with close court \nsupervision. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) provides that \nmatters occurring before a grand jury may be disclosed only to an \nattorney for the government, such other government personnel as are \nnecessary to assist the attorney and another grand jury. Further \ndisclosure is also allowed as specifically authorized by a court.\n  Similarly, section 2517 of title 18, United States Code provides that \nwiretap evidence may be disclosed in testimony during official \nproceedings and to investigative or law enforcement officers to the \nextent appropriate to the proper performance of their official duties. \nIn addition, the wiretap law allows disclosure of wiretap evidence \n``relating to offenses other than specified in the order'' when \nauthorized or approved by a judge. Indeed, just last year, the Justice \nDepartment assured us that ``law enforcement agencies have authority \nunder current law to share title III information regarding terrorism \nwith intelligence agencies when the information is of overriding \nimportance to the national security.'' (Letter from Robert Raben, \nAssistant Attorney General, September 28, 2000).\n  For this reason, and others, the Justice Department at the time \nopposed an amendment proposed by Senators Kyl and Feinstein to S. 2507, \nthe ``Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 2001 that would have \nallowed the sharing of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence \ninformation collected from wiretaps with the intelligence community. I \ndeferred to the Justice Department on this issue and sought changes in \nthe proposed amendment to address the Department's concern that this \nprovision was not only unnecessary but also ``could have significant \nimplications for prosecutions and the discovery process in \nlitigation'', ``raises significant issues regarding the sharing with \nintelligence agencies of information collected about United States \npersons'' and jeopardized ``the need to protect equities relating to \nongoing criminal investigations.'' In the end, the amendment was \nrevised to address the Justice Department's concerns and passed the \nSenate as a free-standing bill, S. 3205, the Counterterrorism Act of \n2000. The House took no action on this legislation.\n  Disclosure of wiretap information. The Administration initially \nproposed adding a sweeping provision to the wiretap statute that \nbroadened the definition of an ``investigative or law enforcement \nofficer'' who may receive disclosures of information obtained through \nwiretaps to include federal law enforcement, intelligence, national \nsecurity, national defense, protective and immigration personnel and \nthe President and Vice President. This proposal troubled me because \ninformation intercepted by a wiretap has enormous potential to infringe \nupon the privacy rights of innocent people, including people who are \nnot even suspected of a crime and merely happen to speak on the \ntelephone with the targets of an investigation. For this reason, the \nauthority to disclose information obtained through a wiretap has always \nbeen carefully circumscribed in law.\n  While I recognize that appropriate officials in the executive branch \nof government should have access to wiretap information that is \nimportant to combating terrorism or protecting the national security, I \nproposed allowing such disclosures where specifically authorized by a \ncourt order. Further, with respect to information relating to \nterrorism, I proposed allowing the disclosure without a court order as \nlong as the judge who authorized the wiretap was notified as soon as \npracticable after the fact. This would have provided a check against \nabuses of the disclosure authority by providing for review by a neutral \njudicial official. At the same time, there was a little likelihood that \na judge would deny any requests for disclosure in cases where it was \nwarranted.\n  On Sunday, September 30, the Administration agreed to my proposal, \nbut within two days, it backed away from its agreement. I remain \nconcerned that the resulting provision will allow the unprecedented, \nwidespread disclosure of this highly sensitive information without any \nnotification to or review by the court that authorizes and supervises \nthe wiretap. This is clearly an area where our Committee will have to \nexercise close oversight to\n\n[[Page S10556]]\n\nmake sure that the newly-minted disclosure authority is not being \nabused.\n  The Administration offered three reasons for reneging on the original \ndeal. First, they claimed that the involvement of the court would \ninhibit Federal investigators and attorneys from disclosing information \nneeded by intelligence and national security officials. Second, they \nsaid the courts might not have adequate security and therefore should \nnot be told that information was disclosed for intelligence or national \nsecurity purposes. And third, they said the President's constitutional \npowers under Article II give him authority to get whatever foreign \nintelligence he needs to exercise his national security \nresponsibilities.\n  I believe these concerns are unfounded. Federal investigators and \nattorneys will recognize the need to disclose information relevant to \nterrorism investigations. Courts can be trusted to keep secrets and \nrecognize the needs of the President.\n  Current law requires that such information be used only for law \nenforcement purpose. This provides an assurance that highly intrusive \ninvasions of privacy are confined to the purpose for which they have \nbeen approved by a court, based on probable cause, as required by the \nFourth Amendment. Current law calls for minimization procedures to \nensure that the surveillance does not gather information about private \nand personal conduct and conversations that are not relevant to the \ncriminal investigation.\n  When the Administration reneged on the agreement regarding court \nsupervision, we turned to other safeguards and were more successful in \nchanging other questionable features of the Administration's bill. The \nAdministration accepted my proposal to strike the term ``national \nsecurity'' from the description of wiretap information that may be \nshared throughout the executive branch and replace it with ``foreign \nintelligence'' information. This change is important in clarifying what \ninformation may be disclosed because the term ``foreign intelligence'' \nis specifically defined by statute whereas ``national security'' is \nnot.\n  Moreoever, the rubric of ``national security'' has been used to \njustify some particularly unsavory activities by the government in the \npast. We must have at least some assurance that we are not embarked on \na course that will lead to a repetition of these abuses because the \nstatute will now more clearly define what type of information is \nsubject to disclosure. In addition, Federal officials who receive the \ninformation may use it only as necessary to the conduct of their \nofficial duties. Therefore, any disclosure or use outside the conduct \nof their official duties remains subject to all limitations applicable \nto their retention and dissemination of information of the type of \ninformation received. This includes the Privacy Act, the criminal \npenalties for unauthorized disclosure of electronic surveillance \ninformation under chapter 119 of title 18, and the contempt penalties \nfor unauthorized disclosure of grand jury information. In addition, the \nAttorney General must establish procedures for the handling of \ninformation that identifies a United States person, such as the \nrestrictions on retention and dissemination of foreign intelligence and \ncounterintelligence information pertaining to United States persons \ncurrently in effect under Executive Order 12333.\n  While these safeguards do not fully substitute for court supervision, \nthey can provide some assurance against misuse of the private, \npersonal, and business information about Americans, that is acquired in \nthe course of criminal investigations and that may flow more widely in \nthe intelligence, defense, and national security worlds.\n  Disclosure of grand jury information. The wiretap statute was not the \nonly provision in which the Administration sought broader authority to \ndisclose highly sensitive investigative information. It also proposed \nbroadening Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to \nallow the disclosure of information relating to terrorism and national \nsecurity obtained from grand jury proceedings to a broad range of \nofficials in the executive branch of government. As with wiretaps, few \nwould disagree that information learned in a criminal investigation \nthat is necessary to combating terrorism or protecting the national \nsecurity ought to be shared with the appropriate intelligence and \nnational security officials. The question is how best to regulate and \nlimit such disclosures so as not to compromise the important policies \nof secrecy and confidentiality that have long applied to grand jury \nproceedings.\n  I proposed that we require judicial review of requests to disclose \nterrorism and foreign intelligence information to officials in the \nexecutive branch beyond those already authorized to receive such \ndisclosures. Once again, the Administration agreed to my proposal on \nSunday, September 30, but reneged within two days. As a result, the \nbill does not provide for any judicial supervision of the new \nauthorization for dissemination of grand jury information throughout \nthe executive branch. The bill does contain the safeguards that I have \ndiscussed with respect to law enforcement wiretap information. However, \nas with the new wiretap disclosure authority, I am troubled by this \nissue and plan to exercise the close oversight of the Judiciary \nCommittee to make sure it is not being abused.\n  Foreign intelligence information sharing. The Administration also \nsought a provision that would allow the sharing of foreign intelligence \ninformation throughout the executive branch of the government \nnotwithstanding any current legal prohibition that may prevent or limit \nits disclosure. I have resisted this proposal more strongly than \nanything else that still remains in the bill. What concerns me is that \nit is not clear what existing prohibitions this provision would affect \nbeyond the grand jury secrecy rule and the wiretap statute, which are \nalready covered by other provisions in the bill. Even the \nAdministration, which wrote this provision, has not been able to \nprovide a fully satisfactory explanation of its scope.\n  If there are specific laws that the Administration believes impede \nthe necessary sharing of information on terrorism and foreign \nintelligence within the executive branch, we should address those \nproblems through legislation that is narrowly targeted to those \nstatutes. Tacking on a blunderbuss provision whose scope we do not \nfully understand can only lead to consequences that we cannot foresee. \nFurther, I am concerned that such legislation, broadly authorizing the \nsecret sharing of intelligence information throughout the executive \nbranch, will fuel the unwarranted fears and dark conspiracy theories of \nAmericans who do not trust their government. This was another provision \nof which the Administration reneged on its agreement with me; it agreed \nto drop it on September 30, but resurrected it within two days, \ninsisting that it remain in the bill. I have been able to mitigate its \npotential for abuse somewhat by adding the same safeguards that apply \nto disclosure of law enforcement wiretap and grand jury information.\n\n  ``Sneak and peek'' search warrants. Another issue that has caused me \nserious concern relates to the Administration's proposal for so-called \n``sneak and peek'' search warrants. The House Judiciary Committee \ndropped this proposal entirely from its version of the legislation. \nNormally, when law enforcement officers execute a search warrant, they \nmust leave a copy of the warrant and a receipt for all property seized \nat the premises searched. Thus, even if the search occurs when the \nowner of the premises is not present, the owner will receive notice \nthat the premises have been lawfully searched pursuant to a warrant \nrather than, for example, burglarized.\n  Two circuit courts of appeal, the Second and the Ninth Circuits, have \nrecognized a limited exception to this requirement. When specifically \nauthorized by the issuing judge or magistrate, the officers may delay \nproviding notice of the search to avoid compromising an ongoing \ninvestigation or for some other good reason. However, this authority \nhas been carefully circumscribed.\n  First, the Second and Ninth Circuit cases have dealt only with \nsituations where the officers search a premises without seizing any \ntangible property. As the Second Circuit explained, such searches are \n``less intrusive than a conventional search with physical seizure \nbecause the latter deprives the owner not only of privacy but also of \nthe use of his property.'' United States v. Villegas, 899 F.2d 1324, \n899 F.2d 1324, 1337 (2d Cir. 1990).\n\n[[Page S10557]]\n\n  Second, the cases have required that the officers seeking the warrant \nmust show good reason for the delay. Finally, while the courts have \nallowed notice of the search may be delayed, it must be provided within \na reasonable period thereafter, which should generally be no more than \nseven days. The reasons for these careful limitations were spelled out \nsuccinctly by Judge Sneed of the Ninth Circuit: ``The mere thought of \nstrangers walking through and visually examining the center of our \nprivacy interest, our home, arouses our passion for freedom as does \nnothing else. That passion, the true source of the Fourth Amendment, \ndemands that surreptitious entries be closely circumscribed.'' United \nStates v. Freitas, 800 F.2d 1451, 1456 (9th Cir. 1986).\n  The Administration's original proposal would have ignored some of the \nkey limitations created by the caselaw for sneak and peek search \nwarrants. First, it would have broadly authorized officers not only to \nconduct surreptitious searches, but also to secretly seize any type of \nproperty without any additional showing of necessity. This type of \nwarrant, which has never been addressed by a published decision of a \nfederal appellate court, has been referred to in a law review article \nwritten by an FBI agent as a ``sneak and steal'' warrant. See K. Corr, \n``Sneaky But Lawful: The Use of Sneak and Peek Search Warrants,'' 43 U. \nKan. L. Rev. 1103, 1113 (1995). Second, the proposal would simply have \nadopted the procedural requirements of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2705 for \nproviding delayed notice of a wiretap. Among other things, this would \nhave extended the permissible period of delay to a maximum of 90 days, \ninstead of the presumptive seven-day period provided by the caselaw on \nsneak and peek warrants.\n  I was able to make significant improvements in the Administration's \noriginal proposal that will help to ensure that the government's \nauthority to obtain sneak and peek warrants is not abused. First, the \nprovision that is now in section 213 of the bill prohibits the \ngovernment from seizing any tangible property or any wire or electronic \ncommunication or stored electronic information unless it makes a \nshowing of reasonable necessity for the seizure. Thus, in contrast to \nthe Administration's original proposal, the presumption is that the \nwarrant will authorize only a search unless the government can make a \nspecific showing of additional need for a seizure. Second, the \nprovision now requires that notice be given within a reasonable time of \nthe execution of the warrant rather than giving a blanket authorization \nfor up to a 90-day delay. What constitutes a reasonable time, of \ncourse, will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case. But \nI would expect courts to be guided by the teachings of the Second and \nthe Ninth Circuits that, in the ordinary case, a reasonable time is no \nmore than seven days.\n  FISA. Several changes in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n(FISA) are designed to clarify technical aspects of the statutory \nframework and take account of experience in practical implementation. \nThese changes are not controversial, and they will facilitate the \ncollection of intelligence for counterterrorism and counterintelligence \npurposes. Other changes are more significant and required careful \nevaluation and revision of the Administration's proposals.\n  Duration of surveillance. The USA Act, in section 297, changes the \nduration of electronic surveillance under FISA in cases of an agent of \na foreign power, other than a United States persons, who acts in the \nUnited States as an officer or employee of a foreign power or as a \nmember of an international terrorist group. Current law limits court \norders in these cases to 90 days, the same duration as for United \nStates persons. Experience indicates, however, that after the initial \nperiod has confirmed probable cause that the foreign national meets the \nstatutory standard, court orders are renewed repeatedly and the 90-day \nrenewal becomes an unnecessary procedural for investigators taxed with \nfar more pressing duties.\n  The Administration proposed that the period of electronic \nsurveillance be changed from 90 days to one year in these cases. This \nproposal did not ensure adequate review after the initial stage to \nensure that the probable cause determination remained justified over \ntime. Therefore, the bill changes the initial period of the \nsurveillance 90 to 120 days and changes the period for extensions from \n90 days to one year. The initial 120-day period provides for a review \nof the results of the surveillance or search directed at an individual \nbefore one-year extensions are requested. These changes do not affect \nsurveillance of a United States person.\n\n  The bill also changes the period for execution of an order for \nphysical search under FISA from 45 to 90 days. This change applies to \nUnited States persons as well as foreign nationals. Experience since \nphysical search authority was added to FISA in 1994 indicates that 45 \ndays is frequently not long enough to plan and carry out a covert \nphysical search. There is no change in the restrictions which provide \nthat United States persons may not be the targets of search or \nsurveillance under FISA unless a judge finds probable cause to believe \nthat they are agents of foreign powers who engage in specified \ninternational terrorist, sabotage, or clandestine intelligence \nactivities that may involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the \nUnited States.\n  FISA judges. The bill, in section 208, seeks to ensure that the \nspecial court established under FISA has sufficient judges to handle \nthe workload. While changing the duration of orders and extensions will \nreduce the number of cases in some categories, the bill retains the \ncourt's role in pen register and trap and trace cases and expands the \ncourt's responsibility for issuing orders for records and other \ntangible items needed for counterintelligence and counter terrorism \ninvestigations. Upon reviewing the court's requirements, the \nAdministration requested an increase in the number of federal district \njudges designated for the court from seven to 11 of whom no less than 3 \nshall reside within 20 miles of the District of Columbia. The latter \nprovision ensures that more than one judge is available to handle cases \non short notice and reduces the need to invoke the alternative of \nAttorney General approval under the emergency authorities in FISA.\n  Agent of a foreign power standard. Other changes in FISA and related \nnational security laws are more controversial. In several areas, the \nbill reflects a serious effort to accommodate the requests for expanded \nsurveillance authority with the need for safeguards against misuse, \nespecially the gathering of intelligence about the lawful political or \ncommercial activities of Americans. One of the most difficult issues \nwas whether to eliminate the existing statutory ``agent of a foreign \npower'' standards for surveillance and investigative techniques that \nraise important privacy concerns, but not at the level that the supreme \nCourt has held to require a court order and a probable cause finding \nunder the Fourth Amendment. These include pen register and trap and \ntrace devices, access to business records and other tangible items held \nby third parties, and access to records that have statutory privacy \nprotection. The latter include telephone, bank, and credit records.\n  The ``agent of a foreign power'' standard in existing law was \ndesigned to ensure that the FBI and other intelligence agencies do not \nuse these surveillance and investigative methods to investigate the \nlawful activities of Americans in the name of an undefined authority to \ncollect foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information. The \nlaw has required a showing of reasonable suspicion, less than probable \ncause, to believe that a United States person is an ``agent of a \nforeign power'' engaged in international terrorism or clandestine \nintelligence activities.\n  However, the ``agent of a foreign power'' standard is more stringent \nthan the standard under comparable criminal law enforcement procedures \nwhich require only a showing of relevance to a criminal investigation. \nThe FBI's experience under existing laws since they were enacted at \nvarious time over the past 15 years has been that, in practice, the \nrequirement to show reasonable suspicion that a person is an ``agent of \na foreign power'' has been almost as burdensome as the requirement to \nshow probable cause required by the Fourth Amendment for more intrusive \ntechniques. The FBI has made a clear case that a relevance standard is \nappropriate for counterintelligence and counterterrorism \ninvestigations, as well as for criminal investigations.\n\n[[Page S10558]]\n\n  The challenge, then, was to define those investigations. The \nalternative proposed by the Administration was to cover any \ninvestigation to obtain foreign intelligence information. This was \nextremely broad, because the definition includes any information with \nrespect to a foreign power that relates to, and if concerning a United \nStates person is necessary to, the national defense or the security of \nthe United States or the conduct of the foreign affairs of the United \nStates. This goes far beyond FBI counterintelligence and \ncounterterrorism requirements. Instead, the bill requires that use of \nthe surveillance technique or access to the records concerning a United \nStates person be relevant to an investigation to protect against \ninternational terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.\n  In addition, an investigation of a United States person may not be \nbased solely on activities protected by the First Amendment. This \nframework applies to pen registers and trap and trace under section \n215, access to records and other items under section 215, and the \nnational security authorities for access to telephone, bank, and credit \nrecords under section 506. Lawful political dissent and protest by \nAmerican citizens against the government may not be the basis for FBI \ncounterintelligence and counterterrorism investigations under these \nprovisions.\n  A separate issue for pen registers and trap and trace under FISA is \nwhether the court should have the discretion to make the decision on \nrelevance. The Administration has insisted on a certification process. \nI discussed this issue as it comes up in the criminal procedures for \npen registers and trap and trace under title 18, and my concerns apply \nto the FISA procedures as well.\n  The purpose of FISA. The most controversial change in FISA requested \nby the Administration was the proposal to allow surveillance and search \nwhen ``a purpose'' is to obtain foreign intelligence information. \nCurrent law requires that the secret procedures and different probable \ncause standards under FISA be used only if a high-level executive \nofficial certifies that ``the purpose'' is to obtain foreign \nintelligence formation. The Administration's aim was to allow FISA \nsurveillance and search for law enforcement purposes, so long as there \nwas at least some element of a foreign intelligence purpose. This \nproposal raised constitutional concerns, which were addressed in a \nlegal opinion provided by the Justice Department, which I insert in the \nrecord at the end of my statement.\n  The Justice Department opinion did not defend the constitutionality \nof the original proposal. Instead, it addressed a suggestion made by \nSenator Feinstein to the Attorney General at the Judiciary Committee \nhearing to change ``the purpose'' to ``a significant purpose.'' No \nmatter what statutory change is made even the Department concedes that \nthe court's may impose a constitutional requirement of ``primary \npurpose'' based on the appellate court decisions upholding FISA against \nconstitutional challenges over the past 20 years.\n\n  Section 218 of the bill adopts ``significant purpose,'' and it will \nbe up to the courts to determine how far law enforcement agencies may \nuse FISA for criminal investigation and prosecution beyond the scope of \nthe statutory definition of ``foreign intelligence information.''\n  In addition, I proposed and the Administration agreed to an \nadditional provision in Section 505 that clarifies the boundaries for \nconsultation and coordination between officials who conduct FISA search \nand surveillance and Federal law enforcement officials including \nprosecutors. Such consultation and coordination is authorized for the \nenforcement of laws that protect against international terrorism, \nclandestine intelligence activities of foreign agents, and other grave \nforeign threats to the nation. Protection against these foreign-based \nthreats by any lawful means is within the scope of the definition of \n``foreign intelligence information,'' and the use of FISA to gather \nevidence for the enforcement of these laws was contemplated in the \nenactment of FISA. The Justice Department's opinion cites relevant \nlegislative history from the Senate Intelligence Committee's report in \n1978, and there is comparable language in the House report.\n  Immigration. The Administration initially proposed that the Attorney \nGeneral be authorized to detain any alien indefinitely upon \ncertification of suspicion to links to terrorist activities or \norganizations. Under close questioning by both Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Specter at the Committee hearing on September 25, the Attorney \nGeneral said that his proposal was intended only to allow the \ngovernment to hold an alien suspected of terrorist activity while \ndeportation proceedings were ongoing. In response to a question by \nSenator Specter, the Attorney General said: ``Our intention is to be \nable to detain individuals who are the subject of deportation \nproceedings on other grounds, to detain them as if they were the \nsubject of deportation proceedings on terrorism.'' The Justice \nDepartment, however, continued to insist on broader authority, \nincluding the power to detain even if the alien was found not to be \ndeportable.\n  I remain concerned about the provision, in section 412, but I believe \nthat it has been improved from the original proposal offered by the \nAdministration. First, the Justice Department must now charge an alien \nwith an immigration or criminal violation within seven days of taking \ncustody, and the Attorney General's certification of an alien under \nthis section is subject to judicial review. Second, if an alien is \nfound not to be removable, he must be released from custody. Third, the \nAttorney General can only delegate the power to certify an alien to the \nDeputy Attorney General, ensuring greater accountability and preventing \nthe certification decision from being made by low-level officials. \nDespite these improvements, I would have preferred that this provision \nnot be included, and I would urge the Attorney General and his \nsuccessors to employ great discretion in using this new power.\n  In addition, the Administration initially proposed a sweeping \ndefinition of terrorist activity and new powers for the Secretary of \nState to designate an organization as a terrorist organization for \npurposes of immigration law. We were able to work with the \nAdministration to refine this definition to limit its application to \nindividuals who had innocent contacts with non-designated \norganizations. We also limited the retroactive effect of these new \ndefinitions. If an alien solicited funds or membership, or provided \nmaterial support for an organization that was not designated at that \ntime by the Secretary of State, the alien will have the opportunity to \nshow that he did not know and should have known that his acts would \nfurther the organization's terrorist activity. This is substantially \nbetter than the administration's proposal, which by its terms, would \nhave empowered the INS to deport someone who raised money for the \nAfrican National Congress in the 1980s.\n  Throughout our negotiations on these issues, Senator Kennedy provided \nsteadfast leadership. Although neither of us are pleased with the final \nproduct, it is far better than it would have been without his active \ninvolvement.\n  Trade Sanctions. I was disappointed that the Administration's initial \nproposal authorizing the President to impose unilateral food and \nmedical sanctions would have undermined a law we passed last year with \noverwhelming bipartisan support.\n  Under that law, the President already has full authority to impose \nunilateral food and medicine sanctions during this crisis because of \ntwo exceptions built into the law that apply to our current situation. \nNevertheless, the Administration sought to undo this law and obtain \nvirtually unlimited authority in the future to impose food and medicine \nembargoes, without making any effort for a multi-lateral approach in \ncooperation with other nations. Absent such a multi-lateral approach, \nother nations would be free to step in immediately and take over \nbusiness from American firms and farmers that they are unilaterally \nbarred from pursuing.\n  Over 30 farm and export groups, including the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the Grocery Manufacturers of America, the National Farmers \nUnion, and the U.S. Dairy Export Council, wrote to me and explained \nthat the Administration proposal would ``not achieve its intended \npolicy goal.''\n  I worked with Senator Enzi, and other Senators, on substitute \nlanguage\n\n[[Page S10559]]\n\nto give the Administration the tools it needs in this crisis. This \nsubstitute has been carefully crafted to avoid needlessly hurting \nAmerican farmers in the future, yet it will assure that the U.S. can \nengage in effective multilateral sanctions.\n  This bipartisan agreement limits the authority in the bill to \nexisting laws and executive orders, which give the President full \nauthority regarding this conflict, and grants authority for the \nPresident to restrict exports of agricultural products, medicine or \nmedical devices. I continue to agree with then-Senator Ashcroft who \nargued in 1999 that unilateral U.S. food and medicine sanctions simply \ndo not work when he introduced the ``Food and Medicine for the World \nAct.''\n  As recently as October 2000, then-Senator Ashcroft pointed out how \nbroad, unilateral embargoes of food or medicine are often \ncounterproductive. Many Republican and Democratic Senators made it \nclear just last year that the U.S. should work with other countries on \nfood and medical sanctions so that the sanctions will be effective in \nhurting our enemies, instead of just hurting the U.S. I am glad that \nwith Senator Enzi's help, we were able to make changes in the trade \nsanctions provision to both protect our farmers and help the President \nduring this crisis.\n  Money Laundering. Title III of the USA Act consists of a bipartisan \nbill that was reported out of the Banking Committee on October 4, 2001. \nI commend the Chairman and Ranking Member of that Committee, Senators \nSarbanes and Gramm, for working together to produce a balanced and \neffective package of measures to combat international money laundering \nand the financing of terrorism.\n  I am pleased that the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Banking \nCommittee agreed to our inclusion in the managers' amendment of a small \nchange to a provision of title III, section 319, relating to forfeiture \nof funds in United States interbank accounts. As reported by the \nBanking Committee, this provision included language suggesting that in \na criminal case, the government may have authority to seek a pretrial \nrestraining order of substitute assets. In fact, as all but one of the \ncircuit courts to consider the issue have held, the government has no \nsuch authority. The managers' amendment strikes the offending language \nfrom section 319.\n  Another provision added as part of the Banking Committee title--\nsection 351--is far more troubling. Section 351 creates a new Bank \nSecrecy Act offense involving the bulk smuggling of more than $10,000 \nin currency in any conveyance, article of luggage or merchandise or \ncontainer, either into or out of the United States. The obvious purpose \nof this section is to circumvent the Supreme Court's decision in United \nStates v. Bajakajian, 118 S. Ct. 2029 (1998), which held that a \n``punitive'' forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause of the \nEighth Amendment if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of the \noffense it is designed to punish.\n  In fact, the crime created in section 351--willfully evading a \ncurrency reporting requirement by ``concealing'' and transporting more \nthan $10,000 across a U.S. border--is no different than the crime at \nissue in Bajakajian--willfully evading a currency reporting requirement \nby transporting more than $10,000 across a U.S. border. A forfeiture \nthat is ``grossly disproportional'' with respect to the latter will \ninevitably be found ``grossly disproportional'' with respect to the \nformer. The new element of ``concealment'' does little or nothing to \nbolster the government's claim to forfeiture of the unreported \ncurrency, since this element is already implicit in the current crime \nof evasion: It is hardly likely that a person who is in the process of \nwillfully evading the currency reporting requirement will be waiving \nhis currency around for all the world to see.\n  Conclusion. I have done my best under the circumstances and want to \nthank especially Senator Kennedy for his leadership on the Immigration \nparts of the bill. My efforts have not been completely successful and \nthere are a number of provisions on which the Administration has \ninsisted with which I disagree. Frankly, the agreement of September 30, \n2001 would have led to a better balanced bill. I could not stop the \nAdministration from reneging on the agreement any more than I could \nhave sped the process to reconstitute this bill in the aftermath of \nthose breaches. In these times we need to work together to face the \nchallenges of international terrorism. I have sought to do so in good \nfaith.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I enjoyed the remarks of my distinguished \ncolleague from Vermont. I compliment him for the work he has done on \nthis bill and for the hard work, over the last 3 weeks, that he and his \nstaff have put into this bill, as well as other members of the \nJudiciary Committee as a whole, and, of course, people on my side as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, I do not intend to take very long. I know our \ncolleagues are tired, and I know they would like to go home. I also \nknow that we have a distinguished colleague in the Chamber who has some \namendments on which we may have to vote.\n  Four weeks ago we were a relatively tranquil nation, but on September \n11, in what amounted to a dastardly attack, an unprovoked attack of \nwar, the World Trade Center was destroyed, along with almost 6,000 \npeople, or maybe more. Our Pentagon was struck by a volitionary act of \nterrorism.\n  As a result of the acts of heroes, one of the planes was downed in \nPennsylvania, killing all aboard, including those heroes who made sure \nthat that plane did not strike either the Capitol or the White House. I \nwant to pay special tribute to those people who were so heroic as to \ngive up their own lives to protect the lives of so many others.\n  There have been so many acts of heroism and self-sacrifice--the \nfirefighters who gave their lives, the firefighters who worked day and \nnight, the volunteers who have gone in there, the mayor of New York \nCity, the Governor, and so many others who deserve mention.\n  This bill, hopefully, will help to at least rectify and redeem some \nof the problems, problems that have existed ever since September 11.\n  We did not seek this war; it was thrust upon us. It was an unprovoked \nattack by people who claim that they represent a religious point of \nview when, in fact, what they represent is a complete distortion of the \nreligion of Islam.\n  Islamic people do not believe in murder, murdering innocent \ncivilians. The Koran does not teach that. They do not believe in \nsuicide. The Koran does not teach that.\n  This is not a war against Islam; this is a war against terrorism and \npeople who have so little regard for human life that they would do \nsomething against innocent civilians that was unthinkable before \nSeptember 11.\n  Therefore, we live in a dangerous and difficult world today. It is a \ndifferent world. And we are going to have to wake up and do the things \nwe have to do to protect our citizenry and, of course, to protect the \nrest of the world to the extent this great Nation can, with the help of \nother nations, a number of which have become supportive of our efforts. \nWe are very grateful to them.\n  But a lot of people do not realize we have terror cells in this \ncountry--that has been in the media even--and there are people in this \ncountry who are dedicated to the overthrow of America. There are people \nwho are dedicated to terrorism right here within our Nation. And some \nof these people who have participated in this matter may very well be \npeople who were rightfully in our Nation--or at least we thought were \nrightfully in our Nation.\n  The responsibility of redeeming and rectifying this situation is the \nresponsibility of the Congress, the Justice Department, the FBI, the \nINS, and the Border Patrol. It is our job to provide the tools, and for \nthem to first identify and then eradicate terrorist activity within our \nborders. And our President has taken the extraordinary step of saying \nwe are going to go after terrorists worldwide and those who harbor \nthem.\n\n  I agree with the President. I think it is time to do it. It is time \nto hit them where it hurts. It is time to let them know we are not \ngoing to put up with this type of activity.\n  A few weeks ago, the Justice Department sent up its legislative \nproposal. It\n\n[[Page S10560]]\n\nwas a good legislative proposal. They had a lot of ideas in there that \nliterally we have been trying to get through for years. When we passed \nthe 1996 antiterrorism, effective death penalty act, a number of us \ntried to get some of these provisions in at that time, but we were \nunsuccessful for a variety of reasons, some very sincere.\n  The fact is, a lot of the provisions we have in the bill are not \nbrand new; a lot of them have been requested for years. And had they \nbeen in play, who knows but we might have been able to interdict these \nterrorists and have stopped what happened and have stopped the loss of \ncivil liberties for approximately 6,000 or more people.\n  In the past several weeks, after the Justice Department sent up its \nbill, Senator Leahy and I, Justice Department officials, White House \nofficials, staff members from both of our staffs, and staff members \nfrom other members of the committee have worked day and night to come \nup with this particular bill.\n  I congratulate my partner and my colleague, Senator Leahy, for his \nhard work on this bill, and his staffers' for the work they have done \non this bill, and, of course, my own staffers, and, of course, those \nothers I have named.\n  This has been a very difficult bill to put forward because there are \nall kinds of cross-pressures, all kinds of ideas, all kinds of \ndifferent thoughts, all kinds of differing philosophies. We believe, \nwith all kinds of deliberation and work, we have been able to put \ntogether a bill that really makes sense, that will give the Justice \nDepartment the tools it needs to be able to work and stamp out \nterrorist activity within our country. At least we want to give them \nthe very best tools we possibly can.\n  We have tried to accommodate the concerns of Senators on both sides \nof the aisle. We have worked very hard to do so. We cannot accommodate \neverybody's concerns. As Senator Leahy has said, this is not a perfect \nbill. Nothing ever seems to be perfect around here. But this is as good \na bill as can be put together, in a bipartisan way, in this area in the \nhistory of the Senate. I really feel good about it, that we have done \nthis type of a job.\n  As I say, a lot of these provisions have been requested by the \nJustice Department and both Democrat and Republican White Houses for \nyears. We took into consideration civil liberties throughout our \ndiscussions on this bill. I think we got it just right. We are \nprotective of civil liberties while at the same time giving the tools \nto the law enforcement agencies to be able to do their jobs in this \ncountry.\n  I might mention that this bill encourages information sharing, that \nwould be absolutely prohibited under current law, among various \nagencies of Government, information sharing that should have been \nallowed a long time ago, at least in my view.\n  It updates the laws with regard to electronic surveillance and brings \nthose laws into the digital age, and brings them into an effective way \nso that we can, in a modernized way, protect our society, at least to \nthe extent we can, from these types of terrorist activities.\n  Of course, little things, such as pen registers, trap-and-trace \nauthority--we have been able to resolve these problems after years of \nproblems.\n  I would like to make a few comments regarding the process for this \nlegislation. Although we have considered this in a more expedited \nmanner than other legislation, my colleagues can be assured that this \nbill has received thorough consideration. First, the fact is that the \nbulk of these proposals have been requested by the Department of \nJustice for years, and have languished in Congress for years because we \nhave been unable to muster the collective political will to enact them \ninto law.\n  No one can say whether these tools could have prevented the attacks \nof September 11. But, as the Attorney General has said, it is certain \nthat without these tools, we did not stop the vicious acts of last \nmonth. I say to my colleagues, Mr. President, that if these tools could \nhelp us now to track down the perpetrators--if they will help us in our \ncontinued pursuit of terrorist activities within our national borders \nthen we should not hesitate any further to pass these reforms into law. \nAs long as these reforms are consistent with our--Constitution and they \nare--it is difficult to see why anyone would oppose their passage.\n  Furthermore, I would like to clearly dispel the myth that the reforms \nin this legislation somehow abridge the Constitutional freedoms enjoyed \nby law-abiding American citizens. Some press reports have portrayed \nthis issue as a choice between individual liberties on the one hand, \nand on the other hand, enhanced powers for our law enforcement \ninstitutions. This is a false dichotomy. We should all take comfort \nthat the reforms in this bill are primarily directed at allowing law \nenforcement agents to work smarter and more efficiently--in no case do \nthey curtail the precious civil liberties protected by our \nConstitution. I want to assure my colleagues that we worked very hard \nover the past several weeks to ensure that this legislation upholds all \nof the constitutional freedoms our citizens cherish. It does.\n  Mr. President, I will submit for the Record my extended remarks \ndescribing this legislation, but I would like to take a minute to \nexplain briefly a few of the most important provisions of this critical \nlegislation.\n  First, the legislation encourages information-sharing between various \narms of the federal government. I believe most of our citizens would be \nshocked to learn that, even if certain government agents had prior \nknowledge of the September 11 attacks, under many circumstances they \nwould have been prohibited by law from sharing that information with \nthe appropriate intelligence or national security authorities.\n  This legislation makes sure that, in the future, such information \nflows freely within the Federal government, so that it will be received \nby those responsible for protecting against terrorist attacks.\n  By making these reforms, we are rejecting the outdated Cold War \nparadigm that has prevented cooperation between our intelligence \ncommunity and our law enforcement agents. Current law does not \nadequately allow for such cooperation, artificially hampering our \ngovernment's ability to identify and prevent acts of terrorism against \nour citizens.\n  In this new war, terrorists are a hybrid between domestic criminals \nand international agents. We must lower the barriers that discourage \nour law enforcement and intelligence agencies from working together to \nstop these terrorists. These hybrid criminals call for new, hybrid \ntools.\n  Second, this bill updates the laws relating to electronic \nsurveillance. Electronic surveillance, conducted under the supervision \nof a federal judge, is one of the most powerful tools at the disposal \nof our law enforcement community. It is simply a disgrace that we have \nnot acted to modernize the laws currently on the books which govern \nsuch surveillance, laws that were enacted before the fax machine came \ninto common usage, and well before the advent of cellular telephones, \ne-mail, and instant messaging. The Department of Justice has asked us \nfor years to update these laws to reflect the new technologies, but \nthere has always been a call to go slow, to seek more information, to \norder further studies.\n  This is no hypothetical problem. We now know that e-mail, cellular \ntelephones, and the Internet have been principal tools used by the \nterrorists to coordinate their atrocious activities. We need to pursue \nall solid investigatory leads that exist right now that our law \nenforcement agents would be unable to pursue because they must continue \nto work within these outdated laws. It is high time that we update our \nlaws so that our law enforcement agencies can deal with the world as it \nis, rather than the world as it existed 20 years ago.\n  A good example of way we our handicapping our law enforcement \nagencies relates to devices called ``pen registers.'' Pen registers may \nbe employed by the FBI, after obtaining a court order, to determine \nwhat telephone numbers are being dialed from a particular telephone. \nThese devices are essential investigatory tools, which allow law \nenforcement agents to determine who is speaking to whom, within a \ncriminal conspiracy.\n  The Supreme Court has held, in Smith v. Maryland, that the \ninformation obtained by pen register devices is not information that is \nsubject to any constitutional protection. Unlike the content of your \ntelephone conversation\n\n[[Page S10561]]\n\nonce your call is connected, the numbers you dial into your telephone \nare not private. Because you have no reasonable expectation that such \nnumbers will be kept private, they are not protected under the \nConstitution. The Smith holding was cited with approval by the Supreme \nCourt just earlier this year.\n  The legislation under consideration today would make clear what the \nFederal courts have already ruled--that Federal judges may grant pen \nregister authority to the FBI to cover, not just telephones, but other \nmore modern modes of communication such as e-mail or instant messaging. \nLet me make clear that the bill does not allow law enforcement to \nreceive the content of the communication, but they can receive the \naddressing information to identify the computer or computers a suspect \nis using to further his criminal activity.\n  Importantly, reform of the pen register law does not allow--as has \nsometimes been misreported in the press--for law enforcement agents to \nview the content of any e-mail messages--not even the subject line of \ne-mails. In addition, this legislation we are considering today makes \nit explicit that content can not be collected through such pen register \norders.\n  This legislation also allows judges to enter pen register orders with \nnationwide scope. Nationwide jurisdiction for pen register orders makes \ncommon sense. It helps law enforcement agents efficiently identify \ncommunications facilities throughout the country, which greatly \nenhances the ability of law enforcement to identify quickly other \nmembers of a criminal organization, such as a terrorist cell.\n  Moreover, this legislation provides our intelligence community with \nthe same authority to use pen register devices, under the auspices of \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, that our law enforcement \nagents have when investigating criminal offenses. It simply makes sense \nto provide law enforcement with the same tools to catch terrorists that \nthey already possess in connection with other criminal investigations, \nsuch as drug crimes or illegal gambling.\n  In addition to the pen register statute, this legislation updates \nother aspects of our wiretapping statutes. It is amazing that law \nenforcement agents do not currently have authority to seek wiretapping \nauthority from a Federal judge when investigating a terrorist offense. \nThis legislation fixes that problem.\n  Moving on, I note that much has been made of the complex immigration \nprovisions of this bill. I know Senators Specter, Kohl and Kennedy had \nquestions about earlier provisions, particularly the detention \nprovision for suspected alien terrorists.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that we have worked hard to address \nyour concerns, and the concerns of the public. As with the other \nimmigration provisions of this bill, we have made painstaking efforts \nto achieve this workable compromise.\n  Let me address some of the specific concerns. In response to the \nconcern that the INS might detain a suspected terrorist indefinitely, \nthe Senator Kennedy, Senator Kyl, and I worked out a compromise that \nlimits the provision. It provides that the alien must be charged with \nan immigration or criminal violation within seven days after the \ncommencement of detention or be released. In addition, contrary to what \nhas been alleged, the certification itself is subject to judicial \nreview. The Attorney General's power to detain a suspected terrorist \nunder this bill is, then, not unfettered.\n  Moreover, Senator Leahy and I have also worked diligently to craft \nnecessary language that provides for the deportation of those aliens \nwho are representatives of organizations that endorse terrorist \nactivity, those who use a position of prominence to endorse terrorist \nactivity or persuade others to support terrorist activity, or those who \nprovide material support to terrorist organizations. If we are to fight \nterrorism, we can not allow those who support terrorists to remain in \nour country. Also, I should note that we have worked hard to provide \nthe State Department and the INS the tools they need to ensure that no \napplicant for admission who is a terrorist is able to secure entry into \nthe United States through legal channels.\n  Finally, the bill gives law enforcement agencies powerful tools to \nattack the financial infrastructure of terrorism giving our Government \nthe ability to choke off the financing that these dangerous terrorist \norganizations need to survive. It criminalizes the practice of \nharboring terrorists, and puts teeth in the laws against providing \nmaterial support to terrorists and terrorist organizations. It gives \nthe President expanded authority to freeze the assets of terrorists and \nterrorist organizations, and provides for the eventual seizure of such \nassets. These tools are vital to our ability to effectively wage the \nwar against terrorism, and ultimately to win it.\n  There have been few, if any, times in our nation's great history \nwhere an event has brought home to so many of our citizens, so quickly, \nand in such a graphic fashion, a sense of our vulnerability to \nunexpected attack.\n  I believe we all took some comfort when President Bush promised us \nthat our law enforcement institutions would have the tools necessary to \nprotect us from the danger that we are only just beginning to perceive.\n  The Attorney General has told us what tools he needs. We have taken \nthe time to review the problems with our current laws, and to reflect \non their solutions. The time to act is now. Let us please move forward \nexpeditiously, and give those who are in the business of protecting us \nthe tools that they need to do the job.\n  Mr. President, I think most people understand this is an important \nbill. All of us understand it needs to be done. All of us understand \nthat these are tools our law enforcement people deserve and need to \nhave. And, frankly, it is a bill that I think can make a real \ndifference with regard to the interdiction of future acts of terrorism \nin our society.\n  Nobody can guarantee, when you have people willing to commit suicide \nin the perpetration of these awful acts, at all times that we can \nabsolutely protect our Nation. But this bill will provide the tools \nwhereby we might be able--and in most cases should be able--to resolve \neven those types of problems.\n  So with that, I am happy to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of S. \n1510, the Uniting and Strengthening America Act of 2001, and in \nparticular, Title III of S. 1510, the International Money Laundering \nAbatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001.\n  Title III was reported out of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs, which I am privileged to chair, a week ago today by a \nunanimous vote of 21 to 0.\n  President Bush said on September 24: ``We have launched a strike on \nthe financial foundation of the global terror network.''\n  Title III of our comprehensive anti-terrorism package supplies the \narmament for that strike. Osama bin Laden may have boasted that ``al-\nQaeda [includes] modern, educated youth who are aware of the cracks \ninside the western financial system, as they are aware of the lines in \ntheir hands.'' With Title III, we are sealing up those cracks.\n  Title III contains, among other things, authority to take targeted \naction against countries, institutions, transactions, or types of \naccounts the Secretary of the Treasury finds to be of ``primary money-\nlaundering concern.'' It also contains requirements for due diligence \nstandards directed at corresponding accounts opened at U.S. banks by \nforeign offshore banks and banks in jurisdictions that have been found \nto fall significantly below international anti-money laundering \nstandards.\n  It contains a bar on the maintenance of U.S. correspondent accounts \nfor offshore shell banks--those banks that have no physical presence or \nemployees anywhere, and that are not part of a regulated and recognized \nbanking company. There is also a requirement that all financial \ninstitutions establish anti-money laundering programs.\n  Title III also contains several provisions that should enhance the \nability\n\n[[Page S10562]]\n\nof the Government to share more specific information with banks, and \nthe ability of banks to share information with one another relating to \npotential terrorist or money-laundering activities, and a large number \nof important technical improvements in anti-money laundering statutes, \nas well as, mandates to the Department of the Treasury to act or \nformulate recommendations to improve our anti-money laundering \nprograms.\n  The problem of money laundering is not a new one. There have been \nsignificant efforts for some time in Congress to cut the financial \nlifelines on which criminal operations depend. Senator John Kerry's \nexhaustive investigation nearly a decade ago into the collapse of a \nshady institution called BCCI, which he found was established with \n``the specific purpose of evading regulation or control by \ngovernments,'' led him to introduce anti-money laundering legislation. \nA bill similar to his was approved last year by the Banking Committee \nof the House of Representatives on a 31 to 1 vote.\n  Recent investigations by Senator Carl Levin's Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations produced two excellent reports on the ways criminals \nuse financial institutions to launder funds and how we can counter \nthese activities. Senator Levin's reports demonstrated dramatically how \ncorrespondent banking facilities and private banking services impede \nfinancial transparency and hide foreign client identity and activity, \nthereby contributing to international money laundering.\n  Senator Charles Grassley has also advocated for stronger money \nlaundering legislation, and sponsored the Money Laundering and \nFinancial Crimes Strategy Act of 1998, which mandates the development \nof an annual national money laundering strategy.\n  Two weeks ago we held our own hearings in the Banking Committee. We \nheard from a number of expert witnesses and from Under Secretary of the \nTreasury Gurule; Assistant Attorney General Chertoff; and Ambassador \nStuart Eizenstat, the former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.\n  On October 4, the Banking Committee marked-up and reported out our \nown bill. The committee print was built, in a sense, on the foundation \ngiven to us by Senators Kerry, Levin, Grassley, and by others in this \ninstitution.\n  Before describing the provisions of Title III in greater detail, I \nwant to thank all members of the Banking Committee for their \ncontributions to this legislation. As I indicated, it came out of the \ncommittee on a vote of 21 to 0. The Ranking Member, Senator Gramm, \nprovided crucial support. He raised certain issues which were addressed \nin the course of the mark-up involving, among other things, important \ndue process protections. Senators Stabenow and Johnson were \ninstrumental in producing a compromise to resolve a dispute over one of \nthe package's most important provisions. Senator Enzi contributed his \nexperience as an accountant in refining another critical provision.\n  Senator Schumer, who has been involved in past efforts to address \nmoney laundering activities, played an important role, as did Senators \nAllard, Bayh, Corzine, and Crapo, who offered amendments and \ncontributed important improvements to various parts of the subtitle.\n  I am deeply grateful to all of the members of the committee for their \nstrong, positive, and constructive contributions and for their \nwillingness to work day and night. It is my understanding that the \ncommittee staff went three consecutive nights without any sleep in \norder to prepare this legislation. This is carefully considered \nlegislation because it reflects and builds upon efforts which have been \nmade over a number of years.\n  Earlier today, our colleagues on the Financial Services Committee in \nthe House of Representatives marked-up a bill, many of the provisions \nof which are identical or virtually identical to those contained in \nTitle III of the package now before us.\n  Public support across the country for anti-money laundering \nlegislation is extremely strong. Jim Hoagland put it plainly in the \nWashington Post:\n\n       This crisis offers Washington an opportunity to force \n     American and international banks to clean up concealment and \n     laundering practices they now tolerate or encourage and which \n     terrorism can exploit.\n\n  Terrorist attacks require major investments of time, planning, \ntraining, practice, and financial resources to pay the bills. Money \nlaundering is the transmission belt that gives terrorists the resources \nto carry out their campaigns of carnage. We intend, with Title III of \nthis legislation, to end that transmission belt and its ability to \nbring resources to the networks that enable terrorists to carry out \ntheir campaigns of violence.\n  Title III addresses all aspects of our defenses against money \nlaundering. Those defenses generally fall into three parts. The first \nis the Bank Secrecy Act, ``BSA'', passed in 1970. It requires financial \ninstitutions to keep standardized transaction records and report large \ncurrency transactions and suspicious transactions and mandates \nreporting of the movement of more than $10,000 in currency into or out \nof the country. The statute is called the ``bank secrecy act,'' because \nit bars bank secrecy in America, by preventing financial institutions \nfrom maintaining opaque records, or discarding their records \naltogether. Secrecy is the hiding place for crime, and Congress has \nbarred our institutions from allowing those hiding places. The \nfinancial institutions covered by that act include banks, broker-\ndealers, casinos, and non-bank transmitters of funds, currency \nexchangers, and check cashers--all financial services businesses \nthrough which our citizens--and criminals hiding as legitimate \ncitizens--can move funds into and through our economy. Unfortunately, \nreporting regulations covering some of these institutions have not yet \nbeen promulgated.\n  The second part of our money laundering defenses are the criminal \nstatutes first enacted in 1986 that make it a crime to launder money \nand allow criminal and civil forfeiture of the proceeds of crime. The \nthird part is the statutory framework that allows information to be \ncommunicated to and between law enforcement officials. Our goal must be \nto assure--to the greatest extent consistent with reasonable privacy \nprotections--that the necessary information can be used by the right \npersons in ``real time'' to cut off terrorism and crime.\n  Title III modernizes provisions in all three areas to meet today's \nthreats in a global economy. Its provisions are divided into five \nsubtitles, dealing, respectively, with ``international counter-money \nlaundering measures''--sections 311-328--``Bank Secrecy Act \nimprovements''--sections 331-342--bulk cash smuggling--section 351 and \nanti-corruption measures--sections 361-363.\n  There are 39 provisions in Title III. At this time, I want to \nsummarize some of the bill's most important provisions.\n  Section 311 gives the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with \nother senior government officials, authority to impose one or more of \nfive new ``special measures'' against foreign jurisdictions, entities, \ntransactions or accounts that the Secretary, after consultation with \nother senior federal officials, determines to pose a ``primary money \nlaundering concern'' to the United States. The special measures all \ninvolve special recordkeeping and reporting measures--to eliminate the \ncurtains behind which launderers hide. In extreme cases the Secretary \nis permitted to bar certain kinds of inter-bank accounts from \nespecially problematic jurisdictions. The statute specifies the \nconsiderations the Secretary must take into account in using the new \nauthority and contains provisions to supplement the Administrative \nProcedure Act to assure that any remedies--except certain short-term \nmeasures--are subject to full comment from all affected persons.\n  This new provision gives the Secretary real authority to act to close \noverseas loopholes through which U.S. financial institutions are \nabused. At present the Secretary has no weapons except Treasury \nAdvisories--which don't impose specific requirements--or full economic \nsanctions that suspend financial and trade relations with offending \ntargets. President Bush's invocation of the International Economic \nEmergency Powers Act (IEEPA) several weeks ago was obviously \nappropriate. But there are many other situations in which we will not \nwant to\n\n[[Page S10563]]\n\nblock all transactions, but in which we will want to do more than \nsimply advise financial institutions about under-regulated foreign \nfinancial institutions or holes in foreign counter-money laundering \nefforts. Former Deputy Secretary Eizenstat testified before the \nCommittee that adding this tool to the Secretary's arsenal was \nessential.\n  Section 312 focuses on another aspect of the fight against money \nlaundering, the financial institutions that are on the front lines \nmaking the initial decisions about what foreign banks to allow inside \nthe United States. It requires U.S. financial institutions to exercise \nappropriate due diligence when dealing with private banking accounts \nand interbank correspondent relationships with foreign banks. With \nrespect to foreign banks, the section requires U.S. financial \ninstitutions to apply appropriate due diligence to all correspondent \naccounts with foreign banks, and enhanced due diligence for accounts \nsought by offshore banks or banks in jurisdictions found to have \nsubstandard money laundering controls or which the Secretary determines \nto be of primary money laundering concern under the new authority given \nhim by section 311.\n  The section also specifies certain minimum standards for the enhanced \ndue diligence that U.S. financial institutions are required to apply to \naccounts opened for two categories of foreign banks with high money \nlaundering risks--offshore banks and banks in jurisdictions with weak \nanti-money laundering and banking controls. These minimum standards \nwere developed from, and are based upon, the factual record and \nanalysis contained in the Levin staff report on correspondent banking \nand money laundering.\n  Section 312 is essential to Title III. It addresses, with appropriate \nflexibility, mechanisms whose very importance for the conduct of \ncommercial banking makes them special targets of money launderers, as \nillustrated in Senator Levin's extensive reports and hearings. A \nrelated provision, in section 319, requires foreign banks that maintain \ncorrespondent accounts in the United States to appoint agents for \nservice of process within the United States and authorizes the Attorney \nGeneral and the Secretary of the Treasury to issue a summons or \nsubpoena to any such foreign bank seeking records, wherever located, \nrelating to such a correspondent account. U.S. banks must sever \ncorrespondent arrangements with foreign banks that do not either comply \nwith or contest any such summons or subpoena, and if the Attorney \nGeneral or the Secretary of the Treasury asks them to sever the \narrangements.\n\n  These provisions send a simple message to foreign banks doing \nbusiness through U.S. correspondent accounts: be prepared, if you want \nto use our banking facilities, to operate in accordance with U.S. law.\n  Section 313 also builds on the factual record before the Banking \nCommittee to bar from the United States financial system pure ``brass-\nplate'' shell banks created outside the U.S. that have no physical \npresence anywhere and are not affiliated with recognized banking \ninstitutions. These shell banks carry the highest money laundering \nrisks in the banking world because they are inherently unavailable for \neffective oversight--there is no office where a bank regulator or law \nenforcement official can go to observe bank operations, review \ndocuments or freeze funds.\n  Section 327 permits the Secretary to deal with abuse of another \nrecognized commercial banking mechanism--concentration accounts that \nare used to commingle related funds in one place temporarily pending \ndisbursement or the transfer of funds into individual client accounts. \nConcentration accounts have been used to launder funds, and the bill \npermits the Secretary to issue rules to bar the use of concentration \naccounts to move client funds anonymously, without documentation \nlinking particular funds to their true owners.\n  Section 332 requires financial institutions to establish minimum \nanti-money laundering programs that include appropriate internal \npolicies, management, employee training, and audit features. This is \nnot a ``one size fits all'' requirement; in fact its very generality \nrecognizes that different types of programs will be appropriate for \ndifferent types and sizes of institutions.\n  A number of improvements are made to the suspicious activity \nreporting rules. First, technical changes strengthen the safe harbor \nfrom civil liability for institutions that report suspicious activity \nto the Treasury. The provisions not only add to the protection for \nreporting institutions; they also address individual privacy concerns \nby making it clear that government officers may not disclose suspicious \ntransaction reports information except in the conduct of their official \nduties. The Act also requires the issuance of suspicious transaction \nreporting rules applicable to brokers and dealers in securities within \n270 days of the date of enactment.\n  Sections 341 and 342 of the Title deal with underground banking \nsystems such as the Hawala, which is suspected of being a channel used \nto finance the al Qaeda network. Section 341 makes it clear that \nunderground money transmitters are subject to the same recordkeeping \nrules--and the same penalties for violating those rules--as above-\nground, recognized, money transmitters. It also directs the Secretary \nof the Treasury to report to Congress, within one year, on the need for \nadditional legislation or regulatory controls relating to underground \nbanking systems. Section 342 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury \nto instruct the United States Executive Director of each of the \ninternational financial institutions to use such Director's ``voice and \nvote'' to support loans and other use of resources to benefit nations \nthat the President determines to be contributing to efforts to combat \ninternational terrorism, and to require the auditing of each \ninternational financial institution to ensure that funds are not paid \nto persons engaged in or supporting terrorism.\n  Section 351 creates a new Bank Secrecy Act offense involving the bulk \nsmuggling of more than $10,000 in currency in any conveyance, article \nof luggage or merchandise or container, either into or out of the \nUnited States, and related forfeiture provisions. This provision has \nbeen sought for several years by both the Departments of Justice and \nTreasury.\n  Other provisions of the bill address relevant provisions of the \nCriminal Code. These provisions were worked out with the Judiciary \nCommittee and are included in Title III because of their close \nrelationship to the provisions of Title 31 added or modified by Title \nIII.\n  The most important is section 315, which expands the list of \nspecified unlawful activities under 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957 to include \nforeign corruption offenses, certain U.S. export control violations, \noffenses subject to U.S. extradition obligations under multilateral \ntreaties, and misuse of funds of international financial institutions.\n  Section 316 establishes procedures to protect the rights of persons \nwhose property may be subject to confiscation in the exercise of the \ngovernment's anti-terrorism authority.\n  Section 319 treats amounts deposited by foreign banks in interbank \naccounts with U.S. banks as having been deposited in the United States \nfor purposes of the forfeiture rules, but grants the Attorney General \nauthority, in the interest of fairness and consistent with the United \nStates' national interest, to suspend a forfeiture proceeding based on \nthat presumption. This closes an important forfeiture loophole.\n  Section 321 allows the United States to exclude any alien that the \nAttorney General knows or has reason to believe is or has engaged in or \nabetted certain money laundering offenses.\n  A third important set of provisions modernize information sharing \nrules to reflect the reality of the fight against money laundering and \nterrorism.\n  Section 314 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue \nregulations to encourage cooperation among financial institutions, \nfinancial regulators and law enforcement officials and to permit the \nsharing of information by law enforcement and regulatory authorities \nwith such institutions regarding persons reasonably suspected, based on \ncredible evidence, of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering \nactivities. The section also allows banks to share information \ninvolving possible money laundering or terrorist activity among \nthemselves--with notice to the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  Section 335 permits, but does not require, a bank to include \ninformation,\n\n[[Page S10564]]\n\nin a response to a request for an employment reference by a second \nbank, about the possible involvement of a former institution-affiliated \nparty in potentially unlawful activity, and creates a safe harbor from \ncivil liability for the bank that includes such information in response \nto an employment reference request, except in the case of malicious \nintent. Given its different focus, it is not my intention to similarly \nlimit a bank's safe harbor from civil liability for the filing of \nsuspicious activity reports under the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\n  Section 340 contains amendments to various provisions of the Bank \nSecrecy Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, and the Fair Credit \nReporting Act, to permit information subject to those statutes to be \nused in the conduct of United States intelligence or \ncounterintelligence activities to protect against international \nterrorism.\n\n  The modernization of our money laundering laws represented by \nSubtitle III is long overdue. It is not the work of one week or one \nweekend, but represents years of careful study and a bipartisan effort \nto produce a piece of prudent legislation. The care taken in producing \nthe legislation extends to several provisions calling for reporting on \nthe legislation's effect and a provision for a three-year review of the \nlegislation's effectiveness.\n  Title III responds, as I've indicated, to the statement of Assistant \nAttorney General Chertoff, the head of the Department of Justice's \nCriminal Division, at the Banking Committee's September 26 hearing that \n``[w]e are fighting with outdated weapons in the money laundering arena \ntoday.'' Without this legislation, the cracks in the system of which \nbin Laden boasted will remain open. We should not, indeed we can not, \nallow that to happen, any more than we can delay dealing with the \nfinancial aspects of the terrorist threat.\n  Title III is a balanced effort to address a complex area of national \nconcern. I strongly urge my colleagues to follow the unanimous \nrecommendation of the Banking Committee and support this important \ncomponent of the anti-terrorism package.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary of Title \nIII be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nTitle III--International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist \n           Financing Act of 2001--Section-by-Section Summary\n\n       Sec. 301. Short title and table of contents.\n       Sec. 302. Findings and purposes.\n       Sec. 303. Provides that the provisions added and amendments \n     made by Title III will terminate after September 30, 2004, if \n     the Congress enacts a joint resolution to that effect, and \n     that such joint resolution will be given expedited \n     consideration in each Houses of Congress.\n\n\nsubtitle A. International Counter-Money Laundering and Related Measures\n\n       Sec. 311. Gives the Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with other senior government officials, \n     authority (in the Secretary's discretion) to impose one or \n     more of five new ``special measures'' against foreign \n     jurisdictions, entities, transactions and accounts that the \n     Secretary, after consultation with other senior federal \n     officials, determines to pose a ``primary money laundering \n     concern'' to the United States. The special measures include: \n     (1) requiring additional recordkeeping or reporting for \n     particular transactions, (2) requiring the identification of \n     the foreign beneficial owners of certain accounts at a U.S. \n     financial institution, (3) requiring the identification of \n     customers of a foreign bank who use an interbank payable-\n     through account opened by that foreign bank at a U.S. bank, \n     (4) requiring the identification of customers of a foreign \n     bank who use an interbank correspondent account opened by \n     that foreign bank at a U.S. bank, and (5) after consultation \n     with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the \n     Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, restricting or \n     prohibiting the opening or maintaining of certain interbank \n     correspondent or payable-through accounts. Measures 1-4 may \n     not be imposed, other than by regulation, for a period in \n     excess of 120 days; measure 5 may only be imposed by \n     regulation. Also requires the Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agencies, \n     to submit to Congress, within 180 days of the date of \n     enactment, recommendations for the most effective way to \n     require foreign nationals opening a U.S. bank account to \n     provide identification comparable to that required when U.S. \n     citizens open a bank account.\n       Sec. 312. Requires a U.S. financial institution that \n     maintains a correspondent account or private banking account \n     for a non-United States person to establish appropriate and, \n     if necessary, enhanced due diligence procedures to detect and \n     report instances of money laundering. Creates a minimum anti-\n     money laundering due diligence standards for U.S. financial \n     institutions that enter into correspondent banking \n     relationships with banks that operate under offshore banking \n     licenses or under banking licenses issued by countries that \n     (a) have been found noncooperative with international counter \n     money laundering principles, or (b) have been the subject of \n     special measures authorized by Sec. 311. Creates minimum \n     anti-money laundering due diligence standards for \n     maintenance of private banking accounts by U.S. financial \n     institutions.\n       Sec. 313. Bars depository institutions and broker-dealers \n     operating in the United States from establishing, \n     maintaining, administering, or managing correspondent \n     accounts for foreign shell banks, other than shell bank \n     vehicles affiliated with recognized and regulated depository \n     institutions.\n       Sec. 314. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue \n     regulations to encourage cooperation among financial \n     institutions, financial regulators and law enforcement \n     officials and to permit the sharing of information by law \n     enforcement and regulatory authorities with such institutions \n     regarding persons reasonably suspected, based on credible \n     evidence, of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering \n     activities. Allows (with notice to the Secretary of the \n     Treasury) the sharing of information among banks involving \n     possible terrorist or money laundering activity.\n       Sec. 315. Expands the list of specified unlawful activities \n     under 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957 to include foreign corruption \n     offenses, certain U.S. export control violations, and misuse \n     of funds of the IMF.\n       Sec. 316. Establishes procedures to protect the rights of \n     persons whose property may be subject to confiscation in the \n     exercise of the government's anti-terrorism authority.\n       Sec. 317. Gives United States courts ``long-arm'' \n     jurisdiction over foreign persons committing money laundering \n     offenses in the United States, over foreign banks opening \n     United States bank accounts, and over foreign persons seizing \n     assets ordered forfeited by a U.S. court.\n       Sec. 318. Expands the definition of financial institution \n     for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957 to include banks \n     operating outside the United States.\n       Sec. 319. Treats amounts deposited by foreign banks in \n     interbank accounts with U.S. banks as having been deposited \n     in the United States for purposes of the forfeiture rules, \n     but grants the Attorney General authority, in the interest of \n     justice and consistent with the United States' national \n     interest, to suspend a forfeiture proceeding based on that \n     presumption. Requires U.S. financial institutions to reply to \n     a request for information from a U.S. regulator relating to \n     anti-money laundering compliance within 120 hours of receipt \n     of such a request. Requires foreign banks that maintain \n     correspondent accounts in the United States to appoint agents \n     for service of process within the United States and \n     authorizes the Attorney General and the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to issue a summons or subpoena to any such foreign \n     bank seeking records, wherever located, relating to such a \n     correspondent account. Requires U.S. banks to sever \n     correspondent arrangements with foreign banks that do not \n     either comply with or contest any such summons or subpoena. \n     Authorizes United States courts to order a convicted criminal \n     to return property located abroad and to order a civil \n     forfeiture defendant to return property located abroad \n     pending trial on the merits. Authorizes United States \n     prosecutors to use a court-appointed Federal receiver to find \n     a criminal defendant's assets, wherever located.\n       Sec. 320. Permits the United States to institute forfeiture \n     proceedings against the proceeds of foreign criminal offenses \n     found in the United States.\n       Sec. 321. Allows the United States to exclude any alien \n     that the Attorney General knows or has reason to believe is \n     or has engaged in or abetted certain money laundering \n     offenses.\n       Sec. 322. Extends the prohibition against the maintenance \n     of a forfeiture proceedings on behalf of a fugitive to \n     include a proceeding by a corporation whose majority \n     shareholder is a fugitive and a proceeding in which the \n     corporation's claim is instituted by a fugitive.\n       Sec. 323. Permits the government to seek a restraining \n     order to preserve the availability of property subject to a \n     foreign forfeiture or confiscation judgment.\n       Sec. 324. Increases from $100,000 to $1,000,000 the maximum \n     civil and criminal penalties for a violation of provisions \n     added to the Bank Secrecy Act by sections 311 and 312 of the \n     Act.\n       Sec. 325. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with the Attorney General, the Federal banking \n     agencies, the SEC, the CFTC and other appropriate agencies to \n     evaluate operation of the provisions of Subtitle A of Title \n     III of the Act and recommend to Congress any relevant \n     legislative action, within 30 months of the date of \n     enactment.\n       Sec. 326. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report \n     annually to the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial \n     Services Committee on measures taken pursuant to Subtitle A \n     of Title III of the Act.\n       Sec. 327. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue \n     regulations concerning the\n\n[[Page S10565]]\n\n     maintenance of concentration accounts by U.S. depository \n     institutions to prevent an institution's customers from \n     anonymously directing funds into or through such accounts.\n       Sec. 328. Provides criminal penalties for officials who \n     violate their trust in connection with the administration of \n     Title III.\n\n\n   Subtitle B. Currency Transaction Reporting Amendments and Related \n                              Improvements\n\n       Sec. 331. Clarifies the terms of the safe harbor from civil \n     liability for financial institutions filing suspicious \n     activity reports pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 5318(g).\n       Sec. 332. Requires financial institutions to establish \n     anti-money laundering programs and grants the Secretary of \n     the Treasury authority to set minimum standards for such \n     programs.\n       Sec. 333. Clarifies that penalties for violation of the \n     Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations also apply \n     to violation of Geographic Targeting Orders issued under 31 \n     U.S.C. 3526, and to certain recordkeeping requirements \n     relating to funds transfers. Otherwise clarifies and updates \n     certain provisions of 31 U.S.C. 5326 relating to Geographic \n     Targeting Orders.\n       Sec. 334. Adds ``money laundering related to terrorist \n     funding'' to the list of subjects to be dealt with in the \n     annual National Money Laundering Strategy prepared by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the ``Money Laundering \n     and Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1998.''\n       Sec. 335. Permits (but does not require) a bank to include \n     information, in a response to a request for an employment \n     reference by a second bank, about the possible involvement of \n     a former institution-affiliated party in potentially unlawful \n     activity, and creates a safe harbor from civil liability for \n     the bank that includes such information in response to an \n     employment reference request, except in the case of malicious \n     intent.\n       Sec. 336. requires the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group to \n     include a privacy advocate among its membership and to \n     operate under certain of the ``sunshine'' provisions of the \n     Federal Advisory Committee Act.\n       Sec. 337. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury and the \n     Federal bank regulatory agencies to submit reports to \n     Congress, one year after the date of enactment, containing \n     recommendations on possible legislation to conform the \n     penalties imposed on depository institutions for violations \n     of the Bank Secrecy Act with penalties imposed on such \n     institutions under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Act.\n       Sec. 338. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, after \n     consultation with the Securities and Exchange Commission and \n     the Federal Reserve Board, to promulgate regulations, within \n     270 days of the date of enactment, requiring broker-dealers \n     to file suspicious activity reports. Also requires the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, the SEC, Federal Reserve Board, \n     and the CFTC to submit jointly to Congress, within one year \n     of the date of enactment, recommendations for effective \n     application of the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 5311-30 to both \n     registered and unregistered investment companies.\n       Sec. 339. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a \n     report to Congress, six months after the date of enactment, \n     on the role of the Internal Revenue Service in the \n     administration of the Bank Secrecy Act, with emphasis on \n     whether IRS Bank Secrecy Act information processing \n     responsibility (for reports filed by all financial \n     institutions) or Bank Secrecy Act audit and examination \n     responsibility (for certain non-bank financial institutions) \n     should be retained or transferred.\n       Sec. 340. Contains amendments to various provisions of the \n     Bank Secrecy Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, and the \n     Fair Credit Reporting Act, to permit information to be used \n     in the conduct of United States intelligence or \n     counterintelligence activities to protect against \n     international terrorism.\n       Sec. 341. Clarifies that the Bank Secrecy Act treats \n     certain underground banking systems as financial \n     institutions, and that the funds transfer recordkeeping rules \n     applicable to licensed money transmitters also apply to such \n     underground systems. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to \n     report to Congress, within one year of the date of enactment, \n     on the need for additional legislation or regulatory controls \n     relating to underground banking systems.\n       Sec. 342. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to \n     instruct the United States Executive Director of each of the \n     international financial institutions (for example, the IMF \n     and the World Bank) to use such Director's ``voice and vote'' \n     to support loans and other use of resources to benefit \n     nations that the President determines to be contributing to \n     United States efforts to combat international terrorism, and \n     to require the auditing of each international financial \n     institution to ensure that funds are not paid to persons \n     engaged in or supporting terrorism.\n\n\n                      subtitle c. currency crimes\n\n       Sec. 351. Creates a new Bank Secrecy Act offense involving \n     the bulk smuggling of more than $10,000 in currency in any \n     conveyance, article of luggage or merchandise or container, \n     either into or out of the United States, and related \n     forfeiture provisions.\n\n\n                  subtitle d. anti-corruption measures\n\n       Sec. 361. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United \n     States should take all steps necessary to identify the \n     proceeds of foreign government corruption that have been \n     deposited in United States financial institutions and return \n     such proceeds to the citizens of the country to whom such \n     assets belong.\n       Sec. 362. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United \n     States must continue actively and publicly to support the \n     objectives of the 29-country Financial Action Task Force \n     Against Money Laundering.\n       Sec. 363. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United \n     States, in its deliberations and negotiations with other \n     countries, should promote international efforts to identify \n     and prevent the transmittal of funds to and from terrorist \n     organizations.\n\n\n                       subtitle e. miscellaneous\n\n       Sec. 371. Expands the SEC's emergency order authority.\n       Sec. 372. Creates uniform protection standards for Federal \n     Reserve facilities.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nBanking Committee, the senior Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes. He \ndid unbelievable work in this committee to pass out a money-laundering \nbill--a very complex and difficult subject. He did it unanimously, I \nbelieve, in a committee that probably has as diverse a membership--that \nis an understatement--as one might find. I compliment him and thank him \nfor his kind words.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I see the chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee here, who wishes to give his opening statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I conferred with Senator Daschle a few \nminutes ago. It is his desire--so there is no misunderstanding of the \nMembers--that a number of opening statements be given: The Senator from \nFlorida, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and we understand \nSenator Stabenow wishes to speak, and there may be a couple of other \nopening statements.\n  As soon as that is done, we are going to turn to Senator Feingold to \noffer the first of his amendments. After that, there will be a vote on \nthe first Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to commend Senators Daschle and \nLott for their leadership in bringing this critical piece of \nlegislation to the Senate just 1 month after the horrific events of \nSeptember 11. Senators Leahy and Hatch also deserve credit for moving \nquickly to shape the judiciary components of this bill and choreograph \nother provisions, including those affecting the intelligence agencies.\n  My remarks will focus on title IX of this legislation, which is \nentitled ``Improved Intelligence,'' as well as the other provisions in \nthe bill that directly affect the mission of the agencies of the \nintelligence community.\n  Title IX is derived from S. 1448, legislation which was developed \nwithin the intelligence community, entitled ``Intelligence to Prevent \nTerrorism Act of 2001.''\n  Since long before September 11, I have been working with members of \nthe committee, particularly Senators Feinstein and Kyl, on \ncomprehensive counterterrorism legislation. Most of the provisions of \nour bill, with some changes requested by the administration, have now \nbecome title IX of S. 1510.\n  The provisions in title IX, as well as other provisions in the bill, \nare designed to accomplish a daunting but not impossible task. That \ntask is to change the cultures within the Federal law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies--primarily the FBI and the CIA--so they work \nseamlessly together for the good of the American people.\n  Both the FBI and the CIA are very good. They are the standards of the \nworld in their own missions. But those missions are very different. The \nFederal Bureau of Investigation is goal oriented. A criminal case has a \nbeginning, a middle, and an end. In a case that has developed the \nguilty party, the end is a conviction for the crime committed. The \ninformation collected during a criminal case is very closely held. It \nis held closely because its purpose is to result in the successful \nprosecution of an event that occurred in the past--not to inform \nthinking about what may happen now or in the future.\n  The Central Intelligence Agency, on the other hand, as well as its \nother companions in the intelligence community, has a global approach, \nliterally\n\n[[Page S10566]]\n\nand figuratively. The CIA is restricted to activities outside the \nUnited States of America. The CIA collects information on a worldwide \nbasis, and it processes that information, analyzes that information, \nand it places it in the hands of its customers. Its customers are other \nFederal agencies and senior policymakers, including the President of \nthe United States. The purpose of that information is to allow those \nsenior policymakers to make more informed decisions.\n  Given the threats we now face, the cultures growing out of these \ndifferent missions must be melded. We cannot fight terrorism by putting \nyellow tape around a bomb site, calling it a crime scene, collecting \nevidence, and proceeding to trial frequently years later. We must put \nthe evidence collected after such an event to work for us in real time \nso we can predict and prevent the next attack. If there is a single \ngoal of the intelligence components of this antiterrorism bill, it is \nto change the focus from responding to acts that have already occurred \nto preventing the acts which threaten the lives of American citizens in \nthis country and abroad.\n  It is critical that all information lawfully available to the Federal \nGovernment be used efficiently and effectively to fight terrorism. We \ncannot continue to use critical information only in a criminal trial. \nAny information collected must be available to intelligence officials \nto inform their operational initiatives so as to prevent the next \nattack.\n\n  Along these lines, several provisions of S. 1510 are designed to \nchange the way information is handled within the Federal Government. \nFor example, section 203 permits law enforcement to share information \ncollected in grand jury proceedings and from title III criminal \nwiretaps with intelligence agencies. Current law, as it has been \ninterpreted, prevents that sharing, except in very limited \ncircumstances.\n  Section 905 then complements section 203 in that it requires law \nenforcement officers, FBI agents, and the Justice Department \nprosecutors to provide foreign intelligence derived in the course of a \ncriminal investigation, including grand juries, criminal wiretaps, FBI \ninterviews, and the like, to the Central Intelligence Agency and to \nother intelligence agencies.\n  A ``permissive'' approach is not good enough under current \ncircumstances. Too many lives have been lost, too many lives are at \nrisk. Law enforcement sharing of information with the intelligence \nagencies must be mandatory.\n  Section 908 further complements this legislation by providing the \ntraining of law enforcement officers at the Federal, State, and local \nagencies so they will be better equipped to recognize foreign \nintelligence information when they see it, and to get it to the right \nplace on a timely basis.\n  Let me give a couple of hypothetical but eerily-close-to-reality \nexamples. It is likely that there are, tonight, grand juries meeting at \nvarious places in the United States to deal with issues related to the \nevents of September 11. Witnesses may be providing information--\ninformation about training camps in Afghanistan, ground warfare \ntechniques used by al-Qaida and the Taliban, the types and quantity of \nweapons available. This type of information will be critical for the \nmilitary--critical for the military now, not 2 years from now when \nthese cases might go to trial.\n  Another example is in the area of wiretaps. Let me just take two \nwiretaps. One has been issued under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act because there was a finding by a Federal judge that \nthere was credible evidence that the telephone was being used by an \nagent of a foreign power.\n  In the course of listening to the wiretap, this conversation comes \nacross: I am planning to fly from a specifically designated site in \nCentral America to a city in Texas. I am going to take my flight a week \nfrom Monday. My intention is, once I arrive over that city, to \ndistribute chemical or biological materials that will terrorize the \npeople of that city by creating havoc due to the illnesses that will be \nprovoked.\n  But how are you going to pay for this? You don't have the money to \nbuy a plane, chemicals, or get the expertise necessary to do that?\n  I am going to do that because I am going to rob a bank next Monday in \norder to get the money that I need to pay for this operation. The bank \nis going to be located at the corner of First and Main, and I am going \nto do it 3 hours after the bank closes next Monday.\n  The person listening to that conversation with a foreign intelligence \nwiretap is under a legal obligation to make known to the appropriate \nlaw enforcement officials that there is about to be a bank robbery at a \nspecific location on a specific date and time in a certain Texas city.\n  Conversely, if that exact conversation had taken place under a \ncriminal wiretap under title 3, the person listening to that \nconversation would be prohibited from telling the foreign intelligence \nagencies that there was about to be a terrorist attack on a date \ncertain against a specific Texas city originating at a specific site in \nCentral America.\n  Try to convince the American people that makes sense. It clearly does \nnot in today's reality. This legislation is going to make the same \nrequirement of mandatory sharing when the information is gathered under \na criminal wiretap that involves foreign intelligence information, as \nis the case today when information gathered under a Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act wiretap must be made available to \nappropriate law enforcement officials.\n  Another provision of title 9 addresses the role of the Director of \nCentral Intelligence in the process of collecting foreign intelligence \nunder the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It recognizes the need \nto target limited resources, including personnel and translators \nagainst the highest priority targets.\n  I ask if I can have an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have about 11 minutes left that has not been committed \nwhich I thought I might use to answer some questions. I give the \nSenator 2 of my 11 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate the Senator's limitations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We just had one Senator ask me for 30 minutes. I am \nlooking at my 11. How can I give him 30? But I will give you 2 of the \n11.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  We have a provision that the Director of Central Intelligence, the \nDCI, will set the overall strategic goals for the collection of foreign \nintelligence so that we can use our limited resources as effectively as \npossible.\n  In order to complement that, we also have a provision that will \nestablish a national virtual translation center as a means of \nincreasing our woefully limited linguistic capabilities to translate \nthe material which we are gathering.\n  We will also provide for additional capability with human \nintelligence. We have become very reliant on technology--eavesdropping, \nsatellite imagery, to the exclusion of the use of human beings. If we \nwant to gain information about the bin Ladens of the world, we cannot \njust take a picture of bin Laden.\n  Today it is increasingly difficult to eavesdrop on bin Laden. What we \nneed to do is get a human being who is able to get close enough to bin \nLaden to learn his intentions and capabilities. This gets to the \ndifficult issue of what kind of assets, human beings, we hire to work \nfor us to gather such information?\n  We would all like to employ the purist of people, all choir boys to \ndo this type of work. Unfortunately, they are not the type of people \nwho are likely to be able to get close to the bin Ladens of the world. \nThus, we have a provision in this legislation in the nature of a sense \nof Congress which we hope will send a strong message to the \nintelligence community that we are encouraging them to overcome some \nprevious messages from Congress and to proceed to recruit the persons \nwho they find to be necessary to gain access to terrorists so that we \ncan have the best opportunity of protecting ourselves.\n  With the adoption of this legislation, we have not reached the end of \nour task or responsibilities to protect the American people. We are \ntaking a substantial step in that direction.\n  To reiterate, another provision of title 9 addresses the role of the \nDirector of Central Intelligence in the process of collecting foreign \nintelligence\n\n[[Page S10567]]\n\nunder the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It recognizes the need \nto target limited resources--e.g. translators--against the highest \npriority targets.\n  In order to ensure that scarce resources are effectively used, the \nDCI--in his role as head of the Intelligence community, not as CIA \nDirector--will set overall strategic goals for FISA collection.\n  He will work with the Attorney General to ensure that FISA \ninformation is distributed to the intelligence operators and analysts \nwho need it government-wide.\n  Of course, the operational targeting and collection using wiretaps \nwill be conducted by the FBI, as it has in the past; the DCI will \nperform no role in those decisions.\n  One of the scarce resources that has plagued the Intelligence \nCommunity, as well as law enforcement, is translation capability.\n  Section 907 of this bill requires the FBI and CIA to work together to \ncreate a ``National Virtual Translation Center.''\n  Such a center would seek to remedy the chronic problem of developing \ncritical language abilities, and matching those resources to \nintelligence collected by the wide range of techniques available.\n  It is not enough to be able to listen to the conversations of \nterrorists and their supporters.\n  Those conversations must be translated, often from difficult \nlanguages such as Urdu, and analyzed, all in a timely fashion.\n  Our intelligence services collect vast amounts of data every day. It \nis possible that we may find that a critical clue to the September 11 \nattacks may have been available, but untranslated, days, weeks, or even \nmonths before the hijackings.\n  We must address this problem before another specific threat is \noverlooked.\n  Finally, I would like to mention a problem that has received a great \ndeal of attention in recent weeks. There has been criticism of the \nintelligence agencies for placing too great a reliance on technical \nintelligence collection--laws dropping, satelite photograph--in recent \nyears at the expense of human sources, or spies.\n  A corollary of this criticism is that CIA officers are to risk-averse \nand that they do not aggressively recruit sources overseas that may \nhave access to terrorist groups because the sources may have engaged in \nhuman rights violations or violent crimes.\n  As to the first problem, the Intelligence authorization bill for \nfiscal year 2002, which may come to the floor next week, provides \ngreater resources for human source recruitment--and it is part of a 5-\nyear plan to beef up this method of collection.\n  With respect to the second problem, we in the Congress simply must \naccept some of the responsibility for creating a risk-averse reaction \nat CIA, if needed there is one.\n  The internal CIA regulations addressing the so-called ``dirty asset'' \nproblem grew out of the criticisms by Congress in the mid-1990s about \nthe recruitment of sources in Guatemala with sordid pasts.\n  We address this issue in S. 1510, section 903, by sending a strong \nmessage to CIA Headquarters and CIA officers overseas that recruitment \nof any person who has access to terrorists or terrorist groups should \nbe of the highest priority.\n  There is no place in times like these for timidity in seeking every \nmethod available to learn the capabilities, plans, and intentions of \nterrorists.\n  Congress needs to send a strong message that we value such efforts to \nrecruit sources on terrorism, even those with pasts we would not \napplaud.\n  Section 903 sends that message.\n  I urge passage of S. 1510.\n  I again commend the Members of the Senate who have played such an \neffective role.\n  I also thank the staff: Al Cumming, Bob Filippone, Vicki Divoll, \nSteven Cash, Bill Duhnke, Paula DeSutter, Jim Hensler, and Jim Barnett.\n  They have been working for the past many months to bring us to the \npoint of this legislation being available for adoption by the Senate \ntonight and for the safety of the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask the distinguished Senator from Utah--I see the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania is here--perhaps after \nthe senior Senator from Utah, and then after the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania speaks, whether it might be possible to go to the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin for the purpose of bringing up his amendments, and we \ncan then debate and vote on them. Will that be agreeable to everybody?\n  Mr. HATCH. It is agreeable.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from Utah, \nand the Senator from Pennsylvania, we go to the Senator from Wisconsin \nfor the purpose of bringing up his amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in my opening remarks, I was remiss in not \nmentioning the tremendous work of the distinguished chairman and vice \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee. They have done a tremendous \namount of work on the intelligence aspect of this bill. As a member of \nthe Intelligence Committee, I express my high regard for the both of \nthem and the work they have done.\n  I also express my regard for my friend from Maryland, Senator \nSarbanes, who came to the Senate with me, for the work he has done on \nthe money-laundering section of this bill. He and Senator Gramm and the \nBanking Committee have done yeoman's service on this, and I hope we are \nable to have that as part of the final bill.\n  I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the great work that has \nbeen done--also, Senator Kyl and so many others. I felt I needed to say \nthat. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry, that I have 30 \nminutes under the unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition and asked for \nthis reservation of time to express my concerns about the record which \nthe Senate is creating so that whatever legislation we pass will pass \nconstitutional muster.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has handed down a series of \ndecisions in the past decade which question the constitutionality and, \nin fact, invalidate acts of Congress because there has been an \ninsufficient record compiled. So I make these statements and review the \nrecord so far with a view to urging my colleagues to create a record in \nthis Chamber, in conference, or wherever that opportunity may present \nitself.\n  In 1989, in the case of Sable v. FCC, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates struck down an act of Congress saying, ``no Congressman or \nSenator purported to present a considered judgment.'' I thought it was \na remarkable statement by the Supreme Court since Congressman Tom \nBliley in the House of Representatives had established a very \ncomprehensive record.\n  The Supreme Court in 1997, in a case captioned Reno v. ACLU, again \ninvalidated an act of Congress noting, ``the lack of legislative \nattention to the statute at issue in Sable suggests another parallel \nwith this case.''\n  It was surprising to me that the Supreme Court of the United States \nwould invalidate an act of Congress on the ground that no Senator or \nCongressman had purported to present a considered judgment, when that \nis the view of the Supreme Court which is contrary to Congress.\n  Under our doctrine of separation of powers, it seemed to me an act of \nCongress should stand unless there is some specific provision in the \nConstitution which warrants invalidating it or for vagueness under the \ndue process clause of the fifth amendment.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, in January of last year, did \nit again in a case captioned Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, a case \nwhich involved the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. There the \nCourt said, ``our examination of the act's legislative record confirms \nthat Congress' 1974 extension of the Act to the States\n\n[[Page S10568]]\n\nwas an unwarranted response to a perhaps inconsequential problem.'' \nAgain, a remarkable holding that the Congress had an unwarranted \nresponse and that it was an inconsequential problem, totally \ncontradicting the judgment of the Congress of the United States.\n  Then the Court went on in the Kimel case to say, ``Congress had no \nreason to believe that broad prophylactic legislation was necessary in \nthis field.''\n  Those are only a few of the cases where the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States has invalidated acts of Congress. There is no doubt there \nis a need for legislation to expand the powers of law enforcement to \nenable us to act against terrorists. My own experience in 8 years on \nthe Intelligence Committee, 2 years of which was as chairman, and my \nwork as chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism have \nconvinced me without a doubt of the scourge of terrorism which we have \nseen many times but never with the intensity which we observed on \nSeptember 11 of this year.\n  The act of Congress in expanding law enforcement has to be very \ncarefully calibrated to protect civil liberties and be in accordance \nwith the Constitution of the United States. Attorney General Ashcroft \nmet with a number of us on Wednesday, September 19, just 8 days after \nthe incident of September 11, and asked that we enact legislation by \nthe end of the week. My response at that time was I thought it could \nnot be done in that time frame, but I thought we could hold hearings in \nthe remainder of that week, perhaps on Thursday the 20th, or Friday the \n21st, or Saturday the 22nd, to move ahead, understanding the import of \nthe administration's bill, and legislate to give them what they needed, \nconsistent with civil rights.\n\n  The Judiciary Committee then held a hearing on September 25 where the \nAttorney General testified for about an hour and 20 minutes. At that \ntime, as that record will show, only a few Senators were able to ask \nquestions. In fact, the questioning ended after my turn came, and most \nof the Judiciary Committee did not have a chance to raise questions.\n  On September 26, the following day, I wrote to the chairman of the \ncommittee saying:\n  I write to urge that our Judiciary Committee proceed promptly with \nthe Attorney General's terrorism package with a view to mark up the \nbill early next week so the full Senate can consider it and hopefully \nact upon it by the end of the week. I am concerned that some further \nact of terrorism may occur which could be attributed to our failure to \nact promptly.\n  I then found out on October 3 that the Subcommittee on the \nConstitution was having a hearing. By chance, I heard about it in the \ncorridors. Although we were having a hearing with Health and Human \nServices Secretary Thompson on bioterrorism, I absented myself from the \nbioterrorism hearing and went down the hall to the Judiciary \nsubcommittee hearing and participated there and expressed many of the \nreservations and concerns I am commenting about today.\n  On that date, I again wrote to Senator Leahy. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full text of my letter to him and the full text of his reply \nto me of October 9 be printed in the Record at the conclusion of these \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. I quote only from the first sentence of Senator Leahy's \nresponse to me:\n  I thank you for your letters of September 26 and October 3 and for \nyour participation in the September 25 hearing regarding antiterrorism \nlegislation. On October 3, you wrote that you were concerned about the \nlack of hearings. I share that concern and have tried to notice prompt \nhearings on a number of aspects of the legislative proposals at the \nearliest possible time.\n  On this state of the record, which I hope can yet be perfected, I am \nconcerned about our meeting the standards of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States for a sufficient deliberative process.\n  When Attorney General Ashcroft appeared before the Judiciary \nCommittee on September 25, he said the only detention he wanted on \naliens was those who were subject to deportation proceedings. I then \npointed out, as the record will show, that the legislation submitted by \nthe Attorney General was much broader and did not limit detention \nsimply or exclusively to those who were subject to deportation \nproceedings. So my comment was that it was necessary to analyze the \nbill very carefully, not do it hurriedly, and give the Attorney General \nof the Department of Justice what he needed, consistent with \nconstitutional rights.\n  The other issue which I had an opportunity to raise in the very brief \nperiod of time I had--some 5 minutes--involved modifications to the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, where the issue was to change \nthe law from ``the purpose,'' being the gathering of intelligence, to \n``a purpose.'' Ultimately the legislation has been modified to read ``a \nsignificant purpose.''\n  At that hearing, the Attorney General said he did not look to obtain \ncontent from electronic surveillance unless probable cause was \nestablished. But in the draft bill, which the Department of Justice had \nsubmitted at that time, that was not what the bill provided. So that on \nthis state of the record, I think the Congress has some work to do, \ntonight in conference or perhaps by other means, to see to it we have a \nrecord which will withstand constitutional scrutiny.\n  On our Judiciary Committee, we have many Members who have expertise \nin this field. This bill, as the Record will show, was negotiated by \nthe chairman and ranking member with the Department of Justice, with \nthe participation of the committee only to the extent of the hearing of \nthe full committee on September 25 and the subcommittee on October 3.\n  We have on our Judiciary Committee a number of Members who have had \nexperience as prosecuting attorneys. We have a number of lawyers who \nare learned in law. We have other Members who have extensive experience \non the Judiciary Committee and a great deal of common sense which may \ntop some of us who have prosecutorial experience or extended experience \nwith probable cause and search warrants or surveillance of some sort or \nanother.\n  I express these concerns so whatever can be done by the Congress will \nbe done to meet the constitutional standards.\n  How much of the 15 minutes have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 37 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 2001.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pat: I write to urge that our Judiciary Committee \n     proceed promptly with the Attorney General's terrorism \n     package with the view to mark up the bill early next week so \n     the full Senate can consider it and hopefully act upon it by \n     the end of next week.\n       I am concerned that some further act of terrorism may occur \n     which could be attributed to our failure to act promptly.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 2001.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am very much concerned about the \n     delay in acting on the anti-terrorism legislation and also \n     about the absence of hearings to establish a record for the \n     legislative package.\n       In recent decisions, the Supreme Court of the United States \n     has declared acts of Congress unconstitutional when there has \n     been an insufficient record or deliberative process to \n     justify the legislation.\n       On the anti-terrorism legislation, perhaps more than any \n     other, the Court engages in balancing the needs of law \n     enforcement with the civil rights issues so that it is \n     necessary to have the specification of the problems to \n     warrant broadening police power.\n       In my judgment, there is no substitute for the hearings, \n     perhaps in closed session, to deal with these issues.\n       As you know, I have been pressing for hearings. I am now \n     informed that Senator Hatch has convened a meeting of all \n     Republican senators to, in effect, tell us what is in a \n     proposed bill where Judiciary Committee members have had no \n     input.\n       We could still have meaningful hearings this week and get \n     this bill ready for prompt floor action.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n[[Page S10569]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2001.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     711 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Arlen, I thank you for your letters of September 26, \n     2001 and October 3, 2001 and for your participation in the \n     September 25, 2001 hearing regarding anti-terrorism \n     legislation. On October 3, 2001, you wrote that you were \n     concerned about the lack of hearings. I share that concern \n     and have tried to notice prompt hearings on a number of \n     aspects of the legislation proposals at the earliest possible \n     time.\n       As you know, the Attorney General consented to appear at \n     our September 25, 2001 hearing for only an hour and we had to \n     prevail upon him to stay a few extra minutes so that Senator \n     Feinstein and you could have a brief opportunity to ask the \n     Attorney General a single question. I invited him to rejoin \n     us the following Tuesday to complete the hearing and I \n     continue to extend such invitations, but he has not accepted \n     any of my follow up invitations. In addition, although \n     Members of the Committee submitted questions in writing to \n     the Attorney General following the September 25, 2001 \n     hearing, they have yet to be answered. I agree with you that \n     these are important matters that justify a more thorough \n     record than we have been able to establish.\n       Last week, Senator Feingold chaired an important hearing on \n     civil liberties concerns before the Constitution \n     Subcommittee. This week Senators Schumer, Feinstein and \n     Durbin each are working to organize hearings on these matters \n     and Senators Kennedy and Biden are working on possible \n     hearings next week.\n       At the same time, we have continued to work nonstop to \n     prepare for Senate action on legislative proposals. We \n     suffered a setback last week when after weeks of intensive \n     negotiations the White House reneged on agreements reached on \n     Sunday, September 30, 2001, and we had to spend much of last \n     week renegotiating a legislative package. Finally, last \n     Thursday S. 1510 was introduced by the Majority Leader, the \n     Republican Leader, the Chairmen of the Judiciary, Banking and \n     Select Intelligence Committees and by Senators Hatch and \n     Shelby as Ranking Members. I am seeking to work closely with \n     the Senate leadership to be prepared to proceed to that \n     legislation at the earliest opportunity. The House is on a \n     similar track and may well consider its version of \n     legislation later this week, as well.\n       You and I both know that no legislation can guarantee \n     against future terrorist attacks. Nonetheless, I have \n     expedited work on anti-terrorism legislation, within which \n     the Administration has insisted on including general criminal \n     law measures not limited to terrorism, in order to allow the \n     Senate to act promptly in response to the unprecedented \n     attacks of September 11, 2001.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is \nwilling to have the distinguished Senator from Michigan recognized for \n5 minutes. I ask unanimous consent she be allowed to proceed preceding \nthe Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank our distinguished chairman and my friend from \nWisconsin for allowing me to proceed before he presents his amendments.\n  I rise this evening to congratulate all involved in this effort. As \nhas been said on so many occasions, it is not perfect but we have come \ntogether with a very positive, important step forward that we can all \ncelebrate this evening on a bipartisan basis.\n  As the Senator from Michigan, along with my colleague, Senator Levin, \nwe certainly celebrate the efforts along the northern border and the \nimportant authorizations for dollars that allow us to continue to \nprotect and strengthen the efforts at the border. I thank my chairman \nof the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, for his efforts to put into \nthis important bill language dealing with the critical issue of money \nlaundering which essentially allows us to follow the money.\n  My colleague, Senator Levin, has been extremely involved in helping \nto lead efforts to lay out the case for this. Senator Kerry and Senator \nGrassley have been involved in important work. I thank them.\n  The antiterrorism bill before the Senate takes a significant step \nforward in cutting the flow of terrorist money. As the President has \nrepeatedly said, stopping the flow of money is key to stopping \nterrorism. That is what we are doing this evening. In particular, we \nare establishing important new responsibilities, both for our \nGovernment and for our financial institutions. The bill authorizes the \nTreasury Secretary to take special measures to stop suspected money-\nlaundering activities. This anti-money-laundering language is \nsignificant because it requires financial institutions to set up their \nown due diligence to combat money laundering, particularly for private \nand corresponding banking situations. This is a key provision of which \nI was proud to be a part. I am pleased we were able to come up with \nlanguage that allows that.\n\n  Another important provision I was pleased to offer in the Banking \nCommittee, which is now part of the bill, was clear authority for the \nTreasury Secretary to issue regulations to crack down on abuses related \nto concentration accounts. These accounts are administrative accounts \nused by financial institutions to combine funds from multiple \ncustomers, various transactions. They do not require any identification \nor accountability of who is involved or how much money we are talking \nabout.\n  The amendment I advocated urges the Treasury Secretary to issue \nregulations ensuring these concentration accounts identify by client \nname all of the client funds moving through the account to prevent \nanonymous movement of the funds that might facilitate money laundering. \nThis is a classic case of why this is so important: Raul Salinas, \nbrother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas, transferred almost \n$100 million to Citibank administrative accounts in New York and London \nwithout any documentation indicating the ownership of these funds. The \nwire transfers sent the funds to Citibank and asked each transfer be \nbrought to the attention of a specific private banker. Later, the \nprivate banker transferred the funds to private accounts controlled by \nMr. Salinas. The origin of this money--$100 million--was never \nsatisfactorily identified.\n  Allegations of drug money or other corporate sources persist to this \nday. We know, through Senator Levin's exhaustive documentation at his \nhearings, that other private banks use this practice as well. Although \nfinancial regulators have cautioned against this practice over and over \nagain, they have not yet issued regulations to stop this loophole. That \nis why the language in this bill is so important.\n  The use of these anonymous concentration accounts breaks the audit \ntrail associating specific funds with specific clients. Again, the \ngoal, as the President said, is to follow the money. We have to have \ninformation if we are going to follow the money.\n  It should now be abundantly clear to Treasury that they have the \nauthority to stop this practice. I hope it is also abundantly clear it \nis a serious problem. I am very concerned that the administration act \nquickly on these anonymous accounts.\n  I congratulate everyone involved in this effort. I think the effort \nregarding the anti-money-laundering language is a critical part of \nmaking sure we have an effective antiterrorism bill. I thank my \ncolleagues for their work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Michigan has \nexpired. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will give a brief statement before I \nstart my amendments, and I ask unanimous consent the time be equally \ndivided amongst the time I have on each of my four amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, 1 month ago, we all were viciously \nattacked. I am pleased and grateful that both the domestic and \ninternational effort to respond to these attacks is fully underway. As \nwe recall, almost as soon as the attacks of September 11 ended, our \npublic discussion turned to two issues: how the United States will \nrespond to these terrorist acts and how we can protect ourselves \nagainst future attacks.\n  Almost immediately, discussion of that second issue raised the \nquestion of how our efforts to prevent terrorism will affect the civil \nliberties enjoyed by all Americans as part of our constitutional \nbirthright.\n  I was encouraged by many of the reactions that our leaders and \nMembers of this body had, but especially encouraged by the words of our \ncolleague, Senator George Allen of Virginia who represents one of the \nStates struck by\n\n[[Page S10570]]\n\nterrorism. On the day after the attacks he said:\n\n       We must make sure that as we learn the facts, we do not \n     allow these attacks to succeed in tempting us in any way to \n     diminish what makes us a great nation. And what makes us a \n     great nation is that this is a country that understands that \n     people have God-given rights and liberties. And we cannot--in \n     our efforts to bring justice--diminish those liberties.\n\n  I agree with Senator Allen. I believe that one of the most important \nduties of this Congress is in responding to the terrible events of \nSeptember 11, in order to protect our civil liberties, which, of \ncourse, derive from our Constitution. That is why I am pleased that we \ndid not take the Attorney General's advice to enact an anti-terrorism \nbill immediately without any deliberation or negotiation. I commend \nSenator Leahy for all his efforts to improve this bill. It is certainly \na better and more comprehensive bill than the one the administration \noriginally proposed. I think even the administration recognizes that.\n\n  But I still believe we needed a more deliberative process on this \nbill, and more careful consideration of the civil liberties implication \nof it. I held a hearing in the Constitution Subcommittee at which many \nserious and substantive concerns about the bill were raised by \ncommentators and experts from both sides of the political spectrum.\n  As the chairman of the subcommittee, I took many of those concerns \nvery seriously. That is why I would not consent on Tuesday night to \nbringing up this bill and passing it without any amendments being \nconsidered. I am pleased that we were able to reach agreement on a \nprocess that will allow some of my concerns with this bill to be \ndebated and voted on through the amendment process.\n  That is not to say that no measures to strengthen law enforcement \nshould be enacted. They should be. We need to do it. We need to do some \nvery serious updating of a number of these laws. This bill does many \nthings to assist the Department of Justice in its mission to catch \nthose who helped the terrorists and prevent future attacks. We can and \nwe will give the FBI new and better tools. But we must also make sure \nthat the new tools don't become instruments of abuse.\n  There is no doubt that if we lived in a police state, it would be \neasier to catch terrorists. If we lived in a country where the police \nwere allowed to search your home at any time for any reason; if we \nlived in a country where the government was entitled to open your mail, \neavesdrop on your phone conversations, or intercept your email \ncommunications; if we lived in a country where people could be held in \njail indefinitely based on what they write or think, or based on mere \nsuspicion that they were up to no good, the government would probably \ndiscover and arrest more terrorists, or would be terrorists, just as it \nwould find more lawbreakers generally. But that would not be a country \nin which we would want to live, and it would not be a country for which \nwe could, in good conscience, ask our young people to fight and die. In \nshort, that country would not be America.\n  I think it is important to remember that the Constitution was written \nin 1789 by men who had recently won the Revolutionary War. They did not \nlive in comfortable and easy times of hypothetical enemies. They wrote \nthe Constitution and the Bill of Rights to protect individual liberties \nin times of war as well as in times of peace.\n  There have been periods in our nation's history when civil liberties \nhave taken a back seat to what appeared at the time to be the \nlegitimate exigencies of war. Our national consciousness still bears \nthe stain and the scars of those events: The Alien and Sedition Acts, \nthe suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War, the internment of \nJapanese-Americans during World War II and the injustices perpetrated \nagainst German-Americans and Italian-Americans, the blacklisting of \nsupposed communist sympathizers during the McCarthy era, and the \nsurveillance and harassment of antiwar protesters, including Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., during the Vietnam war. We must not allow this piece \nof our past to become prologue.\n  Preserving our freedom is the reason we are now engaged in this new \nwar on terrorism. We will lose that war without a shot being fired if \nwe sacrifice the liberties of the American people in the belief that by \ndoing so we will stop the terrorists.\n  That is why this exercise of considering the administration's \nproposed legislation and fine tuning it to minimize the infringement of \ncivil liberties is so necessary and so important. And this is a job \nthat only the Congress can do. We cannot simply rely on the Supreme \nCourt to protect us from laws that sacrifice our freedoms. We took an \noath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. In \nthese difficult times that oath becomes all the more significant.\n  There are quite a number of things in this bill that I am concerned \nabout, but my amendments focus on a small discreet number of items.\n  At this point, I would like to turn to one of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1899\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1899.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make amendments to the provisions relating to interception \n                 of computer trespasser communications)\n\n       On page 42, line 25, insert ``or other'' after \n     ``contractual''.\n       On page 43, line 2, strike ``for'' and insert \n     ``permitting''.\n       On page 43, line 8, insert ``transmitted to, through, or \n     from the protected computer'' after ``computer trespasser''.\n       On page 43, line 20, insert ``does not last for more than \n     96 hours and'' after ``such interception''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask this time now be charged to the first amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The time will be charged.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this amendment simply clarifies the \nprovision in the bill dealing with computer trespass, section 217, so \nthat it more accurately reflects the intent of the provision, as \nfrequently expressed by the administration. Section 217 is designed, we \nhave been told, to permit law enforcement to assist computer owners who \nare subject to denial of service attacks or other episodes of hacking. \nAs currently drafted, however, this provision could allow universities, \nlibraries, and employers to permit government surveillance of people \nwho are permitted to use the computer facilities of those entities. \nSuch surveillance would take place without a judicial order or probable \ncause to believe that a crime is being committed. Under the bill, \nanyone accessing a computer ``without authorization'' is deemed to have \nno privacy rights whatsoever, with no time limit, for as long as they \nare accessing the computer at issue. Basically, the way I read this, \nthis provision completely eliminates fourth amendment protection for a \npotentially very large set of electronic communications.\n  The danger that this amendment tries to address is that ``accessing a \ncomputer without authorization'' could be interpreted to mean a minor \ntransgression of an office or library computer use policy. Let's take \nan example. A working mom uses an office computer to purchase Christmas \npresents on the Internet. Company policy prohibits personal use of \noffice computers. This person has potentially accessed a computer \nwithout authorization and her company could give permission to law \nenforcement to review all of the e-mails that she sends or receives at \nwork, monitor all the instant messages she sends, and record every \nwebsite she visits: No warrant, no probable cause, no fourth amendment \nrights at all. My amendment makes clear that a computer trespasser is \nnot someone who is permitted to use a computer by the owner or operator \nof that computer.\n  This amendment also limits the length of this unreviewed surveillance \nto 96 hours, which is a longer time frame than that placed on other \nemergency wiretap authorities. Again, if\n\n[[Page S10571]]\n\nthis provision is aimed solely at responding to cyber-attacks, there is \nno need to continue such surveillance beyond 96 hours--which is the \ntime we put in our amendment--because that time is sufficient to allow \nthe government to obtain a warrant to continue the surveillance. It is \nnot as if they cannot continue it, they simply have to get a warrant \nafter 4 days. Warrants based on probable cause are still the \nconstitutionally preferred method for conducting surveillance in \nAmerica. The need for immediate and emergency assistance during a \ndenial of service attack or hacking episode, which I certainly think is \na legitimate concern, cannot justify continued surveillance without \njudicial supervision.\n\n  Finally, this amendment prevents law enforcement from abusing this \nauthority in investigations unrelated to the actual computer trespass. \nThe current provision potentially allows law enforcement to intercept \nwire and electronic communications in many investigations where they \nmay not want, or be able, to secure a court order. If the government \nsuspects a person of committing a crime but does not have probable \ncause to justify monitoring of the suspect's work computer, it could \npressure the owner or operator of the computer to find some \ntransgression in the suspect's computer use, allowing the government \ncarte blanche access to email and internet activity of the suspect. I \nsuspect that few small business owners will be anxious to stand up to \nfederal law enforcement requests for this information.\n  Now the administration was apparently willing to add language to deal \nwith employees using office computers, but it refused to recognize that \nin our society many people use computers that they do not own, with \npermission, but without a contractual relationship. People who don't \nown their own home computers use computers at libraries. Students use \ncomputers at school in computer labs or student centers. Without my \namendment, these innocent users could become subject to intrusive \ngovernment surveillance merely because they disobeyed a rule of the \nowner of the computer concerning its use. I have been told that this is \nnot the administration's intent, but they would not fix this provision. \nSo I think it is fair to ask why. Why does the administration insist on \nleaving open the possibility that this provision will be abused to \nentirely eliminate the privacy of students' and library patrons' \ncomputer communications? Is there a hidden agenda here? I sincerely \nhope not, but I was very disappointed in the administration's \nunwillingness to address this concern. I remain willing to negotiate on \nthis amendment, but if there is no further movement on it, I hope my \ncolleagues will recognize that this amendment will leave the publicly \nexpressed purpose of the computer trespass provision untouched and fix \na potentially disastrous case of overbreadth.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining on \nmy side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen and one-half minutes on this \namendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to support my colleague, \nSenator Feingold, and his amendment to section 217. I think the Senator \nhas done a tremendous job in outlining the issues related to this bill \nand the fact that haste can sometimes make waste. Haste in some \ninstances on very well crafted language to uphold our rights under the \nConstitution can be infringed upon.\n  Section 217 is intended to allow computer system owners and operators \nto fully engage Federal law enforcement where someone hacks or intrudes \ninto their system. As Senator Feingold mentioned, that could be a \nbusiness owner, or it could be a library system, or it could be a \nuniversity system.\n  Unfortunately, as drafted, there are few limits on what \ncommunications the Government could intercept without showing probable \ncause that a crime has been committed and without having the \nopportunity for judicial review of those intercepts.\n  The provisions do not even limit the scope of the surveillance. Once \nauthorized, the Government could intercept all communications of a \nperson who is allegedly a trespasser. Again, let me be clear: Without \nmeeting the fourth amendment requirement to show probable cause.\n  Further, there is no time limit on the surveillance under the \nprovision of this legislation. For those who may be reviewing this \nlegislation for the first time, and understanding that as they go to \ntheir workplace, or as they go to their educational institution, or as \nthey go to their library to enhance their education, they could be \nunder surveillance for a very long and indefinite period of time \nwithout their knowledge.\n  Thus, once authorized by a computer system operator, the Government \ncould intercept all communications of a person forever without a proper \nsearch warrant. Even a court order wiretap expires after 30 days.\n\n  This amendment would remedy some of the defects in this bill. It \nwould do that by requiring that the surveillance be only of \ncommunications associated with the trespass and that the length of the \nsurveillance be limited to 96 hours, which, by the way, is twice as \nlong as the time limit placed on emergency wiretap authority. If the \nproblem continues, investigators could easily obtain additional warrant \ntime for the surveillance to continue.\n  This is a very important time in our country's history. It is a time \nin which we want to act in unity and support the administration. It is \na time in which we want to act to give law enforcement the tools they \nneed to apprehend those who have been responsible and may be \nresponsible for future acts of terrorism. But we also must preserve the \nright of citizens of this country when it comes to the fourth \namendment.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Feingold amendment. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, first, I want to say how important it \nis to have on the committee the Senator with expertise in this area as \nwell as her own background. I appreciate very much her help on this \nmatter.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, my colleague from Washington I think \nspeaks within a framework of expertise that she brings to this \nparticular amendment. I speak from the framework of a layperson who has \nbeen trying to understand this bill's pluses and minuses.\n  I say to Senator Feingold and all colleagues, since I think there is \nkind of a rush to table all of the Feingold amendments, that this \namendment is eminently reasonable. The Senator from Wisconsin is \nsaying: Let's put a time limit on this. That is good. Let's have some \njudicial oversight. That is good as well.\n  There are international terrorists who have killed many Americans and \nwant to kill more Americans. There are a lot of provisions in this bill \nwhich I think are right on the money, including northern border \nprotection which is relevant to the Chair, relevant to the Senator from \nWashington, and certainly relevant to the people I represent. But I \nalso think there is no reason, in this rush to pass the bill, that we \ncan't make some changes. These are minor changes the Senator wants to \nmake. This just gives this piece of legislation more balance.\n  I will say this: There is a lot that is good in this bill and a lot \nthat is attractive to me as a Senator. When you add some of the \nadditional security provisions that help all the people we are asked to \nrepresent in addition to the benefits--the financial help to all of the \nrescue workers and all of the innocent people's families, people have \nbeen murdered--there is much in this\n\n[[Page S10572]]\n\nbill that is commendable. The Senator from Wisconsin is just trying to \ngive it more balance.\n  I say to my colleagues that I hope you will support this amendment. I \nwant to say one other thing as well. I really believe what is good \nabout this bill is the provisions that focus on the people whom the \nterrorists are basically trying to kill--Americans. What is not as good \nis when the reach of the bill goes too far beyond that and is too \nbroad.\n  The sunset provision that passed in the House is so important, so \nthat we can continue to monitor this legislation as we move forward.\n  I think this amendment that the Senator from Wisconsin has submitted \nis a step to give this piece of legislation a little more balance, and \nit will be more vigilant of people's civil liberties. I think it is the \nright step.\n  I thank the Senator for his amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his help, \nespecially for making this point: All this amendment is about is making \nsure that it is about the problem we face with the terrorism that is \nthreatening our country and our freedoms. That is all we are trying to \ndo--make sure it doesn't go broadly into people's rights, and into \ntheir privacy, and into their own lives.\n  At this point, I am simply going to reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, let me talk a little bit about the \nprovision of today's legislation that has been referred to as the \n``computer trespasser'' exception.\n  This provision is a perfect example of how our laws dealing with \nelectronic surveillance have become outdated, and nonsensical as \napplied to modern technology.\n  Imagine the following scenario. A terrorist decides to wreak havoc in \na major U.S. city by shutting down an electrical power grid. He uses a \ncomputer to hack into the mainframe computer of a regional utility \ncompany, which he plans to use to bring down the power grid. Before the \nterrorist can accomplish his goal, the utility company recognizes that \nan intruder is attempting to access their computer. The company quickly \ncalls the FBI for assistance in repelling the intruder.\n  Guess what? Under current law, even with the permission from the \nutility company, the FBI is not permitted to monitor the terrorist's \nactivity on the utility company's computer, because current law \nperversely grants the terrorist privacy rights with respect to his \ncommunications on the computer he has invaded.\n  It is as if police could not investigate a burglary, even when \ninvited into the house by the victim of the burglary, because the \nburglar had established privacy rights inside the home he has invaded.\n  It is anomalies such as this, in our current laws regarding \nelectronic surveillance, that today's legislation is designed to fix.\n  As it stands, the computer trespasser provision is defined in such a \nway that the owner or operator of a computer network cannot arbitrarily \ndeclare the user of the network at trespasser, and then invite law \nenforcement in to monitor that user's communications.\n  The provision, as written, provides that a person is not considered a \ncomputer trespasser if the person has an ``existing contractual'' \nrelationship for access to all or part of the computer network.\n  Senator Feingold's amendment would broadly amend the negotiated \nexception, including within its scope anyone with a contractual or \n``other'' relationship to the owner or operator of a computer network. \nWhat is meant by ``other'' relationship? Any hacker could make the \nargument that they have a relationship with a computer operator. \nIndeed, were I a defense counsel, I would argue that the mere fact that \nthe hacker has accessed the computer has created some form of \nrelationship. Clearly, the proposed amendment would broadly and \nunwisely give immunity from our cyber-crime laws. This amendment \ncreates an exception to the criminal laws and puts law enforcement back \nin the same position they currently are--that is, powerless to \ninvestigate hacking incidents where the owner of the computer network \nwants the assistance of law enforcement.\n  Madam President, we should not tie the hands of our law enforcement \nto assist the owners of our computer networks. We should not help \nhackers and cyberterrorists to get away.\n  If you are a victim of a burglary, shouldn't you have the right to \nask the police to investigate your house, to come to your house and \ninvestigate?\n  Why should the owners of the computer not have the right to ask the \npolice to investigate a commuter-hacking incident, especially where it \nappears it is terrorist oriented?\n  This act applies, as written, only to people without authorization to \nbe on the computer. Why should the law protect people who have invaded \na computer they have no right to be on?\n  Let me say one last comment about this. The proponents of this \namendment argue it will apply to students using a university computer. \nThat is true, but only if such students use that university computer to \nhack into a place where they do not belong.\n  Either we have to get serious in this modern society, with these \nmodern computers, about terrorism or we have to ignore it. I, for one, \nam not for ignoring it. I believe we need to have this language in \nhere--so does the Justice Department; so does the White House and the \nWhite House Counsel's Office--in order to do what cannot be done today \nto protect people in our society, and to protect our powerplants, our \ndams, and so many important facilities in our society that are \nvulnerable to cyber-terrorists. This law, the way it is currently \nwritten, will help to do that.\n  That is all I care to say about it. But I believe we should vote down \nthe Senator's amendment. I know it is well intentioned. I have great \nrespect for the Senator from Wisconsin. He is one of the very diligent \nmembers of our committee, and I appreciate him very much, but on this \namendment I believe we have to keep the language of the bill the way it \nis written in order to give our law enforcement people the tools to be \nable to stop terrorist hacking into computers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank my friend for his kind words.\n  Madam President, in response to the points he made, first, let me \nrespond that I accept the premise of this basic provision in terms of \nupdating the ability to get at computer hackers. That is an update. We \ndid not know what this was a few years ago. We did not know what risks \nit posed. Nobody opposes that very important part of this bill.\n  But what the Senator claims is that the phrase ``contractual \nrelationship'' somehow makes sure that people are protected from being \nsubject to this who really should not be subject to this; but it does \nit.\n  I can think of at least three categories of people who do not come \nwithin the category of ``contractual relationship.'' One is in the \ncontext employment. It is nice if you have a contract, but a lot of \nemployees do not. They do not fall within the protection of a \ncontractual relationship.\n  The same goes for people who would go and use a computer at a \nlibrary. They do not have a contractual relationship to protect them in \nthis situation.\n  And finally, as the Senator conceded here, in his last example, that \ncertainly students, students at all our universities across the \ncountry, are not protected by that language. And that is all we want to \ndo, to make it clear that this amendment is related to the problem of \ncomputer hackers, not moms who might be buying Christmas presents on a \ncomputer at work, even though they are not supposed to, or students who \nmaybe are gambling on a university computer. Of course they should not \ndo that, but should that subject them to extraordinary, unprecedented \nintrusion by Government law enforcement authority? Of course not.\n  The Senator attempts to suggest that the provision in here having to \ndo with our desire to have the language say ``contractual'' or \n``other'' relationship would somehow allow a hacker to claim that he is \nprotected. The notion that a hacker would be considered as somebody who \nhas a relationship with the company under this amendment is an absurd \ninterpretation of the amendment's intent, so that clearly is not what \nthis amendment would do.\n  And finally, let me get back to the students, the example the Senator\n\n[[Page S10573]]\n\nfrom Utah mentioned. It is simply an unprecedented intrusion into \nindividual rights for a university to be able to allow--because of a \nminor use that is not within university rules--that person to be \ncompletely subject to this kind of intrusion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have followed this debate closely. I commend the \nSenator for the hearing he had on the constitutional rights part of \nthis debate. But I want to make sure I understand exactly what his \namendment sets out to do.\n  Is my understanding correct that under the Feingold amendment there \ncould be surveillance of a computer for 96 hours before there is any \ncourt approval, so that in the example given by the Senator from Utah, \nthe law enforcement authorities could, in fact, monitor the \ncommunications of someone using this computer for 96 hours before ever \ngoing to a court and asking for a warrant for that search?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is correct. And that even troubles me for the \nlength of time that it is allowed--but it is far better than an \ninfinite position. Law Enforcement should be required to seek a warrant \nas soon as possible, within reason, given the fact that what the \namendment tries to get at is emergency situations involving hackers. As \nsoon as possible, they should have to meet the standards that are \nnormally met.\n  But, yes, the amendment does permit that, in my view, rather \nextraordinary period of time before the requirement would have to be \nmade.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And that period of time, I ask the Senator from \nWisconsin, is roughly twice the amount currently given under emergency \nwiretap authority; is that correct?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. One last question. I want to try to understand. I ask the \nSenator do you not say, in your amendment, that a trespasser does not \ninclude someone who is permitted to use a computer by the owner or \noperator of the computer?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And the difference, of course, is whether it is a \ncontractual relationship or just a permission to use; you are including \npermission to use as well as contractual relationship?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The examples you have given are of people going to a \nlibrary, who may not have a contractual relationship with the library \nbut use the computer, who would be subjected to this warrantless search \nof their computer communications for an indefinite period of time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is right, exactly. This is exactly the problem. \nAll we asked of the committee and of the administration yesterday was \nto make it clear that they did not want to reach these people. That is \nwhat we have been told. The purpose of this is to get at the threat of \ncomputer hackers.\n  The Senator from Illinois has just illustrated, with those examples--\nand he is, of course, correct--that this could be interpreted and could \nbe understood to include situations that not only have nothing to do \nwith the problem but represent a very serious departure from the \nindividual rights people should have in our country.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Illinois and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have been concerned about the scope of \nthe amendment carving an exception to the wiretap statute for so-called \n``computer trespassers.'' This covers anyone who accesses a computer \n``without authorization'' and could allow government eavesdropping, \nwithout a court order or other safeguards in the wiretap statute, or \nInternet users who violate workplace computer use rules or online \nservice rules.\n  I was unable to reach agreement with the administration on limiting \nthe scope of this amendment, and the Feingold amendment makes further \nrefinements. It is unfortunate that the administration did not accept \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 4 minutes 47 \nseconds; the managers have 9 minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to yield back whatever time we have, if it \nis all right with the distinguished Senator from Vermont, with the \nunderstanding that we are just trying to stop unauthorized hacking that \ncould be done by terrorists and others who are criminals that currently \ncannot be stopped. I am prepared to yield back the time, if the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask the chairman of the committee, \nafter listening to the presentation by the Senator from Wisconsin, what \nis the chairman's view of the incursion on law enforcement by the \nlimitation of 96 hours?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The incursion of law enforcement by the 96 hours?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The principal thrust of what the Senator from Wisconsin \nseeks to do is to broaden the definition of a contractual relationship \nto someone who may otherwise have permission. What I am trying to do is \nto understand the administration's position, the law enforcement \nposition as to how law enforcement is adversely impacted by what the \nSenator from Wisconsin seeks to do.\n  My concern, as expressed earlier, is that, especially in the face of \nthe challenge by the amendment, this is a complicated bill.\n  The reality is, it is hard to know all of it without the normal \nhearing process. Now we have a specific challenge. What I would like to \nknow is, how does it inhibit law enforcement? What about the broader \ndefinition gives problems to law enforcement? And then, what is the \ndifficulty in having 96 hours, which is 4 days, to see what is going on \nto find some basis for seeking a warrant with probable cause?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Frankly, I don't have a problem with the Feingold \namendment as it is written. I do have a problem, however, with keeping \na bill together. The initial administration request had no limitations \nwhatsoever. It was so wide open we were concerned that someone who \nmight be using a computer at work to add up their accounts for the \nmonth would be trapped by this because the company said you couldn't \nuse the computer to add up your checking account, for example, to use a \nfarfetched example, because they would be accessing the computer \nwithout authorization and the Government could just step in and go \nforward.\n\n  The administration moved partly our way. We actually ended up with a \ncompromise on this. I suspect what they would say to the Senator from \nPennsylvania is that these attacks last more than 96 hours and that \nthey would be unable to go after them if they were limited to the 96 \nhours.\n  We saw this recently 2 or 3 weeks ago where we had a continuous \nroving attack on a number of Government computers. As I recall--I \ndidn't pay that much attention at the time--they were attacking them \none week and when we came back the following week, they were still \nattacking them. So you had more than 96 hours.\n  Frankly, it is a case where we have reached a compromise. The \ndistinguished ranking member, speaking on behalf of the administration, \nsaid this is not acceptable to them. Had this been part of the original \npackage, I wouldn't have found it acceptable.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Basically, what the administration is after here is that \nif a burglar is coming into your home and the police come to \ninvestigate, they don't have to report to a judge within 96 hours. The \npolice have to act on these terrorist matters. If they find that a \nterrorist has infiltrated a computer controlling an electrical grid \nsystem, they want to get right on the ball and do something about it. \nThat is what they are trying to do with this provision.\n  There are no fourth amendment rights implicated because you have \npeople who have hacked into a computer that they don't have any right \nto be in.\n  We want to give law enforcement the power to stop that. This \nprovision upsets that power and basically puts us back where we are \nwhen we can't do\n\n[[Page S10574]]\n\nanything in a modern digital age to stop terrorists from stopping power \ngrids and damaging dams and a whole raft of other things.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, if the Senator from Utah will yield for \na question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Surely.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator from Wisconsin makes the point that people \nmay have standing to use a computer even without a contractual \nrelationship. He uses the example of a student. Does the Senator from \nUtah believe or does the administration represent that there are no \nrelationships other than contractual which give a person the legitimate \nstanding to use the computer?\n  Mr. HATCH. Under this provision, you do not have a right to hack into \nanother private computer, whether you are a university student or \nanybody else. It only applies, the law we have written, to unauthorized \naccess. It does not apply to authorized access. But unauthorized \naccess, yes, it applies to that. If we don't put it in there, we will \nbe leaving a glaring error that currently exists in our laws that \nprohibit us from solving some of these problems. It would be a terrible \nthing to not correct at this particular time, knowing what we know \nabout how these terrorists are operating right now.\n  Mr. SPECTER. So is the Senator from Utah saying that if you have \npermission, that is a form of a contractual relationship?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am saying that if you have permission, you are not \ncovered by this provision as written. In other words, you would not be \nconsidered a hacker.\n  Mr. SPECTER. On its face you would seem to, unless there is a \ncontractual relationship?\n  Mr. HATCH. It comes down to authorized or unauthorized access. If it \nis authorized, it is not covered under the computer trespasser \nprovision.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, did the Senator yield back his \nremaining time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, we are prepared to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We are prepared if the Senator from Wisconsin is.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I want to clarify a couple points, then I will be \nprepared to yield the remaining time.\n  These were helpful exchanges on a couple of points. First of all, it \nbecame very clear from Senator Specter's excellent questioning that, of \ncourse, there is no guarantee, under the way this language is set up, \nunder the words ``contractual relationship,'' that the provision would \nnot apply to students or to people who would use a computer at a \nlibrary. I can't understand why, if that is the intent of the \nadministration, the intent of the legislation, why they don't just \nagree to language that would say so. That is all we asked for \nyesterday. It could have resolved the problem. For some reason, they \nwon't agree to it.\n  Second, is this notion that a hacker could somehow get in under our \nlanguage. There is no way that a hacker has a relationship with the \ncomputer owner that permits the use of the computer. The hacker is, \nobviously, the antithesis, the opposite of an individual with a \nrelationship that permits use of the computer.\n  Finally, I am amazed at this notion that this amendment, even under \nour version of it, would allow only 96 hours for surveillance when \nunder the example of the Senator from Utah, an ongoing hacker attack is \noccurring.\n  Is it the Senator's contention that at the end of 96 hours, the FBI \nwould not have probable cause to get a warrant, when all it has been \ndealing with for 4 days is this hacking of the computer? Of course, it \nwould. It would be the easiest thing in the world.\n  Section 217 is a very dramatic exception to the usual rule as derived \nunder our system, and expressed in the fourth amendment. Normally, you \nhave to come up with probable cause and a warrant. There are exceptions \nbecause we have difficult problems sometimes. But 96 hours? At the end \nof that time, with clear evidence of a hacking attempt, a warrant could \neasily be obtained. Obviously, our amendment takes care of the need for \nemergency authorization. In fact, I think it is too generous. I am \ntrying to put some kind of a time limit on this so we can have some \nsemblance of the normal rules that protect our citizens.\n  If the other side yields their time, I will yield my remaining time \nas well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I have listened to this debate with \ngreat interest, and I appreciate very much the arguments made by the \nSenator from Wisconsin. As the Senator from Vermont and, I believe, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, have noted, there are circumstances where I \ncan easily see that we could be sympathetic to his amendment. He makes \nan argument.\n  My difficulty tonight is not substantive as much as it is procedural. \nThere is no question, all 100 of us could go through this bill with a \nfine-tooth comb and pinpoint those things which we could improve. There \nis no doubt about that. I have looked at this bill, and there are a lot \nof things, were I to write it alone, upon which I could improve. I know \nthe chairman of the committee believes that too.\n  I think we also have to recognize that this is the product of a lot \nof work in concert with our Republican colleagues, in concert with the \nadministration, in concert with civil liberties groups, and in concert \nwith law enforcement. We have come up with what I would view as a \ndelicate but, yes, successful compromise.\n  Now, if we had opened the bill to amendment, I have no doubt there \nare many colleagues who would offer amendments with which I would \nvehemently disagree--in fact, so much so that I might want to \nfilibuster the bill. I would probably lose. I think there is a \nrealistic expectation that on a lot of these issues, my side would \nlose. I think you could make the same case for the other side. So, we \nmade the best judgment we could, taking into account the very delicate \nbalance between civil liberties and law enforcement that we had to \nachieve in bringing a bill of this complexity to the floor.\n  I have to say, I think our chair and ranking member and all of those \ninvolved did a terrific job under the most difficult of circumstances. \nWhat we did was to say: Let's take this product and work with it; let's \nreview it; if we have to make some changes, let's consider them; but \nlet's recognize that if we were to take this bill open-ended, there \nwould be no end to the amendments--that is the result that would most \nlikely occur in such a circumstance.\n\n  While I may be sympathetic to some amendments offered tonight, had it \nbeen an open debate, there would have been a lot of amendments for \nwhich I would not have been sympathetic.\n  Given those circumstances, my argument is not substantive, it is \nprocedural. We have a job to do. The clock is ticking. The work needs \nto get done. We have to make our best judgment about what is possible, \nand that process goes on.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me tonight in tabling this amendment \nand tabling every other amendment that is offered, should he choose to \noffer them tonight. Let's move on and finish this bill. Let's work with \nthe House and come up with the best product between the Houses. Then, \nlet's let law enforcement do its job, and let's use our power of \noversight to ensure that civil liberties are protected.\n  I make a motion to table.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator withhold that motion to table for a \nmoment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have served with over 250 Senators \nhere, and I have been proud to serve with all of them. I know of no \nSenator who has a stronger commitment to our individual rights and \npersonal liberties than the senior Senator from South Dakota, our \nmajority leader. But I also know that were it not for his commitment \nand efforts, we would not be here with a far better bill than the one \noriginally proposed by the administration. It has been because of his \nwillingness to back us up as we try to improve that bill, to remove \nunconstitutional aspects of it, because of his willingness, we were \nable to get here.\n  As the Senator from South Dakota, the dearest friend I have in this \nbody, has said, he could find parts he would do differently, and he \nknows there are parts I would do differently--even on this one. I have \nhigh regard for the\n\n[[Page S10575]]\n\nSenator from Wisconsin, and I would have loved to have had his \namendment. Actually, I would have done it probably differently than \nthat. But we had a whole lot of places where we won and some where we \nlost.\n  I can tell you right now, if we start unraveling this bill, we are \ngoing to lose all the parts we won and we will be back to a proposal \nthat was blatantly unconstitutional in many parts. So I join, with no \nreluctance whatsoever, in the leader's motion.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, on this bill there was not a single \nmoment of markup or vote in the Judiciary Committee. I accepted that \nbecause of the crisis our Nation faces. This is the first substantive \namendment in the Senate on this entire issue, one of the most important \ncivil liberties bills of our time, and the majority leader has asked \nSenators to not vote on the merits of the issue. I understand the \ndifficult task he has, but I must object to the idea that not one \nsingle amendment on this issue will be voted on the merits on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  What have we come to when we don't have either committee or Senate \ndeliberation on amendments on an issue of this importance?\n  I yield the floor, and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), the Senator from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Thurmond), and the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. \nLott) are necessary absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 83, nays 13, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 299 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--83\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--13\n\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Collins\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n     Levin\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Domenici\n     Helms\n     Lott\n     Thurmond\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, so we understand where we are, there is \nstill a fair amount of time on the bill that the Senator from Utah and \nI have and we have committed to Senators on both sides of the aisle who \nneed time. The remaining time is for the Senator from Wisconsin who has \nthree more amendments with the same time as he had in the last \namendment.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has asked for 5 minutes. I understand \nwe have three more amendments that would take probably an hour or so \nper amendment with the vote if the Senator from Wisconsin wishes to use \nall his time, and he has a right to do that.\n  Once those are disposed of, the Senator from Utah and I are probably \nprepared to yield back our time.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, it was depending entirely on what the \nSenator from Wisconsin was doing. I reserve that now and see where we \nare heading.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, it is my intention to offer two more \namendments, not the third amendment. I believe the time for each of \nthese amendments could be less than the full time allotted. We have a \nfair amount of interest, but I didn't expect as much debate. I think \nthe last two could be expedited, and I am prepared to proceed, if that \nis what my colleagues desire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1900\n\n  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1900.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 21, line 14, insert ``except that, in such \n     circumstances, the order shall direct that the surveillance \n     shall be conducted only when the target's presence at the \n     place where, or use of the facility at which, the electronic \n     surveillance is to be directed has been ascertained by the \n     person implementing the order and that the electronic \n     surveillance must be directed only at the communication of \n     the target,'' after ``such other persons''.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. For the purpose of planning, could the Senator give us a \nsense of both amendments and how long he thinks he will talk.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I have about 12 minutes on this amendment subject to \nany response to that and approximately the same on the second \namendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this amendment has to do with what is \ncalled roving wiretap, or multipoint surveillance authority. This is \none of the first things Attorney General Ashcroft asked for in the \nfirst days after the September 11 attack and gave the example of a \nterrorist using throwaway cell phones and the need for continued \nroaming wiretap authority to allow the FBI to keep up with the ready \navailability of this new technology.\n  First, let me say I have a lot of sympathy for the idea of updating \nthis area of the law. Obviously, it is needed in light of changes in \ntechnology. It is vitally important for Members of the Senate to \nunderstand that roving wiretap authority is already available for \ncriminal investigations under title III. It is in title 18, section \n2518(11) and (12). The Attorney General doesn't need nor has he asked \nfor any new roving wiretap authority for criminal investigations. He \nalready has it.\n  What the bill does in Section 206 is provide similar authority in \ninvestigations under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, known \nas FISA. I am not opposed to expanding existing roving wiretap \nauthority to include FISA investigations, but I am very concerned that \nSection 206 does not include a key safeguard that was part of the \nroving wiretap authority when it was added to title III in 1986. That \nprotection minimizes the possible misuse of the authority, whether \nintentional or unintentional, to eavesdrop on the conversations of \nindividuals who are not the subject of the investigation.\n  Let me read from the Senate Judiciary Committee's report on the \nlegislation that granted roving wiretap authority:\n\n       Proposed subsection 2518(12) of title 18 provides, with \n     respect to both ``wire'' and ``oral'' communications, that \n     where the federal government has been successful in obtaining \n     a relaxed specificity order, it cannot begin the interception \n     until the facilities or place from which the communication is \n     to be intercepted is ascertained by the person implementing \n     the interception order.\n\n\n[[Page S10576]]\n\n\n  In other words, the actual interception could not begin until the \nsuspect begins or evidences an intention to begin a conversation.\n  It further reads:\n\n       It would be improper to use this expanded specificity order \n     to tap a series of telephones, intercept all conversations \n     over such phones and then minimize the conversations \n     collected as a result. This provision puts the burden on the \n     investigation agency to ascertain when the interception is to \n     take place.\n\n  It seems to me that Congress struck the right balance in that \nprovision. It recognized the needs of law enforcement, but also \nrecognized that rights of innocent people were implicated and designed \na safeguard to protect them.\n  When Congress passed FISA in 1978 it granted to the executive branch \nthe power to conduct surveillance in certain types of investigations \nwithout meeting the rigorous probable cause standard under the Fourth \nAmendment that is required for criminal investigations. Investigations \nof agents of foreign powers were different. There is a lower threshold \nfor obtaining an order from the FISA court. But I don't think that \nroving wiretap authority under FISA should be less protective of the \nconstitutional rights of innocent people who are not the subject of the \ninvestigation than the authority that Congress intended to grant in a \nstandard criminal investigation.\n  My amendment takes the safeguard from Title III--from current law--\nand includes it in the FISA roving wiretap authority provision. The \namendment simply provides that before conducting surveillance, the \nperson implementing the order must ascertain that the target of the \nsurveillance is actually in the house that has been bugged, or using \nthe phone that has been tapped.\n  Let me give a few examples of how this would work, which should also \nshow why it is necessary. Indeed, it may be constitutionally required. \nIf the government receives information that the target of the FISA \ninvestigation is making phone calls from a particular bank of pay \nphones in a train station, it may set up wiretaps at all the phones in \nthat bank, but may only listen in on a particular phone that the \nsubject is using. Before beginning the actual surveillance it must know \nthat the suspect is using a particular phone. Otherwise, on the basis \nof a report that a terrorist has been using a particular bank of pay \nphones, the private conversations of innumerable innocent Americans \nwith absolutely no connection to the investigation would be subject to \ngovernment scrutiny. That violates their Fourth Amendment rights. \nSimilarly, the Government should not be able to conduct surveillance on \nall payphones in a neighborhood frequented by a suspected terrorist or \non a particular payphone all day long while innocent people use it.\n  Another example. Suppose a target of a FISA investigation has the \npractice of using a neighbor's or relative's phone. Under my amendment, \nthe Government would not be able to listen in on all calls from that \nphone, but only those taking place when the target is in that person's \nhome. Likewise, if the government believes that the target uses \ncomputers in a library, it can only monitor the one that the terrorist \nis actually using, not all the computers in that facility even when the \nterrorist is not there.\n  I don't believe this amendment should affect the Government's \nauthorization to monitor a new cell phone obtained by the target. If \nthe phone is in the possession of the target or is registered to the \ntarget, then the person implementing the surveillance has ascertained \nthat the facility is being used by the target. They could do it, and I \nsupport that.\n  Now, it has been pointed out to me that in 1999 this safeguard was \nremoved from Title III with respect to wiretaps but left in place with \nrespect to bugs. The change was made in the conference report of an \nintelligence authorization bill, without consideration by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I remind my colleagues again that my amendment was part of the roving \nwiretap authority that Congress granted federal law enforcement in \ncriminal investigations in 1986. It contains a standard that as far as \nwe know served law enforcement adequately in conducting effective \nsurveillance on very sophisticated criminal organizations, including \nthe mafia and drug importation and distribution organizations. I submit \nthat if this standard is not sufficient, we would have seen an open \neffort to change it, but we didn't. Even after the change made in 1999 \nwithout discussion or debate, the standard remains in effect for bugs \nplaced in homes or businesses. Without this protection, Section 206 \nthreatens the rights of innocent people.\n  If law enforcement has been significantly impaired in conducting \neffective surveillance in criminal investigations under the roving \nwiretap provision in current law, we should be shown specific evidence \nof its shortcomings. But if it has not been impaired, then there is no \nreason not to include a similar safeguard in the roving wiretap \nauthority under FISA.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a close look at this amendment. It is \nreasonable, it appropriately reflects current law, but it also allows \nfor updating to face the reality of new technology and all the \ntechnologies that are implicated here. And it protects the \nconstitutional rights of people who are not the subjects of an \ninvestigation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Again, I am not a lawyer. I do not think I understood \nexactly all the argument you were making.\n  Are you saying there has to be some standard of proof? That before \nconducting surveillance, law enforcement has to make sure? In other \nwords, before you actually wiretap a phone or bug a house or a home, \nthe target of the surveillance has to be in that home you are bugging?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. No. Let's say somebody goes to their neighbor's house \nto use their phone. They do that once or twice or whatever it might be. \nOur amendment makes sure this new provision doesn't open up that house \nand everybody in it and every phone call they have in the house to \nunlimited Government surveillance. It requires what has been normally \nrequired under the law, that the law enforcement people ascertain that \nthe person is in the house at the time so it is credible that they \nwould be using that phone again.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In other words, other people who are in the house who \nhave nothing to do with the target of surveillance, their conversations \ncould be--\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Their conversations could and undoubtedly would be, \nwithout some protection.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. And the same thing for the bugging?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Exactly.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. So you are trying to minimize the misuse of authority. \nIt might be unintentional?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Absolutely. There are standards, as I indicated in my \nstatement. There have been rules about how law enforcement has to \nascertain, whether it be at a phone bank or in somebody else's home, \nthat there is a reasonable belief that the individual is actually \nthere. Without that kind of rule, what we are doing is not just \nextending this authority to the reality that people have cell phones \nand move around and use different phones of their own, but it takes us \ninto an area that, frankly, prior to September 11 we would never have \ndreamed of allowing.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, if I could take 2 minutes --I ask the \nSenator from Wisconsin, might I have 2 minutes?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My colleague is saying we have to be very careful \nabout not eavesdropping on the conversations of innocent individuals.\n  Again, we all are painfully aware of September 11. I personally think \nthere is much in this bill that is good, that we need to do. But I \nthink all the Senator from Wisconsin is trying to do is achieve some \nbalance and make sure we do not go above and beyond going after \nterrorists who are trying to kill Americans and instead end up \neavesdropping on innocent people in our country.\n  I think the vast majority of the people in the country, if they \nunderstood what this amendment was about, would support this amendment. \nI do not think passing this amendment does\n\n[[Page S10577]]\n\nany damage whatsoever to much of what is in this bill, which is so \nimportant.\n  So, again, I hope Senators will support this amendment on the merits. \nI think it is a very important amendment. I thank the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Minnesota very much for his \nhelp, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, under current law, law enforcement has \nso-called-roving or multi-point surveillance authority for criminal \ninvestigations under title III, but FISA does not have comparable \nprovisions for agents investigating foreign intelligence. Roving \ninterceptions are tied to a named person rather than to any particular \ncommunications facility or place. Today's bill adds this vital \nauthority to FISA.\n  This authority is critical for tracking suspected spies and \nterrorists who are experts in counter-surveillance methods such as \nfrequently changing locations and communications devices such as phones \nand computer accounts.\n  It simply makes no sense that our wire-tapping statute recognizes \nthis problem, and provides roving wiretap authority for surveillance of \ncommon criminals, but makes no provision for roving authority to \nmonitor terrorists under the FISA statute.\n  The proposed amendment would not succeed in its stated goal of \nharmonizing the standard between title III wiretaps and FISA wiretaps. \nThe proposed amendment would put a requirement on the interception of \nwire or electronic communications under a FISA warrant that does not \nexist in the title III context--a requirement that the law enforcement \nofficer implementing the wiretapping order personally ascertain that \nthe target of the order is using a telephone or computer, before the \nmonitoring could begin.\n  This requirement is operationally unworkable. The way that roving \norders are implemented, requires that law enforcement officers have the \nability to spot check several different telephones in order to \ndetermine which one is being used by the target of the order. The \nlanguage proposed in this amendment does not give law enforcement \nofficers the ability to do so. In fact, they would be worse off under \nthis proposal than they are under current law.\n  The goal of the roving wiretap provision is to give counter-terrorism \ninvestigators as much authority to conduct wiretaps as their \ncounterparts have in conducting criminal investigations. This amendment \ndefeats that goal by putting new, significant obstacles in the path of \ninvestigators attempting to investigate and prevent terrorist \nactivities.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, Senator Feingold provided invaluable \nassistance to the committee during our consideration of this \nlegislation. He also held a hearing in his Constitution Subcommittee \nlast week on the critical civil liberties issues raised by the \nAdministration's anti-terrorism bill. I fully appreciate the depth of \nhis concern and his desire to improve this bill.\n  The Attorney General and I agreed in principal that the roving, or \nmultipoint, wiretap authority for criminal cases should be available \nunder FISA for foreign intelligence cases. The need for such authority \nis especially acute to conduct surveillance of foreign spies trained in \nthe art of avoiding surveillance and detection.\n  Senator Feingold's amendment simply assures that when roving \nsurveillance is conducted, the Government makes efforts to ascertain \nthat the target is actually at the place or using the phone, being \ntapped. This is required in the criminal context. It is unfortunate \nthat the Administration did not accept this amendment.\n  I hope all time could be yielded back on both sides.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It is my understanding the opponents have yielded all \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator is going to yield his.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will just use a minute of my leader \ntime to respond.\n  I have already made my argument on the first amendment. I, in the \ninterest of time, am not going to repeat it. As I said before, I am \nsympathetic to many of these ideas, but I am much more sympathetic to \narriving at a product that will bring us to a point where we can pass \nsomething into law. The record reflects the compromises that have been \nput in place, the very delicate balance that we have achieved. It is \ntoo late to open up the amendment process in a way that might destroy \nthat delicate balance. For that reason, I move to table this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Thurmond), and the Senator \nfrom New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 90, nays 7, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 300 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--90\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--7\n\n     Cantwell\n     Corzine\n     Feingold\n     Levin\n     Specter\n     Thompson\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Domenici\n     Helms\n     Thurmond\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a Statement of Administration Policy on the USA Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n    (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned \n                               agencies)\n\n\n      S. 1510--Uniting and Strengthening America (USA) Act of 2001\n\n       The Administration commends the Senate leadership and the \n     Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     on reaching agreement on S. 1510. This bill contains, in some \n     form, virtually all of the proposals made by the \n     Administration in the wake of the terrorist attacks \n     perpetrated against the United States on September 11th. The \n     Administration strongly supports passage of this bill.\n       The Administration's initial proposals, on which S. 1510 is \n     based, were designed to provide Federal law enforcement and \n     national security officials with the tools and resources \n     necessary to disrupt, weaken, and counter the infrastructure \n     of terrorist organizations, to prevent terrorist attacks, and \n     to punish and defeat terrorists and those who harbor them. S. \n     1510 includes the provisions proposed by the Administration \n     in three main areas: (1) information gathering and sharing; \n     (2) substantive criminal law and criminal procedure; and (3) \n     immigration procedures. The Administration strongly supports \n     passage of these provisions. The Administration also supports \n     valuable provisions, introduced by the Chairman of the\n\n[[Page S10578]]\n\n     Senate Judiciary Committee, aimed at improving the Nation's \n     border protection.\n     Information Gathering and Sharing\n       Existing laws fail to provide national security authorities \n     and law enforcement authorities with certain critical tools \n     they need to fight and win the war against terrorism. For \n     example, technology has dramatically outpaced the Nation's \n     statutes. Many of the most important intelligence gathering \n     laws were enacted decades ago, in and for an era of rotary \n     telephones. Meanwhile, the Nation's enemies use e-mail, the \n     Internet, mobile communications and voice mail.\n       S. 1510 contains numerous provisions that address this \n     problem by helping to make the intelligence gathering and \n     surveillance statutes more ``technology-neutral.'' \n     Specifically, the bill updates the pen-register, trap-and-\n     trace, and Title III-wiretap statutes to cover computer and \n     mobile communications more effectively, while ensuring that \n     the scope of the authority remains the same.\n       The bill also provides for nationwide scope of orders and \n     search warrants, and other practical changes that will enable \n     law enforcement to work more efficiently and effectively. In \n     addition, the bill contains important updates of foreign \n     intelligence gathering-statutes, with the identical goal of \n     making the statutes technology-neutral. Even more important, \n     the bill contains provisions to reduce existing barriers to \n     the sharing of information among Federal agencies where \n     necessary to identify and respond to terrorist threats. The \n     ability of law enforcement and national security personnel to \n     share this type of information is a critical tool for \n     pursuing the war against terrorism on all fronts.\n     Substantive Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure\n       S. 1510 contains important reforms to the criminal statutes \n     designed to strengthen law enforcement's ability to \n     investigate, prosecute, prevent, and punish terrorism crimes. \n     The bill would remove existing barriers to effective \n     prosecution by extending the statute of limitations for \n     terrorist crimes that risk or result in death or serious \n     injury. The bill also creates and strengthens criminal \n     statutes, including a prohibition on harboring terrorists and \n     on providing material support to terrorists, and provides for \n     tougher penalties, including longer prison terms and higher \n     conspiracy penalties for those who commit terrorist acts. \n     These provisions will help to ensure that the fight against \n     terrorism is a national priority in our criminal justice \n     system.\n     Border Protection and Immigration Procedures\n       S. 1510 also contains a number of provisions that would \n     enhance the ability of immigration officials to exclude or \n     deport aliens who engage in terrorist activity and improve \n     the Federal government's ability to share information about \n     suspected terrorists. Under the bill, those who contribute to \n     or otherwise support terrorist organizations and terrorist \n     activities would be denied admission to or deported from this \n     country, and the Attorney General would be authorized to \n     detain deportable persons who are suspected of terrorist \n     activities pending their removal from the United States. In \n     addition, the bill provides for access by the Department of \n     State and the Immigration and Naturalization Service to \n     criminal history records and related information maintained \n     by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n     Money Laundering\n       Title III of S. 1510 includes money laundering and other \n     financial infrastructure provisions, arising from a separate \n     legislative proposal from the Administration. These \n     provisions were added to this bill after unanimous approval \n     was reached on these provisions in the Senate Banking \n     Committee. The Administration supports the effort to \n     strengthen the money laundering statutes to help combat \n     terrorism, and supports virtually all of the proposals that \n     are now included in S. 1510.\n     Pay-As-You-Go Scoring\n       Any law that would increase direct spending is subject to \n     the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act. Accordingly, S. 1510, or any \n     substitute amendment in lieu thereof that would also increase \n     direct spending, will be subject to the pay-as-you-go \n     requirement. OMB's scoring estimates are under development. \n     The Administration will work with Congress to ensure that any \n     unintended sequester of spending does not occur under current \n     law or the enactment of any other proposals that meet the \n     President's objectives to reduce the debt, fund priority \n     initiatives, and grant tax relief to all income tax paying \n     Americans.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I know the Senator from Wisconsin has \nanother amendment. I have had requests for time on our side of the \naisle from the distinguished Senator from Washington State, Ms. \nCantwell, for 7 minutes; the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, \nMr. Kerry, for 5 minutes; the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \nWellstone, for 5 minutes; the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nLevin, for 2 minutes.\n  I mention that, not to lock that in, because the time is there, but \njust to give people an idea of where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, is the Senator from Vermont proposing \na time agreement?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. I am just saying what people are requesting for time. \nI am trying to get some idea. A number of Senators have asked the \ndistinguished leader and myself how much longer we are going to be here \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, let me just say, anybody who wishes to \nspeak on this bill is certainly welcome to do so, but we will be here \nafter the vote for anybody who wishes to accommodate any other Senator \nwho would like to go home.\n  The hour is late. We have one more amendment, and then we have final \npassage. It is my hope that we can complete our work on the bill and \ncertainly leave open the opportunity for Senators to express \nthemselves. We will stay just as long as that is required. I hope, \nthough, we can accommodate other Senators who may not feel the need to \nparticipate in further debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I had spoken earlier this evening at \nsome length about my concerns as to the procedures on the bill. I want \nto make a very few brief comments at this time.\n  I am concerned about the procedures on establishing a record which \nwill withstand constitutional scrutiny. I shall not repeat the \ncitations from decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States \nwhich I cited earlier, except to say that the Supreme Court has \ninvalidated acts of Congress where there is not a considered judgment.\n  I understand the position of the majority leader in wanting to get \nthis bill finished. Earlier this evening, I went through an elaborate \nchronology as to what has happened here. Nine days after September 11, \nthe Attorney General submitted a bill. I had suggested hearings that \nweek. The bill was submitted on September 20. We could have had \nhearings on September 21 and even on September 22, a Saturday. The \nJudiciary Committee had one hearing, a very brief one, on September 25.\n  I wrote the chairman of the committee two letters urging hearings, \nand there was ample time to have hearings to find out about the details \nof this bill. There was a Judiciary subcommittee hearing on October 3.\n  This bill was negotiated between the chairman and ranking member and \nthe White House. The Judiciary Committee did not take up the bill. We \nhave had ample time. This bill should have been before the Senate 2 \nweeks ago. If we had moved on it promptly after it was submitted on the \n20th, we could have had hearings, perhaps some in closed session. We \ncould have had a markup. We could have had an understanding of the \nbill.\n  When the Senator from Wisconsin has offered two amendments, which I \nhave supported, I am inquiring as to what is the specific concern about \nlaw enforcement to preclude the adoption of the amendments of the \nSenator from Wisconsin and on the possible invasions of privacy that \nmay result from the amendments not being adopted.\n  This is a very important bill. I intend to vote for it. I served 8 \nyears on the Intelligence Committee, 2 years as chairman. I chaired the \nSubcommittee of Judiciary on Terrorism. I have been through detailed \nhearings and understand the problem we face, especially in light of the \nwarning which was put out today, and I understand, with the approval of \nthe President, that a terrorist act may happen in the United States or \noverseas in the next several days.\n  We do need adequate law enforcement powers. We should have finished \nthis bill some time ago. But when the majority leader says he is \nconcerned about procedure and not about substance, we are regrettably \nestablishing a record where we have not only not shown the deliberative \nprocess to uphold constitutionality, but we are putting on the record a \ndisregard for constitutionality and elevating procedure over substance, \nwhich is not the way you legislate in a constitutional area\n\n[[Page S10579]]\n\nwhere the Supreme Court of the United States balances law enforcement's \nneeds with the incursion on privacy.\n  I feel constrained to make these comments. I hope yet that we can \ncreate a record which will withstand constitutional scrutiny.\n  Again, I intend to vote for the bill, but say again that this body \nought to be proceeding in a way to establish the record. The worst \nthing that would happen is if we try terrorists, having used these \nprocedures, and have the convictions invalidated. I have had \nexperiences as a prosecuting attorney and know exactly what that means.\n  I want my concerns noted for the record. I thank the Chair and yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I have 5 minutes, but I will not use it. \nI want to make two very quick points.\n  One, as a former prosecutor, I am sympathetic to the comments of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania. I think all of us ought to be respectful of \nwhat the Senator from Wisconsin has been talking about this evening.\n  I will vote for the bill. I am particularly sensitive to what the \nmajority leader has said about the delicacy and the balance. Even \nwithin that delicacy, there are some very legitimate concerns.\n  It is my hope that when this goes to conference, some of the \npositions of the House will be thought about carefully and respected \nand that the Senate may even be able to improve what we have by taking \nthose into account.\n  The second point is that there is within this legislation for the \nfirst time a very significant effort on money laundering. I will say to \nmy colleagues that of all the weapons in this war and for all of our \nmight militarily, the most significant efforts to ferret out and stop \nterrorists are going to come from the combination of information, \nintelligence that we gather and process, and from our ability to take \nunconventional steps, particularly those such as the money-laundering \nmeasures.\n  Senator Levin has done an outstanding job of helping to frame that, \nas has Senator Sarbanes. The truth is, there are banking interests that \neven to this moment still resist living up to the standards of the \nBasel convention and the international standards about knowing your \ncustomer and being part of the law enforcement effort rather than a \nblockade to it.\n  We are told there may be some effort through the House to try to \nstrip this out. It is my hope that the Senate will stand firm and hold \nto the full measure of what President Bush has asked us to do.\n  This will be a long effort, a painstaking effort. If we are serious \nabout it, we have to have the law enforcement tools to make this \nhappen.\n  One of the most critical ones is empowering the Secretary of the \nTreasury to do a reasonable, ratcheted, sort of geared process of \naddressing the concerns of ferreting out money laundering and taking \nthe money away from these illicit interests around the globe. They are \nnot just in terrorism. They are linked to money laundering, to illegal \nalien trafficking. They are all part of the same network which also \nfunds the terrorists themselves.\n  We recognize that three-quarters of the heroin that reaches the \nUnited States comes from Afghanistan. The Taliban and al-Qaida were \nboth trafficking in that heroin. These networks and the \ninterconnectedness of them to the banking institutions, the financial \nmarketplace, are absolutely essential for us as we fight a war on \nterrorism.\n  I hope this money-laundering component will be part of the final \nterrorism bill.\n  I yield whatever remaining time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank Chairman Leahy, Chairman \nSarbanes, and members of their committees, for including our very \nstrong anti-money-laundering provisions in the antiterrorism bill. The \nantiterrorism bill is simply incomplete unless it has anti-money-\nlaundering provisions. Our provisions are strong provisions. They will \nhelp prevent terrorists and other criminals from using our banks to get \ntheir money into this country to fund their activities which are \nterrorizing this country.\n  There apparently is going to be a continuing effort in the House of \nRepresentatives to strip the anti-money-laundering provisions, which we \nhave worked so hard on, from the antiterrorism bill. It is my \nunderstanding the White House will support keeping those provisions in \nthe bill. Our committees have worked very hard to keep our anti-money-\nlaundering provisions in the antiterrorism bill. Unless these \nprovisions are in there, we are providing the executive branch with \nonly half a tool box in the fight against terrorism.\n  Three years ago, the minority staff of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations which I now chair, began its investigation into money \nlaundering using U.S. banks. Three years, three sets of hearings, two \nreports and a five-volume record on correspondent banking and money \nlaundering was the result.\n  We found, not surprisingly, that U.S. banks have accounts for foreign \nbanks and that the customers of those foreign banks can then use the \nU.S. banks to move their money. But if foreign banks do a poor job of \nscreening their customers, criminals and terrorists can end up using \nU.S. banks for their criminal purposes.\n  We found that U.S. banks do a poor job in screening the foreign banks \nthey accept as correspondent customers. Banks told us ``a bank is a \nbank is a bank'' but that's not true. There are good banks and bad \nbanks. We found numerous banks where the bank was engaged in criminal \nactivity or had such poor banking practices any criminal could be a \ncustomer. If a bad bank has a correspondent account with a U.S. bank, \ncustomers of that bad bank have access to U.S. financial system. Then \ncriminals, including drug traffickers and terrorists, are able to use \nour financial systems to carry out their crimes.\n  In response to what we learned, we developed a bill--S. 1371, the \nMoney Laundering Abatement Act introduced in early August.\n  It's a bipartisan bill, and I would like to recognize my cosponsors--\nin particular, Senator Chuck Grassley who has helped to lead the fight \nfor including this money laundering legislation on this anti-terrorism \nbill. The cosponsors in addition to Senator Grassley are: Senators \nSarbanes, Kyl, DeWine, Bill Nelson, Durbin, Kerry and Stabenow. The \nprovisions of this bill have been included in the legislation we are \nnow considering.\n  We now know that the September 11 terrorists used our financial \ninstitutions and systems to help accomplish their ends. They used \nchecks, credit cards, and wire transfers involving U.S. banks in \nFlorida, New York, Pennsylvania. We've seen the photos of two of the \nterrorists using an ATM machine. Osama bin Laden has bragged about it. \nThere are reports of large, unpaid credit card bills.\n  We know that current law is not tough enough in area of correspondent \nbanking--the mechanism used to transfer money around the globe. There \nare too many holes that let in bad banks and bad actors, and we need to \nclose them.\n  Look at what we've learned just in the last few days about bin Laden \nand al-Qaida. Several U.S. banks have had correspondent accounts for a \nSundanese bank called the al Shamal Islamic Bank.\n  A 1996 State Department fact sheet states that bin Laden helped \nfinance the bank in the amount of $50 million. A respected \ninternational newsletter on intelligence matters, Indigo Publications \nin March 16, 2000, said bin Laden remains a leading shareholder, \nalthough the al Shamal Bank apparently denies that.\n  Testimony in the February 2001 criminal trial of the 1998 terrorist \nbombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, revealed that a bin \nLaden associate who handled financial transactions for al-Qaida \ntestified al-Qaida had a half dozen accounts at al Shamal bank, one \nof which was in bin Laden's name. The witness at that trial said in \n1994 a bin Laden associate took $100,000--in cash, U.S. Dollars--out of \nthe Shamal Bank gave it to the witness and told him to deliver it to an \nindividual in Jordan, which he did.\n\n  Another bin Ladin associate testified at the same trial that he \nreceived $250,000 by a wire transfer from the\n\n[[Page S10580]]\n\nShamal Bank to his account in a U.S. bank in Arlington, Texas, to \npurchase a plane in the United States for bin Laden. He said he \npersonally delivered the plane to bin Laden.\n  Why did this bank have a correspondent account with a U.S. bank? Why \nshould we allow that to happen?\n  Even today, when you look at the al Shamal bank website, the bank is \nstill active and advertises an extensive correspondent bank network. \nThree U.S. banks are listed. One of those banks has closed its account, \nbut the two other banks continue to have accounts, although the \naccounts are frozen. Those accounts are now inactive because Sudan, \nhome country of al Shamal, is on the list of terrorist countries and \nany business with the government of those countries has to be approved. \nBut the accounts were operational at one point in time. Moreover, al \nShamal bank has correspondent accounts with other foreign banks which \nhave accounts with U.S. banks.\n  That means al Shamal bank can still be using the U.S. financial \nsystem through an account with a foreign bank that has a correspondent \naccount with a U.S. bank. We call this nesting and it's a serious \nproblem. It means the al Shamal bank and its customers can still use \nthe U.S. banking system.\n  The bill before us would require U.S. banks to do a lot more homework \non the banks they allow to have correspondent accounts. Under the anti-\nterrorism bill, it is my belief and my hope that a bank like al Shamal \nwould never be granted a correspondent account at a U.S. bank.\n  The bill would also allow U.S. law enforcement to capture any illicit \nfunds in a U.S. correspondent account. Now, if a criminal or terrorist \nhas money in a foreign bank that has an account at U.S. bank and \nillicit money is being held in a U.S. account, law enforcement can't \nfreeze that money unless the person is on the terrorist list or can \nprove that the foreign bank with the correspondent account is part of a \ncriminal or terrorist act. That's an excessively hard threshold. This \nlegislation would allow law enforcement to freeze money in \ncorrespondent accounts to the same extent they can freeze money in \nregular, individual accounts.\n  We need all the tools possible in our arsenal to fight the financial \nnetwork of terrorism. The money laundering provisions in this bill \nclose the loopholes in existing law and provide additional tools for \nlaw enforcement to use.\n  I thank Chairman Sarbanes and the other members of the Banking \nCommittee for including so much of the Levin-Grassley anti-money \nlaundering bill, S. 1371, in the Committee's bill. I also thank \nChairman Leahy and the other Judiciary Committee members for including \nanti-money laundering provisions in title 3 of S. 1510, the anti-\nterrorism bill. Strengthening our anti-money laundering laws will \nstrike a blow against terrorism by making it harder for terrorists to \nget the funds they need into United States; an anti-terrorism bill \nwithout these anti-money laundering provisions would be providing U.S. \nlaw enforcement with only half a toolbox against terrorism.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to discuss a few key provisions \nfrom the Levin-Grassley bill that have been incorporated into S. 1510. \nThese provisions are based on an extensive record of hearings and \nreports issued in connection with investigations conducted over the \npast few years by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I \nchair, into money laundering in the correspondent and private banking \nfields.\n\n  The four provisions I want to focus on are provisions that would ban \nforeign shell banks from the U.S. financial system; require U.S. \nfinancial institutions to exercise due diligence; add foreign \ncorruption offenses to the crimes that can trigger a U.S. money \nlaundering prosecution; and close a major forfeiture loophole involving \nforeign banks.\n  First is the shell bank ban in Section 313 of S. 1510. This provision \nis a very important one, because it attempts to eliminate from the U.S. \nfinancial system one category of foreign banks that carry the highest \nmoney laundering risks in the banking world today. Those are foreign \noffshore shell banks which, as defined in the bill, are banks that have \nno physical presence anywhere and no affiliation with any bank that has \na physical presence. Our Subcommittee investigation found that these \nshell banks carry the highest money laundering risks in the banking \nworld, because they are inherently unavailable for effective oversight. \nThere is no office where a bank regulator or law enforcement official \ncan go to observe bank operations, review documents, talk to bank \nofficials, or freeze funds. Only a few countries now issue licenses for \nunaffiliated shall banks; they include Nauru, Vanuatu, and Montenegro. \nNauru alone is believed to maintain licenses for somewhere between 400 \nand 3,000 offshore shell banks, none of which are being actively \nsupervised, and some of which are suspected of laundering funds for \nRussian organized crime. A staff report that we issued in February of \nthis year includes four detailed case histories of offshore shell banks \nthat were able to open correspondent accounts at U.S. banks and used \nthem to move funds related to drug trafficking, bribe money and \nfinancial fraud money. The possibility that terrorists are also using \nshell banks to conduct their operations is real and cannot be ignored. \nThat is why this provision seeks to exclude shell banks from the U.S. \nfinancial system.\n  The provision flat-out prohibits U.S. financial institutions from \nopening accounts for shell banks. Period. It also requires U.S. \nfinancial institutions to take reasonable steps to make sure that other \nforeign banks are not allowing shell banks to use their U.S. accounts \nto gain entry to the U.S. financial system. The point is to prevent \nshell banks from getting direct or indirect access to U.S. financial \naccounts. The shell bank ban applies to both banks and securities firms \noperating in the United States, so that it is as broad and as effective \nas possible.\n  The provision directs the Treasury Secretary to provide regulatory \nguidance to U.S. financial institutions on the reasonable steps they \nhave to take to guard against shell banks using accounts opened for \nother foreign banks. One possible approach would be for U.S. financial \ninstitutions to include a new section in the standard language they use \nto open accounts for foreign banks asking the foreign bank to certify \nthat it will not allow any shell bank to use its U.S. accounts. The \nU.S. financial institution could then rely on that certification, \nunless it encountered evidence to the contrary indicating that a shell \nbank was actually using the account, in which case the financial \ninstitution would have to take reasonable steps to evaluate that \nevidence and determine whether a shell bank was, in fact, using the \nU.S. account.\n  The provision contains one exception to the shell bank ban, which \nshould be narrowly construed to protect the U.S. financial system to \nthe greatest extent possible. This exception allows U.S. financial \ninstitutions to open an account for a shell bank that is both \naffiliated with another bank that maintains a physical presence, and \nsubject to supervision by the banking regulatory of that affiliated \nbank. This exception is intended to allow U.S. financial institutions \nto do business with shell branches of large, established banks on the \nground that the regulator of the established bank can and does oversee \nall of that bank's branches, including any shell branch.\n\n  This exception could, of course, be abused. It is possible that an \nestablished bank in a jurisdiction with weak banking and anti-money \nlaundering controls could open a shell branch in another country with \nequally weak controls and try to use that shell branch to launder funds \nin ways that are unlikely to be detected or stopped by the bank \nregulator in its home jurisdiction. In that case, while the shell bank \nban exception would not flat-out bar U.S. financial institutions from \nopening an account for the shell branch, another provision would come \ninto play and require the U.S. financial institution to exercise \nenhanced due diligence before opening an account for this shell bank. I \nwould hope that U.S. financial institutions would not open such an \naccount--that they would exercise common sense and restraint and \nrefrain from doing business with a shell operation that is affiliated \nwith a poorly regulated bank and inherently resistant to effective \noversight.\n  Many U.S. financial institutions already have a policy against doing \nbusiness with shell banks, but at least one\n\n[[Page S10581]]\n\nmajor U.S. bank, Citibank, has a history of taking on shell banks as \nclients. In order to keep those clients, Citibank tried very hard to \nexpand the exception in this section to also allow U.S. accounts for \nshell banks affiliated with financial service companies other than \nbanks, such as securities firms or financial holding companies. The \nbroad exception was firmly and explicitly rejected by both the Senate \nBanking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, because \nit would have opened a gaping loophole in the shell bank ban and \nrendered the ban largely ineffective. All a shell bank would have had \nto do to evade the ban was establish an affiliated shell corporation \nand call it a financial services company in order to be eligible to \nopen a U.S. bank account. The Citibank approach would, for example, \nhave allowed a shell bank established by bin Laden's financial holding \ncompany, Taba Investments, to open accounts at U.S. banks and \nsecurities firms. That would perpetuate the very problem that the \nSenate investigation identified in two of its shell bank case histories \ninvolving M.A. Bank and Federal Bank, each of which opened Citibank \naccounts in New York and used those accounts to deposit suspect funds \nassociated with drug trafficking and bribery.\n  The exception to the shell bank ban is intended to be narrowly \nconstrued, and U.S. financial institutions will hopefully use great \nrestraint in doing business with any shell bank that is not affiliated \nwith a well known, well regulated bank. The shell bank ban is intended \nto close the U.S. financial marketplace to the money laundering risks \nposed by these banks, and it is my hope that other countries and the \nFinancial Action Task Force on Money Laundering will follow the U.S. \nlead and take the same action in other jurisdictions.\n  The next provision is the due diligence requirement in Section 312 of \nS. 1510. This is another critical provision that tightens up U.S. anti-\nmoney laundering controls by requiring U.S. financial institutions to \nexercise due diligence when opening and managing correspondent and \nprivate banking accounts for foreign banks and wealthy foreign \nindividuals.\n\n  The provision targets correspondent and private banking accounts, \nbecause these two areas have been identified by U.S. bank regulators as \nhigh risk areas for money laundering, and because Congressional \ninvestigations have documented money laundering abuses through them. \nFor example, two weeks ago, I testified before the Banking Committee \nabout a high risk foreign bank in Sudan that was able to open accounts \nat major banks around the world, including in the United States and, in \n1994, used these accounts to funnel money to a bin Laden operative then \nliving in Texas. On one occasion, he used a $250,000 wire transfer from \nthe Sudanese bank to buy an airplane capable of transporting Stinger \nmissiles, fly it to Sudan and deliver the keys to bin Laden. Six months \nearlier, we released a staff report with ten case histories of high \nrisk foreign banks that used their U.S. accounts to transfer illicit \nproceeds associated with drug trafficking, financial fraud and other \ncrimes. A year earlier, another staff report presented four case \nhistories of senior foreign government officials or their relatives \nopening U.S. private banking accounts and using them to deposit \nmillions of dollars in suspect funds. The bottom line is that U.S. \nbanks need to do a much better job in screening the foreign banks and \nwealthy foreign individuals they allow to open accounts in the United \nStates.\n  The due diligence provision would address that problem. It would \nimpose an ongoing, industry-wide legal obligation on all types of \nfinancial institutions operating in the United States to exercise \ngreater care when opening accounts for foreign banks and wealthy \nforeign individuals. Its due diligence requirements are intended to \nfunction as preventative measures to stop dubious banks and as well as \nterrorists or other criminals from using foreign banks' U.S. accounts \nto gain access to the U.S. financial system.\n  The general obligation to exercise due diligence with respect to all \ncorrespondent and private banking accounts is contained in paragraph \n(1). Paragraphs (2) and (3) then provide minimum standards for the \nenhanced due diligence that U.S. banks must exercise with respect to \ncertain correspondent and private banking accounts. Paragraph (4)(B) \ngives the Treasury Secretary discretionary authority to issue \nregulatory guidance to further clarify the due diligence policies, \nprocedures and controls required by paragraph (1).\n  The regulatory authority granted in this section is intended to help \nfinancial institutions understand what is expected of them. The \nSecretary may want to issue regulations that help different types of \nfinancial institutions to understand their obligations under the due \ndiligence provision. However, one caveat needs to be made with respect \nto the Secretary's exercise of this regulatory authority, and that \ninvolves how it is to be coordinated with Section 5318(a)(6), which \nauthorizes the Secretary to grant ``appropriate exemptions'' from any \nparticular money laundering requirement. There are going to be many \nefforts made by various groups of financial institutions to win an \nexemption from the due diligence requirements in this section--from \ninsurance companies, to money transmitters, to offshore affiliates of \nlarge foreign banks. But the Committee's and the Senate's clear \nintention is to cover all major financial institutions operating in the \nUnited States. That is why Chairman Sarbanes changed the language in my \nbill, S. 1371, so that the due diligence requirement did not apply just \nto banks, but to all financial institutions as that term is defined in \nSection 5312(a)(2) of title 31. That broad coverage is exactly what is \ncontemplated by this statute. The bottom line, then, is that the \nSecretary is intended to apply the due diligence requirements broadly \nto U.S. financial institutions, and not to grant an exemption without a \nvery compelling justification.\n\n  This same reasoning also applies to the shell bank ban. There will be \nsome that will seek one exemption or another from the ban, asking the \nTreasury Secretary to use the authority available under Section \n5318(a)(6). Again, the intent of the Committee and this Senate is to \nenact as comprehensive a shell bank ban as possible to protect the \nUnited States from the money laundering threat posed by shell banks. \nThat means that the Secretary should refrain from granting any \nexemption to the shell bank ban without a very compelling \njustification.\n  The third provision I want to discuss is the provision in Section 315 \nadding new foreign corruption offenses to the list of crimes that can \ntrigger a U.S. money laundering prosecution. This is another important \nadvance in U.S. anti-money laundering law. Right now, because foreign \ncorruption offenses are not currently on the list of crimes that can \ntrigger a U.S. money laundering prosecution, corrupt foreign leaders \nmay be targeting U.S. financial institutions as a safe haven for their \nfunds. This provision will make it clear to those who loot their \ncountries, or accept bribes, or steal from their people, that their \nillicit money is not welcome here. Our banks do not want that money, \nand if it is deposited in U.S. banks, it is subject to seizure and the \ndepositor may become subject to a money laundering prosecution.\n  The fourth provision would close a major forfeiture loophole in U.S. \nlaw involving foreign banks. This provision is in Section 319(a) of S. \n1510. It would make a depositor's funds in a foreign bank's U.S. \ncorrespondent account subject to the same civil forfeiture rules that \napply to depositors funds in other U.S. bank accounts. Right now, due \nto a quirk in the law, U.S. law enforcement faces a significant and \nunusual legal barrier to seizing funds from a correspondent account. \nUnlike a regular U.S. bank account, it is not enough for U.S. law \nenforcement to show that criminal proceeds were deposited into the \ncorrespondent account; instead, because funds in a correspondent \naccount are considered to be the funds of the foreign bank itself, the \ngovernment must also show that the foreign bank was somehow part of the \nwrongdoing.\n  That's not only a tough job, that can be an impossible job. In many \ncases, the foreign bank will not have been part of the wrongdoing, but \nthat's a strange reason for letting the foreign depositor who was \nengaged in a wrongdoing escape forfeiture. And in those cases where the \nforeign bank may have\n\n[[Page S10582]]\n\nbeen involved, no prosecutor will be able to allege it in a complaint \nwithout first getting the resources needed to chase the foreign bank \nabroad.\n  Take, for example, the case of Barclays Bank which has frozen an \naccount because of suspicious activity suggesting it may be associated \nwith terrorism. If that account had been a correspondent account in the \nUnited States opened for Barclays Bank, U.S. law enforcement could have \nbeen unable to freeze the particular deposits suspected of being \nassociated with terrorism, because the funds were in the Barclays \ncorrespondent account and Barclays itself was apparently unaware of any \nwrongdoing. That doesn't make sense. U.S. law enforcement should be \nable to freeze the funds.\n\n  Section 319(a) would eliminate that quirk by placing civil \nforfeitures of funds in correspondent accounts on the same footing as \nforfeitures of funds in all other U.S. accounts. There is just no \nreason foreign banks should be shielded from forfeitures when U.S. \nbanks would not be.\n  Section 319 has many other important provisions as well, including \nprovisions dealing with Federal Receivers, legal service on foreign \nbanks and more.\n  I want to again thank Senator Sarbanes and Senator Leahy and their \nstaffs for their hard work and cooperative spirit in bringing this bill \nto the floor and including the provisions of our bill in it.\n  I need to add that the hard work in passing this bill will be for \nnaught if some of the banks have their way in the House and in \nConference Committee. I'm very concerned with reports that there is an \neffort in the House to separate the money laundering and anti-terrorism \nbills, so money laundering will be considered separately. The banks \nshould be working with us to figure out even more ways in which the \nmoney flow of terrorists can be shut down.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print letters of support \nfor this legislation and testimony from the FBI in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Dennis M. Lormel, Chief, Financial Crimes Section, Federal \n   Bureau of Investigation, Before the House Committee on Financial \n               Services, Washington, DC, October 3, 2001\n\n       Correspondent banking is another potential vulnerability in \n     the financial services sector that can offer terrorist \n     organizations a gateway into U.S. banks just as it does for \n     money launderers. As this Committee well knows, the problem \n     stems from the relationships many U.S. Banks have with high \n     risk foreign banks. These foreign banks may be shell banks \n     with no physical presence in any country, offshore banks with \n     licenses limited to transacting business with persons outside \n     the licensing jurisdiction, or banks licensed and regulated \n     by jurisdictions with weak regulatory controls that invite \n     banking abuses and criminal misconduct. Attempts to trace \n     funds through these banks are met with overwhelming \n     obstacles. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that once a \n     correspondent account is opened in a U.S. Bank, not only the \n     foreign bank but its clients can transact business through \n     the U.S. bank. As Congress has noted in the past, requiring \n     U.S. banks to more thoroughly screen and monitor foreign \n     banks as clients could help prevent much of the abuse in \n     correspondent bank relationships.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 18, 2001.\n     Hon.

We \n     appreciate your continued commitment to addressing the \n     serious problem of money laundering in this country and \n     abroad, as demonstrated by your introduction of S. 1371. As \n     you indicated in your letter, the Attorney General has \n     expressed the need to strengthen our money laundering laws. \n     In his August 7th speech, the Attorney General stated: ``The \n     Department of Justice has identified several areas in which \n     our money laundering laws need to be updated to more \n     effectively combat organized crime and to better serve the \n     cause of justice.''\n       We were very pleased to see that one of the areas \n     highlighted in the Attorney General's speech--the need to add \n     to the list of foreign offenses that constitute predicate \n     crimes for money laundering prosecutions--is included in S. \n     1371. This and other provisions in your bill would greatly \n     improve our money laundering laws.\n       As the Attorney General also indicated in his speech, the \n     Department of Justice has been developing its own proposal to \n     update our money laundering laws and we hope to provide \n     Congress with our own recommendations in the near future. We \n     look forward to working with you in pursuing our mutual goal \n     of strengthening and modernizing our money laundering laws to \n     meet the challenges of this new century.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter. If we may be \n     of additional assistance, we trust that you will not hesitate \n     to call upon us. The Office of Management and Budget has \n     advised that there is no objection from the standpoint of the \n     Administration's program to the presentation of this report.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Daniel J.

In addition, as Assistant Attorney General Bryant \n     recently indicated in his letter to you, the Administration \n     has been working for some time on a package of additional \n     suggested money laundering amendments, which we hope to be \n     able to share with you shortly.\n       We look forward to working with you to strengthen and \n     improve the Nation's money laundering laws. If I can be of \n     any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me. \n     The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Asa Hutchinson,\n     Administrator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Federal Deposit\n\n\n                                        Insurance Corporation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for the opportunity to comment \n     on S. 1371, the Money Laundering Abatement Act. The Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Corporation shares your concern about the \n     damage to the U.S. financial system that may result from \n     money laundering activities and we congratulate you for your \n     leadership in this area.\n       As deposit insurer, the FDIC is vitally interested in \n     preventing insured depository institutions from being used as \n     conduits for funds derived from illegal activity. As you may \n     know, in January of this year, the FDIC, together with the \n     Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the \n     Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the \n     Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the \n     Department of State, issued Guidance On Enhanced Scrutiny For \n     Transactions That May Involve The Proceeds Of Official \n     Corruption. The FDIC is also an active participant in other \n     working groups that seek more effective ways to combat money \n     laundering.\n       S. 1371 is an important step in trying to preclude foreign \n     entities from laundering money through U.S. financial \n     institutions. S. 1371 would, in several ways, require U.S. \n     financial institutions to identify foreign parties who open \n     or maintain accounts with U.S. banks, such as through \n     correspondent accounts or private banking accounts. The bill \n     would also prohibit customers from having direct access to \n     concentration accounts, and make it a crime to falsify the \n     identity of a participant in a transaction with or through \n     U.S. financial institutions. Correspondent and concentration \n     accounts have the potential to be misused so as to facilitate \n     money laundering, and the bill appropriately addresses these \n     concerns.\n       One point we would like to raise is in relation to Section \n     3 of the bill. Section 3 provides for consultation between \n     the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, both in regard to devising \n     measures to combat money laundering and defining terms \n     relating to anti-money laundering measures. The FDIC believes \n     that such consultation requirements should include the FDIC \n     as well as the other Federal banking agencies.\n       Thank you again for the opportunity to provide our views on \n     S. 1371. Please do not hesitate to contact Alice Goodman, \n     Director of our Office of Legislative Affairs, at (202) 898-\n     8730 if we can be of any further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donald E.

Chuck Grassley,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Levin and Grassley: I write to express my \n     strong support for S1371, the Money Laundering Abatement Act. \n     This is a prevalent problem that has allowed the criminal \n     element to secrete the proceeds of criminal activity and to \n     generate funds needed to facilitate and underwrite organized \n     crime.\n       The bill will make it harder for foreign criminals to use \n     United States banks to launder the proceeds of their illegal \n     activity and allow investigators to detect, prevent, and \n     prosecute money laundering. In particular, the bill \n     strengthens existing anti-money laundering laws by adding \n     foreign corruption offenses, barring U.S. banks from \n     providing banking services to foreign shell banks, requiring \n     U.S. banks to conduct enhanced due diligence, and making \n     foreign bank depositors' funds in U.S. correspondence banks \n     subject to the same forfeiture rules that apply to funds in \n     other U.S. bank accounts.\n       Recent events highlighting the activities of foreign \n     terrorists have demonstrated the necessity for his law. My \n     colleagues in the U.S. Justice Department indicate that this \n     and similar laws are essential if we are to succeed in our \n     fight against organized crime, drug dealers, and terrorism. \n     This bill is the result of lengthy hearings and congressional \n     fact-finding that concluded that the regulations set forth in \n     the bill are needed. The bill has my support, and I would \n     urge its passage as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                             Jennifer M.

Carl Levin,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Levin and Grassley: I write to express my \n     views on the Money Laundering Abatement Act you are planning \n     to introduce soon. This bill would provide much needed relief \n     from some of the most pressing problems in money laundering \n     enforcement in the international arena. The burdens it places \n     on the financial institutions are well considered, closely \n     tailored to the problems, and reasonable in light of the \n     public benefits involved.\n       The bill focuses on the structural arrangements that allow \n     major money launderers to operate. These include the use of \n     shell banks and foreign accounts, abuse of private banking, \n     evasion of law enforcement efforts to acquire necessary \n     records, and of safe foreign havens for criminal proceeds. \n     The approach is very encouraging, because efforts to limit \n     the abuse of these international money laundering tools and \n     techniques must come from Congress rather than the state \n     legislatures, and because such measures attack money \n     laundering at a deeper and more lasting level than simpler \n     measures.\n       The focus on structural matters means that this bill's \n     effects on cases actually prosecuted by state attorneys \n     general are a relatively small part of the substantial \n     effects its passage would have on money laundering as a \n     whole. Nevertheless, its effects on money laundering \n     affecting victims of crime and illegal drug trafficking would \n     be dramatic. I will use two examples from my Office's present \n     money laundering efforts.\n       My Office initiated a program to combat so-called ``prime \n     bank fraud'' in 1996, and continues to focus on these cases. \n     Some years ago, the International Chamber of Commerce \n     estimated that over $10 million per day is invested in this \n     wholly fraudulent investment scam. The ``PBI'' business has \n     grown substantially since then. To date, my Office has \n     recovered over $46 million in these cases, directly and in \n     concert with U.S. Attorneys and SEC. Prime bank fraudsters \n     rely heavily on the money movement and concealment techniques \n     that this bill would address, particularly foreign bank \n     accounts, shell banks, accounts in false identities, movement \n     of funds through ``concentration'' accounts, and impunity \n     from efforts to repatriate stolen funds. One of our targets \n     was sentenced recently in federal court to over eight years \n     in prison and ordered to make restitution of over $9 million, \n     but without the tools provided in this bill, there is little \n     hope that the victims will even see anything that was not \n     seized for forfeiture in the early stages of the \n     investigation.\n       My Office is now engaged in a program to control the \n     laundering of funds through the money transmitters in \n     Arizona, as part of the much larger problem of illegal money \n     movement to and through the Southwest border region. This \n     mechanism is a major facilitator of the drug smuggling \n     operations. Foreign bank accounts and correspondence \n     accounts, immunity from U.S. forfeitures, and false \n     ownerships are significant barriers to successful control of \n     money laundering in the Southwest.\n       Your bill is an example of the immense value of \n     institutions like the Permanent Subcommittee of \n     Investigations, because this type of bill requires a deeper \n     understanding of the issues that comes from long term \n     inquiries by professional staff. We who are involved in state \n     level money laundering control efforts should be particularly \n     supportive of such long term strategies because they are most \n     important to the quality of life of our citizens.\n       I commend your efforts for introducing this important \n     legislation and will assist you in anyway I can to gain its \n     passage.\n           Yours very truly,\n                                                 Janet Napolitano,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I tell the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan and the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, who made \nsuch strong and valid points on money laundering, we just received from \nthe administration their statement of policy saying: This includes \nmoney laundering, other financial infrastructure provisions arising \nfrom separate legislative proposals. These provisions were added to \nthis bill after unanimous approval to have these provisions in the \nSenate Banking Committee. The administration supports the effort to \nstrengthen this--\n\n  And so on. They are extremely important, and I can assure both \nSenators that I will strongly support retention of this in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1901\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1901, which is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1901.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To modify the provisions relating to access to business \n    records under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978)\n\n       Strike section 215 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 215. ACCESS TO BUSINESS RECORD UNDER FOREIGN \n                   INTELLIGENCE SURVEIL-\n                   LANCE ACT OF 1978.\n\n       (A) In General.--Section 502 of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1862) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``authorizing a common \n     carrier'' and all that follows through ``to release records'' \n     and inserting ``requiring a business to produce any tangible \n     things (including books, records, papers, documents, and \n     other items)'';\n       (2) in subsection (b)(2)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting: ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) the records concerned are not protected by any \n     Federal or State law governing access to the records for \n     intelligence or law enforcement purposes.''; and\n       (3) in subsection (d), by striking ``common carrier, public \n     accommodation facility, physical storage facility, or vehicle \n     rental facility'' each place it appears and inserting \n     ``business''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The text of section 501 of that \n     Act (50 U.S.C. 1861) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``Sec. 501. In this title, the terms `agent of a foreign \n     power', `foreign intelligence information', `international \n     terrorism', and `Attorney General' have the meanings given \n     such terms in section 101.''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment has to do with section \n215 in the bill. It allows the Government, under FISA, to compel \nbusinesses to turn over records to assist in an investigation of \nterrorism or espionage. The provision makes two significant changes \nfrom current law. Under current law, the FBI can seek records from only \na limited set of businesses--from public accommodations, such as hotels \nand motels, car rental companies, storage facilities, and travel \nrecords, such as those from airlines.\n  Current law also requires the FBI to demonstrate to the FISA court \nthat the records pertain to an agent of a foreign power. The FBI cannot \ngo on a fishing expedition of records of citizens of this country who \nmight have had incidental contact with a target of an investigation. \nBut under section 215 of this bill, all business records can be \ncompelled to be produced, including those containing sensitive personal \ninformation such as medical records\n\n[[Page S10584]]\n\nfrom hospitals or doctors, or educational records, or records of what \nbooks someone has taken out of the library.\n  This is an enormous expansion of authority, compounded by the \nelimination of the requirement that the records have to pertain to an \nagent of a foreign power. Under this provision, the Government can \napparently go on a fishing expedition and collect information on \nanyone--perhaps someone who has worked with, or lived next door to, or \nhas been seen in the company of, or went to school with, or whose phone \nnumber was called by the target of an investigation.\n  So we are not talking here only about the targets of the \ninvestigation; we are talking about people who have simply had some \nincidental contact with the target. All the FBI has to do is to allege \nin order to get the order that the information is sought for an \ninvestigation of international terrorism or clandestine intelligence \ngathering. That is all they have to do, assert that--not to just get at \nthe targets, but at people who have had any contact whatsoever with \nthem.\n  On that minimal showing in an ex parte application in a secret court, \nthe Government can lawfully compel a doctor or a hospital to release \nmedical records or a library to release circulation records. This is \ntruly a breathtaking expansion of the police power, one that I do not \nthink is warranted.\n  My amendment does not completely strike the provision. There are \nelements of it that I think have legitimacy. First, my amendment \nmaintains the requirement that the records pertain to a target alleged \nto be an agent of a foreign power. This provides some protection for \nAmerican citizens who might otherwise become the subject of \ninvestigations for having some innocent contact with a suspected \nterrorist.\n  Second, while the amendment maintains the expansion of the FISA \nauthority to all business records, it also requires the FBI to comply \nwith State and Federal laws that contain a higher standard for the \ndisclosure of certain private information. The amendment makes it clear \nthat existing Federal and State statutory protections for the privacy \nof certain information are not diminished or superseded by section 215.\n  There are certain categories of records, such as medical records or \neducational records, that Congress and State legislatures have deemed \nworthy of a higher level of privacy protection. Let me quickly give you \na couple of examples. In California, there is a very detailed statutory \nprovision governing disclosure of medical information to law \nenforcement authorities. Generally, the law requires either patient \nconsent, or a court order, or a subpoena. Before issuing an order for \nthe records to be produced, the court must, among other things, find \ngood cause based on a determination that there is a reasonable \nlikelihood that the records in question will disclose material \ninformation or evidence of substantial value in connection with the \ninvestigation or prosecution.\n  Montana is another State with strong statutory, and indeed \nconstitutional, protections for medical records. It provides that \nmedical records can only be obtained with an investigative subpoena \nsigned by a judge, and that subpoena may be issued only when it appears \nupon the affidavit of the prosecutor that a compelling State interest \nrequires it to be issued. In order to establish a compelling State \ninterest, the prosecutor must state facts and circumstances sufficient \nto support probable cause to believe that an offense has been \ncommitted, and that the information relative to the commission of that \noffense is in the possession of the person or institution to whom the \nsubpoena is directed.\n  My State of Wisconsin, along with many other States, has very strong \nlibrary confidentiality laws which requires a court order for \ndisclosure of public library system records.\n  Texas, for example, permits disclosure of library records ``to a law \nenforcement agency or prosecutor under a court order or subpoena \nobtained after a showing to a court that: (A) disclosure of the record \nis necessary to protect the public safety; (B) the record is evidence \nof an offense or constitutes evidence that a particular person \ncommitted an offense.''\n  Missouri and Nevada library records confidentiality laws both require \nthat a court find ``that the disclosure of such record is necessary to \nprotect the public safety or to prosecute a crime.''\n  South Carolina's library records confidentiality law permits \ndisclosure ``in accordance with a proper judicial order upon finding \nthat disclosure of the records is necessary to protect public safety, \nto prosecute a crime, or upon showing of good cause before a presiding \njudge in a civil matter.''\n  In short, our States have made policy judgments about the protection \nto which certain kinds of records are justified. We have Federal laws \nthat express similar judgments--Federal Educational Records Privacy \nAct. Indeed, as I will mention, this bill provides new standards for \nthe production of educational records in connection with terrorism \ninvestigations.\n  So my fear is that what section 215 does is effectively trump any and \nall of these State and Federal privacy protections. I think that is a \nresult that most of our citizens and their State representatives would \nnot countenance. So my amendment simply provides that this new \nauthority to compel the production of business records through an order \nof a FISA court does not apply if another State or Federal law governs \nthe law enforcement or intelligence access to the records.\n  To the extent that the records sought have no such statutory \nprotection, the only effect this amendment would have is to ensure that \nthe records actually pertain to the target. But I strongly believe that \nmerely alleging that the records are needed for an intelligence \ninvestigation should not override other protections provided by State \nand Federal law.\n  I will quickly highlight the problem by referring to section 508 of \nthis bill. That section, I think, would be rendered meaningless if \nsection 215 is not amended as I propose.\n  The original version of section 508 proposed by the administration \nwould have given the Attorney General the right to obtain the \neducational records of virtually any student without a court order. I \nand many other Senators had serious problems with that provision, and \nit was significantly changed before S. 1510 was introduced. Section 508 \nnow does require a court order and does provide a specific showing that \nthe Attorney General must make to obtain the order to get at these \neducational records. But if section 215 is enacted without my amendment \na university could be ordered to turn over such records as ``tangible \nthings'' on a much lower showing.\n  The administration asserts that it is too great a burden for the \nGovernment to abide by existing privacy protections and seek court \norders to obtain certain sensitive information specifically identified \nby Congress and State legislators. I remind my colleagues that the \nprotections I seek to preserve were carefully drafted and debated and \nenacted at a time when legislators could thoughtfully consider the full \nweight of granting such protections. We are now asked to set these \nprotections aside with scant discussion of either the merits or the \nconsequences of such a proposal, during a time of incredible strain on \nour democratic principles, and for an indeterminate length of time.\n  If my amendment is adopted, law enforcement will still have access to \nall of the information it seeks. But my amendment simply maintains the \nintegrity of protections enacted by Congress and State legislatures for \ncertain kinds of sensitive information to ensure that access to this \ninformation is given only where it is necessary. It makes sure that \nthis provision does not become the platform or an excuse for a fishing \nexpedition for damaging information on American citizens who are not \nthe subjects of FISA surveillance.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say, again, to colleagues that this \namendment the Senator from Wisconsin introduced makes sure that our \nFederal and State laws regarding certain sensitive privacy areas are \nnot diminished or superseded by this provision.\n\n[[Page S10585]]\n\n  The amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin goes to the heart of the \nconcerns that a lot of the people we represent have. I imagine that the \nvote may be overwhelmingly in opposition to this amendment. That has \nbeen the pattern.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for raising these \nquestions. This is what we should be doing.\n  I conclude this way: I really think, in part, because of the kind of \nquestions the Senator from Wisconsin has raised--again, I am not a \nlawyer--in looking at this bill, Mr. President, I say to Senator Leahy, \nit seems to me he and others have done a great job and are doing \neverything possible to make this more balanced. There are so many good \nprovisions in this bill that we need. I believe that.\n  I hope we can keep the sunset provision, which is so essential to \noversight, because I think what is good is the provisions of this \nlegislation that focus on combating terrorism and what is not quite so \ngood is the parts of this bill that reach way beyond that.\n  Yes, there is a lot of good. I will support it. I will reserve final \njudgment of what comes out of the conference committee. I think we can \nmake it better.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Hatch included, for their work. \nSometimes people can honestly disagree. I know this is important. I \nknow where we are as a nation, but the Senator from Wisconsin has \nraised important concerns tonight, and others as well. I hope we do \nbetter in conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. He \nsaid it exactly right. Each of us who spoke on these amendments tonight \ncares just as much as everybody in this room about the fight against \nterrorism and stopping it. We just want to make sure we do not go \nbeyond that goal with unnecessary language that intrudes on our civil \nliberties. That is it. That is all we are trying to do.\n  I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for \nthe time and his energies this evening. We all know that the hour is \nlate and that there are many things we must accomplish in our acts to \nfight terrorism. This is probably one of the most significant pieces of \nlegislation that affects our home-front activities in fighting that \nbattle.\n  There are many good things in this bill. I am very proud of the \nauthorizing language to triple the resources for our northern borders. \nI am very proud of the language in the bill that basically will set a \nnew technology standard for our visa program so we can better identify \npeople coming into this country. I am very proud of the many tools in \nthe bill for law enforcement. I ask unanimous consent that the column \nin the Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 10, 2001]\n\n                         When Care Beats Haste\n\n       The complex antiterrorism legislation that the \n     administration sent Congress less than a month ago could \n     reach the floors of both houses this week. The original \n     proposal has been considerably improved since its hasty \n     submission, but civil liberties groups continue to warn with \n     cause that some of the detention and surveillance provisions \n     would give the government more power than is either necessary \n     or healthy.\n       Some of the members of both parties who helped construct \n     the current compromises are likewise uneasy about their own \n     handiwork, but reluctant to be seen as holding up a bill the \n     administration insists it needs right away. The reluctance \n     will be the greater now that the country is engaged in \n     military action in Afghanistan; there is fear--we have no \n     doubt well-founded--of retaliation. But dangerous moments are \n     precisely the ones when it is most important that civil \n     liberties be protected.\n       The House Judiciary Committee has dealt with the \n     conflicting pressures in part by putting a kind of asterisk \n     after the surveillance sections of the bill. It has \n     ``sunset'' them, meaning the powers they confer will expire \n     after two years unless a subsequent Congress, having seen how \n     the powers work out, votes to extend them. The administration \n     opposes the sunset provision and succeeded in keeping it out \n     of the Senate version. But it's a reasonable compromise. A \n     bill such as this is a balancing of risks--the risk of \n     further attack versus the risk to civil liberties in seeking \n     to forestall the attack. If the bill is as benign as the \n     administration insists, it has nothing to fear from a sunset \n     provision, which ought to be retained.\n       Parts of the administration proposal were sensible and are \n     not in dispute: allowing the government in an age of cell \n     phones to seek court approval for placing a wiretap on a \n     person rather than a particular phone, for example. Others \n     were drawn too loosely, and some still need work. The \n     administration had sought authority to detain indefinitely \n     non-citizens whom the attorney general thought even might be \n     engaged in terrorism or other activities that endangered \n     national security. That power has been greatly circumscribed. \n     A person not charged with a crime after seven days can be \n     held only if the government is moving to deport him. The \n     question, which the bills don't clearly answer, is how long, \n     without judicial determination, can it hold him then?\n       Wiretap authority now is easier to get for foreign \n     intelligence than for law enforcement purposes. The \n     legislation would make it easier still. The question then \n     becomes how to make sure that the new authority isn't \n     abused--in fact used for law enforcement purposes or fishing \n     expeditions--in such a way as to make such surveillance far \n     more commonplace than now. Related issues have to do with the \n     sharing of law enforcement and intelligence information among \n     government officials. There are ways to provide the broader \n     authority the government says it needs while hedging against \n     its abuse; in our view, not all of those have been fully \n     explored.\n       So too with the power the bill would give law enforcement \n     officials to obtain records of an individual's Internet use, \n     including addresses of e-mail sent and received. Phone \n     records are now available to law enforcement agencies more or \n     less on request--when were calls made from phone A to phone \n     B? what should be the Internet analogy?\n       The administration was said yesterday to be pressing for \n     quick passage by both houses of the Senate measure; the more \n     careful work of the House Judiciary Committee would be set \n     aside. That's wrong, and an acquiescent step that in the long \n     run Congress likely would regret.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. This article said it best with the headline: ``When \nCare Beats Haste'':\n\n       The question then becomes how to make sure that the new \n     authority isn't abused--in fact used for law enforcement \n     purposes or fishing expeditions--\n\n  Later it says that it would be wrong for us to take an acquiescent \nstep that in the long run would really hurt our country.\n  What Senator Feingold is simply trying to say is that we have already \npainstakingly over many years crafted a careful balance in protecting \npersonal privacy. This language in section 215 changes that. It \nbasically says that the FBI can have access to other things, including \nbusiness records from U.S. citizens who may have had incidental contact \nwith someone who is defined as a terrorist.\n  Think about that for a second. If you are an employer and someone in \nyour company has now been accused of these terrorists acts and is under \ninvestigation, your business records can also be attained if, as \nSenator Feingold said, it was deemed part of this investigation, with \nvery minimal judicial review.\n  Take for another example, you happen to live across the hall from \nsomeone who now has become a suspect. Maybe you have been over to their \nhouse for dinner several times. Now, all of a sudden, you may be part \nof that investigation, and your financial records, your medical \nrecords, your personal records can now be part of that investigation, \nagain, with very minimal judicial review.\n  I have heard from many in my State, including my State librarian, \nconsumers, and businesses that are concerned, that this provision is \nfar too broad.\n  It takes little imagination, as I said, to think of all the tangible \nitems this would give the FBI carte blanche to examine some people's \nmost private and personal papers.\n  The bottom line is this legislation could circumvent or supersede \nFederal and State privacy laws that protect student records, library \nrecords, and health records not previously admissible under FISA.\n  What we are talking about in the Feingold amendment is trying to \npreserve those State and Federal laws that already specify protection. \nThe amendment simply states where Congress or a State legislature has \nenacted a law which requires an order to obtain records, that Federal \nor State law stands.\n  That seems pretty simple. We have worked on these issues. We should \nnot work on them in haste.\n\n[[Page S10586]]\n\n  This is a very complex time. It is no ordinary time for our country. \nThis process has to remember those fourth amendment rights that we have \nso diligently fought for in the past. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am grateful for the remarks of the \nSenator from Washington. I am afraid we are going to read them in a few \nyears and wish maybe we listened more closely to what we are doing on \nthis particular provision.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah wanted to say \nsomething for the record.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  I oppose Senator Feingold's amendment to Section 215 of the bill. \nSection 215 allows federal law enforcement to apply for a court order \nto obtain records and other evidence in the course of an investigation \nto protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence \nactivities. This provision has many safeguards built in to prevent its \nmisuse.\n  For instance, the application must be made by the Director of the FBI \nor his designee, whose rank cannot be lower than an Assistant Special \nAgent in Charge, and specify that the records concerned are sought for \nan authorized investigation to protect against international terrorism \nor clandestine intelligence activities. Additionally, the investigation \nmust be conducted pursuant to approved Attorney General guidelines and \nmay not be conducted on a United States person solely upon the basis of \nactivities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution.\n  As written, the provision balances the investigatory needs of the FBI \nwith privacy concerns and provides adequate protection, while not \nallowing a host of state-law provisions to stand in the way of national \nsecurity needs. Senator Feingold's amendment would condition the \nissuance of the court order on a myriad of federal and state-law \nprovisions. Such conditioning will have the effect of making \ninvestigations to protect against international terrorism more \ndifficult than investigations of certain domestic criminal violations.\n  Senator Feingold's amendment purports to preserve privacy protections \nin place for certain records. The amendment's effect, however, will be \nto place foreign international and intelligence investigations at a \ndisadvantage to criminal investigations. For example, this amendment \nwould make it more difficult for the government to obtain business \nrecords in a foreign-intelligence or foreign counter-intelligence \ninvestigation through a court order than it is to obtain the same \nrecords in a criminal health-care fraud or child pornography \ninvestigation through a grand jury subpoena or administrative subpoena. \n(see 18 U.S.C. 3486).\n\n  Federal law enforcement officers investigating the activities of a \nterrorist organization or foreign intelligence target should not face a \ngreater burden than that imposed on investigators of health-care fraud \nor child pornography.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the administration originally wanted \nadministrative subpoena authority in foreign intelligence cases for \ngovernment access to any business record. I was able to reach agreement \nwith the administration to subject this authority to judicial review \nand to bar investigations based on the basis of activities protected by \nthe First Amendment.\n  The Feingold amendment would ensure that current laws providing \nsafeguards for certain types of records, such as medical and \neducational records, be maintained. Again, it is unfortunate that the \nadministration did not accept this amendment.\n  Mr. President, we are prepared to yield back the remainder of our \ntime if the Senator from Wisconsin is prepared to yield back the \nremainder of his time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If the majority leader is going to speak, I would like \nto respond. If not, I will simply yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                        NORTHERN BORDER SECURITY\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, especially Chairman Leahy and Senator Hatch for their hard \nwork on this important legislation. This bill will give the \nadministration an increased ability to fight terrorism on many fronts. \nOne section of the bill that is extremely important to my state \naddresses Northern Border Security. This bill will triple the number of \nBorder Patrol, Customs Service, and INS inspectors along America's \nnorthern borders. It also authorizes $100 million to improve INS and \nCustoms technology and for additional equipment for monitoring the \nnorthern borders. Alaska and Alaskans are in a unique position. One \nsection of our northern boarder stretches from Maine through, my good \nfriend's home state of, Vermont all the way to Washington State. A \nsecond section is that of my home State. As you know we are the largest \nState in the Nation with an enormous border with Canada that runs over \n1,538 miles. We have one of the busiest international cargo airports in \nthe world, which has lost a number of carriers since the September 11 \nattacks due to grossly inadequate staffing at our secure, sterile \ncustoms facility. We also have several major international ports \nscattered throughout Alaska including the Port of Anchorage, which \nhandles the most container traffic in Alaska; Dutch Harbor, which is \nAmerica's busiest commercial fishing port; and Valdez, where millions \nof barrels of North Slope crude oil are sent by pipeline to the ``South \n48.'' The sections of the bill that address the Northern Border \nSecurity do not mention Alaska specifically. I intended to offer an \namendment to insure that we are part of the definition. But as my good \nfriend the Senator from Vermont pointed out to me, other northern \nborder States are not mentioned specifically either. I understand that \nit is the intent of this legislation that Alaska and all other states \nthat border Canada\n\n[[Page S10587]]\n\nare ``Northern Border'' States and that INS, Border Patrol, U.S. \nCustoms service and others should look at all of these states when \naddressing security issues. I would ask the manager of this bill if my \nunderstanding is correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska is correct. Alaska \nis definitely part of America's Northern Border and it was the intent \nof the committee and the Senate that it be part of that definition.\n  The unfolding facts about how the terrorists who committed the \nSeptember 11 attack were able to enter this country without difficulty \nare chilling. Since the attacks many have pointed to our northern \nborder as vulnerable to the entry of future terrorists. This is not \nsurprising when a simple review of the numbers shows that the northern \nborder has been routinely short-changed in personnel. While the number \nof border patrol agents along the southern border has increased over \nthe last few years to over 8,000, the number at the northern border has \nremained the same as a decade ago at 300. This remains true despite the \nfact that Admad Ressam, the Algerian who planned to blow up the Los \nAngeles International Airport in 1999, and who has been linked to those \ninvolved in the September 11 attacks, chose to enter the United States \nat our northern border. It will remain an inviting target until we \ndramatically improve our security.\n  The USA Act includes my proposals to provide the substantial and long \noverdue assistance for our law enforcement and border control efforts \nalong the Northern Border. My home State of Vermont has seen huge \nincreases in Customs and INS activity since the signing of NAFTA. The \nnumber of people coming through our borders has risen steeply over the \nyears, but our staff and our resources have not.\n  I proposed--and this legislation authorizes in section 402--tripling \nthe number of Border Patrol, INS inspectors, and Customs Service \nemployees in each of the States along the Northern Border. Alaska is \ncertainly one of those States. I was gratified when 22 Senators--\nDemocrats and Republicans--wrote to the President supporting such an \nincrease, and I am pleased that the administration agreed that this \ncritical law enforcement improvement should be included in the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. With \nthis clear statement of of the legislation I will not offer an \namendment to specifically name Alaska as a Northern Border State.\n\n\n                     alien terrorist removal court\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it had been my intention \nto offer an amendment which would strengthen provisions in the bill to \ndeal with known terrorist aliens. As Senator Lott well remembers, we \nworked in 1996, created the Alien Terrorist Removal Court, to hear \ncases against aliens who were known terrorist and to allow the Justice \nDepartment to deport these aliens without divulging classified \ninformation to the terrorist organization.\n  Mr. LOTT. I know the Senator from New Hampshire has been working a \nlong time on this issue. In fact, when he sponsored this legislation \nback in 1995, I was a cosponsor of his bill. He has been a leader on \nthis issue, he passed his legislation, and the Court was created.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. That is correct. As the leader knows, \nthere are some changes that are needed to improve the law, which is \nwhat my amendment was going to be about.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand, and I agree that the law needs to be \nstrengthened.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would say to my \ncolleagues, all the tools we are giving to the Justice Department in \nthis bill are irrelevant if we cannot deport these terrorist who are \nliving in our country preparing to terrorize American citizens. Page \n162 of the bill says the Attorney General shall place an alien in \nremoval proceedings within 7 days of catching him, or charge him with a \ncriminal act, or else the bill says ``the Attorney General shall \nrelease the alien.'' Mr. President, the problem is that most of these \nterrorist have not committed criminal acts until they are ready to \nattack. Therefore, in most of these cases, the only option is to deport \nthem.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is my opinion, that if we can deport known terrorist, we \nshould do it. We cannot let the Justice Department be barred because \nthe evidence was too sensitive to use in Court.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. That is exactly the problem. Under \ncurrent law, the Justice Department would have to give a declassified \nsummary of all the secret evidence used in the deportation proceedings \nto the terrorist. Now, why would we compromise our intelligence sources \nand methods by revealing sensitive intelligence information to a known \nterrorist? The intelligence community would never allow it, and with \ngood reason. But as a result, the Justice Department has never once \nused the alien terrorist removal court to deport anyone.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is my understanding, and it is a serious problem. I am \nin complete agreement with the Senator.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank the Leader. As I \nsaid, it had been my intention to offer an amendment to resolve this \nproblem by eliminating the requirement for the Attorney General to give \nthis sensitive information to the alien terrorist before deporting him. \nHowever, upon discussions with the Attorney General, who indicated to \nme that he supports this provision, and after discussions with the \nLeader, I have decided in the interest of moving this legislation to \nwithhold my amendment at this time, with the assurance of the Leader \nand the Administration that we will work to solve this problem in \nconference.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say to the Senator that he can count me as a \ncosponsor of this amendment. It is an excellent amendment, it is \nneeded, and I commit to the Senator that I will do my best to see that \nit is added in conference. I would further say to the Senator that I \nhave also talked about this issue with the Attorney General, and he \nindicated to me that the Administration supports your amendment and \nthat he will also work to support it in conference when we get to that \npoint. So, I appreciate his withholding at this time so we can get this \nbill to conference where we can work to get the Smith amendment added \nto greatly improve this bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Leader for his strong \nsupport, and I am pleased that the administration is also supportive. I \nknow how many long hours the Attorney General is putting in on this \nissue, and how committed he is to winning this war on terrorism. I look \nforward to passing this important provision which will be an invaluable \ntool for the Attorney General and the President in this war.\n\n\n                       deterring money laundering\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to clarify with Chairman \nSarbanes my understanding of the provision in Title III, the anti-money \nlaundering provisions in the antiterrorism package, entitled ``Section \n314. Cooperative Efforts to Deter Money Laundering''.\n  As the Chairman is well aware, Section 314(b) is intended to address \nconcerns about regulatory barriers that stand in the way of developing \nefficient mechanisms and services that financial institutions can use \nto fulfill their regulatory compliance obligations. The regulations to \nbe issued by the Secretary, and potentially by bank and thrift \nregulators as well, could further this purpose by reconciling rules \nthat could be interpreted in a way that places conflicting burdens on \nfinancial institutions.\n  Does that comport with the Chairman's understanding of the intent of \nthe provision and how that intent could best be carried out by the \nregulators?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator for his question. Yes, that is also \nmy understanding of Section 314.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am going to support this legislation, \nand I want to commend the leadership--Senators Daschle and Lott--and \nSenators Leahy and Hatch, for their efforts in developing the bill. \nClearly, there is no higher priority than combating terrorism and \nprotecting our national security. At the same time, I do have real \nconcerns about the process by which this legislation has come to the \nfloor, and about the implications of some provisions for fundamental \ncivil liberties.\n  There are several provisions in this legislation that make a real, \npositive contribution to the fight against terrorism. Other senators \nhave discussed\n\n[[Page S10588]]\n\nsome of the highlights in more depth, so let me just focus on a few.\n  First, this bill includes legislation approved by the Senate \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, on which I sit, that \nwill help authorities crack down on money laundering. This is essential \nif we are to deprive terrorists of resources. The bill will require \nadditional reporting of suspicious transactions, require identification \nof the foreign owners of certain U.S. accounts, and impose other \nrequirements on financial institutions to give authorities a greater \nability to identify and prosecute money launderers. I also note that \nthe bill includes a provision I authored that calls for a study into \nthe possibility of expanding the legislation to include hedge funds and \nother investment services that also can be used by terrorists to \nlaunder money.\n  Beyond the money laundering provisions, I also am pleased that this \nbill provides additional funding for the victims of terrorism. Coming \nfrom New Jersey, where thousands of our residents have been victimized \nby the tragedy at the World Trade Center, this is especially important \nto me. In my view, we as a nation have a responsibility to ensure that \nterrorism victims and their families are not left alone and \nuncompensated. That is why I am pleased that the bill would replenish \nthe antiterrorism emergency reserve, replace the annual cap on the \nCrime Victim Fund, authorize private contributions to the fund, and \nstrengthen services for victims in other ways. While this is not all \nthat we should be doing for victims and their families, I appreciate \nthe work of the leaders in focusing on their needs.\n  I also pleased that the bill would triple the number of Border \nPatrol, Customs Service and immigration inspectors at our northern \nborder. This would significantly enhance security over an area that, \nuntil now, has been seriously understaffed. The bill also authorizes \n$100 million to improve INS and Customs technology and additional \nequipment for monitoring the U.S.-Canada border.\n  In addition, I want to highlight language in this bill that would \nestablish two new crimes related to bioterrorism, including provisions \nto prohibit certain people from possessing a listed biological agent or \ntoxin. There are many other things we need to do to prepare for the \nthreat of a biological or chemical attack, and I have introduced \nrelated legislation, S. 1508, that would require states to develop \ncoordinated plans, and that would provide additional resources for \nhospitals and other health care providers. The threat of bioterrorism \nis real, and I would hope that our leaders will bring related \nlegislation to the Senate floor as soon as possible.\n\n  While I support the provisions in this bill on money laundering, \nvictim services, border enforcement, and bioterrorism, I do have \nserious concerns about the way this bill was put together, and about \nother provisions that raise serious questions about the protection of \ncivil liberties.\n  It is deeply troubling to me that we would be taking up a bill that \ndeals with such sensitive civil liberties matters without comprehensive \nhearings, and without even consideration by the relevant committee. We \nare talking about a 243-page bill that was developed behind closed \ndoors by a handful of people operating under enormous time pressure. \nThis is a bill that raises fundamental questions that go to the very \nessence of our democracy, and our freedoms. It's not something that \nshould be done in haste, with so little opportunity for input from \noutside experts, the public, and all senators.\n  Perhaps because the legislation was developed so quickly, and in an \nenvironment so dominated by great public anxiety about security, there \nis a real risk that we will make serious mistakes.\n  I am especially concerned about the provisions in this bill that \nrequire the detention of immigrants who are not terrorists, who are not \ncriminals, but are merely suspected of future wrongdoing. In fact, \nthese provisions go further than that. Lawful permanent residents who \nare charged with being deportable on terrorism grounds could be held \nindefinitely even if an immigration judge determines that the terrorism \ncharges are false.\n  I understand that we need to give the government sufficient authority \nto protect Americans from those who pose a real threat to public \nsafety. But this provision goes too far. And I hope it can be corrected \nin conference.\n  Similarly, there are other provisions of this legislation that seem \nvery loosely drafted, and that could, perhaps unintentionally, lead to \ninfringement on important civil liberties. For example, many have \nraised serious questions about provisions relating to law enforcement \nsurveillance of Internet and telephone use, and about other provisions \nthat give the government extensive new powers to conduct secret \nsearches. These and other provisions do not seem to have received \nadequate scrutiny. I am hopeful that they can be examined more closely \nin conference, and any needed improvements can be made before the \nlegislation is sent to the President.\n  I also would urge our conferees to accept a provision, like one \nincluded in the House version of this legislation, that would set a \ntime limit on the application of certain provisions that pose the \ngreatest threats to civil liberties. In my view, that's especially \nimportant since we have rushed this legislation through the Senate so \nquickly. As I said, I am hopeful that we can identify and correct any \nmistakes in conference. But we still seem to be operating on a rush \nbasis, and I suspect that some mistakes are inevitable. Given the \nstakes involved, I think it would be better to make many of these \nprovisions temporary, and then revisit these issues when we have more \ntime to thoroughly consider all their implications.\n  In the end, while I do have serious concerns about certain aspects of \nthis legislation, I have decided to support the effort to move it to \nconference. Our nation has just suffered the most horrendous act of \nterrorism in our history, and we are facing serious threats of other \nterrorist attacks. A vast, well-organized and well-funded terrorist \nnetwork has gone to war against our nation. And while we should not \noverreact, or erode basic freedoms, we do have to defend ourselves.\n  We must give our law enforcement officials the tools they need to \nfind and destroy these terrorist networks. And this legislation should \nhelp. But we need to continue to review and improve its provision as we \ngo to conference. And we will need to continue to closely review the \nimplementation of the legislation after it is enacted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I support this bill, but I do so only \nwith some reservations.\n  We are giving broad new powers to our law enforcement and \nintelligence communities--without the traditional safeguards of \njudicial review and congressional oversight.\n  I believe that many provisions of the bill, particularly those \nsections dealing with electronic eavesdropping and computer trespass, \nremain seriously flawed and may infringe on civil liberties.\n  I am voting for this bill today with the strong hope that it will be \nimproved in a conference with the House. As it currently stands, the \nSenate bill breaks down the traditional separation of domestic criminal \nmatters governed by the fourth amendment right against unjustified \nsearch and seizure--from the gathering of international intelligence \ninformation traditionally gathered without the same concern for \nconstitutional rights.\n  I strongly believe that we should have included in this bill a sunset \nprovision that would give Congress the opportunity to reassess whether \nthese new tools are yielding the intended results in the war on terror, \nand I am hopeful that the final bill will emerge with this and other \nimprovements.\n  If this bill is not improved through a conference process or other \nnegotiation, I reserve the right to vote against a conference report.\n  However, I also believe this bill contains many provisions that will \nsignificantly advance our battle against terrorism. I thank the \nChairman for his hard work on these provisions and appreciate his \nefforts particularly to strengthen security on our northern border.\n  Among the most important provisions in this bill is the authorization \nto triple staffing across our northern border.\n  These increases in manpower are desperately needed. The northern \nborder is\n\n[[Page S10589]]\n\npatrolled by only 300 border patrol agents in contrast to the 9,000 on \nthe southern border. More critically, at points of entry where suspect \npersons have repeatedly tried to enter or have entered, we currently \nlack sufficient staffing to allow Customs and INS inspectors and INS \nagents to do their job well. We place a tremendous responsibility on \nthe individuals charged with deciding whom to admit and whom to turn \naway.\n  One additional new tool this bill provides is the establishment of a \nvisa technology standard to help secure our border. I personally worked \nto get language included in this bill that requires the State \nDepartment and the Department of Justice to develop a shared technology \nstandard--so that we can be certain each individual who seeks entry \ninto our country on a visa--is the person he or she claims to be.\n  American citizenship comes with deeply valued privileges and rights. \nOne of the most basic of those rights is privacy. To require a \nfingerprint or a digital photograph of an alien seeking to enter our \ncountry is a reasonable and effective way to improve our ability to \nkeep terrorists out of this country while still welcoming a vibrant \nflow of legal immigrants.\n\n  Unfortunately, aspects of this bill that impose unreasonable and \nunwarranted requirements on legal immigrants, greatly expand electronic \neavesdropping, and potentially provide law enforcement easy access to \nsome types of email communications--remain troubling.\n  I would like to believe that the expansion of the ability of the \ngovernment to place wiretaps on the lines of American citizens--done in \nsecret with insignificant reporting or opportunity for oversight by the \nCongress--will not be abused.\n  I would like to believe that technologies like that technologies like \nCarnivore will not be used to derive content from email communications.\n  But I am skeptical.\n  Several other aspects of this bill, when taken together, also have \nthe potential to interfere with Americans' enjoyment of their right to \nprivacy without providing value in the fight against terrorists.\n  Those of us who feel strongly about how new powers might chip away at \ntraditional privacy rights will closely watch how law enforcement uses \nthese tools.\n  The events of September 11 have changed us as a country forever. We \nhave been attacked on our own soil. Thousands have died, thousands more \nhave been injured. Very simply, we must do all that we can to stop \nterrorism by finding and disrupting terrorist activities here and \nabroad. The challenge we face is to do this without compromising the \nvalue that make Americans unique and have allowed us to become great: \nrespect for personal autonomy and the rights of the individual; and \ntolerance of all regardless of race or religion.\n  While I will vote for this bill, I also promise to engage in vigilant \noversight of these new powers, and I urge those in the law enforcement \nand intelligence communities to use these powers wisely and with great \ndeliberation.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1510, the Uniting \nand Strengthening America Act.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, we face two difficult and delicate \ntasks: to strengthen our security in order to prevent future terrorist \nattacks, and at the same time, to safeguard the individual liberties \nthat make America a beacon of freedom to all the world.\n  I believe that when the President signs this anti-terrorism \nlegislation into law, we will have achieved those two goals as best we \nnow can.\n  The act is a far-reaching bill. I will mention just a few key aspects \nof that bill.\n  First, the legislation brings our surveillance laws into the 21st \ncentury. Here are two of many examples. Under current law, the FBI can \nuse a basic search warrant to access answering machine messages, but \nthe FBI needs a different kind of warrant to get to voice mail. This \nlaw says the FBI can use a traditional warrant for both. Another \nexample: Under current law, a Federal court can authorize many \nelectronic surveillance warrants only within the court's limited \njurisdiction. If the target of the investigation is in the judge's \njurisdiction, but the subject of the warrant is technically an internet \nservice provider located elsewhere, the warrant is no good as to that \nISP. This bill allows the court overseeing an investigation to issue \nvalid warrants nationwide.\n  Second, the act gives law enforcement officers and the foreign \nintelligence community the ability to share intelligence information \nwith each other in defined contexts. For example, the act says that \nunder specified conditions, the FBI may share wiretap and grand jury \ninformation related to foreign- and counter-intelligence. I appreciate \nconcerns that this information-sharing authority could be abused. Like \nChairman Leahy, I would have preferred to see greater judicial \noversight of these data exchanges. But I also believe we simply cannot \nprevail in the battle against terrorism if the right hand of our \ngovernment has no idea what the left hand is doing.\n  Third, the act enhances intelligence authorities under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). When I met with FBI agents in \nNorth Carolina shortly after September 11, they told me their number \none priority was to streamline the FISA process. We've done that. We've \nsaid, for example, that the renewal periods of certain key FISA orders \nmay be longer than the initial periods. This makes sure the FBI can \nfocus on investigations, not duplicative court applications.\n  A more controversial change concerns the purpose of FISA \nsurveillance. Under current law, a FISA wiretap order may only enter if \nthe primary purpose of the surveillance is foreign intelligence \ngathering. The administration initially proposed changing the ``primary \npurpose'' requirement to a requirement of ``a purpose,'' any foreign \nintelligence purpose. At a recent Intelligence Committee hearing, I was \none of several Senators to raise constitutional questions about the \nAdministration's initial proposal. The last thing we want is to see \nFISA investigations lost, and convictions overturned, because the \nsurveillance is not constitutional. S. 1510 says that FISA surveillance \nrequires not just ``a purpose,'' but ``a significant purpose,'' of \nforeign intelligence gathering. That new language is a substantial \nimprovement that I support. In applying this ``significant purpose'' \nrequirement, the FISA court will still need to be careful to enter FISA \norders only when the requirements of the Constitution as well as the \nstatute are satisfied. As the Department of Justice has stated in its \nletter regarding the proposed FISA change, the FISA court has ``an \nobligation,'' whatever the statutory standard, ``to reject FISA \napplications that do not truly qualify'' as constitutional. I \nanticipate continued close congressional oversight and inquiry in this \narea.\n  A forth step taken by this legislation is to triple the number of \nBorder Patrol, INS inspectors, and Customs Service agents along our \n4,000-mile northern border. Today there are just 300 border patrol \nagents to guard those 4,000 miles. Orange cones are too often our only \ndefenses against illegal entries. This bill will change that.\n  Fifth, the bill expedites the hiring of translators by the FBI. It is \nunthinkable that our law enforcement agents could have critical raw \nintelligence that they simply cannot understand because they do not \nknow the relevant language. This statute will help to change that state \nof affairs.\n  Finally, the bill makes the criminal law tougher on terrorists. We \nmake it a crime to possess a biological agent or toxin in an amount \nwith no reasonable, peaceful purpose, a crime to harbor a terrorist, a \ncrime to provide material support to terrorism. And we say that when \nyou commit a crime of terrorism, you can be prosecuted for that crime \nfor the rest of your life, with no limitations period. Statutes of \nlimitations guarantee what lawyers call ``repose.'' Terrorists deserve \nno repose.\n  As Chairman Leahy and Senator Hatch have both said, this legislation \nis not perfect, and the House-Senate Conference may yet make \nimprovements. For example, the Conference might clarify that, as to \naliens detained as national security threats, the law will secure the \ndue process protections and judicial review required by the \nConstitution and by the Supreme Court's recent decisions in Zadvydas v. \nDavis and INS v. St. Cyr. The Conference might also sensibly include a\n\n[[Page S10590]]\n\nsunset of the new surveillance authorities, ensuring that Congress will \nreconsider this bill's provisions, which touch such cherished \nliberties, in light of further experience and reflection.\n  The bill is not perfect, but it is a good bill, it is important for \nthe Nation, and I am pleased to support it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the antiterrorism \nbill, S. 1510. The bill would provide our nation's law enforcement with \nimportant tools to more effectively investigate and prevent further \nattacks against the people of the United States.\n  At the outset, in response to concerns that some have raised, I want \nto make clear that we are not rushing to pass ill-conceived \nlegislation.\n  During the past two Congresses, when I chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Technology and Terrorism, the Subcommittee \nheld 19 hearings on terrorism. I want to repeat that: 19. The witnesses \nwho appeared before the Subcommittee included the then-Director of the \nFBI Louis Freeh and representatives of all three of the \ncongressionally-mandated commissions on terrorism that have issued \nreports over the last two years. Additional hearings on terrorism were \nheld by the full Judiciary Committee and by other committees.\n  Many of the provisions contained in the Attorney General's proposed \nlegislation mirror the recommendations of one or more of the major \nterrorism commissions and have already been examined by the committee \nof jurisdiction. In fact, some of these provisions have already been \nvoted on and passed by the Senate.\n  Indeed, as I will discuss more fully in a minute, the language sent \nforward by the Attorney General to establish nationwide trap and trace \nauthority was included in the Hatch-Feinstein-Kyl Amendment to the \nrecently passed Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill. Much of \nthe remaining language in that amendment was included in the \nCounterterrorism Act of 2000, which the Senate passed last fall, after \na terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole killed 17 American sailors and \ninjured another 39. That bill was based on recommendations of the \nbipartisan, congressionally-mandated National Commission on Terrorism, \nknown as the Bremmer Commission, which was established in 1998 in \nresponse to the embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya.\n  One particularly important provision, which was included in the both \nthe CJS bill and the current bill, updates the law to keep pace with \ntechnology. The provision on pen register and trap and trace devices 1. \nWould allow judges to enter pen/trap orders with nationwide scope and \n2. Would codify current caselaw that holds that pen/trap orders apply \nto modern communication technologies such as e-mail and the Internet, \nin addition to traditional phone lines.\n\n  Nationwide jurisdiction for a court order will help law enforcement \nto quickly identify other members of a criminal organization such as a \nterrorist cell. Indeed, last year Director Freeh testified before the \nTerrorism Subcommittee that one of the problems law enforcement faces \nis ``the jurisdictional limitation of pen registers and trap-and-trace \norders issued by federal courts.'' [Source: Hearing before the \nSubcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information of \nthe Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 106th Cong, 2nd Sess. (March 28, \n2000), at 31.]\n  He continued: ``Today's electronic crimes, which occur at the speed \nof light, cannot be effectively investigated with procedural devices \nforged in the last millennium during the infancy of the information \ntechnology age.'' [Source: Id. at 32.]\n  Currently, to track a communication that is purposely routed through \nInternet Service Providers located in different states, law enforcement \nmust obtain multiple court orders. This is because, under current law, \na Federal court can order only those communications carriers within its \ndistrict to provide tracing information to law enforcement.\n  According to Director Freeh's testimony before the Terrorism \nSubcommittee, ``As a result of the fact that investigators typically \nhave to apply for numerous court orders to trace a single \ncommunication, there is a needless waste of time and resources, and a \nnumber of important investigations are either hampered or derailed \nentirely in those instances where law enforcement gets to a \ncommunications carrier after that carrier has already discarded the \nnecessary information.'' [Source: Id. at 31.]\n  Section 216 of the Senate bill solves this problem.\n  I would also like to address another important provision.\n  Section 802 is intended more clearly to criminalize the possession of \nbiological and toxin agents by those who should not possess them. This \nsection amends the implementing legislation for the 1972 ``Convention \non the Prohibition of the Development, Production, and Stockpiling of \nBactiological, Biological, and Toxin Weapons and on their \nDestruction'', BWC. Article I of the BWC prohibits the development, \nproduction, stockpiling, acquisition, or retention of Microbial or \nother biological agents, or toxins, whatever their origin or method of \nproduction, of types and in quantities that have no justification for \nprophylactic, protective, or other peaceful purposes. It is not the \nintent of the BWC, nor is it the intent of Section 802, to prevent the \nlegitimate application of biological agents or toxins for prophylactic, \nprotective, bona fide research, or other peaceful purposes. These \npurposes include, inter alia, medical and national health activities, \nand such national security activities as may include the confiscation, \nsecuring, and/or destruction of possible illegal biological substances.\n\n  Finally, let me address briefly the concern voiced by some that we \nare in danger of ``trampling civil liberties.'' I reiterate that we are \nnot rushing, that we have had thorough, deliberative hearings, and that \nmany of the proposals have already been passed by the Senate. Nothing \nin the current bill impinges on civil liberties. The bill would give \nFederal agencies fighting terrorism the same tools we have given those \nfighting illicit drugs, or even postal fraud. Many of the tools in the \nbill are modernizations of the criminal laws, necessitated by the \nadvent of the Internet.\n  While some of these tools are extremely helpful in terrorism \ninvestigations, it makes no sense to refuse to apply these common sense \nchanges to other crimes that are committed, like kidnapping, drug \ndealing, and child pornography. It is unwise to limit these tools to \nonly terrorism offenses because often, at the outset of an \ninvestigation of a particular person or crime, law enforcement does not \nknow what you are dealing with. A credit-card fraud case or a false \nimmigration documents case may turn out to be connected to funding or \nfacilitating the operations of a terrorist group. We should give law \nenforcement the tools it needs to have the best chance of discovering \nand disrupting these activities.\n  We have a responsibility to the people of this nation to ensure that \nthose who are charged with protecting us from future terrorist attacks \nare empowered to do so. This is not a zero sum game. We can both ensure \nour security and protect our liberties.\n  We cannot afford to lose this race against terror, and we cannot \nafford to give the enemy in this war a full lap head-start. I support \nthis bill. I commend President Bush and General Ashcroft for submitting \na sound proposal to the Senate, and for their tremendous efforts during \nthe past month.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the all of the other provisions in this \nantiterrorism legislation that will provide our law enforcement \ncommunities with the tools to weed out and stop terrorism, I want to \nexpress my support for the immigration provisions upon which the \nadministration, Senators Hatch, Kennedy, Leahy and I have reached \nagreement, and which are included in this bill.\n  Even with the passage of these provisions, however, the United States \nwill continue to face overwhelming infrastructure and personnel needs \nat our consular offices abroad, along both the southern and northern \nborder, and in our immigration offices throughout the United States. In \nconjunction with increasing personnel and infrastructure, the U.S. must \ndeprive terrorists of the ability to present altered international \ndocuments, and improve the dissemination of information about suspected\n\n[[Page S10591]]\n\nterrorists to all appropriate agencies. Senator Feinstein and I, in a \nhearing of the Terrorism Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee this \nFriday, will continue to assess these needs by hearing from Justice and \nState Department officials.\n  So, our actions on immigration reform as it is relates to terrorism \nmust go beyond the scope of this anti-terrorism package. With that \nsaid, this bill will certainly provide a better legal framework for \nkeeping foreign terrorists out of the United States, and detaining them \nshould they enter.\n  First, this antiterrorism bill clarifies that the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation is authorized to share data from its ``most wanted \nlist,'' and any other information contained in its national crime-\ninformation system, with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and \nthe State Department. This will help the INS and State Department \nidentify suspected terrorists before they come to the United States, \nand should they gain entry, will help track them down on our soil. It \nalso allows the State Department, during a U.S. criminal investigation, \nto give foreign governments information on a case-by-case basis about \nthe issuance or refusal to issue a U.S. visa.\n  The bill will also clarify U.S. law prohibiting the entry of, and \nrequiring the removal of, individual alien terrorists. It will probably \nsurprise the Members of this body a great deal to know that, under \ncurrent law, a terrorist alien is not considered either inadmissible \nto, or deportable from, the United States even if he or she has \n``endorsed or espoused terrorist activity that undermines the efforts \nof the United States to fight terrorism,'' or has provided ``material \nsupport to a terrorist organization.'' Nor is an individual deportable \nfor being a ``representative of a terrorist organization.'' The anti-\nterrorism bill makes it clear to U.S. officials considering whether to \nallow someone to come to the country, that a person meeting any one of \nthese criteria is not welcome here.\n\n  In addition, the anti-terrorism package that we are debating today \nfurther defines what is considered by the United States to be a \nterrorist organization. Under current law, a terrorist organization \nmust be designated by the Secretary of State under Section 219 of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act. This process can take several months, \nand has been criticized by some experts as potentially politically \ncorruptible. Under this Senate anti-terrorism package, Section 219 \nremains in effect. A separate designation process is added, whereby an \norganization can be designated by the Secretary of State or the \nAttorney General, in consultation with each other, with seven days' \nnotice to the leadership of the House and Senate and the congressional \ncommittees of jurisdiction. Additionally, an organization, whether or \nnot it is formally designated by the Secretary of State or the Attorney \nGeneral, can be considered to be terrorist if it is made up of two or \nmore individuals who commit or plan to commit terrorist activities.\n  The Senate's antiterrorism package also has provisions regarding \ntemporary detention. It allows for the temporary detention of aliens \nwho the Attorney General certifies that he has ``reasonable grounds to \nbelieve is inadmissible or deportable under the terrorism grounds.'' \nThis compromise represents a bipartisan understanding that the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States needs the flexibility to detain suspected \nterrorists. Under the compromise that Members have reached, the \nAttorney General must charge an alien with a deportable violation or he \nmust release the alien. The underlying certification, and all \ncollateral matters, can be reviewed by the U.S. District Court of the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the Attorney General is required to report to \nCongress every six months on the use of this detention provision.\n  Finally, the Senate package, as a result of amendments added by \nSenator Byrd, will determine whether ``consular shopping''--i.e., \nsomeone has a visa application pending from his or her home country, \nbut goes to another country for adjudication--is a problem. If so, the \nSecretary of State must recommend ways to remedy it. Another authorizes \n$36.8 million for quick implementation of the INS foreign student \ntracking system, a program that I have repeatedly urged be implemented.\n  As former chairman and now ranking Republican of the Judiciary \nCommittee's Terrorism Subcommittee, I have long suggested, and strongly \nsupported, many of the anti-terrorism and immigration initiatives now \nbeing advocated by Republicans and Democrats alike. In my sadness about \nthe overwhelming and tragic events that took thousands of precious \nlives, I am resolved to push forward on all fronts to fight against \nterrorism. That means delivering justice to those who are responsible \nfor the lives lost on September 11, and reorganizing the institutions \nof government so that the law-abiding can continue to live their lives \nin freedom.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconsensus terrorism bill now on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  The people of the United States awoke on September 12 to a whole new \nworld, one in which we can no longer feel safe within our borders. We \nawoke to a world in which our very way of life is under attack, and we \nhave since resolved to fight back with every tool at our disposal.\n  This is an unprecedented state of affairs, and it demands \nunprecedented action. We must seek out and defeat individuals and \ngroups who would build upon the September 11 attacks with more of their \nown. We simply must give law enforcement officials the tools they need \nto track, to hunt down, and to capture terrorists, both in this \ncountry, and around the world as well. And that is what this bill would \ndo.\n  Let me just describe some of the key provisions of this legislation, \nand how those provisions will make an impact, even in the current \ninvestigation into the September 11 attacks.\n  First, this bill makes it easier to collect foreign intelligence \ninformation under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA. \nUnder current law, authorities can proceed with surveillance under FISA \nonly if the primary purpose of the investigation is to collect foreign \nintelligence.\n  But in today's world things are not so simple. In many cases, \nsurveillance will have two key goals--the gathering of foreign \nintelligence, and the gathering of evidence for a criminal prosecution. \nDetermining which purpose is the ``primary'' purpose of the \ninvestigation can be difficult, and will only become more so as we \ncoordinate our intelligence and law enforcement efforts in the war \nagainst terror.\n  Rather than forcing law enforcement to decide which purpose is \nprimary--law enforcement or foreign intelligence gathering, this bill \nstrikes a new balance. It will now require that a ``significant'' \npurpose of the investigation must be foreign intelligence gathering to \nproceed with surveillance under FISA.\n  The effect of this provision will be to make it easier for law \nenforcement to obtain a FISA search or surveillance warrant for those \ncases where the subject of the surveillance is both a potential source \nof valuable intelligence and the potential target of a criminal \nprosecution. Many of the individuals involved in supporting the \nSeptember 11 attacks may well fall into both of these categories.\n  This language is a negotiated compromise between those who wished the \nlaw to stay the same, and those who wished to virtually eliminate the \nforeign intelligence standard entirely.\n  The administration originally proposed changing ``primary purpose'' \nto ``a purpose,'' but when I questioned Attorney General Ashcroft at \nour Judiciary Committee hearing, he agreed that ``significant purpose'' \nwould represent a good compromise.\n  Second, this legislation will provide multi-point authority, or so-\ncalled ``roving wiretap authority'' in foreign intelligence \ninvestigations. This provision is designed to defeat attempts to evade \nlaw enforcement by simply switching cell phones or moving locations.\n  Under current law, law enforcement must get a wiretap order for each \nindividuals phone line. Criminals and terrorists know this, so they \noften manage to defeat surveillance by simply moving locations or \nexchanging countless disposable or even stolen cell phones.\n  This legislation will now allow the surveillance to follow the \nperson, wherever or however that person is communicating. So, no longer \nwill duplicative\n\n[[Page S10592]]\n\nwiretap orders be necessary simply to listen to the same, single target \nof an investigation. This is a powerful change to the law that does not \nput innocent conversations in danger, but stops the evasion of \nsurveillance now possible under the law.\n  Third, this legislation allows nationwide service of so-called ``pen \nregister'' and ``trap and trace'' orders. Those orders allow law \nenforcement to track incoming and outgoing phone calls, and now \nInternet addressing, so that the authorities can make connections \nbetween various criminals or terrorists.\n  The problem with current law is that it has not kept up with \ntechnology. Modern communications travel through many jurisdictions \nbefore reaching their final destinations, and current law requires \ncourt orders from every jurisdiction through which the communication \ntravels.\n  Under this new legislation, only one court order will be necessary, \neliminating the time-consuming and burdensome requirements now placed \non law enforcement simply because technology has changed the way \ncommunications travel from one place to the other. Law enforcement \nresources should be spent in the field, not filing unnecessarily \nburdensome motions in courtroom after courtroom.\n\n  I should also mention one important point about this provision. The \nstandard necessary to get a court-ordered pen register or trap and \ntrace is lower than the standard necessary to get a wiretap, so it was \nvery important to make sure that this legislation makes it clear that \nthese orders do not allow law enforcement to eavesdrop on or read the \ncontent of communication. Only the origin and destination of the \nmessages will be intercepted.\n  This legislation also authorizes the seizure of voice-mail messages \npursuant to a probable cause warrant, which is an easier standard for \nlaw enforcement to meet than the standard required for a wiretap.\n  Current law treats a voice-mail like an ongoing oral communication, \nand requires law enforcement to obtain a wiretap order to seize and \nlisten to those saved messages. E-mails, however, receive no similar \nprotection. In my opinion, if law enforcement can access e-mail \ncommunications with probable cause, the same should be the case with \nvoice-mails. And so it will be once this legislation passes.\n  This legislation will also now allow for limited sharing of grand \njury and other criminal investigation information with the intelligence \ncommunity, to assist in the prevention of terrorist acts and the \napprehension of the terrorists themselves.\n  Under current law, law enforcement officials involved in a grand jury \ninvestigation cannot share information gathered in the grand jury with \nthe intelligence community, even if that information would prevent a \nfuture terrorist act.\n  Under this legislation, grand jury and other criminal investigative \ninformation can be shared if one, the information can is foreign \nintelligence and counterintelligence information, as defined by \nstatute; two, the information is given to an official with a need to \nknow in the performance of his or her official duties; and three, \nlimitations on public or other unauthorized disclosure would remain in \nforce.\n  This balance makes sense, I believe strongly that grand jury \ninformation should not be leaked to the public or disclosed haphazardly \nto anyone. But at the same time, it makes perfect sense to allow our \nown law enforcement officials to talk to each other about ongoing \ninvestigations, and to coordinate their efforts to capture terrorists \nwherever they may be.\n  This legislation also contains a heavily negotiated provision \nregarding the detention of aliens suspected of links to terrorism \nwithout charging them. Agreement was reached to one, limit to 7 days \nthe length of time an alien may be held before being charged with \ncriminal or immigration violations, two, allow the Attorney General to \ndelegate the certification power only to the INS Commissioner, and \nthree, specify that the merits of the certification is subject to \njudicial review.\n  This legislation also contains several key provisions from a bill I \nintroduced last month with the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nSenator Graham. For instance, the bill: Clarifies the role of the CIA \ndirector as the coordinator of strategies and priorities for how the \ngovernment uses its limited surveillance resources; requires that law \nenforcement officers who discover foreign intelligence information in \nthe course of a criminal investigation share that information with the \nintelligence community; includes ``international terrorist activities'' \nin the definition of ``foreign intelligence'' to clarify the \nauthorities of the CIA; includes a sense of Congress that the CIA \nshould make efforts to recruit informants in the fight against \nterrorism, even if some of those informants may, as is likely the case, \nnot be ideal citizens; requires a report from the CIA on the \nfeasibility of establishing a virtual translation center for use by the \nintelligence community, so that translators around the country can \nassist in investigations taking place far, far away. For instance, this \ncenter would allow a translator living in Los Angeles to assist law \nenforcement in New York without even leaving California; and finally, \nagreement was reached to require the Attorney General, in consultation \nwith the CIA Director, to provide training to federal, state and local \ngovernment officials to identify foreign intelligence information \nobtained in the course of their duties.\n\n  In addition, this bill also: Triples the number of Border Patrol, \nCustoms Service, and INS inspectors at the northern border; authorizes \n$50 million to improve INS and Customs technology for monitoring the \nnorthern border and to add equipment on the border; lifts the statute \nof limitations on terrorist acts as defined by law where those crimes \nresulted in, or created a risk of, death or serious bodily injury. \nThese crimes include bio-terrorism, attacks against airports or \nairplanes, arson or bombings of U.S. facilities, and other terrorist \nacts; adds this same list of terrorist crimes certain as predicates for \nRICO and money laundering; creates two new bio-terrorism crimes, the \nfirst prohibits certain restricted persons, including nonresident \naliens from countries that support terrorism, from possessing a listed \nbiological agent or toxin; and the second prohibits any person from \npossessing a biological agent, toxin, or delivery system of a type or \nin a quantity that, under the circumstances, is not reasonably \njustified by a peaceful purpose.\n  The Attorney General and the President of the United States have \nasked this Congress to give them legislation that will assist in the \nwar against terrorism, and I am one who believes very strongly that we \nshould do so, and we should do so quickly.\n  This bill is a product of intense negotiations, and I believe that a \ngood balance has been struck here. Compromises have been reached on the \nmost controversial provisions, roving wiretap authority; trap and trace \nof computer routing information; sharing of grand jury information; and \nmandatory detention of aliens suspected of terrorism.\n  Although I no longer believe it to be necessary now that these \ncompromises have been reached, I would support a five-year sunset on \nthe provisions I just mentioned as a valuable check on the potential \nabuse of the new powers granted in the bill.\n  But a two-year sunset, such as the one contained in the House bill, \nis simply too short to allow law enforcement to accomplish what it \nneeds to do to rout terrorists from this country.\n  The legislation before us contains provisions that could actually \nhelp in the current investigation into Osama bin Laden and his network \nin the United States and abroad.\n  I urge this Senate to pass this legislation and get it to the \nPresident for his signature. We are in a sustained war against terror, \nand we have waited long enough. I\n\n\n                  FISA AND PEN REGISTER/TRAP AND TRACE\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would like to raise several concerns \nregarding the provisions of this legislation, the USA Act of 2001, that \nexpand wiretapping authority under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act of 1978, and amend Federal pen register and trap and \ntrace authorities.\n  Both of these changes purport to improve communication between law \nenforcement and intelligence operatives. There is a difference, \nhowever, between facilitating the sharing of information between the \nlaw enforcement and intelligence communities, and blurring the\n\n[[Page S10593]]\n\nline between the missions of the two communities. Where information is \nsought for the purpose of law enforcement, we must ensure that fourth \namendment protections apply. Much of the fear about the legislation is \nbased on legitimate concern that information gathered ostensibly for \nintelligence and defense purposes could be used for law enforcement \npurposes. The intelligence community does not prosecute and lock up its \ntargets; it uses information to intervene against foreign nationals \nseeking to harm America. But the law enforcement community has a \ndifferent mission, to catch and prosecute criminals in our courts of \nlaw. Because law enforcement acts upon U.S. citizens, it must do so \nwithin the bounds of the Constitution. The differences in these \nmissions must be acknowledged, and we must be vigilant to maintain the \ndistinctions.\n  We can all agree that the events on September 11 have focused America \non the fight against terrorism, and we applaud the efforts of the \nadministration in the weeks since that tragic day. Clearly, there were \nfailures in our investigative network, and this legislation will \naddress some of those failures, allowing greater sharing of information \nthat could foil terrorists before they carry out their brutal schemes \nagainst innocent civilians.\n  I appreciate Chairman Leahy's tireless efforts to facilitate our \nintelligence gathering authorities while preserving our constitutional \nrights. The negotiations have been intense, but these are difficult and \ndivisive issues. Given the time frame, Chairman Leahy's charge has not \nbeen an easy one, but I appreciate the substantial progress he has \nmade.\n  I remain concerned that some of the legislative changes fail to \nbalance the increased powers to law enforcement against the need to \nprotect the civil liberties of Americans. With these changes to FISA, \nit will be much more likely that the FBI will be able to obtain secret \nFISA wiretaps on American citizens. That information may not only be \nused for intelligence purposes, but also in a criminal prosecution, \nwithout complying with the normal requirements of a title III wiretap \nand the safeguards it provides to adhere to the fourth amendment. Some \nhave warned that this language leaves room for ``fishing expeditions'' \nrather than properly authorized law enforcement activities. I would \nhope that this is not the case.\n  Although the language has been improved from the administration's \noriginal proposal and now would require that ``a significant,'' rather \nthan simply ``a,'' purpose for the wiretap must be the gathering of \nforeign intelligence, the possibility remains that the primary purpose \nof the wiretap would be a criminal investigation, without the \nsafeguards of the title III wiretap law and the protections under the \nfourth amendment that those fulfill.\n  I would like to ask the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee whether \nhe interprets this language in this same way.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, the Senator from Washington is correct. While \nimproved, the USA Act would make it easier for the FBI to use a FISA \nwiretap to obtain information where the Government's most important \nmotivation for the wiretap is for use in a criminal prosecution. This \nis a disturbing and dangerous change in the law. The Justice Department \nconcedes that ``the few courts that have addressed the issue have \nfollowed a primary purpose test'', October 1, 2001 Letter from Daniel \nJ. Bryant, Assistant Attorney General, p. 13.\n  I appreciate the administration's agreement to move off its original \nposition of changing the law to only require the FISA surveillance to \n``a'' purpose of collecting foreign intelligence information. Indeed, \nthe Justice Department's own constitutional analysis provided to the \nCommittee at the request of our Members does not even attempt to \njustify the original proposal, but instead presents argument for why a \nchange to ``a significant\" purpose would be constitutional.\n  I remain disappointed with the administration's insistence on forcing \nany change on this important statutory requirement. FISA was enacted \nfor the express purpose of clarifying that different legal standards \napply to those gathering foreign intelligence than to those seeking \ncriminal evidence. This new provision will blur that distinction, and \nit is indeed very problematic in my mind.\n  Federal courts have upheld FISA on the basis that what is reasonable \nunder the fourth amendment may vary when national security is at risk. \nThus, a FISA wiretap does not have to be based on probable cause to \nbelieve a crime has been or is about to be committed, and no notice is \ngiven unless the person is prosecuted. Further, while judges review \nwarrants on the merits when targets are U.S. persons, the primary \npurpose for the wiretap must be the protection of our national \nsecurity. Upon satisfaction of that critical condition, the statute \nauthorized the use of evidence obtained under a FISA wiretap for \ncriminal prosecution.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, although much effort has gone into \nnarrowing this provision to fit within the bounds of the Constitution, \nit would seem to me that this legislation may not stand up to this \ntest, and thus may fail judicial scrutiny. Regardless, we cannot await \ncourt review. I believe Congress must keep watch over the use of this \nprovision. May I ask the Chairman, do you agree that, under these \ncircumstances, it is incumbent upon the committee, which has \njurisdiction over the Department of Justice, to maintain vigilant \noversight of the Department in its use of FISA authorities after \nenactment of this legislation?\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with you completely, and you can rest assured that \nthe Judiciary Committee under my chairmanship will conduct meaningful \noversight, as we already have begun to do over the summer.\n  Although FISA requires oversight reporting to the Intelligence \nCommittees, the law makes clear that other Committees may also have \noversight jurisdiction. Section 108 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. 1808, states, \n``Nothing in this title shall be deemed to limit the authority and \nresponsibility of the appropriate committees of each House of Congress \nto obtain such information as they may need to carry out their \nrespective functions and duties.'' Section 306 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. 1826, \nprovides for semiannual reports from the Attorney General to the \nIntelligence and Judiciary Committees on the number of applications for \nphysical search orders made, granted, modified, or denied, and the \nnumber of physical searches which involved the property of United \nStates persons. The Judiciary Committee's responsibility will be \ngreater under the amendment to FISA, because of the greater authority \nto use FISA for law enforcement purposes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, similarly, I am concerned that revisions \nto the laws regarding pen registers and trap and trace devices may have \nfourth amendment implications. Although modified since we received the \noriginal language from the Administration, the new language could \nencourage greater use of technologies such as the FBI's ``Carnivore'' \nto access information that is protected by the fourth amendment.\n  The failure to properly define the term ``address'' in the e-mail \ncontext to exclude information protected by the Fourth Amendment will \nhaunt us for a long time. And I regret this. Although it certainly can \nbe said that new technologies are emerging and the definition may need \nbe flexible, the term ``address'' presently is undefined and new in the \ncontext of our Federal criminal statutes. Because of this ambiguity, we \nmay see law enforcement authorities take inconsistent approaches to \nfiltering information pursuant to this new law. There is risk that some \nwill obtain information, such as ``subject line'' information or URL \ncodes, that may otherwise be protected by the fourth amendment. There \nis certain to be judicial scrutiny of this provision.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with Senator Cantwell and thank her for bringing \nthese concerns to the attention of this body. I share these concerns.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I would like to suggest to the chairman, and I would be \nhappy to work closely with the Chairman on this, that the General \nAccounting Office provide to the Senate Judiciary Committee every six \nmonths a report on the use of the FISA wiretap authorities, and the \nexpanded pen register and trap and trace authorities, by the Federal \nBureau of Investigation or other agencies within the Department of \nJustice. I would certainly not suggest compromising the security of our\n\n[[Page S10594]]\n\nnation with such a report, so I would be content with closed-session \nhearings on the findings of such reports. But only with such oversight \ncan we reasonably assure our constituents that the use of these new \nauthorities is not impinging on our fourth amendment rights.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with Senator Cantwell and I appreciate her efforts \nto suggest restraint at the Department of Justice to avoid misusing the \nnew authorities we are contemplating using to address terrorism. I \nshare her view that the GAO should undertake this important assignment \nand will work with her and other Senators to see it accomplished. We \nall need to make certain that these new authorities are not abused.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the chairman for his diligence in working to \npreserve our fundamental rights.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am proud to be a co-sponsor of S. 1510, \nthe ``Uniting and Strengthening America Act'' or ``USA Act.'' This bill \nreflects a bipartisan effort to aid law enforcement, immigration, and \nthe intelligence community in investigating, detaining, and \napprehending suspected terrorists. This legislation follows lengthy \ncommittee inquiry, debate, and revision of legislation Attorney General \nAshcroft proposed a few weeks ago and which sparked national debate \nover whether civil rights would be violated.\n  During the past few weeks, Senate leaders have been working \ntirelessly with Attorney General Ashcroft in order to create a bill \nthat strengthens our existing laws with respect to apprehending \nterrorists, but still protects the civil rights of our citizens. This \nis an important mission for Congress. Everyone in America understands \nthe need for enforcement, immigration and the intelligence community to \nhave the tools necessary to find terrorists, cut-off their financial \nsupport, and bring them to Justice.\n  While I am committed to routing out terrorists here and abroad, I am \nequally committed to making sure the rights of innocent U.S. citizens \nare not violated. This includes the privacy and property rights our \nconstitution affords and that make this country so great. I believe \nthis bipartisan bill does both. This legislation strikes a balance \nbetween protecting our civil rights and assisting Attorney General \nAshcroft and others to do their jobs. While the Senate and House may \nlater debate some of the provisions in this legislation, be assured \nthat every member of Congress is united in this mission. We are totally \ncommitted to passing anti-terrorism legislation and apprehending the \nbin Ladens of this world.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is one of the most important \npieces of legislation we will consider during this Congress. The \nhorrific loss of life and destruction that occurred on September 11, \nthe crime against humanity, changed us as a country. The Uniting and \nStrengthening America Act is an opportunity to help ensure that such \nterrorist attacks do not occur again. We need to improve all aspects of \nour domestic security, including by enhancing our intelligence \ncapacities so that we can identify possible future attacks in their \nplanning stages and prevent them from happening. We must be vigilant \nand willing to invest the resources and time required to gather the \ninformation that we need to protect ourselves and our way of life.\n  I appreciate the enormous amount of time and energy that my colleague \nfrom Vermont and others have put into this legislation. They have done \ntheir best to balance the risk of further terrorist attacks with \npossible risks to civil liberties. The bill updates and improves a \nnumber of existing laws, it creates important new security statutes, \nand it authorizes new money for programs that will bring much needed \nrelief to victims of terrorist attacks. I have reservations about \ncertain provisions of the bill as they might affect civil liberties. I \nwish that it were more tightly targeted to address only actions \ndirectly related to terrorism or suspected terrorism. And I hope that \nby the time it passes as a conference report the bill will contain a \nsunset provision. But I support the bill today as a step toward \nconference, and as an important and needed strengthening of our \nsecurity from horrific attacks such as that of September 11.\n  The bill expands the Regional Information Sharing Systems Program to \npromote information sharing among Federal, State and local law \nenforcement agencies in their anti-terrorism efforts. State and local \nlaw enforcement have a critical role to play in preventing and \ninvestigating terrorism, and this bill provides them benefits \nappropriate to such duty. The bill streamlines and expedites the Public \nSafety Officers' Benefits application process for family members of \nfire-fighters, police officers and other emergency personnel who are \nkilled or suffer a disabling injury in connection with a future \nterrorist attack. And it raises the total amount of the Public Safety \nOfficers' Benefit Program payments from approximately $150,000 to \n$250,000.\n  This bill will also make an immediate difference in the lives of \nvictims of terrorism and their families. It refines the Victims of \nCrime Act and by doing so improves the way in which its crime fund is \nmanaged and preserved. It replenishes the emergency reserve of the \nCrime Victims Fund with up to $50 million and improves the mechanism to \nreplenish the fund in future years. The USA Act also increases security \non our Northern Border, including the border between Canada and my \nState of Minnesota. It triples the number of Border Patrol, Customs \nService and INS inspectors at the Northern Border and authorizes $100 \nmillion to improve old equipment and provide new technology to INS and \nthe Customs Service at that border.\n  On the criminal justice side, the bill clarifies existing \n``cybercrime'' law to cover computers outside the United States that \naffect communications in this country and changes sentencing guidelines \nin some of these cases. It provides prosecutors betters tools to go \nafter those involved in money-laundering schemes that are linked to \nterrorism, and it adds certain terrorism-related crimes as predicates \nfor RICO and money-laundering. It creates a new criminal statute \ntargeting acts of terrorism on mass transportation systems, and it \nstrengthens our Federal laws relating to the threat of biological \nweapons. The bill will enhance the Government's ability to prosecute \nsuspected terrorists in possession of biological agents. It will \nprohibit certain persons, particularly those from countries that \nsupport terrorism, from possessing biological agents. And it will \nprohibit any person from possessing a biological agent of a type or \nquantity that is not reasonably justified by a peaceful purpose.\n\n  The bill also broadens the authority of the President to impose \nsanctions on the Taliban regime. Regarding criminal penalties for those \nconvicted of terrorist acts, it provides a fair definition of what \nconstitutes ``terrorism'' and ensures that penalties more closely \nreflect the offenses committed by terrorists. Again, I'd like to thank \nmy colleague from Vermont and others who worked on these penalty \nprovisions. The administration's initial proposal was too broad in this \narea, and the current bill provides a fair alternative.\n  I strongly support these needed provisions. Still, I do have concerns \nabout the possible effect on civil liberties of the bill's measures to \nenhance electronic surveillance and information sharing of criminal \njustice information, while at the same time reducing judicial review of \nthose actions. I also hope that the bill's provisions to expand the \nGovernment's ability to conduct secret searches, as well as searches \nunder the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, will not be abused.\n  I believe we will need to monitor the use of new authorities provided \nto law enforcement agents to conduct surveillance of internet \ncommunications. The same is true of the bill's changes to laws allowing \nthe sharing of confidential criminal justice information with various \nFederal agencies. I would prefer the requirement of judicial review \nbefore disclosure, which is contained in the House version of this \nbill. Likewise, I believe the House of Representatives' decision not to \ninclude this bill's expansion of the Government's ability to conduct \nsecret, or so-called ``Sneak-n-Peek,'' searches, was correct. I hope \nthe safeguards against abuse we have added in our bill--such as the \nprohibition against the Government seizing any tangible property or \nstored electronic information unless it makes a showing of reasonable \nnecessity, as well as the requirement that notice be given within a \nreasonable time of the\n\n[[Page S10595]]\n\nexecution of a sneak-n-peak warrant--will prove sufficient.\n  The bill broadens the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, by \nextending FISA surveillance authority to criminal investigations, even \nwhen the primary purpose is not intelligence gathering. The bill limits \nthis ability by authorizing surveillance only if a significant purpose \nof it is to gather intelligence information. I hope this new FISA \nauthority will be used for the purpose of investigating and preventing \nterrorism or suspected terrorism, and not for other domestic purposes.\n  Mr. President, we have done our best in this bill to maximize our \nsecurity while minimizing the impact some of these changes may have on \nour civil liberties. Nearly all of us have probably said since \nSeptember 11 that if that day's terror is allowed to undermine our \ndemocratic principles and practices, then the terrorists will have won \na victory. We should pass this bill today. And we should also commit \nourselves to monitoring its impact on civil liberties in the coming \nmonths and years.\n  I believe a sunset provision that ensures that review is essential. \nThe bill before us today is good, but there are provisions that are too \nbroad. There are parts that should be more narrowly focused on \ncombating terrorism. I hope these are the concerns that will be \naddressed in conference. Mr. President, our challenge is to balance our \nsecurity with our liberties. While it is not perfect, I believe we are \ndoing that in this bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 1510, the anti-\nterrorism bill.\n  To more effectively fight terrorism and those who perpetrate it, we \nneed to improve law enforcement's intelligence gathering capability and \nenhance their ability to investigate and prosecute suspected \nterrorists. This measure does both. But let's also be realistic about \nthe act. It will not solve all of law enforcement's problems in \ncombating terrorism nor will it severely compromise our civil \nliberties. The truth lies somewhere in between.\n  The strongest proponents of the legislation argue that the bill \nprimarily consists of long overdue updates of current laws, updates \nnecessary because technology advances have allowed criminals and \nterrorists to stay a step, or two, ahead of law enforcement. Updates \nare necessary because the inability of Federal authorities to share \ninformation on suspected terrorists hampers criminal investigations. \nUpdates are necessary because the penalties and limitations periods \ngoverning many terrorist crimes have been woefully inadequate. All of \nthis is true. And for these reasons, I support the bill.\n  But, we shouldn't be lulled into thinking that this measure will \nsolve our problems. Indeed, I asked the Attorney General whether the \nnew powers granted in this bill could have prevented the events of \nSeptember 11. He answered me honestly, saying that he could not make \nthat guarantee. Yet, he added that these new tools would make it less \nlikely that terrorism could strike in the same way again.\n  Tougher laws and penalties are an important part of our strategy to \ncombat terrorism. That plan must also include more and better agents \ndedicated to gathering intelligence, an aggressive approach to \npreventing attacks, and patience from all Americans. Patience is \nessential because we will need to understand that we might have to \ntemper our freedoms slightly in an effort to guarantee them.\n  Critics of this legislation caution us to be wary of compromising our \nliberties in an effort to make our Nation safer. They comment that \nsacrificing freedom gives the terrorists a victory. Those warnings do \nhave merit.\n  Some of this bill's provisions do risk our civil liberties and ask \nAmericans to sacrifice some privacy. This bill grants our prosecutors a \ngreat deal of discretion in enforcing the law and asks Americans to \nhave faith that this power will not be abused. Most of us would rather \nnot have our civil liberties depend on someone else's discretion.\n  That's why I believe many of this bill's provisions should lapse in \ntwo years and then be reconsidered by Congress. The House version of \nthis bill reconciles the need for tough law enforcement with the \nconcern for our civil liberties by sunsetting some of the most \nobjectionable portions of the bill in two years. That is a good idea. \nTwo years from now, we can take stock of where we are, how this bill \nhas affected us, and whether the trust we show in law enforcement is \nwarranted. I hope that the final version of this bill will adopt such a \nsensible approach.\n  I have never doubted that our country's law enforcement is the best \nin the world. They are dedicated, creative, committed, and decent. From \nlocal beat officers to the Director of the FBI, every one of them has a \nvital role to play in combating terrorism. We believe this bill will \nhelp them prevent terrorism when possible. It will help them catch \nwrongdoers. It will cut wrongdoers off from their support networks. It \nwill guarantee stiff punishment for their criminal acts. It will deter \nothers from following in the terrorists' footsteps. It is our \nresponsibility to give law enforcement the tools they need in an \nincreasingly complex world. It is their responsibility to use them \nwisely.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nantiterrorism legislation we have before us.\n  First, let me say I am pleased to have also worked in conjunction \nwith Senator Bond and Senator Conrad in supporting their legislation \nentitled ``The Visa Integrity and Security Act.'' This bill addresses \nmany of the concerns I have, such as the importance of information \nsharing among Government law enforcement and intelligence agencies with \nthe State Department and tightening tracking controls on those entering \nthe United States on student visas, including those attending flight \nschools. These are critical issues, and I commend both Senators for \ntheir efforts.\n  Today, our men and women in uniform are on the frontlines in the war \nagainst terrorism. We salute their willingness to put themselves in \nharm's way in defense of freedom, and we pray for their safety and \nwell-being. Here at home, we are working to secure our nation, and that \nis why I am pleased that we will pass this legislation in the Senate \nthat will take strong measures to help prevent further terrorist \nattacks on American soil.\n  With this legislation, we will take reasonable, constitutional steps \nto enhance electronic and other forms of surveillance, without \ntrampling on the rights of Americans. We will also institute critical \nmeasures to increase information sharing by mandating access to the \nFBI's National Crime Information Center, or NCIC, by the State \nDepartment and INS.\n  In our war against terrorism, Americans stand as one behind our \nPresident. It is equally critical that, in the all-out effort to \nprotect our homeland, Federal agencies be united in securing American \nsoil.\n  In that light, President Bush made exactly the right decision when he \ncreated the Office of Homeland Security, a national imperative in the \nwake of the horrific tragedies of September 11, and I commend him for \nappointing my former colleague, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, as its \nDirector.\n  With a seat at the Cabinet table, Governor Ridge will literally be at \nthe President's side, giving him the standing that will be required to \nremove jurisdictional hurdles among the 40-plus agencies he will be \nresponsible for coordinating. Now, we will assist in that coordination \nby allowing INS and the State Department access to the information they \nneed to make informed decisions about who we will grant entrance into \nthis country.\n  I saw firsthand the consequences of serious inadequacies in \ncoordination and communication during my 12 years as ranking member of \nthe House Foreign Affairs International Operations Subcommittee and \nChair of the subcommittee's Senate counterpart. In fact, I recently \nwrote an op-ed piece concerning my findings during that time and I \nwould like to submit the entire text of that piece for the Record.\n  In conducting oversight of Embassy security as well as visa and \nconsular operations, I became extensively involved with the issue of \nterrorism, co-drafting antiterrorism legislation with former \nRepresentative Dan Mica in the wake of 1983 and 1984 terrorist attacks \nagainst the U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks in Lebanon--traveling to \nBelgrade, Warsaw, and East Berlin to press government officials into \nhelping\n\n[[Page S10596]]\n\nstem the flow of money to the terrorist Abu Nidal and his \norganization--and investigating entry into the United States by radical \nEgyptian cleric Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, mastermind of the 1993 World \nTrade Center bombing.\n  As far back as our hearings on the 1985 Inman Report, commissioned by \nthen-Secretary of State George Shultz in response to the attacks in \nLebanon, it was abundantly clear that improved coordination and \nconsolidation of information from agencies such as the FBI, CIA, DEA, \nCustoms, INS and the State Department would be an essential step toward \nremoving a vulnerability in our national security. That point was \ntragically underscored by our discovery that, astoundingly, in the \nperiod since 1987 when Sheikh Rahman was placed on the State Department \nlookout list, the Sheikh entered and exited the United States five \ntimes totally unimpeded.\n  But it got even worse. Even after the State Department formally \nissued a certification of visa revocation, he was granted permanent \nresidence status by the INS. When he was finally caught on July 31, \n1991, reentering the United States, he was immediately released back \ninto U.S. society to allow him to pursue a multi-year appeal process.\n  As unbelievable as that may sound, just as unfathomable is the fact \nthat, even after the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center, membership \nin a terrorist organization in and of itself--with the exception of the \nPLO--was not sufficient grounds for visa denial. Rather, the \nImmigration Act of 1990 required the Government to prove that an \nindividual either was personally involved in a terrorist act, or \nplanning one.\n  This absurd threshold made it almost impossible to block individuals, \nsuch as Sheikh Rahman, from entering the country legally. Legislation I \nintroduced in 1993 removed that bureaucratic and legal obstacle--yet it \ntook nearly 3 more years to enact it as part of the Anti-Terrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996.\n  However, provisions from my bill were enacted in 1994 to respond to \nthe trail of errors we uncovered requiring modernization in the State \nDepartment's antiquated microfiche ``lookout'' system to keep dangerous \naliens from entering the United States.\n  This system required manual searches, was difficult to use, and was \nsubject to error. The language I crafted required the State Department \nto replace the old systems with one of two forms of state-of-the-art \ncomputerized systems. Visa fees were even increased for non-immigrants \nto pay for the upgrades.\n  Recognizing the need to mate these new technologies with the need for \nthe most comprehensive, current and reliable information, we also \nattempted to address the issue of access. This was all the more \npressing because, in 1990, the Justice Department had ruled that \nbecause the State Department was not a ``law enforcement agency,'' it \nno longer had free access to the FBI's National Crime Information \nCenter, NCIC.\n  This system, which maintains arrest and criminal information from a \nwide variety of Federal, State, and local sources as well as from \nCanada, was used by the State Department to deny visas. Tellingly, \nafter it lost access to the NCIC, the visa denial rate for past \ncriminal activities plunged a remarkable 45 percent--stark evidence \nthat we can't afford to tie the hands of America's overseas line of \ndefense against terrorism.\n  Incredibly, while intelligence is frequently exchanged, no law \nrequires agencies like the FBI and CIA to share information on \ndangerous aliens with the State Department. To address this, my 1993 \nbill also designated the State Department a ``law enforcement agency'' \nfor purposes of accessing the NCIC as well as other FBI criminal \nrecords when processing any visa application, whether immigrant or non-\nimmigrant.\n  Unfortunately, a revised provision also enacted in 1994 only provided \nthe State Department with free access to these FBI resources for \npurposes of processing immigrant visas--dropping my requirement for \nnon-immigrant visas eventually used by all 19 suspected hijackers.\n  Also of note, we discovered later in trying to understand some of \nwhat's gone wrong that even that limited law was sunsetted in 1997 due \nto a provision added by the House-Senate conference on the Foreign \nRelations Authorization Act for FY 1994-1995--a conference of which I \nwas not a member. Subsequently, that law was extended to 1998 in the \nCommerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998, and \nthen was allowed to expire. This happened despite my legislation \nenacted in 1996 repealing the requirement that visa applicants be \ninformed of the reason for a denial--a provision that law enforcement \nagencies legitimately believed could impede ongoing investigations, or \nreveal sources and methods. Thus, today, information sharing remains \noptional and ad hoc.\n  Currently, U.S. posts check the lookout database called the \n``Consular Lookout and Support System--Enhanced,'' or CLASS-E, prior to \nissuing any visa. CLASS-E contains approximately 5.7 million records, \nmost of which originate with U.S. Embassies and consulates abroad \nthrough the visa application process. The INS, DEA, Department of \nJustice, and other Federal agencies also contribute lookouts to the \nsystem, however, this is voluntary.\n  To further fortify our front-line defenses against terrorism--to turn \nback terrorists at their point of origin--information sharing should be \nmandatory, not voluntary. That is why I introduced a bill that would \nrequire that law enforcement and the intelligence community share \ninformation with the State Department and INS for the purpose of \nissuing visas and permitting entry into the United States. And while my \nbill would have gone farther than the legislation before us--by \nincluding the DEA, CIA, Customs and the Department of Defense in the \nmandated information-sharing network--I am pleased that this bill we \nare considering does mandate access to the NCIC by INS and the State \nDepartment.\n  Clearly, the catastrophic events of September 11 have catapulted us \ninto a different era, and everything is forever changed. We must move \nheaven and earth to remove the impediments that keep us from maximizing \nour defense against terrorism. The bottom line is, if knowledge is \npower, we are only as strong as the weakest link in our information \nnetwork--therefore, we must ensure that the only ``turf war'' will be \nthe one to protect American turf.\n  That is why we need a singular, Cabinet-level authority that can help \nchange the prevailing system and culture, and why we need legislation \nto help them do it. Ironically, the most compelling reason for an \nOffice of Homeland Security is also its greatest challenge--the need to \nfocus on the ``three C's'' of coordination, communication and \ncooperation so that all our resources are brought to bear in securing \nour Nation.\n  Winston Churchill, in a 1941 radio broadcast, sent a message to \nPresident Roosevelt saying, ``Give us the tools and we will finish the \njob.'' I have no doubt that, given the tools, the men and women of our \nEmbassies throughout the world will get the job done and help us build \na more secure American homeland.\n  Finally, once a visa is issued at the point of origin, we should be \nensuring that it's the same person who shows up at the point of entry. \nThe fact is, we don't know how many--if any--of the 19 terrorists \nimplicated in the September 11 attacks entered the United States on \nvisas that were actually issued to someone else.\n  Currently, once a visa is issued by the State Department, it then \nfalls to INS officials at a port-of-entry to determine whether to grant \nentry. The problem is, no automated system is utilized to ensure that \nthe person holding the visa is actually the person who was issued the \nvisa. In other words, the INS official has to rely solely on the \nidentification documents the person seeking entry is carrying--making \nthat officials job that much more difficult.\n  There is a better way, and legislation I introduced would require the \nestablishment of a fingerprint-based check system to be used by State \nand INS to verify that the person who received the visa is the same \nperson at the border crossing station trying to enter the country.\n  Simply put, it requires the State Department and INS to jointly \ncreate an electronic database which stores fingerprints--and that other \nagencies may use as well. When a foreign national receives a visa, a \nfingerprint is taken, which then is matched against the fingerprint \ntaken by INS upon entry to\n\n[[Page S10597]]\n\nthe United States. This is a common sense approach that would take us \none step closer to minimizing the threat and maximizing our national \nsecurity.\n  The fact of the matter is, fingerprint technology--one part of the \nlarger category of biological factors that can be used for \nidentification known as biometrics--is not new. In fact, the U.S. \nGovernment has already employed biometrics to verify identities at \nmilitary and secret facilities, at ports-of-entry, and for airport \nsecurity, among many others.\n  The INS has already announced it was beginning to implement the new \nbiometric Mexican border crossing cards as required by 1996 Illegal \nImmigrations Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. These cards have \nthe individual's fingerprint encoded on them and are matched to the \nfingerprint of the person possessing the card at a U.S. port-of-entry.\n  This surely does not sound all that much different than the \nlegislation I have proposed. I am pleased the bill before us at least \nstarts us down the road toward implementing biometric technologies by \nrequiring a review of the feasibility of instituting such technologies, \nand I hope this can be achieved as soon as possible.\n  Despite areas where I might have wished to strengthen this bill even \nfurther, this legislation is vital to our national security, and I will \nbe proud to support it. The war on terrorism is a war on myriad fronts. \nSome of the battles will be great in scale, many will be notable by \nwhat is not seen and by what doesn't happen--namely, that individuals \nwho pose a serious threat to this Nation never see these shores and \nnever set foot on our soil.\n  Many of our greatest victories will be measured by the attacks that \nnever happen--in battles we win before they ever have a name--in \nconflicts we prevent before they ever claim one American life. I hope \nwe will pass and enact legislation that will help make that possible. I \nthank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a month ago today, America was attacked \nby vicious terrorists bent on doing all they can to undermine our \nNation, our freedoms, and our way of life. But they have failed. Our \ncountry has never been more united behind the ideals that make us \nstrong, or more committed to protecting our security.\n  In recent weeks, we have sought international cooperation and \nreceived it. We have asked our men and women in uniform to protect and \ndefend our Nation, and they are doing it superbly. We are equally \ncommitted to preserving our freedoms and our democracy.\n  The goal of this antiterrorism legislation is to achieve greater \ncoordination between the law enforcement and intelligence communities, \nwhile protecting the civil liberties of American citizens. We must give \nthe Secretary of State and the Attorney General the tools to stop \nterrorists from entering our country, while guaranteeing America's \nproud tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world.\n  The terrorist attacks of September 11 make it an urgent priority to \nact as soon as possible. The INS and the State Department must have the \ntechnology and intelligence information they need to make quick and \naccurate decisions on whether to admit anyone to the United States.\n  We must also take urgent steps to improve security at our borders \nwith Canada and Mexico, to keep terrorists from entering the country \nillegally.\n  These improvements in the immigration laws can make a huge and \nimmediate difference. Immigration security is an indispensable part of \nour national security.\n  As we protect our country, we must also protect the founding \nprinciples that have made our nation great. We must respond to the \ncurrent crisis in ways that protect the basic rights and liberties of \nour citizens and others residing legally in the United States.\n  Currently, the INS has broad authority to act against any foreign \nnational who supports terrorism. With respect to visitors, foreign \nstudents, and other non-immigrants, as well as immigrants already in \nthis country, the Federal Government has a broad range of enforcement \ntools. The INS may detain certain non-citizens if they pose a threat to \nnational security or are a flight risk, and they may do so on the basis \nof secret evidence. The INS may also deport any alien who has engaged \nin terrorist activity, or supported terrorist activity in any way. If \nthe INS has the resources to use its existing authority fully and \nfairly, we will be far closer to ensuring our national security.\n  Nonetheless, loopholes may exist in our current laws, and we should \nclose them. In recent weeks, many of us in Congress have worked closely \nwith the administration to strengthen the law without creating serious \ncivil liberties concerns. Although we have made progress, more remains \nto be done. I continue to be concerned that the Attorney General has \nthe authority to detain even permanent residents without adequate \ncause, and with very few due process protections.\n  We must be cautious that new measures are not enacted in haste, \nundermining current law in critical and constitutionally troubling \nrespects. We must avoid enacting legislation with vague and overly \nbroad definitions or legislation that punishes individuals exercising \nconstitutionally protected rights.\n  Consistent with these basic principles, it is essential for Congress \nto strengthen the criminal code in response to the September 11 \nattacks. We must increase penalties for terrorists and those who \nsupport terrorist activity. We must punish those who possess biological \nweapons and commit acts of violence against mass transportation \nsystems. We must also ensure that victim assistance and victim \ncompensation programs are able to help all the victims of the September \n11 attacks. In fact, the current bill makes several important reforms \nto the Victim of Crimes Act to achieve that goal.\n  I am concerned, however, that by authorizing foreign-intelligence \nsearches where foreign-intelligence gathering is only ``a significant \npurpose''--not the sole or primary purpose--of the search, the bill may \nwell make the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act unconstitutional \nunder the fourth amendment.\n  We must also ensure that, in acting to expand the powers of law \nenforcement to obtain student educational records for the investigation \nand prosecution of terrorism, we adequately safeguard the interests of \ninnocent students. We should not permit schools and colleges to \ntransfer student records to law enforcement agencies indiscriminately. \nWe have worked closely with the administration to develop measures that \nstrike a balance between the legitimate interests of law enforcement \nand the privacy of students.\n  In the wake of the September 11 attacks, we have also seen a \ndisturbing increase in hate-motivated violence directed at Arab \nAmericans and Muslim Americans. The Department of Justice is currently \ninvestigating over 90 such incidents, including several murders.\n  We need to do more to combat the acts of hate that cause many Arab \nand Muslim Americans to live in fear. Under current law, the Department \nof Justice cannot prosecute such cases as hate crimes unless it can \nprove that the victim was engaged in one of six ``federally protected \nactivities''--such as voting or attending a public university--when the \ncrime occurred. This requirement is an unwise and unnecessary \nconstraint on effective law enforcement and may hamper the Department's \nability to prosecute some of the cases it is now investigating.\n  The bipartisan hate crimes bill passed by the Senate last year and \napproved again by the Judiciary Committee in July would remove the \n``federally protected activity'' requirement from the law--making it \neasier for the Justice Department to prosecute hate crimes--while still \nensuring that the Federal Government is only involved when necessary \nand appropriate.\n  Congress and the President must send a strong and unequivocal message \nto the American people that hate-motivated violence in any form will \nnot be tolerated in our nation.\n  There are provisions in the Uniting and Strengthening America Act \nthat do not strike the correct balance between law enforcement \nauthority and civil liberties protection. However, I am confident that \nworking with the House of Representatives and the administration, we \ncan enact a final bill that meets these important concerns.\n  We can send the President a tough, comprehensive, and balanced anti-\nterrorism bill. The important work we do in the coming days will \nstrengthen\n\n[[Page S10598]]\n\nAmerica, and make America proud of its ideals as well.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity \nto speak for a few minutes about the Uniting and Strengthening America, \nUSA, Act that is before the Senate today. This legislation reflects the \nhard work of the Senate Banking Committee and the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and I want to thank them for their commitment to ensuring \nthat Congress address this legislation as quickly as possible and for \npaying great attention to the civil rights and liberties of the \nAmerican people.\n  Right now our Nation is strongly united. We are bound together by, \namong other things, a desire to see justice brought to those who \nplanned the terrorist attacks and those who aided and abetted the \nterrorists. And Americans are united by our desire to prevent future \nterrorist attacks. At this time, more so than at any time in the past \n40 years, the American people are standing firmly behind the Federal \nGovernment and they trust government to do the right thing. The \nAmerican people support the idea that we must provide the FBI and the \nDepartment of Justice will the tools necessary to punish the \nperpetrators of the terrorist attacks and to prevent future attacks.\n  But as much as the American people seek a just resolution to the acts \nof terror, they are adamant about protecting their rights and \nliberties. We have heard it time and again since September 11: our \nNation must be secure, but must not become so at the expense of our \nfreedoms, our rights, and our liberties. We must not let the American \npeople down.\n  I want to thank Senator Leahy for his leadership on this legislation \nand his concern with important Constitutional principles, such as due \nprocess and unreasonable search and seizure. At Senator Leahy's urging, \nthe administration's anti-terrorism proposal was carefully and closely \nanalyzed and Senator Leahy did not yield to the political pressures \nthat threatened to push this legislation through the Congress without \nits careful consideration. I believe that the bill before the Senate is \nvastly improved from the proposal that the administration sent up, and \nI appreciate that important changes were made.\n  Though I am grateful that important changes have been made to the \nSenate bill, I am still troubled by certain provisions in the \nlegislation which fail to strike the proper balance between the need \nfor security and the need for civil liberties. Moving an anti-terrorism \nbill through the Congress in a timely fashion is critically important, \nparticularly in light of the ongoing air strikes in Afghanistan. We all \nknow that a real threat exists for future terrorist attacks in this \ncountry and passing legislation that helps the Federal Government \nprevent those attacks is crucial. I support the process, I support \nmoving this legislation forward, and I will vote for it. But I also \nbelieve that the bill that passed the House better balances our civil \nliberties and the Federal Government's need for greater surveillance \npowers, and I am hopeful that the bill that emerges from the conference \ncommittee retains some of these provisions. I am disturbed by comments \nmade yesterday by the administration in which swift consideration by \nboth houses of Congress of the Senate bill was urged. This legislation \ndeserves the full measure of our attention and should not be hastily \ndispensed with when the threat to our most cherished civil liberties is \nso great.\n  The wide-ranging legislation before us would enhance domestic \nsurveillance powers, stiffen penalties for terrorism, increase the \npenalties for money-laundering, and make it easier for law enforcement \nand intelligence agencies to share information. There was broad \nagreement on some elements of the administration's anti-terrorism \npackage, such as the need to update our anti-terrorism laws to take \naccount of new technologies--such as cell phones--and to ensure that \ncounter-terrorism investigators wield the same powers that apply to \ndrug trafficking and organized crime. But agreement was more difficult \nto reach on other issues, like detaining foreign nationals, and I am \npleased that we are in a position to move forward on the legislation.\n  I am also pleased that this package includes a bill, which I \nsponsored, that will provide the tools the U.S. needs to crack down on \ninternational money laundering havens and protect the integrity of the \nU.S. financial system from the influx of tainted money from abroad. \nThis legislation was part of a package of anti-money laundering \nprovisions that unanimously passed the Senate Banking Committee last \nweek.\n  Today, the global volume of laundered money is estimated to be 2 to 5 \npercent of global Gross Domestic Product, between $600 billion and $1.5 \ntrillion. The effects of money laundering extend far beyond the \nparameters of law enforcement, creating international political issues \nand generating domestic political crises.\n  It is becoming more and more apparent that Osama bin Laden's \nterrorist network, known as al Qaida, provided assistance to the \nhijackers who attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon with \nfunding that was transported from the Middle East to the United States \nthrough the global financial system. Al-Qaida has, for years, developed \na worldwide terrorist network by taking advantage of an open system of \ninternational financial transactions.\n  The United States has declared a war on terrorism. This new war is \ngoing to be unlike anything that we have ever engaged in previously. If \nwe are to lead the world in the fight against terror, we must insure \nthat our own laws are worthy of the difficult task ahead.\n  The International Counter-Money Laundering and Foreign Anti-\ncorruption Act of 2001, which I sponsored and which has been included \nin this legislation, will stop the flow of assets through the \ninternational financial system that have been used by bin Laden, the al \nQaeda terrorist network and other terrorist groups.\n  The United States has the largest and most accessible economic \nmarketplace in the world. Foreign financial institutions and \njurisdictions must have unfettered access to markets to effectively \nwork within the international economic system. The goal of this \nlegislation is to give the Treasury Secretary, in conjunction with our \nallies in the European Union and the Financial Action Task Force, the \nauthority to leverage the power of our markets to force countries or \nfinancial institutions with lax money laundering laws or standards to \nreform them. If they refuse, the Secretary will have the authority to \ndeny foreign financial institutions or jurisdictions access to the \nUnited States marketplace. This will help stop international criminals \nfrom laundering the proceeds of their crimes into the United States \nfinancial system or using the proceeds to commit terrorist acts.\n\n  Specifically, the bill will give the Secretary of the Treasury--\nacting in consultation with other senior government officials--the \nauthority to designate a specific foreign jurisdiction, foreign \nfinancial institution, or class of international transactions as being \nof ``primary money laundering concern.'' Then, on a case-by-case basis, \nthe Secretary will have the option to use a series of new tools to \ncombat the specific type of foreign money laundering threat we face. In \nsome cases, the Secretary will have the option to require banks to \npierce the veil of secrecy behind which foreign criminals hide. In \nother cases, the Secretary will have the option to require the \nidentification of those using a foreign bank's correspondent or \npayable-through accounts. If these transparency provisions were deemed \nto be inadequate to address the specific problem identified, the \nSecretary will have the option to restrict or prohibit U.S. banks from \ncontinuing correspondent or payable-through banking relationships with \nmoney laundering havens and rogue foreign banks. Through these steps, \nthe Secretary will help prevent laundered money from slipping \nundetected into the U.S. financial system and, as a result, increase \nthe pressure on foreign money laundering havens to bring their laws and \npractices into line with international anti-money laundering standards.\n  The bill provides for actions that will be graduated, discretionary, \nand targeted, in order to focus actions on international transactions \ninvolving criminal proceeds, while allowing legitimate international \ncommerce to continue to flow unimpeded.\n\n[[Page S10599]]\n\n  It provides a clear warning to those who have assisted or unwittingly \nassisted those involved in the al Qaeda network or other terrorist \norganizations in laundering money. The United States will take whatever \nactions are necessary, including denying foreign banks and \njurisdictions access to the United States economy, in order to stop \nterrorists and international criminal networks from continuing to \nlaunder money through the international financial system.\n  Passage of this legislation will make it much more difficult for new \nterrorist organizations to develop. During the 1980s, as Chairman of \nthe Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I began an \ninvestigation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), \nand uncovered a complex money laundering scheme involving billions of \ndollars. Fortunately, BCCI was forced to close and we were able to \nbring many of those involved in to justice. However, as we have learned \nsince the closing of BCCI, Osama bin Laden had a number of accounts at \nBCCI and we had dealt him a very serious economic blow. So as we \nconsider this bill as a response to recent attacks, we must not lose \nsight of the potential this legislation will have to stop the \ndevelopment of terrorist organizations in the future.\n  With the support of the United States and the European Union, the \nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development has begun a \ncrackdown on tax havens by targeting 36 jurisdictions which it said \nparticipate in unfair tax competition and undermine other nations' tax \nbases. The OECD approach does not punish countries just for having low \ntax rates, instead, it looks for tax systems that have a lack of \ntransparency, a lack of effective exchange of information and those \ncountries that have different tax rules for foreign customers than for \nits own citizens. Countries with these types of tax systems assist \nterrorists and international criminal organizations looking to hide \nmoney that was derived from the sale of drugs, weapons and other \ncriminal enterprises that have already been laundered in the \ninternational financial system.\n  Mr. President, earlier this evening my colleague Senator Feingold \noffered an amendment to the section of the USA Act that deals with the \ninterception of computer trespass communications. This amendment, at \nits core, was intended to prevent law enforcement from abusing their \nauthority to monitor computer activity. The Senator from Wisconsin's \namendment would have limited the amount of time that law enforcement \ncould monitor suspicious activity without a court order to 96 hours, \nafter which time investigators would have to obtain a warrant for \ncontinued surveillance. I support the intent of this amendment, and \nregret that I felt compelled vote to table the amendment. I voted to \ntable the amendment for two reasons: First, I was concerned that the \namendment was overly restrictive because it prevented law enforcement \nfrom investigations unrelated to the computer trespass. My concern is \nthat law enforcement authorities would, for example, be able to monitor \nactivity which permitted a computer hacker to establish a ``dead drop'' \nzone for terrorists to post messages, but would not be able to monitor \nthe content of those messages.\n  I also voted to table Senator Feingold's amendment because I strongly \nbelieve that we must move forward with this anti-terrorism legislation. \nJust today the FBI issued a statement warning of terrorist attacks and \nput law enforcement on the highest alert. I believe these serious \nthreats to our security justify our this legislation swiftly. But I \nsincerely hope that an acceptable compromise can be reached--on this \nand on other issues--in the final legislation.\n  This legislation is a crucial step toward limiting the scourge of \nmoney laundering and to stop the development of international criminal \norganizations. It is my hope that the Congress will be able to develop \nanti-terrorism legislation that will provide needed protections of our \ncitizens without eliminating any of our cherished individual liberties.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in the war against terrorism, Americans \nstand as one behind our President. Now, in the all-out effort to \nprotect our homeland, Federal agencies must be united in securing \nAmerican soil.\n  In that light, President Bush made exactly the right decision when he \ncreated the Office of Homeland Security--a national imperative in the \nwake of the horrific tragedies of September 11--and I commend him for \nappointing my former colleague, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, as its \ndirector. With a seat at the Cabinet table, Governor Ridge will \nliterally be at the President's side, giving him the standing that will \nbe required to remove jurisdictional hurdles among the forty-plus \nagencies he will be responsible for coordinating.\n  I saw firsthand the consequences of serious inadequacies in \ncoordination and communication during my twelve years as ranking member \nof the House Foreign Affairs International Operations Subcommittee and \nChair of the subcommittee's Senate counterpart. In conducting oversight \nof embassy security as well as visa and consular operations, I became \nextensively involved with the issue of terrorism, co-drafting anti-\nterrorism legislation with former Representative Dan Mica, Florida, in \nthe wake of 1983 and 1984 terrorist attacks against the U.S. embassy \nand Marine barracks in Lebanon; traveling to Belgrade, Warsaw, and East \nBerlin to press government officials into helping stem the flow of \nmoney to the terrorist Abu Nidal and his organization; and \ninvestigating entry into the United States by radical Egyptian cleric \nSheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing \nin 1993.\n  As far back as our hearings on the 1985 Inman Report, commissioned in \nresponse to the attacks in Lebanon, it was abundantly clear that \nimproved coordination and consolidation of information from agencies \nsuch as the FBI, CIA, DEA, Customs, INS and the State Department would \nbe an essential step toward removing a vulnerability in our national \nsecurity. That point was tragically underscored by our discovery that, \nastoundingly, in the period since 1987 when Sheikh Rahman was placed on \nthe State Department lookout list, the Sheikh entered and exited the \nU.S. five times totally unimpeded. Even after the State Department \nformally issued a certification of visa revocation, he was granted \npermanent residence status by the INS. When he was finally caught on \nJuly 31, 1991, reentering the United States, he was immediately \nreleased back into U.S. society to allow him to pursue a multi-year \nappeal process.\n  Just as unbelievable is the fact that, even after the 1993 attack on \nthe World Trade Center, membership in a terrorist organization in and \nof itself--with the exception of the PLO--was not sufficient grounds \nfor visa denial. Rather, the Immigration Act of 1990 required the \nGovernment to prove that an individual either was personally involved \nin a terrorist act, or planning one. This absurd threshold made it \nalmost impossible to block individuals, such as Sheikh Rahman, from \nentering the country legally. Legislation I introduced in 1993 removed \nthat bureaucratic and legal obstacle--yet it took nearly 3 more years \nto enact it as part of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1996.\n  Further, to respond to the trail of errors we uncovered, provisions \nfrom my bill were enacted in 1994 requiring modernization in the State \nDepartment's antiquated microfiche ``lookout'' system to keep dangerous \naliens from entering the United States. This system required manual \nsearches, was difficult to use, and was subject to error. The language \nI crafted required State to replace the old systems with one of two \nforms of state-of-the-art computerized systems. Visa fees were even \nincreased for non-immigrants to pay for the upgrades.\n  Recognizing the need to mate these new technologies with the need for \nthe most comprehensive, current and reliable information, we also \nattempted to address the issue of access. This was all the more \npressing because, in 1990, the Justice Department had ruled that \nbecause the State Department was not a ``law enforcement agency'', it \nno longer had free access to the FBI's National Crime Information \nCenter. This system, which maintains arrest and criminal information \nfrom a wide variety of federal, state, and local sources as well as \nfrom Canada, is used by the State Department to deny visas. Tellingly,\n\n[[Page S10600]]\n\nafter it lost access to the NCIC, the visa denial rate for past \ncriminal activities plunged a remarkable 45 percent--stark evidence \nthat we can't afford to tie the hands of America's overseas line of \ndefense against terrorism.\n  Incredibly, while intelligence is frequently exchanged, no law \nrequires agencies like the FBI and CIA to share information on \ndangerous aliens with the State Department. To address this, my 1993 \nbill also designated the State Department a ``law enforcement agency'' \nfor purposes of accessing the NCIC as well as other FBI criminal \nrecords when processing any visa application, whether immigrant or non-\nimmigrant.\n  Unfortunately, a revised provision also enacted in 1994 only provided \nthe State Department with free access to these FBI resources for \npurposes of processing immigrant visas--dropping my requirement for \nnon-immigrant visas eventually used by at least 16 of the 19 suspected \nhijackers. Even that limited law was allowed to expire, despite my \nlegislation enacted in 1996 repealing the requirement that visa \napplicants be informed of the reason for a denial--a provision that law \nenforcement agencies legitimately believed could impede ongoing \ninvestigations, or reveal sources and methods. Thus, today, information \nsharing remains optional and ad hoc.\n  To further fortify our front-line defenses against terrorism, I also \npropose to assist our embassies in turning-back terrorists at their \npoint of origin by establishing Terrorist Lookout Committees, comprised \nof the head of the political section of each embassy and senior \nrepresentatives of all U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies. \nThe committees would be required to meet on a monthly basis to review \nand submit names to the State Department for inclusion in the visa \nlookout system.\n  Clearly, the catastrophic events of September 11 have catapulted us \ninto a different era, and everything is forever changed. We must move \nheaven and earth to remove the impediments that keep us from maximizing \nour defense against terrorism, and that is why we need a singular, \nCabinet-level authority that can change the prevailing system and \nculture. Ironically, the most compelling reason for an Office of \nHomeland Security is also its greatest challenge: the need to focus on \nthe ``three C's'' of coordination, communication and cooperation so \nthat all our resources are brought to bear in securing our nation. The \nbottom line is, if knowledge is power, we are only as strong as the \nweakest link in our information network therefore, we must ensure that \nthe only ``turf war'' will be the one to protect American turf. In our \nfight against terrorism, we can do no less.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on \nthe World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the attention of the American \npeople has turned to the security of our national border system and how \nthese attackers were able to exploit that system to plot these \ndastardly acts.\n  The September 11 attacks have highlighted numerous loopholes in our \nimmigration laws that have allowed terrorists to enter the United Stats \nposing as students and tourists, and, in some cases, by simply walking \nacross an unpatrolled border. In reviewing our counter-terrorism \nefforts within our intelligence community, it is also appropriate that \nwe look at the numerous immigration loopholes these terrorists were \nable to slip through.\n  There are currently between 7 million and 13 million illegal aliens \nliving in the United States. Six out of 10 of these aliens crossed a \nU.S. border illegally, and therefore were not subject to background \nchecks by the INS or the State Department to determine if they had a \nterrorist or criminal history. In fact, exit/entry records are so \nincomplete that the Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, has no \nrecord of 6 of the 19 suspected hijackers entering the United States.\n  Of the roughly 10,000 INS agents guarding our borders, only 3 percent \nare stationed on our northern border with Canada. That's 334 agents \nprotecting a 4,000 mile border, or one agent for every 12 miles. \nAccording to media reports, a number of the September 11 terrorists \ncrossed this border to enter the United States.\n  Of those foreign nationals who have legally entered the United \nStates, more than a half-a-million of them are registered as \ninternational students at 15,000 universities, colleges, and vocational \nschools across the United States. These are nuclear engineering \nscholars, biochemistry students, and even pilot trainees who have \naccess to dangerous technology, training, and information.\n  The Congress passed legislation in 1996 requiring the INS to create a \ndatabase for tracking these students. The purpose was to more \nefficiently monitor the immigration/visa status and whereabouts of \nstudents from abroad. After 5 years, there is still no system in place \nto monitor these 500,000 students. The current pilot program operating \nat 21 schools is not expected to be fully operational for five more \nyears, and even that date could slip.\n  Without a monitoring system in place to audit schools that sponsor \nthese foreign students, there is nothing to prevent an alien from \nentering the United States on a student visa and then just \ndisappearing. Consequently, one of the September 11 hijackers was able \nto enter the United States on a student visa, dropped out, and remained \nillegally thereafter.\n  Abuses of the visa system can also be found in the application \nprocess overseas at our U.S. consulates. Foreign nationals must apply \nfor a visa at a U.S. consulate abroad and go through a series of \nsecurity checks before they can enter the United States. Some media \nreports have raised the issue of consulate shopping, that is, foreign \nnationals choosing to apply at a U.S. consulate that they believe is \nmost likely to grant them a visa. The ``New York Times'' reported in \nSeptember that Chinese nationals applying for visas at a U.S. consulate \nin Beijing compare their experiences over the Internet--and even post \ntips on how to act and what to say, to boost their chances of receiving \na visa.\n  Such an article raises the question of whether a terrorist could \ntravel from country to country in hopes of finding a U.S. consulate \nwhich would be less familiar with his background and more likely to \naward him a visa. One terrorist who was involved in the 1993 World \nTrade Center bombing was denied a visa at the U.S. consulate in Egypt, \nonly to be awarded a visa by the U.S. consulate in Sudan.\n  And these are loopholes that exist only for those terrorists who \nwould risk a background check by seeking a visa at a U.S. consulate. \nThe United States allows 29 countries to participate in a visa-waiver \nprogram, which effectively allows the citizens of many European \ncountries to bypass the initial screening process at a U.S. consulate \nabroad by waiving the visa requirement. The Inspectors General for both \nthe State and Justice Departments have raised the possibility that a \nforeign national could steal and counterfeit a visa-free passport to \nbypass the visa background check altogether.\n  The October 8 Wall Street Journal reported that some 1,067 visa-free \npassports have been stolen in recent months, presumably to be used for \nentry into the United States. In fact, one of the terrorists who \nplotted the bombing of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing was caught \ntrying to slip through this loophole in 1992 when he tried to enter the \nUnited States using a visa-free Swedish passport.\n  These are just some of the loopholes that terrorists are trying to \nexploit. To its credit, the Senate Judiciary Committee recognizes this \nfact.\n  The legislation drafted by the committee would triple the number of \nINS agents on our northern border. This is a worthwhile investment, and \none that should be made. However, the security of our borders depends \non more than just INS agents. The first line of defense against \nterrorists are our U.S. consulates abroad.\n  We must address the loopholes in the visa-waiver program that would \nallow a potential terrorist to enter the United States on a stolen \npassport. We must prevent consulate shopping. And, we must fully \nimplement a system that can monitor foreign students.\n  The State and Justice Departments confirm that these are real \nsecurity threats that must be addressed if we are to protect our \nborders from terrorists.\n  I have offered three amendments to address these concerns, which were \naccepted by the Judiciary Committee chairman and ranking member into \nthe manager's package.\n\n[[Page S10601]]\n\n  My first amendment would authorize the necessary funding so that the \nJustice Department could immediately put into place a tracking system \nthat would require every university, college, and vocational school to \nsubmit a name, an address, an enrollment status, and disciplinary \naction taken on each of the international students that these \neducational institutions sponsor. Such a database would be invaluable \nto law enforcement officials who may need to identify and locate a \npotential terrorist immediately.\n  My second amendment would tighten the visa-waiver program by \nrequiring that any country that participates in that program issue to \nits citizens within 2 years machine-readable passports that U.S. \nofficials could scan into a ``look out'' system. This moves forward the \noriginal statutory deadline Congress agreed to last year by 4 years.\n  This amendment would also require the State Department to regularly \naudit the passports of these visa-free countries to ensure that \ncountries that participate in this program have implemented sufficient \nsafety precautions to prevent the counterfeiting and the theft of their \npassports.\n  My third amendment would require the State Department to review how \nit issues its visas to determine if consulate shopping is a problem, \nand then require the Secretary of State to take the necessary steps to \ncorrect the problem. The State Department has the legislative authority \nit needs to fix this problem. It is now imperative that it use that \nauthority.\n  My amendments are important steps toward closing down the loopholes \nin our immigration laws, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues so that we may continue to tighten the security of national \nborders.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, three weeks ago, the President of the \nUnited States--with the undivided support of this Congress and the \nAmerican people--announced a war on terrorism. In that address, he \nasked Congress to provide our law enforcement community with the tools \nthat they need to wage that war effectively.\n  After several weeks of negotiations with the Chairman and the \nAdministration, I am pleased we have come to the point where we can \npass a bipartisan, measured bill that does just that.\n  Mr. President, each of us has, in different ways, had our lives \ntouched by the awful events of September 11th. Each of us has, in the \ndays since the attack, been shocked and appalled by the terrible images \nof destruction that have reached us, by television, by newspaper--and \nin many cases by our own eyes--from the sites of the attacks in \nPennsylvania, at the World Trade Center, and at the Pentagon.\n  Paradoxically, each of us has also been uplifted by the stories of \nheroism and self-sacrifice that have emerged from around the country in \nthe wake of these terrible events.\n  As the President made clear in his address to the nation, we did not \nseek this war. This war was thrust upon us--thrust upon us by an \nunprovoked attack upon our civilian population in the very midst of our \ngreatest cities.\n  Just one month ago, we could not have contemplated that today, \nOctober 11th, 2001, we would be at war. It is true that, for years, \nsome of us in this Congress, and around the country, have warned that \nthere were powerful, well-financed individuals located throughout the \nworld who were dedicated to the destruction of our way of life. But, \nfew of us could predict the horrific methods that these men would \nemploy in an effort to destroy us and our democratic institutions.\n  On September 11th, all that changed.\n  In the last few weeks, we have all come to acknowledge that we live \nin a different and more dangerous world than the world we thought we \nknew when we woke up on the morning of September 11th . . .\n\n  . . . A different world--not only because thousands of our countrymen \nare dead as a result of the September 11th attacks . . .\n  . . . A different world--not only because many of our neighbors now \nhesitate to get on an airplane, or ride in an elevator, or engage in \nany one of a number of activities that we took for granted before the \nattacks . . .\n  . . . But a different world, also, because we must acknowledge that \nthere remains an ongoing and serious threat to our way of life and, in \nfact, to our health and well-being as a society.\n  As has been reported in the national media, the investigation into \nthe September 11th attacks has revealed there are terrorist cells that \ncontinue to operate actively among us. It is a chilling thought, but it \nis true.\n  The war to which we have collectively committed is a war unlike any \nwar in the history of this country. It is different because a \nsubstantial part of this war must be fought on our own soil. This is \nnot a circumstance of our choosing. The enemy has brought the war to \nus.\n  But we must not flinch from acknowledging the fact that, because this \nis a different kind of war, it is a war that will require different \nkinds of weapons, and different kinds of tactics.\n  The Department of Justice, and its investigatory components including \nthe FBI, the INS, and the Border Patrol, will continue to have the \nprincipal responsibility for identifying and eradicating terrorist \nactivity within our national borders. Our intelligence community must \nhave access to critical information available to our law enforcement \ncommunity.\n  Over the last several weeks, the Attorney General has made clear to \nus, in no uncertain terms, that he does not currently have adequate \nweapons to fight this war. Weeks ago, the Administration sent to \nCongress a legislative proposal that would give the Department of \nJustice and others in law enforcement the tools they need to be \neffective in tracking down and eliminating terrorist activity in this \ncountry.\n  Over the last several weeks, Senator Leahy, other members of the \nJudiciary Committee, and I have undertaken a painstaking review of the \nanti-terrorism proposal submitted by the Administration. There have \nbeen several hearings on this legislation in the Senate, and many \nbriefings by experts and advocates.\n  The legislation that we are about to vote upon is a product of \nintense bipartisan negotiations. It is a proposal I am proud to \ncosponsor with my other colleagues in the Senate and particularly the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy.\n  I would like to congratulate Senator Leahy, in particular, for his \nthoroughness in reviewing this legislation and his many thoughtful \ncomments and suggestions in our joint effort to ensure that the \nproposals adequately protect the constitutional liberties of all \nAmericans.\n  Now, after weeks of fine-tuning, we have reached a final product that \naccommodates the concerns of each of the Senators who has examined this \nbill. The bipartisan bill that we vote on today respects the \nconstitutional liberties of the American people and, at the same time, \ndoes what people around America have been calling upon us in Congress \nto do--that is, give our law enforcement community the tools they need \nto keep us safe in our homes, in our travels, and in our places of \nbusiness.\n  I would like to make a few comments regarding the process for this \nlegislation. Although we have considered this in a more expedited \nmanner than other legislation, my colleagues can be assured that this \nbill has received thorough consideration. First, the fact is that the \nbulk of these proposals have been requested by the Department of \nJustice for years, and have languished in Congress for years because we \nhave been unable to muster the collective political will to enact them \ninto law.\n  No one can say whether these tools could have prevented the attacks \nof September 11th. But, as the Attorney General has said, it is certain \nthat without these tools, we did not stop the vicious acts of last \nmonth. I say to my colleagues, Mr. President, that if these tools could \nhelp us now to track down the perpetrators--if they will help us in our \ncontinued pursuit of terrorist activities within our national borders--\nthen we should not hesitate any further to pass these reforms into law. \nAs long as these reforms are consistent with our Constitution--and they \nare--it is difficult to see why anyone would oppose their passage.\n  Furthermore, I would like to clearly dispel the myth that the reforms \nin this legislation somehow abridge the Constitutional freedoms enjoyed \nby law-abiding American citizens. Some press reports have portrayed \nthis issue\n\n[[Page S10602]]\n\nas a choice between individual liberties on the one hand, and on the \nother hand, enhanced powers for our law enforcement institutions. This \nis a false dichotomy. We should all take comfort that the reforms in \nthis bill are primarily directed at allowing law enforcement agents to \nwork smarter and more efficiently--in no case do they curtail the \nprecious civil liberties protected by our Constitution. I want to \nassure my colleagues that we worked very hard over the past several \nweeks to ensure that this legislation upholds all of the constitutional \nfreedoms our citizens cherish. It does.\n\n  I would like to take a minute to explain briefly a few of the most \nimportant provisions of this critical legislation.\n  First, the legislation encourages information-sharing between various \narms of the federal government. I believe most of our citizens would be \nshocked to learn that, even if certain government agents had prior \nknowledge of the September 11th attacks, under many circumstances they \nwould have been prohibited by law from sharing that information with \nthe appropriate intelligence or national security authorities.\n  This legislation makes sure that, in the future, such information \nflows freely within the Federal government, so tat it will be received \nby those responsible for protecting against terrorist attacks.\n  By making these reforms, we are rejecting the outdated Cold War \nparadigm that has prevented cooperation between our intelligence \ncommunity and our law enforcement agents. Current law does not \nadequately allow for such cooperation, artificially hampering our \ngovernment's ability to identify and prevent acts of terrorism against \nour citizens.\n  In this new war, Mr. President, terrorists are a hybrid between \ndomestic criminals and international agents. We must lower the barriers \nthat discourage our law enforcement and intelligence agencies from \nworking together to stop these terrorists. These hybrid criminals call \nfor new, hybrid tools.\n  Second, this bill updates the laws relating to electronic \nsurveillance. Electronic surveillance, conducted under the supervision \nof a federal judge, is one of the most powerful tools at the disposal \nof our law enforcement community. It is simply a disgrace that we have \nnot acted to modernize the laws currently on the books which govern \nsuch surveillance, laws that were enacted before the fax machine came \ninto common usage, and well before the advent of cellular telephones, \ne-mail, and instant messaging. The Department of Justice has asked us \nfor years to update these laws to reflect the new technologies, but \nthere has always been a call to go slow, to seek more information, to \norder further studies.\n\n  This is no hypothetical problem. We now know that e-mail, cellular \ntelephones, and the Internet have been principal tools used by the \nterrorists to coordinate their atrocious activities. We need to pursue \nall solid investigatory leads that exist right now that our law \nenforcement agents would be unable to pursue because they must continue \nto work within these outdated laws. It is high time that we update our \nlaws so that our law enforcement agencies can deal with the world as it \nis, rather than the world as it existed 20 years ago.\n  A good example of the way we are handicapping our law enforcement \nagencies relates to devices called ``pen registers.'' Pen registers may \nbe employed by the FBI, after obtaining a court order, to determine \nwhat telephone numbers are being dialed from a particular telephone. \nThese devices are essential investigatory tools, which allow law \nenforcement agents to determine who is speaking to whom, within a \ncriminal conspiracy.\n  The Supreme Court has held, in Smith v. Maryland, that the \ninformation obtained by pen register devices is not information that is \nsubject to ANY constitutional protection. Unlike the content of your \ntelephone conversation once your call is connected, the numbers you \ndial into your telephone are not private. Because you have no \nreasonable expectation that such numbers will be kept private, they are \nnot protected under the Constitution. The Smith holding was cited with \napproval by the Supreme Court just earlier this year.\n  The legislation under consideration today would make clear what the \nfederal courts have already ruled--that federal judges may grant pen \nregister authority to the FBI to cover, not just telephones, but other \nmore modern modes of communication such as e-mail or instant messaging. \nLet me make clear that the bill does not allow law enforcement to \nreceive the content of the communication, but they can receive the \naddressing information to identify the computer or computers a suspect \nis using to further his criminal activity.\n  Importantly, reform of the pen register law does not allow--as has \nsometimes been misreported in the press--for law enforcement agents to \nview the content of any e-mail messages--not even the subject line of \ne-mails. In addition, this legislation we are about to vote upon makes \nit explicit that content can not be collected through such pen register \norders.\n  This legislation also allows judges to enter pen register orders with \nnationwide scope. Nationwide jurisdiction for pen register orders makes \ncommon sense. It helps law enforcement agents efficiently identify \ncommunications facilities throughout the country, which greatly \nenhances the ability of law enforcement to identify quickly other \nmembers of a criminal organization, such as a terrorist cell.\n  Moreover, this legislation provides our intelligence community with \nthe same authority to use pen register devices, under the auspices of \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, that our law enforcement \nagents have when investigating criminal offenses. It simply makes sense \nto provide law enforcement with the same tools to catch terrorists that \nthey already possess in connection with other criminal investigations, \nsuch as drug crimes or illegal gambling.\n  In addition to the pen register statute, this legislation updates \nother aspects of our wiretapping statutes. It is amazing that law \nenforcement agents do not currently have authority to seek wiretapping \nauthority from a federal judge when investigating a terrorist offense. \nThis legislation fixes that problem.\n  Moving on, I note that much has been made of the complex immigration \nprovisions of this bill. I know Senators Specter, Kohl and Kennedy had \nquestions about earlier provisions, particularly the detention \nprovision for suspected alien terrorists.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that we have worked hard to address \nyour concerns, and the concerns of the public. As with the other \nimmigration provisions of this bill, we have made painstaking efforts \nto achieve this workable compromise.\n  Let me address some of the specific concerns. In response to the \nconcern that the INS might detain a suspected terrorist indefinitely, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Kyl, and I worked out a compromise that limits \nthe provision. It provides that the alien must be charged with an \nimmigration or criminal violation within seven days after the \ncommencement of detention or be released. In addition, contrary to what \nhas been alleged, the certification itself is subject to judicial \nreview. The Attorney General's power to detain a suspected terrorist \nunder this bill is, then, not unfettered.\n  Moreover, Senator Leahy and I have also worked diligently to craft \nnecessary language that provides for the deportation of those aliens \nwho are representatives of organizations that endorse terrorist \nactivity, those who use a position of prominence to endorse terrorist \nactivity or persuade others to support terrorist activity, or those who \nprovide material support to terrorist organizations. If we are to fight \nterrorism, we can not allow those who support terrorists to remain in \nour country. Also, I should note that we have worked hard to provide \nthe State Department and the INS the tools they need to ensure that no \napplicant for admission who is a terrorist is able to secure entry into \nthe United States through legal channels.\n\n  Finally, the bill gives law enforcement agencies powerful tools to \nattack the financial infrastructure of terrorism--giving our government \nthe ability to choke off the financing that these dangerous terrorist \norganizations need to survive. It criminalizes the practice of \nharboring terrorists, and puts teeth in the laws against providing \nmaterial support to terrorists\n\n[[Page S10603]]\n\nand terrorist organizations. It gives the President expanded authority \nto freeze the assets of terrorists and terrorist organizations, and \nprovides for the eventual seizure of such assets. These tools are vital \nto our ability to effectively wage the war against terrorism, and \nultimately to win it.\n  Mr. President, before this debate comes to an end, I would be remiss \nif I did not acknowledge the hard work put in by my staff, the staff of \nSenator Leahy, and the representatives of the Administration who were \ninvolved in the negotiation of this bill. These people have engaged in \ndiscussions, literally around the clock over the last 3 weeks to \nproduce this excellent bill, that now enjoys such widespread bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I would like to thank my Chief Counsel, Makim Delrahim, who has been \ninstrumental in putting this bill together. I also would like to thank \nmy criminal counsel, Jeff Taylor, Stuart Nash, and Leah Belaire, who \nhave brought invaluable expertise to this process. My immigration \ncounsel, Dustin Pead and my legislative assistant Brigham Cannon have \nprovided invaluable assistance.\n  I would like to thank the staff of Senator Leahy--his chief counsel \nBruce Cohen, and other members of his staff--Beryl Howell, Julie \nKatzman, Ed Pagano, David James, and John Eliff.\n  The Department of Justice has been of great assistance to us in \nputting this bill together. I would like to thank Attorney General \nAshcroft and his Deputy Larry Thompson for their wise counsel, and for \ntheir quick response to our many questions and concerns. Michael \nChertoff, the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division was \na frequent participant in our meetings, as well as Assistant Attorneys \nGeneral Dan Bryant and Viet Dinh. Jennifer Newstead, John Yew, John \nElwood and Pat O'Brien were all important participants in this process.\n  Finally, the White House staff provided essential contributions at \nall stages of this process. Judge Al Gonzales, the White House counsel \nprovided key guidance, with the help of his wonderful staff, including \nTim Flanagan, Courtney Elwood, and Porad Berensen.\n  In addition, members of the White House Congressional Liaison Office \nkept this process moving forward. I would like to thank Heather \nWingate, Candy Wolff and Nancy Dorn for all the assistance they have \ngiven us.\n  There have been few, if any, times in our nation's great history \nwhere an event has brought home to so many of our citizens, so quickly, \nand in such a graphic fashion, a sense of our vulnerability to \nunexpected attack.\n  I believe we all took some comfort when President Bush promised us \nthat our law enforcement institutions would have the tools necessary to \nprotect us from the danger that we are only just beginning to perceive.\n  The Attorney General has told us what tools he needs. We have taken \nthe time to review the problems with our current laws, and to reflect \non their solutions. The time to act is now. Let us please move forward \nexpeditiously, and give those who are in the business of protecting us \nthe tools that they need to do the job.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues' support for this important \nlegislation and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 4 days ago, our military began strikes \nagainst terrorist training camps and the Taliban's military \ninstallations in Afghanistan. They are intended to disrupt the network \nof terror that spreads across Afghanistan.\n  But these strikes are one part of a much larger battle. The network \nthat we seek to disrupt and ultimately destroy often operates without \nborders or boundaries. Its tools are not simply the weapons it chooses \nto employ. And its trails are more often electronic than physical.\n  This is a new kind of battle. Winning it will require a new set of \ntools . . . And winning is the only acceptable outcome.\n  Just as we are committed to giving our men and women in uniform the \ntools and training they need to do what is asked of them, we must now \nmake that same commitment to our justice and law enforcement officials.\n  After all, we are now asking them to do nothing less than protect the \nAmerican people by finding, tracking, monitoring--and ultimately \nstopping--any terrorist elements that threaten our nation or our \ncitizens.\n  I believe that by passing this measure today, we are taking a swift \nand significant step toward doing just that. We are also demonstrating, \nonce again, that the Senate can work both quickly and effectively when \nwe work cooperatively.\n  I want to thank Senator Lott, Chairmen Leahy, Graham and Sarbanes, as \nwell as Senators Hatch, Shelby, and Gramm for their leadership on this \nbill.\n  I especially appreciate Chairman Leahy's management and handling of \nthis important and delicate process.\n  I also want to thank the many other Democratic and Republican \nSenators whose insights and suggestions improved this legislation.\n  For example, Senator Kennedy's input on provisions regarding \nimmigration addressed concerns a number of us had about the detention \nof legal permanent residents with only few due process protections.\n  And Senators Enzi, Leahy and Dorgan were able to improve a provision \nregarding unilateral food and medical sanctions in a way that avoids \nneedlessly hurting American farmers.\n  I'll be honest, this bill is not perfect, and I hope that we will be \nable to work with our House colleagues in the days ahead in order to \nimprove it.\n  Whenever we weigh civil liberties against national security, we need \nto do so with the utmost care.\n  Among other things, I am concerned about the provisions within this \nbill that allow the sharing of information gathered in grand juries and \nthrough wiretaps without judicial check. And, as we give the \nadministration new legitimate powers to wiretap under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, I believe we should do more to protect \nthe rights of Americans who are not suspects or targets of \ninvestigations.\n  These flaws are not insubstantial, but ultimately the need for this \nbill outweighs them. When it comes to an issue as central to our \ndemocracy as the protection of our people, we must act.\n  This bill does several important things:\n  First, it will enhance the ability of law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies to conduct electronic surveillance and execute \nsearches in order to gather critical information to fight terrorism.\n  Second, it will permit broader information sharing between \ntraditional law enforcement and foreign intelligence officers.\n  Third, it will increase the Attorney General's ability to deport and \ndetain individuals who support terrorist activity. I should note, \nthough, that the Senate bill requires the Attorney General either to \nbring criminal or immigration charges within seven days after taking \ncustody of an alien or relinquish custody.\n  Fourth, this bill also takes significant steps to increase law \nenforcement personnel on our northern border. For example, it would \ntriple the number of Border Patrol, Customs Service, and INS inspectors \nat the northern border, who would work in concert with their Canadian \ncounterparts in order to enhance security in this previously \nunderstaffed area.\n  Fifth, thanks in large part to Senator Leahy's hard work, this bill \nmakes major revisions to the Victims of Crime Act--by strengthening the \nCrime Victim Fund and expediting assistance to victims of domestic \nterrorism.\n  Sixth and finally, the Banking Committee was able to agree on, and \nadd to this bill, several significant counter money laundering \nmeasures. If we are to truly fight terrorism on all fronts, we must \nfight it on the financial front as well.\n  As you can see, this is a complex piece of legislation. But its aim \nis simple: to give law enforcement the tools it needs to fight \nterrorism.\n  It was a month ago on this day that we suffered the worst terrorist \nattack in our Nation's history. In the days since, we have honored the \nmemories of the more than 6,000 innocent men and women who lost their \nlives on that terrible day.\n  Hours ago, for example, we passed a resolution that designates \nSeptember 11 as a national day of remembrance.\n  But I believe that to truly honor those whose lives were lost, we \nmust match our words with action, and do all that we can in order to \nprevent future attacks.\n\n[[Page S10604]]\n\n  This bill is a significant step towards keeping that commitment, and \nkeeping Americans safe.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is my understanding that the managers intend now to \nyield back the remainder of the time on the bill and we will go \nstraight to final passage.\n  First, I thank all Senators for their cooperation tonight. This was a \nvery good day. We got a lot of work done, and I appreciate the work of \nall Members. There will not be rollcall votes tomorrow. In fact, we \nwill not be in session. We will come in on Monday, midafternoon. There \nwill be a vote on the motion to proceed to the foreign operations bill \nand a vote on the conference report on the Interior appropriations bill \nat approximately 5:30 Monday afternoon. I thank all Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are about to go to final passage. We \nthought there would be a managers' package. We signed off on this side, \nand apparently the other side has not, which is their right.\n  Mr. HATCH. We have a managers' package. It is done. It is just being \nassembled and put together and will be here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am glad there will be a managers' package. We cannot \nvote on final passage until the managers' package is here. I thank the \nmajority leader for his help. As I said before, I don't think the bill \ncould have gotten as far as it did without that help. I wish the \nadministration had kept to the agreement they made September 30. We \nwould have a more balanced bill. I still am not sure why the \nadministration backed away from their agreement. I am the old style \nVermonter: When you make an agreement, you stick with it. But they \ndecided not to, and it slowed us up a bit.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let's have order in the Senate Chamber so the \nSenator can be heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the passage of the amendment, the managers' amendment \nbe considered subject to approval by both managers and both leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will repeat the request. There is a \ntechnical amendment having to do with some of the issues that have been \nworked out, that have no substantive consequence. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this managers' amendment be approved, notwithstanding \npassage of the bill, subject to approval by the two managers and the \ntwo leaders.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield all time. I ask for the yeas and nays on final \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill for the third \ntime.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, what is the status?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is ready for third reading.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask the Chair if the managers' amendment has been \nadopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has been none submitted.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Thurmond), and the Senator \nfrom New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 96, nays 1, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 302 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--96\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--1\n\n       \n     Feingold\n       \n\n                            NOT VOTING --- 3\n\n     Domenici\n     Helms\n     Thurmond\n  The bill (S. 1510) as passed as follows:\n\n                                S. 1510\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) money laundering, estimated by the International \n     Monetary Fund to amount to between 2 and 5 percent of global \n     gross domestic product, which is at least $600,000,000,000 \n     annually, provides the financial fuel that permits \n     transnational criminal enterprises to conduct and expand \n     their operations to the detriment of the safety and security \n     of American citizens;\n       (2) money laundering, and the defects in financial \n     transparency on which money launderers rely, are critical to \n     the financing of global terrorism and the provision of funds \n     for terrorist attacks;\n       (3) money launderers subvert legitimate financial \n     mechanisms and banking relationships by using them as \n     protective covering for the movement of criminal proceeds and \n     the financing of crime and terrorism, and, by so doing, can \n     threaten the safety of United States citizens and undermine \n     the integrity of United States financial institutions and of \n     the global financial and trading systems upon which \n     prosperity and growth depend;\n       (4) certain jurisdictions outside of the United States that \n     offer ``offshore'' banking and related facilities designed to \n     provide anonymity, coupled with special tax advantages and \n     weak financial supervisory and enforcement regimes, provide \n     essential tools to disguise ownership and movement of \n     criminal funds, derived from, or used to commit, offenses \n     ranging from narcotics trafficking, terrorism, arms \n     smuggling, and trafficking in human beings, to financial \n     frauds that prey on law-abiding citizens;\n       (5) transactions involving such offshore jurisdictions make \n     it difficult for law enforcement officials and regulators to \n     follow the trail of money earned by criminals, organized \n     international criminal enterprises, and global terrorist \n     organizations;\n       (6) correspondent banking facilities are one of the banking \n     mechanisms susceptible in some circumstances to manipulation \n     by foreign banks to permit the laundering of funds by hiding \n     the identity of real parties in interest to financial \n     transactions;\n       (7) private banking services can be susceptible to \n     manipulation by money launderers, for example corrupt foreign \n     government officials, particularly if those services include \n     the creation of offshore accounts and facilities for large \n     personal funds transfers to channel funds into accounts \n     around the globe;\n       (8) United States anti-money laundering efforts are impeded \n     by outmoded and inadequate statutory provisions that make \n     investigations, prosecutions, and forfeitures more difficult, \n     particularly in cases in which money laundering involves \n     foreign persons, foreign banks, or foreign countries;\n       (9) the ability to mount effective counter-measures to \n     international money launderers requires national, as well as \n     bilateral and multilateral action, using tools specially \n     designed for that effort; and\n       (10) the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and \n     Supervisory Practices and the Financial Action Task Force on \n     Money Laundering, of both of which the United States is a \n     member, have each adopted international anti-money laundering \n     principles and recommendations.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to increase the strength of United States measures to \n     prevent, detect, and prosecute international money laundering \n     and the financing of terrorism;\n       (2) to ensure that--\n       (A) banking transactions and financial relationships and \n     the conduct of such transactions and relationships, do not \n     contravene the purposes of subchapter II of chapter 53 of \n     title 31, United States Code, section 21 of the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Act, or chapter 2 of title I of Public Law \n     91-508 (84 Stat. 1116), or facilitate the evasion of any such \n     provision; and\n       (B) the purposes of such provisions of law continue to be \n     fulfilled, and that such provisions of law are effectively \n     and efficiently administered;\n       (3) to strengthen the provisions put into place by the \n     Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. 981 note), \n     especially with respect to crimes by non-United States \n     nationals and foreign financial institutions;\n       (4) to provide a clear national mandate for subjecting to \n     special scrutiny those foreign jurisdictions, financial \n     institutions operating outside of the United States, and \n     classes of international transactions that pose particular, \n     identifiable opportunities for criminal abuse;\n       (5) to provide the Secretary of the Treasury (in this title \n     referred to as the ``Secretary'') with broad discretion, \n     subject to the safeguards provided by the Administrative \n     Procedures Act under title 5, United States Code, to take \n     measures tailored to the particular money laundering problems \n     presented by specific foreign jurisdictions, financial \n     institutions operating outside of the United States, and \n     classes of international transactions;\n       (6) to ensure that the employment of such measures by the \n     Secretary permits appropriate opportunity for comment by \n     affected financial institutions;\n       (7) to provide guidance to domestic financial institutions \n     on particular foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions \n     operating outside of the United States, and classes of \n     international transactions that are of primary money \n     laundering concern to the United States Government;\n       (8) to ensure that the forfeiture of any assets in \n     connection with the anti-terrorist efforts of the United \n     States permits for adequate challenge consistent with \n     providing due process rights;\n       (9) to clarify the terms of the safe harbor from civil \n     liability for filing suspicious activity reports;\n       (10) to strengthen the authority of the Secretary to issue \n     and administer geographic targeting orders, and to clarify \n     that violations of such orders or any other requirement \n     imposed under the authority contained in chapter 2 of title I \n     of Public Law 91-508 and subchapters II and III of chapter 53 \n     of title 31, United States Code, may result in criminal and \n     civil penalties;\n       (11) to ensure that all appropriate elements of the \n     financial services industry are subject to appropriate \n     requirements to report potential money laundering \n     transactions to proper authorities, and that jurisdictional \n     disputes do not hinder examination of compliance by financial \n     institutions with relevant reporting requirements;\n       (12) to fix responsibility for high level coordination of \n     the anti-money laundering efforts of the Department of the \n     Treasury;\n       (13) to strengthen the ability of financial institutions to \n     maintain the integrity of their employee population; and\n       (14) to strengthen measures to prevent the use of the \n     United States financial system for personal gain by corrupt \n     foreign officials and to facilitate the repatriation of any \n     stolen assets to the citizens of countries to whom such \n     assets belong.\n\n[[Page S10611]]\n\n     SEC. 303. 4-YEAR CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW-EXPEDITED \n                   CONSIDERATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Effective on and after the first day of \n     fiscal year 2005, the provisions of this title and the \n     amendments made by this title shall terminate if the Congress \n     enacts a joint resolution, the text after the resolving \n     clause of which is as follows: ``That provisions of the \n     International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist \n     Financing Act of 2001, and the amendments made thereby, shall \n     no longer have the force of law.''.\n       (b) Expedited Consideration.--Any joint resolution \n     submitted pursuant to this section shall be considered in the \n     Senate in accordance with the provisions of section 601(b) of \n     the International Security Assistance and Arms Control Act of \n     1976.

BULK CASH SMUGGLING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) effective enforcement of the currency reporting \n     requirements of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code \n     (commonly referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act), and the \n     regulations promulgated thereunder, has forced drug dealers \n     and other criminals engaged in cash-based businesses to avoid \n     using traditional financial institutions;\n       (2) in their effort to avoid using traditional financial \n     institutions, drug dealers, and other criminals are forced to \n     move large quantities of currency in bulk form to and through \n     the airports, border crossings, and other ports of entry \n     where it can be smuggled out of the United States and placed \n     in a foreign financial institution or sold on the black \n     market;\n       (3) the transportation and smuggling of cash in bulk form \n     may, at the time of enactment of this Act, be the most common \n     form of money laundering, and the movement of large sums of \n     cash is one of the most reliable warning signs of drug \n     trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, racketeering, tax \n     evasion, and similar crimes;\n       (4) the intentional transportation into or out of the \n     United States of large amounts of currency or monetary \n     instruments, in a manner designed to circumvent the mandatory \n     reporting provisions of chapter 53 of title 31, United States \n     Code, is the equivalent of, and creates the same harm as, the \n     smuggling of goods;\n       (5) the arrest and prosecution of bulk cash smugglers is an \n     important part of law enforcement's effort to stop the \n     laundering of criminal proceeds, but the couriers who attempt \n     to smuggle the cash out of the United States are typically \n     low-level employees of large criminal organizations, and are \n     easily replaced, and therefore only the confiscation of the \n     smuggled bulk cash can effectively break the cycle of \n     criminal activity of which the laundering of bulk cash is a \n     critical part;\n       (6) the penalties for violations of the currency reporting \n     requirements of the chapter 53 of title 31, United States \n     Code, are insufficient to provide a deterrent to the \n     laundering of criminal proceeds;\n       (7) because the only criminal violation under Federal law \n     before the date of enactment of this Act was a reporting \n     offense, the law does not adequately provide for the \n     confiscation of smuggled currency; and\n       (8) if the smuggling of bulk cash were itself an offense, \n     the cash could be confiscated as the corpus delicti of the \n     smuggling offense.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (1) to make the act of smuggling bulk cash itself a \n     criminal offense;\n       (2) to authorize forfeiture of any cash or instruments of \n     the smuggling offense;\n       (3) to emphasize the seriousness of the act of bulk cash \n     smuggling; and\n       (4) to prescribe guidelines for determining the amount of \n     property subject to such forfeiture in various situations.\n       (c) Bulk Cash Smuggling Offense.--\n       (1) In general.--Subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 5331.

Mr. President, on this solemn day, one month since the \nhorrific terrorist attacks on American citizens, our institutions, and \nour way of life, memorial services were held today in New York City and \nArlington, VA. President Bush, whom I commend for his leadership and \nstrong efforts to unify our Nation at this difficult time in our \nhistory, spoke today at the Pentagon ceremony honoring the victims of \nthese attacks. His remarks were eloquent and very moving to the \nfamilies and members of our armed forces who attended the service.

Please be seated. President and Senator \n     Clinton, thank you all for being here. We have come here to \n     pay our respects to 125 men and women who died in the service \n     of America. We also remember 64 passengers on a hijacked \n     plane; those men and women, boys and girls who fell into the \n     hands of evildoers, and also died here exactly one month ago.\n       On September 11th, great sorrow came to our country. And \n     from that sorrow has come great resolve. Today, we are a \n     nation awakened to the evil of terrorism, and determined to \n     destroy it. That work began the moment we were attacked; and \n     it will continue until justice is delivered.\n       Americans are returning, as we must, to the normal pursuits \n     of life. Americans are returning, as we must, to the normal \n     pursuits of life. But we know that if you lost a son or \n     daughter here, or a husband, or a wife, or a mom or dad, life \n     will never again be as it was. The loss was sudden, and hard, \n     and permanent. So difficult to explain. So difficult to \n     accept.\n       Three schoolchildren traveling with their teacher. An Army \n     general. A budget analyst who reported to work here for 30 \n     years. A lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve who left \n     behind a wife, a four-year son, and another child on the way.\n       One life touches so many others. One death can leave sorrow \n     that seems almost unbearable. But to all of you who lost \n     someone here, I want to say: You are not alone. The American \n     people will never forget the cruelty that was done here and \n     in New York, and in the sky over Pennsylvania.\n       We will never forget all the innocent people killed by the \n     hatred of a few. We know the loneliness you feel in your \n     loss. The entire nation, entire nation shares in your \n     sadness. And we pray for you and your loved ones. And we will \n     always honor their memory.\n       The hijackers were instruments of evil who died in vain. \n     Behind them is a cult of evil which seeks to harm the \n     innocent and thrives on human suffering. Theirs is the worst \n     kind of cruelty, the cruelty that is fed, not weakened, by \n     tears. Theirs is the worst kind of violence, pure malice, \n     while daring to claim the authority of God. We cannot fully \n     understand the designs and power of evil. It is enough to \n     know that evil, like goodness, exists. And in the terrorists, \n     evil has found a willing servant.\n       In New York the terrorists chose as their target a symbol \n     of America's freedom and confidence. Here, they struck a \n     symbol of our strength in the world. And the attack on the \n     Pentagon, on that day, was more symbolic than they knew. \n     It was on another September 11th, September 11th, 1941, \n     that construction on this building first began. America \n     was just then awakening to another menace; The Nazi terror \n     in Europe.\n       And on that very night, President Franklin Roosevelt spoke \n     to the nation. The danger, he warned, has long ceased to be a \n     mere possibility. The danger is here now. Not only from a \n     military enemy, but from an enemy of all law, all liberty, \n     all morality, all region.\n       For us too, in the year 2001, an enemy has emerged that \n     rejects every limit of law, morality, and religion. The \n     terrorists have no true home in any country, or culture, or \n     faith. They dwell in dark corners of earth. And there, we \n     will find them.\n       This week, I have called, this week, I have called the \n     Armed Forces into action. One by one, we are eliminating \n     power centers of a regime that harbors al Qaeda terrorists. \n     We gave that regime a choice: Turn over the terrorists, or \n     face your ruin. They close unwisely.\n       The Taliban regime has brought nothing but fear and misery \n     to the people of Afghanistan. These rulers call themselves \n     holy men, even with their record of drawing money from heroin \n     trafficking. They consider themselves pious and devout, while \n     subjecting women to fierce brutality.\n       The Taliban has allied itself with murderers and gave them \n     shelter. But today, for al Qaeda and the Taliban, there is no \n     shelter. As Americans did 60 years ago, we have entered a \n     struggle of uncertain duration. But now, as then, we can be \n     certain of the outcome, because we have a number of decisive \n     assets.\n       We have a unified country. We have the patience to fight \n     and win on many fronts: Blocking terrorist plans, seizing \n     their funds, arresting their networks, disrupting their \n     communications, opposing their sponsors. And we have one more \n     great asset in this cause: The brave men and women of the \n     United States military.\n       From my first days in this office, I have felt and seen the \n     strong spirit of the Armed Forces. I saw it Fort Stewart, \n     Georgia, when I first reviewed our troops as Commander-in-\n     Chief, and looked into the faces of proud and determined \n     soldiers. I saw it in Annapolis on a graduation day, at Camp \n     Pendleton in California, Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo. And I have \n     seen this spirit at the Pentagon, before and after the attack \n     on this building.\n       You've responded to a great emergency with calm and \n     courage. And for that, your country honors you. A Commander-\n     in-Chief must know, must know that he can count on the skill \n     and readiness of servicemen and women at every point in the \n     chain of command. You have given me that confidence.\n       And I give you these commitments. The wound to this \n     building will not be forgotten, but it will be repaired. \n     Brick by brick, we will quickly rebuild the Pentagon. In the \n     missions ahead for the military, you will have everything you \n     need, every resource, every weapon, every means to assure \n     full victory for the United States and the cause of freedom.\n       And I pledge to you that America will never relent on this \n     war against terror. There will be times of swift, dramatic \n     action. There will be times of steady, quiet progress. Over \n     time, with patience, and precision, the terrorists will be \n     pursued. They will be isolated, surrounded, cornered, until \n     there is no place to run, or hide, or rest.\n       As military and civilian personnel in the Pentagon, you are \n     an important part of the struggle we have entered. You know \n     the risks of your calling, and you have willingly accepted \n     them. You believe in our country, and our country believes in \n     you.\n       Within sight of this building is Arlington Cemetery, the \n     final resting place of many thousands who died for our \n     country over the generations. Enemies of America have now \n     added to these graves, and they wish to add more. Unlike our \n     enemies, we value every life, and we mourn every loss.\n       Yet we're not afraid. Our cause is just, and worthy of \n     sacrifice. Our nation is strong of heart, firm of purpose. \n     Inspired by all the courage that has come before, we will \n     meet our moment and we will prevail.\n       May God bless you all, and may God bless America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Memorial Service in Remembrance of Those Lost on September 11\n\n   (Remarks Prepared for Delivery by Secretary of Defense Donald H. \n   Rumsfeld, The Pentagon, Arlington, VA, Thursday, October 11, 2001)\n\n       We are gathered here because of what happened here on \n     September 11th. Events that bring to mind tragedy--but also \n     our gratitude to those who came to assist that day and \n     afterwards, those we saw at the Pentagon site everyday--the \n     guards, police, fire and rescue workers, the Defense \n     Protective service, hospitals, Red Cross, family center \n     professionals and volunteers and many others.\n       And yet our reason for being here today is something else.\n       We are gathered here to remember, to console and to pray.\n       To remember comrades and colleagues, friends and family \n     members, those lost to us on Sept. 11th.\n       We remember them as heroes. And we are right to do so. They \n     died because, in words of justification offered by their \n     attackers, they were Americans. They died, then, because of \n     how they lived--as free men and women, proud of their \n     freedom, proud of their country and proud of their country's \n     cause--the cause of human freedom.\n       And they died for another reason--the simple fact they \n     worked here in this building--the Pentagon.\n       It is seen as a place of power, the locus of command for \n     what has been called the greatest accumulation of military \n     might in history. And yet a might used far differently than \n     the long course of history has usually known.\n       In the last century, this building existed to oppose two \n     totalitarian regimes that sought to oppress and to rule other \n     nations. And it is no exaggeration of historical judgment to \n     say that without this building, and those who worked here, \n     those two regimes would not have been stopped or thwarted in \n     their oppression of countless millions.\n       But just as those regimes sought to rule and oppress, \n     others in this century seek to do the same by corrupting a \n     noble religion. Our President has been right to see the \n     similarity--and to say that the fault, the evil is the same. \n     It is the will to power, the urge to dominion over others, to \n     the point of oppressing them, even to taking thousands of \n     innocent lives--or more. And that this oppression makes \n     the terrorist a believer--not in the theology of God, but \n     the theology of self--and in the whispered words of \n     temptation: ``Ye shall be as Gods.''\n       In targeting this place, then, and those who worked here, \n     the attackers, the evildoers correctly sensed that the \n     opposite of all they were, and stood for, resided here.\n       Those who worked here--those who on Sept. 11 died here--\n     whether civilians or in uniform--side by side they sought not \n     to rule, but to serve. They sought not to oppress, but to \n     liberate. They worked not to take lives, but to protect them. \n     And they tried not to preempt God, but see to it His \n     creatures lived as He intended--in the light and dignity of \n     human freedom.\n       Our first task then is to remember the fallen as they \n     were--as they would have wanted to be remembered--living in \n     freedom, blessed by it, proud of it and willing--like so many \n     others before them, and like so many today, to die for it.\n       And to remember them as believers in the heroic ideal for \n     which this nation stands and\n\n[[Page S10632]]\n\n     for which this building exists--the ideal of service to \n     country and to others.\n       Beyond all this, their deaths remind us of a new kind of \n     evil, the evil of a threat and menace to which this nation \n     and the world has now fully awakened, because of them.\n       In causing this awakening, then, the terrorists have \n     assured their own destruction. And those we mourn today, \n     have, in the moment of their death, assured their own triumph \n     over hate and fear. For out of this act of terror--and the \n     awakening it brings--here and across the globe--will surely \n     come a victory over terrorism. A victory that one day may \n     save millions from the harm of weapons of mass destruction. \n     And this victory--their victory--we pledge today.\n       But if we gather here to remember them--we are also here to \n     console those who shared their lives, those who loved them. \n     And yet, the irony is that those whom we have come to console \n     have given us the best of all consolations, by reminding us \n     not only of the meaning of the deaths, but of the lives of \n     their loved ones.\n       ``He was a hero long before the eleventh of September,'' \n     said a friend of one of those we have lost--``a hero every \n     single day, a hero to his family, to his friends and to his \n     professional peers.''\n       A veteran of the Gulf War--hardworking, who showed up at \n     the Pentagon at 3:30 in the morning, and then headed home in \n     the afternoon to be with his children--all of whom he loved \n     dearly, but one of whom he gave very special care, because \n     she needs very special care and love.\n       About him and those who served with him, his wife said: \n     ``It's not just when a plane hits their building. They are \n     heroes every day.''\n       ``Heroes every day.'' We are here to affirm that. And to do \n     this on behalf of America.\n       And also to say to those who mourn, who have lost loved \n     ones: Know that the heart of America is here today, and that \n     it speaks to each one of you words of sympathy, consolation, \n     compassion and love. All the love that the heart of America--\n     and a great heart it is--can muster.\n       Watching and listening today, Americans everywhere are \n     saying: I wish I could be there to tell them how sorry we \n     are, how much we grieve for them. And to tell them too, how \n     thankful we are for those they loved, and that we will \n     remember them, and recall always the meaning of their deaths \n     and their lives.\n       A Marine chaplain, in trying to explain why there could be \n     no human explanation for a tragedy such as this, said once: \n     ``You would think it would break the heart of God.''\n       We stand today in the midst of tragedy--the mystery of \n     tragedy. Yet a mystery that is part of that larger awe and \n     wonder that causes us to bow our heads in faith and say of \n     those we mourn, those we have lost, the words of scripture: \n     ``Lord now let Thy servants go in peace, Thy word has been \n     fulfilled.''\n       To the families and friends of our fallen colleagues and \n     comrades we extend today our deepest sympathy and \n     condolences--and those of the American people.\n       We pray that God will give some share of the peace that now \n     belongs to those we lost, to those who knew and loved them in \n     this life.\n       But as we grieve together we are also thankful--for their \n     lives, thankful for the time we had with them. And proud \n     too--as proud as they were--that they lived their lives as \n     Americans.\n       We are mindful too--and resolute that their deaths, like \n     their lives, shall have meaning. And that the birthright of \n     human freedom--a birthright that was theirs as Americans and \n     for which they died--will always be ours and our children's. \n     And through our efforts and example, one day, the birthright \n     of every man, woman, and child on earth.\n                                  ____\n\n\nRemarks of General Richard B. Myers, USAF, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \n                  of Staff, Pentagon Memorial Service\n\n       Ladies and gentlemen, Today we remember family members, \n     friends, and colleagues lost in the barbaric attack on the \n     Pentagon--civilian and military Pentagon employees, the \n     contractors who support us, and the passengers and crew of \n     Flight 77. We also grieve with the rest of America and the \n     world for those killed in New York City and Pennsylvania. We \n     gather to comfort each other and to honor the dead.\n       Our DOD colleagues working in the Pentagon that day would \n     insist that they were only doing their jobs. But we know \n     better. We know, and they knew, that they were serving their \n     country. And suddenly, on 11 September they were called to \n     make the ultimate sacrifice. For that, we call them heroes.\n       We honor the heroism of defending our Nation. We honor the \n     heroism and taking an oath to support the Constitution. We \n     honor the heroism of standing ready to serve the greater good \n     of our society.\n       That same heroism was on display at the Pentagon in the \n     aftermath of the attack. Co-workers, firefighters, police \n     officers, medics--even private citizens driving past on the \n     highway--all rushed to help and put themselves in grave \n     danger to rescue survivors and treat the injured.\n       One of them, who I had a chance to meet recently, was Army \n     Sergeant Adis Goodwill, a young emergency medical technician. \n     She drove the first ambulance from Walter Reed Army Hospital \n     to arrive at the scene.\n       Sergeant Goodwill spent long hours treating the wounded--\n     simply doing her duty--all the while not knowing, and \n     worrying about, the fate of her sister, Lia, who worked in \n     the World Trade Center. She would eventually learn that Lia \n     was OK.\n       Prior to 11 September, Sergeant Goodwill hadn't decided \n     whether to reenlist in the Army or not. After the tragic \n     events of that day, her course was clear. And three weeks \n     ago, I had the privilege of reenlisting her. With tears of \n     pride in their eyes, her family, including her sister Lia, \n     watched her take the oath of office. Sergeant Goodwill is \n     with us today.\n       The heroes kept coming in the days following the 11th--\n     individual volunteers, both civilian and military; \n     firefighters; police officers; and civil and military rescue \n     units working on the site. Other Americans helped too, as \n     General Van Alstyne said, with donations of equipment \n     supplies, and food; letters and posters from school children; \n     and American flags everywhere.\n       Today, we mourn our losses, but we should also celebrate \n     the spirit of the heroes of 11 September, both living and \n     dead, and the heroic spirit that remains at the core of our \n     great Nation. This is what our enemies do not understand. \n     They can knock us off stride for a moment or two. But then, \n     we will gather ourselves with an unmatched unity of purpose \n     and will rise to defend the ideals that make this country a \n     beacon of hope around the world.\n       In speaking of those ideals, John Quincy Adams once said, \n     ``I am well aware of the toil and blood and treasure that it \n     will cost to . . . support and defend these states; yet, \n     through all the gloom I can see the rays of light and \n     glory.'' The light and glory of our ideals remain within our \n     grasp. That's what our heroes died for.\n       Some of them--the uniformed military members--made the \n     commitment to fight for, and if necessary, to die for our \n     country from the beginnings of their careers. Our civilian \n     DOD employees had chosen to serve in a different way but are \n     now bound to their uniformed comrades in the same sacrifice. \n     Other victims, employees of contractors and the passengers \n     and crew of the airliner, were innocents--casualties of a war \n     not of their choosing.\n       But if by some miracle, we were able to ask all of them \n     today whether a Nation and government such as ours is worth \n     their sacrifices; if we were able to ask them today whether \n     that light and glory is worth future sacrifices; the answer, \n     surely, would be a resounding ``yes.'' The terrorists who \n     perpetrated this violence should know that there are millions \n     more American patriots who echo that resounding yes.\n       We who defend this Nation say to those who threaten us--\n     here we stand--resolute in our allegiance to the \n     Constitution; united in our service to the American people \n     and the preservation of our way of life; undaunted in our \n     devotion to duty and honor.\n       We remember the dead. We call them heroes, not because they \n     died, but because they lived in service to the greater good. \n     We know that's small comfort to those who have lost family \n     members and dear friends. To you, this tragedy is very \n     personal, and our thoughts and our prayers are with you. We \n     will never forget the sacrifices of your loved ones.\n       We ask God to bless and keep them. We pray for their \n     families, and we also pray for wisdom and courage as we face \n     the many challenges to come. And may God bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10632-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10632-S10633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING MIKE MANSFIELD\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, much has been said and much has been \nwritten about the gentleman from Montana, Mike Mansfield. Books about \nhim have been written, and countless speeches about him have been \npresented. For many years to come, more books will be written, and more \nspeeches will be made about him. This is to be expected because he was \na person worthy of emulating. He was a person we all looked upon \nwithout hesitation as our leader. He was a person whose word was always \ngood, reasoned, logical, and fair. He was a rare person, deeply \nreligious, humble to a fault, and flawlessly honest.\n  It is certain that he will be more than a footnote in the history of \nour great Nation. He helped to lead us out of the quagmire of the \nVietnam conflict. His leadership assured the enactment of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, and the following year, he led the fight for the \npassage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. As a former school teacher, \nhe became the education leader in the Senate. Medicare became a \npossibility under his leadership. His contributions are too many to \nrecount.\n  Like many, I was especially intrigued and impressed by Senator \nMansfield's military service record. At the age of 14, he became a \nsailor. When the authorities discovered the age discrepancy, he left \nand enlisted in the Army. After the Army, he became a Marine. He was \nespecially proud of his title PFC Mike Mansfield. He once remarked that \nhe preferred that title to Senator or Ambassador.\n\n[[Page S10633]]\n\n  Many of us have anecdotes and stories about Mike Mansfield. I, too, \nhave some, but I would prefer to keep them as part of my warm and happy \npersonal memories of my acquaintance with my Leader. Like all who have \nknown him, I will miss him. I know I am a better American for having \nknown Mike Mansfield. It is difficult to say goodbye to a good friend, \nbut in saying goodbye, I wish to assure him that his lessons will never \nbe forgotten.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial piece that appeared in the \nHonolulu Advertiser on October 6, 2001, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Mike Mansfield Made His Mark Here, in Japan\n\n       It's a tossup whether the passing of Mike Mansfield, who \n     died yesterday at 98, will be noted more prominently in Japan \n     or the United States. He was widely respected and admired in \n     both countries.\n       The Montana Democrat was both the longest-serving U.S. \n     Senate majority leader and the longest-serving U.S. \n     ambassador to Japan.\n       Named ambassador in 1977 by President Carter, Mansfield was \n     reappointed by President Reagan in 1981.\n       When he returned home after 11 years in Tokyo, the \n     Washington Post reported, Japan's ambassador to the United \n     States said Mansfield ``could have run for prime minister and \n     won.''\n       Expressing condolences yesterday, Japanese Prime Minister \n     Junichiro Koizumi called Mansfield a great contributor to \n     friendship between the nations.\n       Mansfield's service as Senate majority leader, from 1961 to \n     1976, gave him a central role in debates on civil rights, the \n     Vietnam War, which he strongly opposed, and the Watergate \n     crisis.\n       Mansfield exercised that role with a leadership style that \n     drew bipartisan praise.\n       ``It's no coincidence that the Mansfield years remain among \n     the most civil, and the most productive, in the Senate's \n     history,'' Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle said yesterday.\n       Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott, said, ``We have had few \n     like him, but then with the good Lord's help, it takes only a \n     few.''\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, with the passing of Mike Mansfield, this \nChamber lost a man who embodied the true meaning of public service. And \nwhile he will no longer be with us, his spirit and his commitment to \nserving our Nation survives him and guides us. I rise today to pay my \nrespects for his service as well as to ask that we honor his life by \nfollowing his example.\n  Mike Mansfield's patriotism and commitment to public service resided \nin the very core of who he was. At the ripe old age of 14, when most \nboys are signing up for freshman football, Mike Mansfield was signing \nup for his first tour with the Navy. After the Navy discharged him due \nto his age, Mike Mansfield would reenlist and serve in the Army and \nMarine Corps. For a young man from Montana, those experiences led him \nto develop an interest and passion for defining America's role in this \nworld. Back in 1921, when the word ``globalization'' was not exactly in \nvogue, Mike Mansfield was taking his first trip to Asia. His commitment \nto United States-Asia relations was unprecedented, while his leadership \nin this area was unparalleled. It is with awe that in an age of hyper-\npartisanship, we look back at a life of service that always put \nprinciples above partisanship. One can only look back with awe and \nrespect at a man who not only served as the longest serving Senate \nmajority leader but also the longest serving U.S. Ambassador to Japan.\n  While this Nation said goodbye this weekend to our modern day \nironman, Cal Ripken, it's only appropriate that the nation recognizes \nthe Senate's own ironman. Mike Mansfield's legacy will be found not \nonly in the accomplishments of his service, but equally in the vision \nhe left for his colleagues and the manner in which he demonstrated his \nleadership.\n  Senator Mansfield once said that ``by exploring the cultural, \nreligious, and social forces that have molded a nation, we can begin to \nbetter understand each other and contribute to the knowledge and \nunderstanding that will strengthen our ties of friendship and lead to a \nbetter world.'' As we lead this Nation into a more globally \ninterdependent future, it will serve us well to keep Mike Mansfield's \nwords, and his legacy, close to us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10633-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10633-S10634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO STANLEY BLAKE HARRIS, CHIEF COUNSEL AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF \n                                 STAFF\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and wish a fond \nfarewell to a longtime staff member, Stanley Blake Harris, who is \ndeparting my personal office staff and returning to the State of \nMississippi after more than fifteen years of exemplary service here in \nWashington. Throughout his career, Stan has served with distinction. It \nis my privilege to recognize his accomplishments and commend him for \nthe superb service he has provided to me and to our home state.\n  A native of Hattiesburg, MS, Stan graduated from William Carey \nCollege in 1982, ranked first academically in his class. During his \ntenure at William Carey, Stan earned the degrees of Bachelor of Arts \nand Bachelor of Science summa cum laude, with a triple major in \nEnglish, History, and Social Science as well as a double minor in \nBusiness Administration and Political Science. In addition, Stan's \nclassmates bestowed upon him the honor and privilege of serving as \nStudent Government Association President while at William Carey.\n  Upon his graduation, Stan enrolled in the University of Mississippi \nSchool of Law, from which he received a Juris Doctorate in 1985. His \nendeavors and accomplishments on behalf of the law school and his \nclassmates were recognized as he was awarded the Dean's Outstanding \nService Award, the Edward R. Finch Award, and the Stephen Gorove Award.\n  Immediately following his graduation from law school, Stan continued \nhis educational pursuits at Mississippi State University, where he \nenrolled in the Public Policy and Administration Program. However, \nbefore he could complete the program, duty in Washington called. At the \nbeginning of 1986, Stan came to work for me in Washington as a Whip \nAssistant in the House of Representatives Republican Whip Office. From \nthere, Stan went on to serve as Counsel in my personal office while I \nwas a member of the House of Representatives.\n  Upon my election to the United States Senate in 1989, Stan was named \nCounsel and Director of Projects in my office, and was charged with \nresponsibility for establishing my Projects Department. In this role, \nStan has directed efforts in my office to pursue public projects for \nthe State of Mississippi. Along these lines, he has handled cases and \nprojects involving virtually every Federal department and agency, \nincluding the Department of Agriculture, NASA, the Department of State, \nthe Department of Justice, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the \nAppalachian Regional Commission and the White House. In addition, he \nhas worked closely with officials in virtually every city, county, and \nstate agency in Mississippi, while looking after Mississippi's needs. \nFurther, Mississippi has benefited from the close working relationships \nStan has developed with Congressional staff members in both the House \nand Senate.\n  Although Stan has worked diligently for the nation throughout his \ntenure on Capitol Hill, he has always put Mississippi first. The thing \nI will always remember the most about Stan is his unflinching ability \nto ``out-bureaucrat the bureaucrats.'' His tenacity and refusal to \nyield on matters of importance to Mississippi have produced great \nresults for our state. For instance, Stan has been instrumental in my \nefforts to secure a new Federal courthouse for Harrison County, \nMississippi. He has worked tirelessly for me for the past decade to \nensure that a new bridge over the Pascagoula River is built for the \npeople of Jackson County. And just last year on my behalf, he opened \ndoors in Washington for officials from his hometown of Hattiesburg, who \nare endeavoring to construct a new intermodal center for the City of \nHattiesburg. He also has worked closely with Mississippi's universities \nto improve educational opportunities in our State and to make these \nfacilities the finest in the Nation.\n  But Stan's work on Capitol Hill has not been limited to Mississippi \nprojects alone. Over the past fifteen years, he also has maintained a \nspecial focus on Federal ethics. During this time, Stan has served as \nmy counsel through such prominent cases as the Durenberger and \n``Keating Five'' hearings, as well as other notable ethics inquiries. \nIn fact, because of his work, Stan was selected to serve on the Senate \nEthics\n\n[[Page S10634]]\n\nReform Task Force. As an outgrowth of his Federal ethics work, Stan has \nalso developed a special commitment to law enforcement organizations \nnationwide. Because of his work on behalf of law enforcement groups \neverywhere and our nation's parks, Stan has been named an honorary \nmember of the U.S. Park Police.\n  Several years ago, as if his plate wasn't already full enough, Stan \nfulfilled a lifelong dream of joining the Mississippi Army National \nGuard. For a number of years now, he has regularly communted between \nWashington, D.C. and Jackson, Mississippi to fulfill his duty \nrequirements. During that time, he has risen to the rank of Major in \nthe Judge Advocate General Corps where he now serves as Deputy Staff \nJudge Advocate for Headquarters, 66th Troop Command.\n  On Wednesday, October 17, 2001, Stan will conclude over fifteen years \nof faithful and loyal service in my office. And while it is difficult \nto lose a staff member with such dedication and institutional \nknowledge, I know that he and his family are excited about returning \nhome to Mississippi where Stan and his wife, Lauren, can begin raising \ntheir four children with an appropriate southern accent.\n  In the weeks ahead, Stan will begin a new journey in his professional \nand legal career as the Chief Deputy Assistant United States Attorney \nin the U.S. Attorney's Southern District office in Mississippi. I have \nno doubt that Stan will serve the Department of Justice, the State of \nMississippi, and the people of our Nation, in this role with \ndistinction and integrity.

Mr. President, I rise today in sadness over the first \nannounced American casualty in Operation Enduring Freedom. Master \nSergeant Evander Earl Andrews, who was stationed in my home State of \nIdaho at the Mountain Home Air Force Base, was killed in service to his \ncountry in the Arabian Peninsula. He was part of the 366th Civil \nEngineer Squadron stationed there. Although Master Sergeant Andrews was \noriginally from a small town in Maine, Idaho feels this loss along with \nthe rest of the Nation.\n  Master Sergeant Andrews went to the Middle East to fight for our \nfreedom with valor and courage in this time of national crisis and made \nthe ultimate sacrifice in defense of his country. There are no words \nfor such an incredible loss, but we are a great Nation because of brave \nmen and women like Master Sgt. Andrews.\n  Flags are flying all over our country now, a visible display of the \nsupport our military troops and our President have over Operation \nEnduring Freedom. With the news of the first American casualty, it \nbecomes even more evident that American lives will be lost in this \nfight against terrorism. Our hearts and prayers are not only with the \nfamily of Master Sergeant Andrews in Idaho and Maine, but also with the \nfamilies of all our military troops, who are serving their country so \nfar away,\n  This will be a long war, one that will be won over a period of months \nor years through several strategic actions; there is no one operation \nthat will rid the world of the evils of terrorism. But one thing is \ncertain: freedom will prevail and we will not forget Master Sergeant \nAndrews and others like him to whom we owe our liberties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10634-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    VISION 2020 WORLD SIGHT DAY 2001\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Vision 2020 World Sight Day 2001 is \nobserved today, Thursday October 11, 2001, in cooperation with the \nWorld Health Organization, WHO, the 2020 Foundation of Tulsa, Oklahoma, \nChristian Blind Mission International, CBMI, and a partnership of 26 \ninternational organizations concerned with world blindness working \ntogether to eliminate avoidable blindness by the year 2020.\n  Forty-five million people living in our world today are totally \nblind. Eighty percent of this blindness could be prevented or cured \nwith simple cost-effective nutrition, medicines and medical care. A \nchild in our world goes blind every minute, most often due to a simple \nlack of Vitamin A. More than half of these precious children will die \nwithin 2 years of losing their sight.\n  The primary causes of blindness, malnutrition, disease, lack of \nmedicines and medical care, are always linked to the grinding poverty \nso characteristic of developing nations around the globe. Millions of \nmen, women and children needlessly live in a prison of darkness 24 \nhours a day. They desperately need the help of privileged nations to be \nset free.\n  The Vision 2020 program plans to eliminate most of the world's \nblindness by the year 2020. But with no intervention, the number of \nblind in this world will reach an estimated 100 million by the year \n2020.\n  World Sight Day 2001 raises awareness that most blindness, associated \nmisery, and several billion dollars in related costs can be prevented \nif we as a nation and a world intervene in time.\n  I commend the 2020 Foundation, Christian Blind Mission International \nand the other members of the 2020 Task Force for helping bring the gift \nof sight to the less fortunate around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10634-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SIX SIMPLE STEPS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, an organization called Common Sense about \nKids and Guns has developed a list of six gun safety tips that have \nbeen endorsed by a wide range of organizations from the National SAFE \nKIDS Campaign to the National Shooting Sport Foundation. Regardless of \nour differences of opinion on how to regulate firearms, I think we can \nall agree that these simple steps make a lot of sense.\n  All gun owners should unload and lock up their guns, lock and store \nammunition separately and keep keys where kids are unable to find them. \nIn addition, parents should ask if guns are safely stored at places \ntheir kids visit or play, regularly talk with their kids about guns, \nand teach young children both not to touch guns and tell an adult if \nthey find one.\n  The Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Health \nStatistics reports that firearm deaths of children and teens is \ndropping. However, ignoring firearms related child homicides, there \nwere still 1,300 kids killed in gun-related accidents and suicides in \n1999. That number remains far too high. Remembering the six simple \nsteps proposed by Common Sense about Kids and Guns can help cut that \nnumber even more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10634-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10634-S10635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PREPARING FOR BIOTERRORISM IN SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenator John Edwards, and Senator Chuck Hagel, in supporting \nlegislation to help South Dakotans prepare for possible bioterrorist \nattacks. The recent example of anthrax being reported in Florida has \nhighlighted the importance of being prepared to combat bioterrorism in \nour communities.\n  Now this doesn't mean that everyone should run out and buy a gas \nmask. Successful attacks using germs and chemicals are relatively \ndifficult to accomplish and rarely attempted.\n  However, the nature of such an attack makes just one successful act \nof bioterrorism unique and incredibly damaging. For example, most of \nthe germs involved in bioterrorism, anthrax and smallpox to name a few, \nare so rare that many medical professionals haven't treated them \nbefore. Symptoms may not be visible for days or weeks, and these \ndiseases can be spread easily among people.\n  In addition to threatening people, bioterrorism can also cripple our \nState's agriculture economy. We all saw this summer how the threat of \nfoot-and-mouth disease in the United States can directly impact South \nDakota's ag business.\n  The risk of an agriculture terrorist attack poses a serious threat to \nour economy as well as our abundant food supply. An agricultural \nterrorist could introduce a pathogen to a certain crop and decimate \nthat crop's yield. A quickly-spreading animal disease intentionally \nintroduced could cause economic ruin to States that depend on revenues \nfrom the livestock industry.\n\n[[Page S10635]]\n\n  Earlier this week, the nonpartisan General Accounting Office, GAO, \nreported that coordination is fragmented between 40 Federal departments \nand agencies responsible for responding to a bioterrorist attack.\n  The GAO report also noted insufficient State and local planning for \nresponse to terrorist attacks. In addition, while spending on domestic \npreparedness for terrorist attacks has risen 310 percent since 1998, \nonly a portion of these funds were used to conduct research on and \nprepare for the public health and medical consequences of a \nbioterrorist attack.\n  To better address the needs of State and local communities in dealing \nwith the threat of bioterrorism, I recently joined Senators Edwards and \nHagel on legislation called the Biological and Chemical Weapons \nPreparedness Act.\n  Our legislation provides $1.6 billion in new resources for Federal, \nState, and local efforts, including $450 million specifically for \nagricultural counter-terrorism and food safety measures.\n  Too often, bioterrorism funding has been tied up in the bureaucracy \nof Washington, and I'm pleased that our legislation sends over one-\nthird of these funds, $555 million, directly to States and local \ngovernments through new block grants. Our legislation gives States and \nlocal communities the resources to study the problems unique to them \nand implement appropriate solutions.\n  Our legislation would accomplish six goals. First, we would provide \ntraining and equipment to State and local ``first responders,'' such as \nemergency medical personnel, law enforcement officials, fire fighters, \nphysicians, and nurses, to recognize and respond to biological and \nchemical attacks\n  Second, our bill strengthens the local public health network through \nincreased training, coordination, and additional specialized equipment.\n  Third, we protect food safety and the agricultural economy by \nproviding assistance to States to better coordinate with law \nenforcement and public health officials, increase training and \nawareness among farmers and other agricultural stakeholders. Our \nmeasure would also give States the resources they need to establish \nemergency diagnostic facilities to work in conjunction with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's facility to quickly diagnose animal \ndiseases. Along with this assistance to States, the measure would \nprovide additional funds for the USDA's counterterrorism efforts.\n  Fourth, the legislation assists local hospital emergency rooms with \nresponse training and biocontainment and decontamination capabilities.\n  Fifth, we address the need to develop and stockpile vaccines and \nantibiotics.\n  Finally, our Biological and Chemical Weapons Preparedness Act \nenhances disease surveillance between the Centers for Disease Control, \nCDC, and State and local public health services to provide electronic \nnationwide access to critical data, treatment guidelines, and alerts.\n  Our legislation has been referred to the Senate Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, and there have already been a handful \nof hearings held so far. I anticipate a number of proposals, similar to \nours, being discussed and a compromise ultimately being sent to the \nPresident this year.\n  I will continue to work to ensure that the provisions in our \nlegislation dealing with rural communities and agriculture remain in a \nfinal version that is signed into law by the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10635-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ONE-MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF TERRORIST ATTACKS\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, grief has changed the face of America. \nWe are a tear-stained Nation. But today, one month after the September \n11 attacks, we are one America, united as seldom before.\n  Patriotism prevails throughout the country. The pins on our jackets, \nthe flags taped to cars and hanging from windows, the millions of \ndollars in donations to the victims, this is the American response to \ntragedy.\n  We are united in support of our troops flying dangerous missions over \nAfghanistan. This is the first step in a prolonged campaign against the \nterrorists. It is a necessary step and it is directed at the right \ntargets, the Taliban government that has given safe harbor to terrorist \norganizations for far too long.\n  Americans are also united in sympathy with the Afghan people. While \nour bombers are flying over Taliban strongholds, our C-17s are dropping \nfood to the refugees.\n  Today, our thoughts are with those who lost their lives one month \nago, and with the families who said goodbye to their loved ones for the \nlast time.\n  But in the past month, we have seen the great spirit of Americans. \nThe hatred and utter disregard for human life shown by the terrorists \nstands in stark contrast to the outpouring of sympathy and compassion \nby millions of Americans, in acts great and small. We gave what we \ncould: Money, water, shelter, blood, and sometimes just a shoulder to \nlean on. Entertainers came together for an unprecedented benefit, \nathletes donated their salaries, and children even donated their piggy \nbanks.\n  Among the most inspiring stories of September 11 were the rescue \nworkers. Sadly, many of the heroes of September 11 are now among the \nvictims. Their valor has inspired the Nation. Their sacrifice will not \ngo unnoted or their deeds unsung. If those rescue workers could muster \nthe strength to do what was needed then, surely our Nation can find the \nstrength to do what is needed now.\n  We must prepare our military, strengthen our intelligence operations, \nand tighten our security. And we must rally behind our President.\n  Let those who practice terrorism or harbor terrorists have no doubt \nabout America's intent. We will find you. We will strike you \nmilitarily, economically, and politically. And you will pay a heavy \nprice for your acts against mankind.\n  We have overcome the enemies of freedom before. We conquered the evil \nof fascism in Europe and Asia, rescued democracy, and built a better \nworld. We defied communism for decades powered by the certainty that \nfreedom would ultimately triumph over oppression. You will not take \nthese gains from us.\n  Though we mourn the loss of our fellow Americans, our eyes are \nundimmed by tears. Our dreams are undiminished by fear. From the ashes \nof terrorism, we will build a new tower to freedom that will cast its \nlight around the world.\n  And, with God's help, we will prove again what the poet Carl Sandburg \nonce said: ``We are Americans. Nothing like us ever was.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10635-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10635-S10636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, statistics show that a woman is raped \nevery five minutes in the United States and that one in every three \nadult women experiences at least one physical assault by a partner \nduring adulthood. In fact, more women are injured by domestic violence \neach year than by automobile accidents and cancer deaths combined.\n  October, as Domestic Violence Awareness Month, is a good time to take \na serious look at the progress we've made in addressing the problem of \nabuse against women in our communities. In 1983, I introduced \nlegislation in the South Dakota State Legislature to use marriage \nlicense fees to help fund domestic abuse shelters. At that time, \nthousands of South Dakota women and children were in need of shelters \nand programs to help them. However, few people wanted to acknowledge \nthat domestic abuse occurred in their communities, or even in their \nhomes.\n  During the last 7 years, I have led efforts in the United States \nCongress to authorize the original Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, \nand, most recently, expand and improve the program to assist rural \ncommunities. South Dakota has received over $8 million in VAWA funds \nfor women's' shelters and family violence prevention services. In \naddition the law has doubled prison time for repeat sex offenders, \nestablished mandatory restitution to victims of violence against women, \nand strengthened interstate enforcement of violent crimes against \nwomen. South Dakotans can also call a nationwide toll-free hotline for \nimmediate crisis intervention help and free referrals to local \nservices. The number for women to call for help is 1-800-799-SAFE.\n\n[[Page S10636]]\n\n  In South Dakota last year, over 5,500 women were provided assistance \nin domestic violence shelters and outreach centers thanks, in part, to \nVAWA funds. While I am pleased that we have made significant progress \nin getting resources to thousands of South Dakota women in need, it is \nimportant to look beyond the numbers. Fifty-five hundred neighbors, \nsisters, daughters, and wives in South Dakota were victimized by abuse \nlast year. Thousands of other women are abused and don't seek help. We \nmust also recognize that the problem is multiplied on the reservations \nwhere Native American women are abused at two and a half times the \nnational rate and are more than twice as likely to be rape victims as \nany other race of women.\n  The words of a domestic abuse survivor may best illustrate the need \nto remain vigilant in Congress and in our communities on preventing \ndomestic abuse. A woman from my State wrote me and explained that she \nwas abused as a child, raped as a teenager, and emotionally abused as a \nwife. Her grandchildren were also abused. In her letter, she pleaded: \n``Don't let another woman go through what I went through, and please \ndon't let another child go through what my grandchildren have gone \nthrough. You can make a difference.'' We all can make a difference by \nprotecting women from violence and abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10636-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 6, 2001 \nin Monmouth County, NJ. Seven people were sentenced on multiple counts, \nincluding aggravated assault and harassment by bias intimidation under \nthe state law, for assaulting a 23-year-old learning disabled man with \nhearing and speech impediments. The victim was lured to a party, bound, \nand physically and verbally assaulted for three hours. Later, he was \ntaken to a wooded area where the torture continued until he was able to \nescape.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10636-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS FOR PHYSICS\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to recognize the \naccomplishments of two Boulder, Colorado scientists. On October 10, \n2001 Carl E. Wieman, a professor of physics at the University of \nColorado at Boulder and Eric A. Cornell, the senior scientist at the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST), received the \nNobel Prize for Physics. The two shared the award with Wolfgang \nKetterle of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n  All three received this award for their work that created the world's \nfirst Bose-Einstein Condensate which occurs when a group of atoms \noverlap and their individual wavelengths behave in identical fashion \ncreating a ``superatom''. The condensate allows scientists to study the \nextremely small world of quantum physics as if they are looking through \na giant magnifying glass. Its creation established a new branch of \natomic physics that has provided a number of scientific discoveries.\n  The research was funded by the National Science Foundation, NIST, the \nOffice of Naval Research and the University of Colorado at Boulder. \nWeiman and Cornell are both fellows of JILA which is formerly known as \nthe Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics where much of the \nresearch was done. It is a joint institute of the University of \nColorado at Boulder and NIST and it exists for research and graduate \neducation in the physical sciences.\n  Both Wieman and Cornell have won several prestigious awards in the \npast including the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Physics from the Franklin \nInstitute in 2000, the Lorentz Medal from the Royal Netherlands Academy \nof Arts and Sciences in 1998, the King Faisal International Prize in \nScience in 1997 and the Fritz London Award for low-temperature physics \nin 1996.\n  Carl Wieman and Eric Cornell became the second and third Nobel Prize \nwinners at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Cornell is the \nsecond for NIST. Thomas Cech, a CU-Boulder professor of Chemistry and \nbiochemistry, was a co winner of the 1989 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with \nSydney Altman of Yale University for research on RNA. William Phillips, \nA NIST fellow, shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in physics.\n  I want to personally congratulate Carl Wieman and Eric Cornell for \nthis truly prestigious award of excellence in scientific research.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10636-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REWARDS FOR JUSTICE FUND\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, since the brutal assault on our Nation \nalmost 3 weeks ago, Americans of all walks of life have asked the \nquestion: How can I help in the fight against terrorism? One option is \nthe Rewards for Justice Fund, a nonprofit organization that was created \nin the days following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center \nand the Pentagon. The fund was announced on the Today Show on October \n1, 2001.\n  Since 1984, the Rewards for Justice Program has quietly but \neffectively thwarted terrorism by using reward payments to obtain \ninformation on terrorists' locations and plans. The Rewards for Justice \nProgram enables individual citizens to unite and make financial \ncontributions to the Department of State Rewards for Justice Program. \nMoney raised by individual citizens responding to the Fund's call to \naction, will be turned over directly to the State Department's anti-\nterrorism program. The Rewards for Justice Fund represents the first \nbroad based fund of individual citizen contributions to be accepted by \nthe Department of State to enhance the anti-terrorism program.\n  Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security David Carpenter, \nsays: ``It's clear to us that the Rewards for Justice Program saves \nlives, in that those who have perpetrated crimes against us in the past \noften intend to perpetrate additional crimes. The information we \nreceive by offering rewards has saved countless lives and we are \nconfident it will save additional lives in the future.''\n  In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, Americans have shown \ntremendous resolve in raising money to help the victims and their \nfamilies. Now, the same involvement and spirit that is the trademark of \nour great country will be focused on the very important quest of \ntracking and apprehending terrorists, both at home and abroad.\n  Information on the Rewards for Justice Fund can be found on the \nInternet at www.rewardsfund.com. For more information on the State \nDepartment's Rewards for Justice Program see their website at \nwww.dssrewards.net/index.htm.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10636-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10636-S10637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ENERGY LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to make a short comment regarding \nenergy legislation. I have heard a few of my colleagues question how \nMajority Leader Daschle is handling the Senate schedule. I want to take \nexception to those complaints.\n  I believe the Majority Leader has done an outstanding job moving \nlegislation this Congress. We started the year with a new \nAdministration and then the Senate changed hands, that is difficult \nenough. And since September 11 we are in truly extraordinary times. \nYet, under his leadership, and with the leadership of President Bush \nand Minority Leader Lott, we have moved quickly and decisively to \napprove the use of force, to appropriate emergency funding and assist \nthe airline industry. That progress stalled this week with objections \nover the airline security proposal, but that is hardly the fault of the \nMajority Leader. It's ironic that members came to the floor to protest \nthe schedule for an energy bill on a day that their leadership delayed \nthe airline security bill. Majority Leader Daschle is not the problem.\n\n[[Page S10637]]\n\n  As for the Majority Leader's decision to move an energy bill directly \nto the floor, that's his prerogative as our majority leader. It's been \ndone before and it will very likely be done again. Chairman Bingaman \nhas asked that we support the Majority Leader's decision, and I do. The \nMajority Leader's decision recognizes the reality that energy policy \nreaches beyond the Energy Committee in an important ways. It impacts \nissues in the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, Commerce \nCommittee, the Environment and Public works Committee, among others.\n  As for his managing of the Senate schedule for the remainder of this \nsession, I trust that he will use his best judgement, and will, as he \nalways has, confer with the minority, to decide the order of \nlegislation. We have spent more than a week on airline security, a \npriority issue I believe. We then must address the terrorism prevention \nbill. We have several appropriation bills to take up and pass. We may \nconsider an economic stimulus package. We may consider a Farm Bill. And \nwe really don't know what else will be necessary of us in the coming \nweeks. The past month has demonstrated the unpredictability of our \nwork. So, I would urge the Majority Leader to listen to all Senators' \nconcerns but to be wary of demands from members that we consider \nlegislation in their preferred order. We have a lot of work to do, \nlittle time to do it, and don't know what the coming weeks may hold.\n  Very briefly, I'd like to comment on two statements made regarding \nenergy security on the floor yesterday. First, one of my colleagues \nnoted that America imports more than 50 percent of our oil, and then \nimplied that should we find ourselves in a military conflict those \nimports, half the oil we consume, might be lost. I want to say, to \nassure my colleagues and the public, that that dire scenario is not at \nall plausible. Today, America depends less on the Middle Eastern oil \nthan we did during the oil embargo of the 1970s. We import almost 30 \npercent of our oil from Mexico, Canada, Great Britain, Colombia, Norway \nand Venezuela. It's wrong to suggest that these nations would abandon \nthe United States during a military conflict.\n  Secondly, I have heard statements referring to the energy needs of \nthe U.S. military, suggesting, I guess, that if we don't pass an energy \nbill immediately the military might run short of fuel. The military \ndoesn't lack the oil it needs to operate. Even if this fictitious \nworldwide embargo of U.S. oil imports that my colleagues contemplate \never took place, this Nation's military would have all the oil it \nneeds.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nMinnesota Taxpayers Association, for its long and proud history of \nworking to disseminate accurate, nonpartisan fiscal information to the \ncitizens of Minnesota. The Minnesota Taxpayers Association celebrates \nits 75th anniversary this year, as one of the Nation's most acclaimed \ntaxpayer organizations.\n  Its membership has been comprised of thousands of Minnesota's \nbusiness leaders, government officials and concerned citizens. Its \nstellar leadership, on both its Board and its staff, has consistently \nbeen populated by Minnesota's most able and intelligent citizens.\n  The Minnesota Taxpayers Association, MTA, was founded in 1926 when \nAmerica was in the middle of a strong recovery from World War I, and we \nwere on a ``return to normalcy'' path in both foreign relations and \ndomestic policies.\n  The Association started as part of a larger government research \nmovement in the country aimed at bringing more professionalism to \ngovernment, particularly local government. The first steps toward \nlaunching the Minnesota Taxpayers Association were taken at a meeting \nin Minneapolis on February 25, 1926. It was planned that the \nAssociation's core would consist of representatives of 15 local \ntaxpayers groups. The first objective of the new nonpartisan \nassociation was to reduce taxes. Three other objectives were to \neliminate extravagance, reduce public debt, and stop misuse of public \nfunds.\n  On November 22, 1926, the Association became a permanent organization \nat a meeting at the Nicollet Hotel in Minneapolis. In short order, \nrepresentatives of 28 counties formed the South Central, Southeast, and \nSouthwest Taxpayers Associations at meetings in Mankato, Rochester, and \nWorthington, MN, respectively. They were so successful that by April of \n1927 there were 45 county taxpayer groups across the State. By World \nWar II, the MTA had grown to be an association of 81 county taxpayer \ngroups.\n  In August of 1956, the MTA merged with the Minnesota Institute of \nGovernmental Research, MIGR, another nonpartisan government research \norganization. The institute's research bulletins covered such topics as \nproperty tax issues; the merits of a sales taxation, more than 30 years \nbefore the State's first sales tax in 1967; and an analysis of the new \nSocial Security Act and its implications for Minnesota.\n  Because government itself did little research in those days, MIGR had \na tremendous impact on Minnesota State government. MIGR's work inspired \nthe creation of the 1939 Reorganization Act under Governor Harold \nStassen. This act received national attention as it produced major \nimprovements in the administration of State government, saving millions \nof dollars in the first 10 years after enactment.\n  It was through the Reorganization Act and the work of MIGR that the \nDepartments of Taxation and Administration were created and the spoils \nsystem was replaced with civil service. As a follow-up to the \nReorganization Act, MIGR staff was loaned to the ``Little Hoover'' \nCommission of the early 1950s to study areas for further reform in \nState government.\n  Within two years of the merger, in August of 1958, MTA became \nincorporated. At that time, it moved away from being an umbrella \norganization for county-level taxpayer groups to being an organization \nwith its own\n\n[[Page S10638]]\n\nboard of directors and a statewide membership of individuals and \ncompanies. Its focus also changed to monitoring State fiscal matters \nand advocating for sound fiscal policy.\n  In 1957, MTA started publishing ``Fiscal Facts for Minnesotans,'' a \npopular handbook of State and local fiscal data that continues to be \npublished today. A widely read and discussed publication series was \nbegun in 1969 with the first release of ``How Does Minnesota Compare?'' \na State-by-State comparison of key tax and spending aggregates.\n  The Minnesota Taxpayers Association has steadfastly stressed the \nimportance of good information and citizen involvement in government. \nAs evidence of its commitment to these goals, the Association continues \nto focus on research publications aimed at educating the public, \npublications like its award-winning ``Understanding Your Property \nTaxes'' and its ``Guide to State Government Spending,'' as well as on \ncountless public presentations and frequent legislative consultations.\n  As State and local governments take on more responsibility for \ndesigning, funding, and delivering public services, and as taxpayers \nlook for greater value for their tax dollars, the need for \norganizations like the Minnesota Taxpayers Association increases. The \nAssociation's work over the past 75 years has been a great asset to the \npeople of Minnesota, and its reputation for excellence and integrity \nassures a prominent and vital role for this outstanding organization in \nthe improvement of Minnesota State and local government in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10638-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO FRAN FLANIGAN\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \nhonor an extraordinary Marylander and steward of the Chesapeake Bay, \nFran Flanigan. Fran is stepping down from a long and distinguished \ncareer as executive director of the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay and \nI want to express my personal congratulations and thanks for her \noutstanding and dedicated service.\n  When the history of the Chesapeake Bay restoration effort is finally \nwritten there are many people who will be recognized for the role they \nplayed in helping to ``Save the Bay.'' But Fran's hard work and \ncreativity over the past three decades will distinguish her as one of \nthe true leaders in this important endeavor. Fran has been a determined \nadvocate for the Chesapeake Bay from virtually the inception of the Bay \nprogram. In December 1983, she organized a 3-day conference which \nbrought together the Governors of Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania, \nthe EPA Administrator, members of the State legislatures and many other \nindividuals and organization. That conference resulted in the signing \nof the Chesapeake Bay Agreement which formally bound the Federal and \nState governments to work together to restore the Bay and effectively \ninitiated the cooperative Chesapeake Bay Program.\n  I became acquainted with Fran during that historic summit and have \nhad the opportunity to work closely with her and her non-profit \norganization, the Citizens Program for the Chesapeake Bay, later the \nAlliance for the Chesapeake Bay, for many years. I can personally \nattest to the tremendous energy and creativity which she consistently \nbrought to her work. Fran has an amazing ability to pull people \ntogether and has been called upon time and time again to convene \nstakeholder roundtables on key issues and expand public involvement. \nWhether the subject was agriculture, toxic pollution or land use, Fran \nwould try to find common ground and a way to ensure that different \nStates and interest groups moved forward together for the betterment of \nthe Chesapeake Bay.\n  Fran Flanigan and Alliance have been very forward thinking and helped \nmove the Bay cleanup program upstream into the rivers that flow into \nthe Chesapeake. She reoriented the Alliance to work at a more local \nlevel and promote local restoration activities, all in an effort to \nbetter acquaint the public with the resources they were working to \nprotect and restore. She knew that public participation in the efforts \nto clean up the Bay were essential and the key to keeping the Bay \ncleanup effort on course and worked hard to keep the public informed \nabout key Chesapeake issues through the Alliance's outstanding white \npapers, fact sheets, newsletters and the Bay Journal. She also helped \norganize everything from small watershed groups to huge public outreach \nefforts such as those needed before the signing of the 1987 and 2000 \nBay Agreements.\n  Fran has been there on the front line from the very start of the Bay \nprogram and, even in retirement, I know will continue to be involved in \nthe Bay efforts. Her dedication and efforts over the years have earned \nher the respect and admiration of everyone with whom she has worked. \nShe has been instrumental in bringing to so many people an enjoyment \nand sense of ownership of the Chesapeake Bay. I join with her many \ncolleagues and friends in extending my best wishes and thanks for her \nleadership and commitment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10638-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10638-S10639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RECOGNITION OF PETER HENRY'S SERVICE TO SOUTH DAKOTA VETERANS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nextraordinary work done by Peter Henry as Director of the VA Black \nHills Health Care System in Fort Meade and Hot Springs, SD. I also wish \nhim all the best in his new position as Chief Executive Officer of the \nExtended Care and Rehabilitation Patient Service Line for Veterans \nIntegrated Service Network, VISN, 13.\n  Peter has been a valuable asset in working the myriad of issues \naffecting the VA over the years, especially his efforts to keep \nservices going to Category C veterans when others could not. Peter, his \nwife Sharon, and their five children, have also been important members \nof the Black Hills community. Peter serves on the Board of the Sturgis \nArea Chamber of Commerce and the Sturgis United Way.\n  Peter's service in the VA dates back to 1970, when he was a \nManagement Intern at VA Central Office in Washington, DC. He later \nserved as Chief of Personnel Service at Vancouver, Martinez, and Palo \nAlto VAMCs. He completed the Associate Director Training Program in \n1982 at the VAMC in San Francisco, CA. Peter then served as Associate \nDirector at the James A. Haley Veterans Hospital in Tampa, FL and as \nAssistant Medical Center Director at the VAMC Long Beach, CA.\n  Peter came to South Dakota in 1993 as the Director of the Medical \nCenter at Fort Meade, SD. Three years later, he became Director of the \nVA Black Hills Health Care System. Peter is a third generation VA \nemployee and currently serves as president of the VA Chapter of the \nSenior Executives Association and on the National Board of that \norganization.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with Peter through my career in \nthe United States House of Representatives and now in the United States \nSenate. Peter has helped to educate me and other South Dakota officials \non a variety of veterans issues, and his caring for the individual \nveterans in the Black Hills has been a great asset to our efforts to \nimprove health care services for our Nation's heroes. Peter's \ncommitment to expanding VA services into rural regions of South Dakota \nincludes the use of outreach clinics which have allowed veterans in \nrural areas to receive needed care closer to their homes.\n  As I travel South Dakota and meet with veterans, I am reminded of the \nvery core of what the Founding Fathers meant when they talked about \nAmerica's citizen soldiers who serve as the bulwark of defending our \ndemocracy and freedom. The sacrifices of the men and women who served \nthis Nation in time of war are a dramatic story that we need to tell to \nfuture generations.\n  We need to remind younger generations of the sacrifice of the quiet \nheroes who have served our Nation in the military service. We need to \nremind them that freedom isn't really free. Throughout our Nation's \nproud history, people have made profound sacrifices to preserve liberty \nand democracy.\n  I am pleased that with the help of dedicated people like Peter Henry, \nwe have finally begun to honor additional commitments made to veterans \nnationwide. Peter and his staff at the VA Black Hills Health Care \nSystem know that veterans health care is this Nation's priority and not \njust an afterthought. I look forward to working\n\n[[Page S10639]]\n\nwith Peter, in his new role with VISN 13, to continue to improve \nveterans health care services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10639-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 7:35 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1992.

A bill to provide improved safety and security measures for \nrail transportation, provide for improved passenger rail service, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, one month ago today, the United States \nwas attacked by terrorists who hijacked airplanes and used them as \nweapons against the World Trade Center, Pentagon and another unknown \ntarget which was crashed into a field in Pennsylvania. After the \nFederal Aviation Administration grounded the airlines following the \nterrorist attacks, travelers flocked to Amtrak. Whether people had to \ntravel for business, to help with rescue efforts, or just to get home, \nAmtrak kept our American citizens moving during a time of national \nemergency.\n  The situation not only proved that Amtrak works, but that Amtrak is a \ncritical part of our transportation infrastructure during a national \nemergency. Now that airlines have reduced their flights on the East \nCoast and throughout the country, more of the passenger burden has \nfallen on Amtrak, which carries 35,000 passengers along the Northeast \nCorridor everyday. Even the U.S. Postal Office carried 237 extra \ncarloads of mail in the days following the terrorist attacks.\n  Today I am introducing the Railroad Advancement and Infrastructure \nLaw of the 21st Century, or RAIL-21. In the short run, this bill will \nprovide emergency security assistance to Amtrak, a key part of our \nnational transportation infrastructure. In the long run, this bill will \nspark the building of important high-speed rail infrastructure in high-\nvolume corridors across the United States, reducing our dependence on \nair and highway travel.\n  In light of the events of September 11, it is important to look at \nthe entire transportation system. Transportation security requires a \nbalanced and competitive system of transportation alternatives. Three \nweeks ago we found out that our dependence on the aviation system \nalmost crippled us. We cannot be overly reliant on any single mode of \ntransportation; we need to ensure that we have a balanced system.\n  Today we are trying to pass the airline security bill to make airline \npassengers feel safe so they will fly again. We need to make passengers \nfeel just as safe when they travel by train. And we need to make sure \nwe have transportation alternatives.\n  To address Amtrak's immediate concerns, the bill would authorize $3.2 \nbillion in emergency spending for Amtrak's security and capacity needs. \nThe money will pay for more police, surveillance, fencing and lighting \nat the train stations and train yards; life-safety improvements and \nmore fire-fighting capacity for tunnels in New York, Baltimore and \nWashington, D.C.;\n\n[[Page S10642]]\n\nand more passenger cars and capacity improvements to meet the growing \ndemand for train service.\n  RAIL-21 would reauthorize Amtrak for one year with $1.2 billion for \ncapital and operating expenses. The bill would allow Amtrak to continue \nits GSA vehicle lease agreements and would suspend Amtrak's redemption \nrequirements for common stock until the end of FY2004.\n\n  Additionally, the bill would remove the operational self-sufficiency \nrequirement passed three years ago. Let me talk about that for a \nmoment. There is no truly national passenger train service in the world \nthat makes a profit. Requiring Amtrak to do so has forced the railroad \nto short-change critical infrastructure investments in order to meet a \nquestionable economic model. We must free Amtrak from this requirement \nso they can go back to running a passenger railroad with modern and \nsafe equipment, not juggling bond payments and taking out mortgages on \nPenn Station just to meet an impossible self-sufficiency deadline.\n  Nations invest in passenger rail service because it increases the \nopportunities to travel and thus a Nation's quality of life. Rail \nservice also reduces car congestion and pollution. And we saw last \nmonth that, during a national emergency, having a viable, operating \nnational train system can be a strategic asset.\n  Kenneth Mead, the Inspector General for the Department of \nTransportation, has said the drive for self-sufficiency has forced \nAmtrak to spend money on quick projects that improve the short-term \nbottom line while cutting back on maintenance and investments.\n  Those who want Amtrak to operate without Federal assistance, \nultimately forcing the railroad's passengers onto cars, buses and \nairplanes, always cry that we should not ``subsidize'' Amtrak. But we \nsubsidize the building of roads and highways with tax dollars. We \nsubsidize the building of airports and pay flight controllers with tax \ndollars. We consider those subsidies to be worthwhile investments in \nour economy and our quality of life. We must make the same investment \nthat other countries make it passenger rail service.\n  While that argument should stand on its own, here's something the \nhighway and airplane crowd can take to the bank: moving more short-haul \ntravelers to rail service reduces congestion on our already overcrowded \nhighways and eases congestion at airports, allowing airlines to focus \non more-profitable, long-distance routes. Investing in passenger rail \nimproves conditions for highway and airport users at a fraction of the \ncost per mile traveled.\n  According to some experts, Amtrak has reduced air traffic congestion \nout of Philadelphia's airport by 50 flights a day. Rail service between \nNew York and Washington carries enough passengers to fill 121 airline \nflights per day. Now, with reduced flights out of East Coast airports, \nit makes more sense to look at Amtrak not only as a transportation \nalternative, but as a transportation mainstay for regional corridors \nall over the U.S.\n  Amtrak has been severely under-capitalized since its inception in \n1971. We would not be talking about many of these problems with Amtrak \nif it had been given the proper seed money for capital and annual \nfunding from the very beginning.\n  And that leads me to the second part of this bill, in which we look \nto passenger rail's long-term future. The passenger railroad system \nthat has worked on the Northeast Coast can work in other high-\ncongestion areas of the country: the South, the Midwest, California and \nthe Northwest.\n  Thirty years ago, those areas did not have the population to support \nhigh-speed intercity rail. But today those areas are growing by leaps \nand bounds. As the highways in those areas clog up and the planes run \nthree hours late, their governors, many of them Republicans, are asking \nus for help to build high speed rail.\n  RAIL-21 authorizes $35 billion in direct loans and loan guarantees \nfor passenger rail, freight rail, and rail security enhancements. The \ncriteria for these loans will replace language contained three years \nago in TEA-21.\n  TEA-21 directed the Department of Transportation to establish a \nprogram to replace the old Title V loan guarantee program which was \nused to build, rehabilitate or upgrade primarily short line railroads. \nOn September 5, 2000, the DOT issued a final rule on the Railroad \nRehabilitation and improvement Financing Program (RRIF) to provide \ndirect loans and loan guarantees to State and local governments, \ngovernment sponsored authorities and corporations, railroads, and joint \nventures that include at least one railroad.\n  Eligible projects for RRIF include: 1. acquisition, improvement or \nrehabilitation of intermodal or rail equipment of facilities (including \ntracks, components of tracks, bridges, yards, buildings, and shops), 2. \nthe refinancing of outstanding debt incurred for these purposes; 3. \ndevelopment or establishment of new intermodal or railroad facilities, \n4. and security purposes.\n  RAIL-21 eliminates much of the bureaucratic red tape that has delayed \nany TEA-21 loans or loan guarantees from being issued.\n  Under RAIL-21, Class 1 railroads, regional railroads, short lines, \nand passenger projects would be eligible for loans and loan guarantees. \nThe bill would set aside $7 billion of the loans and loan guarantees \nfor short lines.\n  RAIL-21 also establishes a $350 million grant program for \nrehabilitating, preserving or improving railroad tracks for regional \nand short line railroads. Short line railroads have saved tens of \nthousands of miles of light density rail line from abandonment. In \n1980, there were 220 short line railroads in the U.S. Today there are \nover 500 short line railroads, due in part to the mergers and \nstreamlining of Class I operations which encouraged the larger \ncompanies to sell off their little-used or abandoned branch lines. \nShort line and regional railroads are an important and growing \ncomponent of the railroad industry. Today they operate and maintain 29 \npercent of the American railroad industry's route mileage and account \nfor 9 percent of the rail industry's freight revenue and 11 percent of \nrailroad employment.\n  These line railroads employ approximately 25,000 workers, serve \nthousands of local and rural shippers, and are often the only \nconnection these shippers have to the national rail network. To \nsurvive, this infrastructure needs to be upgraded in order to move the \nheavier cars that are currently being moved by the Class I railroads. \nThe revenues of the smaller railroads are not sufficient to get the job \ndone.\n  Since 1982, the short lines and regional railroads have maintained \nthe track in rural areas where rail service would have been abandoned \nby the Class I railroads. Because of their relatively low traffic \nlevels, the Class I railroads could not afford to invest in this \ninfrastructure and, as a result, allowed these lines to slowly \ndeteriorate. With a lower cost structure and more flexible service, \nshort line companies that bought the track have been able to keep them \ngoing. However, the revenue is still not high enough to make up for \npast years of neglect.\n  Today, two factors have combined to bring this situation to a head. \nFirst, the advent of the heavier 286,000-pound cars that are becoming \nthe standard of the Class I industry require substantially higher \ninvestment in the track. Second, as the Class I industry puts a greater \npremium on speed and precisely scheduled operations, the short line \nrailroads must meet these higher standards or be cut off from the \nnational system.\n  This legislation does not create a long-term program to fix this \nproblem, but instead it creates a one-time fix for this problem. While \nthese small railroads have enough traffic to operate profitably on an \nongoing basis, they do not earn enough to make the large capital \ninvestment required by the advent of the 286,000-pound cars or the need \nto significantly increase speed. This legislation would authorize a \nprogram that could provide grants to the nation's smaller railroads to \nhelp them make the improvements needed to stay in business and continue \nto serve small shippers.\n  RAIL-21 also would authorize $50 million in matching grants annually \nduring FY02 through FY04: $25 million would be available for security \nand technology research and development; $25 million would be available \nfor corridor planning and acquisition of rolling stock, with preference \ngiven to designated corridors.\n  RAIL-21 identifies existing high-speed corridors for priority \nconsideration. Many of these corridors are in\n\n[[Page S10643]]\n\nthe South, Midwest and California where people are now driving cars or \ntaking airplanes on trips of 200 miles or less. In these areas, like \nthe East Coast, travelers could take a high-speed train instead, and \narrive about the same time.\n  But right now they don't have that option. Therefore, we have a \nproblem here: They can't use it if we don't build it.\n  We built high speed rail on the East Coast, and the people have used \nit. If we build rail corridors around Chicago and the Midwestern \ncities, they will use it. If we build rail lines in the South from \nWashington, D.C. through the Carolinas to Atlanta and Florida, they \nwill ride it. If we build a corridor in California from San Diego to \nSacramento, they will ride it.\n  This bill does not only support Amtrak. It is intended for commuter \nrail, freight railroads, and short line operators. That's what many \nSenators, governors and constituents have asked for.\n  In the long term, travel in the United States will outpace the \nability of airports and highways to handle the volume. With the tighter \nsecurity checks at the airports, it will be faster to make trips of \n200-300 miles by train than by air. More train travel will reduce \ncongestion at our most crowded airports and our most gridlocked \nInterstate highways.\n  I am pleased my colleagues have joined with me to introduce this \nbill, which we hope to move quickly. Modernizing Amtrak now will create \njobs in the short run to stimulate our economy. And by modernizing our \ntransportation infrastructure, high-speed rail corridors will play a \nkey role in our long-term prosperity.\n  I would ask that the text of my bill and a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1530\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the payment of emergency extended \nunemployment compensation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the President's \nEmergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act.\n  The Senator from California was talking about her concerns, help on \nthe way. I think we all share those concerns. While the actions of \nAmericans have shown that we are trying to get open for business again, \nwe are obviously united in our resolve that a long fight awaits us \nbecause of these vile terrorist acts of September 11, 2001.\n  This flag is from the Pentagon. The President just gave a wonderful \nspeech, as did Secretary Rumsfeld. Everyone was united in tears and in \nlove for those families who lost loved ones and, also, a resolve that \nfreedom and justice will prevail.\n  Indeed, we are working to rebuild and recover. The President talked \nabout rebuilding the Pentagon. Others have talked about rebuilding in \nNew York. The rescue, recovery, cleanup, and rebuilding efforts will be \nenormous.\n  Congress has responded with $40 billion in aid. The airline industry, \nwhich is responsible for 10 percent of the Nation's gross domestic \nproduct, as well as being a key element of our reserve military airlift \nfleet, needs to remain solvent. We recognize that.\n  We understood that the FAA closed our skies after the terrorist \nattacks. We have responded with $5 billion in cash for lost revenue, \ndue to the skies being closed, to help get our airlines back in the sky \nas quickly as possible.\n  The perception of safety while flying has been shaken to the core. I \nhave participated in hearings in the Commerce Committee working to help \ncraft legislation aimed at improving aviation safety both on the ground \nat airports, and on our aircraft as well. Senators Hollings, McCain, \nRockefeller, and Hutchison have worked hard in bringing this bill to \nthe floor to do just that. We will pass this legislation to ensure that \nno commercial airliner or any aircraft in this country ever again is \ncommandeered and used as a weapon.\n  Ronald Reagan National Airport, which is a symbol of the Nation's \nCapital and our transportation system, remained closed for nearly 3 \nweeks due to Federal order. After nearly 3 weeks of consideration of \nideas for safety and special precautions for Reagan National Airport, \nlast week President Bush very wisely announced a plan with a phased-in \napproach so that flights at Ronald Reagan National Airport could start. \nI was fortunate to be on the first flight out of Reagan since that \nfateful day last Thursday.\n  For the first 3 weeks of the reopening of Reagan National Airport, it \nis restricted to operating at 24-percent capacity. After that, in phase \n2, it will be at 57-percent capacity for as long as 7 weeks. We still \nhave a lot of work to do. While our general aviation pilots are \nfortunately back in the skies, there are still limitations on airspace \nall around the country.\n  Airline carriers and manufacturers have laid off over 100,000 \nemployees. Airport employees and workers for businesses located in and \naround airport facilities are losing jobs by the thousands. Reagan \nNational Airport is again open for business, but many of its 10,200 \nemployees are out of work since they are restricted to operating at \none-quarter capacity. Vendors, business owners, and concessionaires at \nthe airport have lost revenues and jobs because of this direct Federal \naction. The shock waves are being felt throughout our economy--from \nretail establishments to high-tech businesses.\n  Now that we have addressed some of the recovery and rebuilding \nefforts, we are finally able to turn our attention to these hard-\nworking Americans who unfortunately have lost their jobs through no \nfault of their own. Today, on behalf of the President, I am introducing \nlegislation to provide that necessary assistance for the backbone of \nour economy--the free people of the greatest and strongest nation on \nEarth.\n  The President's plan will provide health coverage, unemployment \nbenefits, and job training assistance to hard-working Americans who \nhave lost their jobs as a result of the economic downturn since the \nSeptember 11 attacks.\n  Specifically, it will extend unemployment benefits for up to 13 weeks \nbeyond what individual States cover. It will provide COBRA health \ninsurance premiums, which are substantially covered by the Federal \nGovernment, for up to 10 months.\n  It will also more easily allow affected workers to avail themselves \nof more than $6 billion in Federal programs that provide job search, \ntraining, placement, and other services.\n\n[[Page S10646]]\n\n  It makes $11 billion available to States to help low-income workers \nand families who have lost their jobs to maintain health insurance \nthrough either the S-CHIP or Medicaid Programs.\n  It will also provide $3 billion to States in the form of national \nemergency grants that Governors can fashion to best address the needs \nof their States to help workers maintain health care coverage, \nsupplement their income, and receive job training. Also, the Governors \ncan use it to compensate employees who have lost their jobs due to this \ndirect Federal intervention.\n  In addition, the White House, my office, and the Republican Senate \nleadership offices, have been working through the night addressing some \nof the specific concerns I have for Reagan National Airport. That is \nwhy I will add an amendment to the President's package to address those \nspecific concerns, because although actions such as the Reagan National \nshutdown are sometimes necessary for national security reasons, those \nactions that will directly impact the ability of hard-working Americans \nand business owners to make a living. We should respond in realization \nthat limited Federal benefits are little comfort to those thrown out of \nwork due to a Federal action.\n\n  That is why my supplemental amendment will also allow the Governors \nof the States where major disasters have been declared to use their \nnational emergency grants to supplement the incomes of those unemployed \nor underemployed because of direct Federal action, or for the lost \nrevenues of those businesses that were similarly affected. These are \nnot mandated, direct Federal grants but allowable uses under the \nnational emergency grant programs at the discretion of Governors.\n  Again, it makes sense. If the Federal Government has an action that \nharms someone, whether it is their property or their livelihood, the \nFederal Government ought to help them. It is indeed the same logic we \nused in helping the airline industry.\n  The White House, of course, has seen the need to act. They understand \nthat direct Federal action is necessary. Unfortunately, it was \nnecessary to keep Reagan National closed for a while. The leadership at \nthe White House and the Senate Republicans have been very helpful in \nanalyzing this supplemental amendment, and I believe we can make it \nwork out in the end.\n  Most of all, I know all Americans have significant concerns about \njobs--jobs for people in all of our States. These job losses are not \nunique to New York, or Virginia, where those terrorist attacks have the \ngreatest impact; the job losses are felt in every corner of our \ncountry. We see smaller airports worrying about whether or not they are \ngoing to have service.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this measure today for this \nneeded aid to help our hard-working citizens all over America recover \nfrom the extended effects of this horrific disaster. In times like \nthis, I believe the entire Nation has a role to play in keeping \nAmerican businesses and entrepreneurs running, and especially in \nkeeping Americans at work.\n  Once again, I believe America will triumph over tyrants and we will \nstand strong with our people; unwavering in the face of terrorism. We \nwill show that not only is America open for business but also that \nAmerica means business.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 1534. A bill to establish the Department of National Homeland \nSecurity; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today, Senator Specter and I are \nintroducing legislation to create a Department of National Homeland \nSecurity. One month ago, America suffered devastating attacks at the \nhands of terrorists with whom we are now at war. Our Nation has \nstruggled to adjust to the realization that our citizens are vulnerable \nto hostile acts on the part of adversaries whose methods are as \nfanatical as their goals. The legislation we are introducing is \nintended to provide Americans with the assurance they need to return to \ntheir daily routines without fear of further attack, and so confound \nthe terrorists, whose aim was to disrupt our lives and break our \nspirit.\n  Shortly after the attacks, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee \nheld a hearing to explore how government could better organize itself \nto defend against such threats. Former Senators Gary Hart and Warren \nRudman, co-chairs of the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st \nCentury, offered compelling testimony in favor of creating a homeland \nsecurity agency.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is based largely on the \nCommission's recommendation. It will create a cabinet-level Department \nof National Homeland Security. This Department would bring the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, the Customs Service, the Border Patrol, \nthe Coast Guard, and certain offices responsible for critical \ninfrastructure protection under a single administrative umbrella.\n  The Department will be headed by a Secretary, who will be appointed \nby the President and confirmed by the Senate, and who will be a \nstatutory member of the National Security Council. The Secretary will \nbe accountable to the Congress and the American people. Like other \ncabinet members, the Secretary for Homeland Security would enjoy \nexecutive control over personnel and programs, and have all-important \nbudget authority over his department's spending priorities. The \nSecretary for Homeland Security would have the rank and power to ensure \nthat the security of our homeland remains high on our national agenda, \nand that all necessary resources are made available toward that end.\n  The new Department would be organized into three functional \ndirectorates that would be responsible for ``3 Ps\": prevention, \nprotection, and preparation for response.\n  The Coast Guard, Customs Service, and Border Patrol would comprise \nthe ``prevention'' directorate, responsible for securing our borders \nand making sure that potentially harmful persons or materials never \nmake it onto American soil. Each of these organizations is now on the \nfront line of our nation's efforts to prevent future acts of terrorism; \nhowever, they are not working together as well as they should, a \nproblem exacerbated by the fact that homeland security is not among \ntheir parent agencies' primary missions. They require additional \nresources, but they also need to be under a single Secretary, who can \ndirect their efforts jointly to fulfill a shared homeland defense \nmission.\n  The Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office and the Information \nInfrastructure Protection Institute, both of the Commerce Department, \nand the National Infrastructure Protection Center, now located in the \nFBI, would serve as the nucleus of the ``protection'' directorate, with \nthe difficult task of working to help safeguard our transportation \nnetworks, power grids, water supply, cybersystems and other essential \nsystems from attacks or other threats. These offices share essentially \nthe same mission, and it makes sense that they are placed under a \nsingle Department and Secretary, so that they operate in unison.\n  Finally, FEMA and the FBI's National Domestic Preparedness Office \nwould form the core of the ``preparation'' directorate, which would \nconduct the planning and mitigation measures necessary to prepare for \ndisasters as well as to operate the crisis and recovery response \nmachinery when emergencies do occur. Importantly, by building this \ndirectorate around FEMA, we will ensure that much of the Homeland \nDefense Department's organizational infrastructure will be focused \ntowards working effectively with State and local governments, which are \nclearly key players in homeland defense.\n  In short, this legislation is meant to structure homeland defense in \na way that makes sense operationally, but also in terms of maximizing \nfunding priorities, interagency cooperation, and bureaucratic clout.\n  In proposing this legislation, we know well that there are other \nideas and proposals under consideration, and we look forward to working \nwith our House and Senate colleagues, as well as the President, to \narrive at what is best for the American people. The President has \nappointed Governor Tom Ridge to head a the new Office of Homeland \nSecurity in the White House, to coordinate strategy across the 40-plus \ngovernment agencies that now have important roles to play in the fight \nagainst terrorism. This is clearly a critical\n\n[[Page S10647]]\n\nfunction. I absolutely agree that there must be better coordination \nacross the agencies, including intelligence and law-enforcement \nfunctions, which are central to preventing acts of terror at home. My \nfear is that it is not enough to improve coordination and cooperation \nacross the existing array of federal agencies and programs.\n  I am convinced that protecting our homeland requires nothing less \nthan the establishment of a robust, cabinet-level Department, and led \nby a Secretary who has executive control over key agencies, full \nauthority over his organization's budget, the ability to deploy \npersonnel and resources, and the capacity to make and implement \ndecisions immediately.\n  I am proud to have Senator Specter as a principal cosponsor of this \nlegislation. I am pleased to note that similar legislation has been \noffered in the House by Rep. Mac Thornberry, Rep. Ellen Tauscher, and \nothers, who deserve our thanks for drafting this legislation well \nbefore the events of September 11, 2001. We look forward to working \nwith them and other interested Members of Congress, as well as the \nAdministration, to ensure that our government is effectively organized \nto defend the American people at home.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1534\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nresearch on, and services for individuals with, postpartum depression \nand psychosis; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Melanie \nStokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act with my colleague \nfrom Illinois, Senator Fitzgerald. This legislation develops a \ncoordinated approach for understanding and treating the devastating \nmental health disorder of postpartum depression.\n  This act is named for Chicago native Melanie Stokes, a successful \npharmaceutical sales manager and loving wife of Dr. Sam Stokes, who \ngave birth on February 23, 2001 to her daughter, Sommer Skyy. \nUnfortunately, with the birth of her daughter, Melanie entered into a \nbattle for her life with a devastating mood disorder known as \npostpartum psychosis. Mrs. Stokes was in and out of hospitals three \ntimes, each for a week to 10 days. She stopped eating and drinking and \nrefused to swallow pills. Her weight dropped rapidly. Despite medical \nassistance and the support of her family and friends, Mrs. Stokes lost \nher battle with postpartum psychosis. Melanie jumped to her death from \na 12-story window ledge on June 11, 2001. In addition to Melanie \nStokes, in my own home State of Illinois, three other women suffering \nfrom postpartum depression or psychosis have committed suicide since \nJune 11.\n  These women were not alone. Studies indicate that 50 to 75 percent of \nall new mothers undergo the ``baby blues,'' a feeling of let-down after \nthe emotional experience of childbirth. Serious postpartum depression \naffects 10 to 20 percent of women who manifest symptoms including \nexcessive worry or exhaustion, sadness, feelings of guilt, apathy, \nphobias, sleep problems, physical complaints and marked fear of \ncriticism of mothering skills. These symptoms may last from 3 to 14 \nmonths. The most severe form of postpartum depression, postpartum \npsychosis, is characterized by hallucinations, hearing voices, \nparanoia, severe insomnia, extreme anxiety and depression, and deluded \nthinking in addition to many of the other symptoms of postpartum \ndepression. Postpartum psychosis often requires hospitalization. While \nthis severe form occurs fairly infrequently, affecting an estimated one \nin 1,000 new mothers, it may have the most grievous consequences \nincluding attempts at self-harm, suicide, or harm to others. Clearly \npostpartum depression is a significant problem with major societal \ncosts.\n  While postpartum depression is a widespread problem, there are \ncurrently few research studies looking into its causes and there is \ncurrently no standard treatment for women suffering from this disorder. \nGiven the lack of coordination amongst those interested in \nunderstanding and treating such a widespread problem, science and \nmedicine have made few inroads into helping the many women and their \nfamilies carrying the burden of postpartum depression. This legislation \nseeks to rectify this situation.\n  This bill authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \norganize a series of national meetings, with the goal of developing a \nresearch and treatment plan for postpartum depression and psychosis. \nFurther, this legislation encourages the Secretary to implement the \nresearch and treatment plan in a timely fashion. The bill also creates \na new grants program, administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Administration, to provide\n\n[[Page S10649]]\n\nwomen and their families with treatment and services.\n  In Illinois alone there are at least 175,000 births a year. Even \nusing the conservative estimate that 10 percent of mothers will suffer \nfrom postpartum depression, this suggests that over 17,000 women, in \nthe State of Illinois alone, and 400,000 women nationwide will \nexperience the devastating symptoms of this disorder each year. \nDeveloping new treatments for this disorder should be a top priority.\n  I am pleased that Senator Fitzgerald has joined me in cosponsoring \nthis bill. In the House of Representatives, Representative Rush has \nalready introduced this legislation and it enjoys wide bipartisan \nsupport with 90 cosponsors at this time.\n  In remembrance of Melanie Stokes and all the women who have suffered \nfrom postpartum depression and psychosis, as well as their families and \nfriend who have stood by their side, I am introducing the Melanie \nStokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 1537. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na hydrogeologic mapping, modeling and monitoring program for the High \nPlains Aquifer and to establish the High Plains Aquifer Coordination \ncouncil to facilitate groundwater conservation in the High Plains; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 1538. A bill to further continued economic viability in the \ncommunities on the High Plains by promoting sustainable groundwater \nmanagement of the Ogallala Aquifer; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two important \npieces of legislation that have great significance for New Mexico, but \nalso are crucial to the entire Great Plains region of our Nation. The \nbills address the alarming decline in portions of the Ogallala Aquifer, \nwhich extends under eight States: Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, \nColorado, Nebraska, Wyoming, and South Dakota.\n  A reliable source of groundwater is esential to the well-being and \nlivelihoods of people in the great Plains region. Local towns and rural \nareas are dependent on the use of groundwater for drinking water, \nranching, farming, and other commercial uses. Yet many areas overlying \nthe Ogallala Aquifer have experienced a dramatic depletion of this \ngroundwater resource. Some areas have seen a decline of over 100 feet \nin aquifer levels during the last half of the twentieth century.\n  The first bill that I am introducing today, the ``High Plains Aquifer \nConservation, Monitoring, and Coordination Act,'' would direct the \nSecretary of the Interior to develop and carry out a comprehensive \nhydrogeologic mapping, modeling and monitoring program for the High \nPlains Aquifer, which is comprised in large part by the Ogallala \nAquifer. The Secretary is directed to work in conjunction with the \neight High Plains Aquifer States in carrying out this program. The U.S. \nGeological Survey and the States will work in cooperation to further \nthe goals of this program, with half of the available funds directed to \nthe States for their participation in the program.\n\n  The bill would also charge the Secretary of the Interior, working in \ncooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, with establishing a High \nPlains Aquifer Coordination Council. This Council would coordinate \nmapping, modeling, and monitoring efforts; facilitate coordination of \nfederal, state and local programs relating to the groundwater resources \nof the High Plains Aquifer; facilitate coordination of programs and \npolicies among the High Plains Aquifer States; and provide \nrecommendations to the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of \nAgriculture, and the Governors regarding programs and policies to \naddress the groundwater resources of the High Plains Aquifer. The \nCouncil will be comprised of State and Federal representatives, as well \nas individuals from irrigation production agriculture, nonagricultural \nwater users, the conservation community, and Indian Tribes.\n  Finally, the legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to \nprovide funding to each of the High Plains Aquifer States to further \ngroundwater education programs, working with land grant universities \nand other educational institutions and cooperating entities.\n  The second bill that I am introducing today is the ``High Plains \nGroundwater Resource Conservation Act.'' This bill would establish a \nvoluntary 10-year groundwater conservation incentives program for the \nHigh Plains Aquifer region. Incentive payments would be made for \nvoluntary land management practices, which may include changes from \nirrigated to dryland agriculture, changes in cropping patterns to \nutilize water conserving crops, and other conservation measures that \nresult in quantifiable and significant savings in groundwater use. \nCost-share payments will be made for structural practices that will \nconserve groundwater resources of the High Plains Aquifer, which may \ninclude improvement of irrigation systems and purchase of new \nequipment. Priority will be given to areas experiencing significant \naquifer level declines. In order to be eligible, producers must be in \nan area covered by a groundwater conservation plan.\n\n  The legislation would also require the Secretary of Agriculture to \nprovide financial and technical assistance on a cost-share basis to \nStates, tribes, counties, conservation districts and other political \nsubdivisions. Upon approval by the Secretary, a State can carry out \nthese activities in lieu of the Secretary. The Secretary is also \nrequired to set up a process to certify groundwater conservation plans.\n  In addition, the bill would enhance eligibility for participation in \nthe Conservation Reserve Program for lands drawing water from the High \nPlains Aquifer.\n  These two bills bring focus to an issue that concerns the long-term \neconomic viability of communities in much of America's heartland. This \nis farm country, and the cornerstone of its economy is its groundwater \nsupply, the Ogallala Aquifer, which allows for irrigated agriculture. \nThe Department of Agriculture estimates that there are over six million \nacres of irrigated agriculture overlying just the southern portion of \nthe Ogallala. These farms use between six and nine million acre feet of \nwater per year. The problem we are confronting is that the aquifer is \nnot sustainable, and it is being depleted rapidly, This threatens the \nway of life of all who live on the High Plains. These bills would take \nsignificant steps to address this serious problem. I ask that my \ncolleagues join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Murray, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 1539. A bill to protect children from terrorism; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on this, the one month anniversary of \nthe horrifying terrorist attacks of September 11, I rise to introduce a \nbill that I believe will provide protection from future terrorist \nattacks for the most vulnerable members of our society: children.\n  In preparing for threats ahead, we must also examine what happened to \nour children on September 11--we must consider the impact of the \nattacks on children in New York and Virginia, and all of the affected \nstates and regions, as well as the impact on children throughout the \nNation. We must do all we can to support and assist these children in \ntheir recovery, as well as protect children in the future who, God \nforbid, may face similarly horrifying attacks.\n  People in New York, and around the country, are looking for \ninformation and assurance that their children's needs are being taken \ninto account as we prepare for future terrorist threats.\n  Parents have been coming up to me in New York and asking important \nquestions about how to protect their children in the case of a threat.\n  And, students have been writing to me asking to protect them as we \nmove ahead into a more uncertain world. Sheryl De Los Santos, a student \nat I.S. 383, a middle school in Brooklyn, writes:\n\n\n[[Page S10650]]\n\n\n       During the tragic loss of the Twin Towers my reaction to \n     this loss was why? Why would someone do this to our country? \n     When I saw them come down, I totally lost it. I cried. I \n     cried even more when I heard how many people died. I feel \n     angry, hurt, sad, mad, scared and horrified all at the same \n     time. I even feel confused. I feel scared because if anything \n     else happened I would go crazy. I feel angry for what they \n     did because I have never been to the Twin Towers. I feel sad \n     and hurt because of so many lost lives. Though I am not \n     saying it is your fault because it is not. I am writing to \n     you to tell you that America's safety has been sleeping on \n     the job. Maybe you can have more security.\n\n  I think it's important that we provide parents and their children \nwith the assurance that we are working to protect them and we must \nreplace fear with facts.\n  As we consider potential terrorist threats, the threat of bioterrorsm \nhas felt all too real particularly as a criminal investigation goes on \nin Florida on the three individuals who were exposed to anthrax.\n  My bill, Protecting Children Against Terrorism Act, will ensure that \nas we take steps to prepare for the threat of bioterrorism, we take \ninto account children's health needs.\n  I am extremely concerned that we are not paying a sufficient amount \nof attention to the unique needs of children in our efforts to plan and \nprepare for future attacks.\n  Children have special needs relating to bioterrorism. First, they are \nparticularly susceptible to biological and chemical attacks. Some dense \nnerve gas agents, like Sarin, concentrate lower to the ground, near the \nbreathing zone of children. Also, because children have more rapid \nrespiratory rates and larger surface to mass ratios, they anatomically \nare more vulnerable to exposures.\n  And yet, the tools of our response to bioterrorism are less effective \nfor children's needs.\n  My legislation, the Protecting America's Children Against Terrorism \nAct, would create a national task force comprised of: children health \nexperts on infectious disease, environmental health and toxicology; \nmembers of esteemed organizations like the American Academy of \nPediatrics and the National Association of Children's Hospitals; and \nrepresentatives of relevant federal agencies.\n  These national children's health experts would look at our health \nsystem to ensure that, as we're stepping up our response efforts, the \nmedicine and treatments fit the health needs of children.\n  For instance, as we're making sure we have antidotes to threatening \ndiseases, we need to ensure that these have been tested not just on \nadults, but on children too.\n  As my colleagues, Senators Dodd, DeWine, Kennedy, and others with \nwhom I have worked closely on the pediatric testing issue know, many \npharmaceutical manufacturers have not tested, or properly dosed \nantidotes, antibiotics, or other agents for use on children. My \nlegislation would insist that we do this testing.\n  And CDC ``push packs'' and other emergency response supply systems do \nnot take into account the special medical needs of children. I am \ncalling for CDC to revise their emergency response supply to take into \naccount the needs of kids.\n  My legislation would also ensure that the expert doctors and health \nprofessionals, who would be on the frontlines in responding to an \nattack, are trained and equipped to treat children too. These doctors \nneed to know whether a certain disease or chemical agent will affect a \nchild differently than an adult and which treatment is most effective \nfor children.\n  The final step is providing parents with information so that they can \nrest assured that there are doctors and medicine that are specially \ntrained and developed to help their children.\n  We must also ensure that the place in which children spend much of \ntheir days are protected, our schools. On September 11, New York's \nteachers, school personnel and child care providers acted with great \nbravery and skill as they safely evacuated school children from the \nschools and child care centers in and around the World Trade Center. As \na result, no students were physically harmed during the attacks.\n  Are all schools prepared to safely evacuate students? Did New York do \nit perfectly? The answers are, of course, ``no.''\n  Lisa Swovick, a mother from Rochester, wrote the following email to \nme:\n\n       Having grown up during the Cold War, I remember practicing \n     drills in school should we become victims of a nuclear \n     attack. I also remember learning about the nearest shelter to \n     go to should the attack happen. It was the neighborhood \n     school and library. We were instructed to go there and there \n     would be food and shelter provided in an emergency. I would \n     like to know, if during the present time of much dialog of \n     possible biological terrorist attacks on America, if it would \n     be a good idea for these shelters to return. There are scary \n     thoughts to have, however, I had to deal with the thought of \n     a nuclear attack from Russia as a child. I only fear that we \n     won't be as prepared as we might have been in the 1960s for \n     the present-day dangers of our very uncertain world.\n\n  In my bill, I ask that the Secretary of Education develop \nrecommendations and models to help communities develop school \nevacuation plans, safe places for children to go in case of an attack, \npartnerships with the medical community to ensure that children get the \nimmediate care they need, and recommendations for notifying parents of \nevacuation plans and information on how and where to find their child \nor children in the wake of an attack.\n  As we prepare for threats ahead, we cannot forget the many, many \nchildren who have already been severely affected by the terrorism of \nSeptember 11.\n  Children are especially susceptible to the terrible emotional and \nmental anguish that terrorist attacks cause, whether they have a parent \nwho was called into military duty, lost a parent in the attack or \nactually witnessed the violence themselves.\n  My legislation would help address this immense need by providing \ngrants to community groups, and schools to make sure that children's \nmental health needs are met.\n  And we need to make sure that our disaster relief assistance is \ntailored to help children who have been orphaned or lost a parent in an \nattack. We do not yet know the numbers of children who lost a parent in \nthe September 11 attacks, but some have speculated that it could be as \nhigh as 10,000 children.\n  My legislation would create an office of children's services within \nFEMA for helping children who lose a parent in a disaster by offering \nthem many different types of support, such as counseling and legal \nservices for adoption.\n  And, finally, I believe we must shore-up our social services \ninfrastructure.\n  In the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks, over 400 hotline \nnumbers were established in order to provide help and information for \nfamilies and victims of the terrorist attacks. These numbers were on \ntop of the thousands of existing non-profit organizations and Federal, \nState and city governmental agencies that provide human and social \nservices to help children and families in crisis.\n  My legislation would also include funding to implement 2-1-1, a \nuniversal hotline designed by the United Way and approved by the \nFederal Communication Commission to be used to connect children and \nfamilies with the help they need.\n  I appreciate the support I have already received for this legislation \nand I am proud to have co-sponsorships from: Senators Dodd, Murray, \nMikulski, Schumer, Bingaman, and Corzine.

A bill to extend and improve the emergency food assistance \nprogram; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto help food banks, soup kitchens, and other emergency feeding \norganizations meet the needs of our hungry citizens.\n  According to the most recent U.S. Department of Agriculture \nestimates, 10.1 percent of U.S. households, 31 million Americans are \nconsidered food insecure. Under current law, the Emergency Food \nAssistance Program, TEFAP, purchases agricultural commodities for use \nby food banks and soup kitchens. Needy American citizens rely on this \nprogram to get them over the hump when they lose their jobs or fall on \nunexpected hard times. Yet, a recent report of the U.S. Conference of \nMayors concluded that 13 percent of these families who requested \nemergency food assistance were turned away due to a lack of food \nresources.\n  The bill I introduce today simply increases funding for TEFAP by $40 \nmillion, a 40 percent increase. As well, the bill allows $10 million of \nthis new funding to be used for state and local food processing, \ndistribution, transportation, and storage costs. This $10 million \nenhances the $45 million already appropriated annually for these costs.\n  Additionally, this bill has secondary benefits to our rural \ncommunities. TEFAP provides a boost to the agriculture economy by \npurchasing surplus commodities from the market.\n  I commend Congressman Goodlatte of Virginia for championing a similar \nbill on the House side. I look forward to working closely with my \ncolleagues on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry to ensure that this legislation is included in the Nutrition \nTitle of the Farm Bill.\n  The legislation is supported by America's Second Harvest and food \nbanks and soup kitchens throughout the nation. This bill entitled the \n``Emergency Food Assistance Program Enhancement Act'' should enjoy \nbipartisan support, and I encourage my colleagues to co-sponsor this \npiece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI:\n  S. 1542. A bill to foster innovation and technological advancement in \nthe development of the Internet and electronic commerce, and to assist \nthe States in simplifying their sales and use taxes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Internet Tax \nMoratorium and Equity Act. I encourage each of my colleagues to join me \nas a cosponsor of this bill. With the extension of the current \nmoratorium of the Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998 expiring soon on \nOctober 21, 2001, there are several bills that are currently being \ndiscussed in the Senate in order to address this issue. I had to take a \nlook at the Internet sales tax issue for people who might be using \nlegislative vehicles to develop huge loopholes in our current system. \nWe are federally mandating States into a sales tax exemption. We need \nto preserve the system for those cities, towns, counties, and States \nthat rely on the ability to collect the sales tax they are currently \ngetting. I believe that the current moratorium on Internet access taxes \nand multiple and discriminatory taxes on the Internet should not be \nextended without addressing the larger issue of sales and use tax \ncollection on electronic commerce.\n  There are some critical issues here that have to be solved to keep \nthe stability of State and local government, just the stability of it, \nnot to increase sales tax, just protect what is there right now. I \nbelieve the Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act is a monumental step \nforward in protecting, yet enhancing, the current system.\n  Certainly, no Senator wants to take steps that will unreasonably \nburden the development and growth of the Internet. At the same time, we \nmust also be sensitive to issues of basic competitive fairness and the \nnegative effect our action or inaction can have on brick-and-mortar \nretailers, a critical economic sector and employment force in all \nAmerican society, especially in rural States like Wyoming. In addition, \nwe must consider the legitimate need of State and local governments to \nhave the flexibility they need to generate resources to adequately fund \ntheir programs and operations.\n  As the only accountant in the Senate, I have a unique perspective on \nthe dozens of tax proposals that are introduced in Congress each year. \nIn addition, my service on the State and local levels and my \nexperiences as a small business owner enable me to consider these bills \nfrom more than one viewpoint.\n  I understand the importance of protecting and promoting the growth of \nInternet commerce because of its potential economic benefits. It is a \nvaluable resource because it provides access on demand. In addition, it \nis estimated that the growth of online businesses will create millions \nof new jobs nationwide in the coming years. Therefore, I do not support \na tax on the use of Internet itself.\n  I do, however, have concerns about using the Internet as a sales tax \nloophole. Sales taxes go directly to State and local governments and I \nam very leery of any Federal legislation that bypasses their \ntraditional ability to raise revenue to perform needed services such as \nschool funding, road repair and law enforcement. I will not force \nStates into a huge new exemption. While those who advocate a permanent \nloophole on the collection of a sales tax over the Internet claim to \nrepresent the principles of tax reduction, they are actually advocating \na tax increase. Simply put, if Congress continues to allow sales over \nthe Internet to go untaxed and electronic commerce continues to grow as \npredicted, revenues to State and local governments will fall and \nproperty taxes will have to be increased to offset lost revenue or \nStates who do not have or believe in State income taxes will be forced \nto start one.\n  Furthermore, State and local revenues and budgets are especially \ncritical now as these governments are responding to protect the \nsecurity of all of our citizens and businesses. Any action to\n\n[[Page S10653]]\n\nextend the current moratorium without creating a level playing field \nwould perpetuate a fundamental inequity and ignore a growing problem \nthat will gravely affect the readiness of the nation.\n  After months of hard work, negotiations, and compromise, the Internet \nTax Moratorium and Equity Act has been introduced. I would like to \ncommend several of my colleagues for their commitment to finding a \nsolution and working with all parties to find that solution. I know \nthis bill is the solution. The bill makes permanent the existing \nmoratorium on Internet access taxes, but extends the current moratorium \non multiple and discriminatory taxes for an additional four years \nthrough December 31, 2005.\n  Throughout the past several years, we have heard that catalog and \nInternet companies say they are willing to allow and collect sales tax \non interstate sales, regardless of traditional or Internet sales, if \nStates will simplify collections to one rate per State sent to one \nlocation in that State. I think that is a reasonable request. I have \nheard the argument that computers make it possible to handle several \nthousand tax entities, but from an auditing standpoint as well \nas simplicity for small business, I support one rate per State. I think \nthe States should have some responsibility for redistribution not a \nbusiness forced to do work for government. Therefore, the bill would \nput Congress on record as urging States and localities to develop a \nstreamlined sales and use tax system, which would include a single, \nblended tax rate with which all remote sellers can comply. You need to \nbe aware that States are prohibited from gaining benefit from the \nauthority extended in the bill to require sellers to collect and remit \nsales and use taxes on remote sales if the States have not adopted the \nsimplified sales and use tax system.\n\n  Further, the bill would authorize States to enter into an Interstate \nSales and Use Tax Compact through which members would adopt the \nstreamlined sales and use tax system. Congressional authority and \nconsent to enter into such a compact would expire if it has not \noccurred by January 1, 2006. The bill also authorizes States to require \nall other sellers to collect and remit sales and use taxes on remote \nsales unless Congress has acted to disapprove the compact by law within \na period of 120 days after the Congress receives it.\n  The bill also calls for a sense of the Congress that before the end \nof the 107th Congress, legislation should be enacted to determine the \nappropriate factors to be considered in establishing whether nexus \nexists for State business activity tax purposes.\n  I am introducing this bill today because I do not think there is \nadequate protection now. It is very important we do not build \nelectronic loopholes on the Internet, an ever-changing Internet, one \nthat is growing by leaps and bounds, one that is finding new technology \nvirtually every day.\n  I recognize this body has a constitutional responsibility to regulate \ninterstate commerce. Furthermore, I understand the desire of several \nsenators to protect and promote the growth of Internet commerce. \nInternet commerce is an exciting field. It has a lot of growth \npotential. The new business will continue to create millions of new \njobs in the coming years.\n  The exciting thing about that for Wyomingites is that our merchants \ndo not have to go where the people are. For people in my State, that \nmeans their products are no longer confined to a local market. They do \nnot have to rely on expensive catalogs to sell merchandise to the big \ncity folks. They do not have to travel all the way to Asia to display \ntheir goods. The customer can come to us on the Internet. It is a \nremarkable development, and it will push more growth for small \nmanufacturers in rural America, especially in my State. We have seen \nsome of the economic potential in the Internet and will continue this \nprogress. It is a valuable resource because it provides access on \ndemand. It brings information to your fingertips when you want it and \nhow you want it.\n  I am very concerned, however, with any piece of legislation that \nmandates or restricts State and local governments' ability to meet the \nneeds of its citizens. This has the potential to provide electronic \nloopholes that will take away all of their revenue. The Internet Tax \nMoratorium and Equity Act would designate a level playing field for all \ninvolved--business, government, and the consumer.\n  The States, and not the Federal Government, should have the right to \nimpose, or not to impose, consumption taxes as they see fit. The \nreality is that emergency response personnel, law enforcement \nofficials, and other essential services are funded largely by States \nand local governments, especially through sales taxes. Passing an \nextension of the current moratorium without taking steps toward a \ncomprehensive solution would leave many States and local communities \nunable to fund their services. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Lott, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. \n        Allen):\n  S.J.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Kennedy, and 23 of our colleagues that will \nput the Senate on record in strong support of substantial new \ninvestment toward strengthening our Nation's preparedness to respond to \nany potential bioterrorist threat.\n  Last year, Congress passed the bipartisan Frist-Kennedy Public Health \nThreats and Emergencies Act of 2000. That law provides a coherent \nframework for responding to health threats resulting from bioterrorism. \nIt authorizes a series of important initiatives to strengthen the \nnation's public health system; to improve hospital response \ncapabilities; to upgrade the Centers for Disease Control's rapid \nidentification and early warning systems; to assure adequate staffing \nand training of health professionals to diagnose and care for victims \nof bioterrorism; to enhance our research and development capabilities; \nto expand our reserve of vaccines and antibiotics; and to pursue \nadditional measures necessary to prevent, prepare, and respond to the \nthreat of biological or chemical attacks. The framework exists, so now \nit is time to fund these critical initiatives.\n  The threat of a bioterrorist attack is remote, so we must not \noverreact or give into irrational fears. But remote as the threat may \nbe, it is real. For a variety of reasons, the threat is higher today \nthan it was one month ago, and it is growing. Osama bin Laden has said \nit is his religious duty to acquire weapons of mass destruction, \nincluding chemical and biological weapons. He and his followers have \nshown an utter disregard for human life. They, and other known \nterrorists, have the resources and motivation to acquire and use germ \nwarfare. Recent advances in agent delivery technology, such as \naerosolization, have made weaponiza- tion of germs easier. Finally, \nwith the fall of the Soviet Union, the expertise of thousands of \nscientists knowledgeable in germ warfare may be available to the \nhighest bidder.\n  We have made important strides during the past few years in preparing \nour Nation to meet this threat. There is much to be proud of in our \nresponse to the attacks of September 11, as well as the response to the \nrecent anthrax outbreaks in Florida. But additional steps are needed, \nand they are needed now. To better prepare our Nation, the \nAdministration, local and State officials, public health departments, \nand our front line medical response teams must have additional \nresources and support. I believe the best way to accomplish this is to \nprovide additional funds toward the priorities outlined in the Public \nHealth Threats and Emergencies Act and to better arm America to fight \nagainst bioterrorism.\n  Senator Kennedy and I, and our colleagues, look forward to working \nwith the Administration and those who serve on the Appropriations \nCommittees to provide the funds necessary to fill the gaps in our \ncurrent biodefense and surveillance systems and to take additional \nsteps to prevent the use of bioweapons and fully prepare our \ncommunities to respond. So that the Senate is strongly on record in \nfavor of these efforts, I look forward to working with all of my \ncolleagues to have this Sense of the Senate Resolution considered on an \nappropriate vehicle in the very near future.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I join my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Bill Frist, and many other colleagues in the Senate to \nintroduce a resolution stating our strong support for strengthening \nAmerica's defenses against bioterrorism.\n  As our forces continue their actions over Afghanistan, we can expect \nthat our enemies will try to strike against our country again. We must \nclose the gaps in our ability to deal with the possibility of \nbioterrorism on American soil. Just as we support our armed forces \noverseas, we should support our front line defenses against \nbioterrorism--our public health and medical professionals.\n  We want to reassure all Americans that much has already been done to \nassure their safety from such an attack, and to minimize the spread of \nbiological agents if an attack does occur. The kind of heroism we \nwitnessed from average Americans on September 11 with Americans caring \nfor and protecting their fellow citizens would take place once again in \nresponding to a bioterrorist threat.\n  But every day we delay in expanding our capabilities exposes innocent \nAmericans to needless danger. We cannot afford to wait.\n  Our first priority must be to prevent an attack from ever occurring. \nThat means moving quickly to enhance our intelligence capacity and our \nability to infiltrate terrorist cells, wherever they may exist. It also \nmeans using the renewed partnership between the United States and \nRussia to make sure that dangerous biological agents do not fall into \nthe hands of terrorists. We've worked with Russia to prevent the spread \nof nuclear weapons, and we must work together now to prevent the spread \nof biological weapons.\n  We must also enhance America's preparedness for a bioterrorist \nattack. Our citizens need not live their lives in fear of a biological \nattack, but building strong defenses is the right thing to do.\n  Unlike the assaults on New York and Washington, a biological attack \nwould not be accompanied by explosions and police sirens. In the days \nthat followed, victims of the attack would visit their family doctor or \nthe local emergency room, complaining of fevers, aches in the joints or \nperhaps a sore throat. The actions taken in those first few days will \ndo much to determine how severe the consequences of the attack will be.\n  The keys to responding effectively to a bioterrorist attack lie in \nthree key concepts: immediate detection, immediate treatment and \nimmediate containment.\n  To improve detection, we should improve the training of doctors to \nrecognize the symptoms of a bioterrorist attack, so that precious hours \nwill not be lost as doctors try to diagnose their patients. As we've \nseen in recent days,\n\n[[Page S10655]]\n\npatients with anthrax and other rarely encountered diseases are often \ninitially diagnosed incorrectly. In addition, public health \nlaboratories need the training, the equipment and the personnel to \nidentify biological weapons as quickly as possible.\n  In Boston, a recently installed electronic communication system will \nenable physicians to report unusual symptoms rapidly to local health \nofficials, so that an attack could be identified quickly. Too often, \nhowever, as a CDC report has stated: ``Global travel and commerce can \nmove microbes around the world at jet speed, yet our public health \nsurveillance systems still rely on a `Pony Express' system of paper-\nbased reporting and telephone calls.''\n  To improve the treatment of victims of a bioterrorist attack, we must \nstrengthen our hospitals and emergency medical plans. Boston, New York \nand a few other communities have plans to convert National Guard \narmories and other public buildings into temporary medical facilities, \nand other communities need to be well prepared too. Even cities with \nextensive plans need more resources to ensure that those plans will be \neffective when they are needed.\n  To improve containment, we must make certain that federal supplies of \nvaccines and antibiotics are available quickly to assist local public \nhealth officials in preventing the disease from spreading.\n  Developing new medical resources for the future is also essential. \nScientists recently reported that they had determined the complete DNA \nsequence of the microbe that causes plague. This breakthrough may allow \nnew treatments and vaccines to be developed against this ancient \ndisease scourge. We should use the remarkable skills of our \nuniversities and biotechnology companies to give us new and better \ntreatments in the battle against bioterrorism.\n  September 11 was a turning point in America's history. Our challenge \nnow is to do everything we can to learn from that tragic day, and \nprepare effectively for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10655-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1861.

Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to take the \nopportunity today to say a few words about an outstanding young \nAmerican who the President has nominated and the Senate has confirmed \nto be the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia.\n  John Brownlee is exceptionally well-qualified to serve in this \nposition. He is a graduate of Washington and Lee University and the Law \nSchool of the College of William and Mary. Following his graduation \nfrom law school, John served for two years as a law clerk for the \nHonorable Sam Wilson, Chief U.S. District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Virginia. He served four years as an Assistant U.S. \nAttorney here in the District of Columbia where he gained extensive \nexperience as a federal prosecutor. John also has experience in the \nprivate sector as an attorney with the law firm of Woods, Rogers and \nHazlegrove in Roanoke, Virginia.\n  I have known this outstanding young man for almost eighteen years and \nhave followed his career development with great interest. John is very \ncapable and dedicated, with extraordinary character and high moral \nstandards. A graduate of the ROTC program at Washington & Lee \nUniversity, where he also lettered in varsity football each year, John \nentered the U.S. Army upon graduation as an infantry officer. He also \nvolunteered for and graduated from the Army's Airborne and Ranger \ntraining programs.\n  John's 4-year military career was primarily as an officer in the \nArmy's 3rd Infantry, the ``Old Guard'', where he served initially as a \nRifle Platoon Leader and later commanded the prestigious Army Drill \nTeam. While on duty at Ft. Myer, Virginia, John also served as a \nmilitary social aide to President George H.W. Bush and, through night \ncourses, earned a Masters Degree in Business Administration. John \ncontinues to serve his country as a Major in the Army Reserve.\n  John and his lovely wife, Lee Ann along with their two year old \ndaughter, Thompson Ann, currently live in Roanoke. Lee Ann is a news \nanchor for Channel 10 and one of the most popular personalities in \nsouthwest Virginia.\n  John was appointed Acting U.S. Attorney on August 30, 2001. He is \nalready hard at work as the Chief Law Enforcement Officer in the \nWestern District. John has already tried and won his first case as the \nU.S. Attorney.\n  I am particularly proud of this young man, having watched him develop \nover many years. As many of my colleagues know, John is the son of Les \nBrownlee, the Republican Staff Director of the Armed Services \nCommittee, who has worked for me and the Armed Services Committee for \nalmost 18 years. So, it is with a great deal of pride and personal \npleasure that I have urged my colleagues to support unanimously the \nconfirmation of John L. Brownlee as the U.S. Attorney for the Western \nDistrict of the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF GREGORY LOCKHART\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased that today we have confirmed \nGreg Lockhart to be U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio. I \nam in full and strong support of this nomination.\n  I have known Greg Lockhart for over 25 years. I know from my personal \nexperiences working with Greg that he is an extremely well qualified \nnominee, who possesses great integrity and personal virtue.\n  Greg's experience is extensive. He served in the U.S. Air Force for \nthree years from 1966 to 1969, including service in Vietnam. Following \nhis military service, he attended Wright State University, where he \ngraduated in 1973. He then earned a law degree from Ohio State \nUniversity in 1976. He's been a career prosecutor ever since.\n  I worked with Greg first in Xenia, when he was the legal advisor to \nthe Xenia and Fairborn police departments and I was serving as Greene \nCounty prosecutor. I hired him to be assistant county prosecutor in \n1978. He became an assistant U.S. attorney in 1987. While in this \nposition, Greg served as Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force \n(OCDETF) prosecutor for two years, with duties including the \nprosecution of all violations of federal law, such as contract fraud, \nmurder, firearms, drugs, money laundering, and organized crime. \nAdditionally, Greg has handled the civil defense of all manner of \nlawsuits brought against the United States, including medical and tort \nclaims, discrimination, the training of agents and appellate practice.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that Greg Lockhart has the \nqualifications and skills necessary to serve in this post. With 25 \nyears of experience as a prosecutor, Greg will fill this position in a \npragmatic, tempered, and thoughtful way. I thank my colleagues for \njoining me in supporting this nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/11/senate-section/article/S10668-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution \nintroduced by myself and my friend and colleague from New Mexico, \nSenator Domenici, to establish National Character Counts Week. This \nresolution has passed during each of the last four Congresses with \nbroad, bi-partisan support. This year, in addition to Senator Domenici \nand myself, the resolution has 45 co-sponsors, divided almost equally \nbetween Democrats and Republicans. This resolution passed the House on \nSeptember 24, 2001, and we hope that it will pass the Senate today by \nunanimous consent.\n  Our schools may be built with the bricks of reading and math, and \nscience and history, but bricks need mortar, and character is that \nmortar in our children's education. Dr. Martin Luther King exhorted us \nto judge each other not by the color of our skin, but by the content of \nour character. We must do all that we can to help families and schools \nensure that the character of which Dr. King spoke is sound.\n  That is why Senator Domenici and I supported grants for character \neducation partnerships in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in \n1994, and again this year. That is why we have been so pleased by the \nPresident's support for character education. And, that is why we urge \nour colleagues in the Senate to support this resolution today.\n  Character education provides students a context within which to \nlearn. If we view education simply as imparting cold facts to our \nchildren, then we will miss a critical opportunity to develop the \ncharacter of future generations. Character education must be part of a \nseamless garment of learning.\n  For example, at Waterford High School, in Connecticut, math students \ndesigned an access ramp for children and others who use wheelchairs. \nThe students learned about math, but also about caring and inclusion.\n  At Butler Elementary School, in Groton, CT, principals and teachers \ndeveloped the Respect Every Day program. The program is not an \nadditional required subject. Rather, it is a part of every subject. \nAnd, in Enfield, Connecticut, at Prudence Crandall Elementary School, \nteachers use the Teaching Children to Get Along program, which teaches \nstudents to treat others with courtesy, and to be assertive, but not \nangry, when dealing with problems such as bullying and teasing.\n  The Connecticut Department of Education, on behalf of many state \norganizations, has issued a Call to Action letter, outlining a program \nto improve the school climate in Connecticut schools. And, the \nConnecticut Education Association has developed its own character \neducation program that teaches kids about not bullying and other \nbehaviors that can disrupt schools and make it difficult for children \nto learn.\n  Just last week, there was a wonderful article in the Washington Post, \nabout Mt. Rainier Elementary School, in Maryland, only a few miles from \nthe Capitol. At Mt. Rainier, the theme of peace is woven throughout the \ncurriculum, and is central to the school's effort to teach children to \nbe responsible for their actions and to respect themselves, fellow \nstudents, and adults.\n  A banner over the school entrance reads ``Mt. Rainier: A Peaceful \nSchool.'' Each week, students learn a different word for peace, often \nit is the word for peace in a foreign language, teaching students that \npeace must be universal. And, students are rewarded for good behavior. \nLast year, the school celebrated 160 consecutive Peace Days--a Peace \nDay is a day without a fight--with a parade, complete with a marching \nband, banners, and a cheering crowd. There's an old line that football \ncoaches get paid more than teachers, because people don't come to watch \nteachers teach--but, apparently, that's not true at Mt. Rainier.\n  Mt. Rainier's message, and the message of character education \ngenerally, is more important now, than ever. Mt. Rainier's principal, \nPhil Catania, said that he and his staff want to make sure that \nwhatever is happening on the outside, Mt. Rainier is a place where \nchildren can be safe and happy, and learn that anger and violence need \nnot win out in the end.\n  A month ago, that would have been about the difference between what \nhappens in school and what happens in some of the children's \nneighborhoods. Tragically, today, it also is about the terrible attacks \non New York, the Pentagon, and Pennsylvania. Principal Catania also has \nsaid that he thinks that Mt. Rainier's program is helping students cope \nwith those events.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, to encourage \nparents, schools, and communities to make character education a part of \ntheir children's daily lives, so that their children, like those in \nConnecticut, and Mt. Rainier, MD, and around our country, can serve as \nbeacons of hope in troubled times, and act to end troubled times, as \nwell.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend, Senator \nDodd, to applaud the passage of a concurrent resolution regarding \nNational Character Counts Week, H. Con. Res. 204.\n  I would also like to thank Congressmen Lamar Smith and Bobby Scott \nfor all of their hard work and leadership on this issue.\n  The resolution says the week of October 15 through 21 of this year, \nand October 14 through 20 of next year, will be known across the \ncountry as ``National Character Counts Week.''\n  I am pleased with our timing because just this past January, I \nlistened with great pleasure to President Bush's inaugural address, as \nhe basically ticked off the tenants of good character underscoring \nAmerican life. The President's speech was clearly a message about \ncharacter and its importance in American life.\n  In his speech, the President touched on many of the elements of good \ncharacter. I found it especially telling when the President emphasized \nthe necessity of teaching every child these principles and the duty of \nevery citizen to uphold these very same principles.\n  Ironically, nearly a century ago another President, Theodore \nRoosevelt, said the following about character: ``Character, in the long \nrun, is the decisive factor in the life of an individual and of nations \nalike.''\n  I would submit that character truly does transcend time as well as \nreligious, cultural, political, and socio-economic barriers.\n  I believe President Bush's renewed focus on character sends a \nwonderful message to Americans, and will help those of us involved in \ncharacter education reinvigorate our efforts to get communities and \nschools involved.\n  I say that because a number of years ago we started this approach to \ncharacter education called ``Character Counts.'' Senators Nunn, Dodd \nand I first introduced the resolution that has now passed the Senate on \ninnumerable occasions. The resolution simply declares that for all of \nAmerica, one week during the year will be known as ``National Character \nCounts Week.''\n  Frankly, we hear a lot about how we should help our young people \ngrowing up in this often difficult society, However, I believe the key \nis finding those ideas and programs that work.\n  We all understand that there are certain people who have the primary \nresponsibility to care for our children like mothers, fathers, \nsiblings, and grandparents. We are not in any way talking about \nnegating that responsibility of raising a child with good values.\n  However, we have found the teachers in our schools have been yearning \nfor something they could teach our children that for some reason had \nbeen eliminated from both the public and private school agenda \ncurriculum. It is sometimes referred to as character education.\n  I choose to speak about the ``Character Counts'' program that is \nbeing used in many public schools in our country, and certainly in my \nState of New Mexico where teachers embrace six pillars of character.\n  The values comprising the Six Pillars are everyday concepts that \nAmericans across this land wish their children would have and hope \nAmerica will keep. They are simply: trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. They transcend \npolitical and social barriers and are central to the ideals on which \nthis Nation was built.\n  As a matter of fact, I think they are central and basic to any nation \nthat survives for any long period of history. As Plato once said:\n\n       A country without character is a country that's doomed and \n     the only way a country can have character is if the \n     individual citizens in the country have character.\n\n\n[[Page S10670]]\n\n\n  I could speak for all of my allotted time on the 200,000 New Mexico \nschoolchildren in public, private and parochial schools learning about \ngood character. About 90 percent of the grade school children, and a \nsignificant portion of the others, are now participating in character \neducation programs that simply and profoundly bring them into contact \nwith each of these Pillars one month at a time.\n  So if you walk the halls of a grade school in Albuquerque, you might \nsee a sign outside that says, ``This Is Responsibility Month.'' And all \nthe young people will be discussing the concept of responsibility in \ntheir classrooms, and they will put up posters saying, ``Responsibility \nCounts.''\n  At the end of that month they may have an assembly where \nresponsibility will be discussed by all the kids, and awards will be \ngiven to those demonstrating the most responsibility. The next month it \nmight be ``respect.'' The month after that it might be ``caring.''\n  I would submit the concept is working wherever it is being tried. A \ngood example can be seen in the changes that occurred at the Garfield \nMiddle School in Albuquerque. The 570 students at Garfield received \ntheir first lessons on the Six Pillars in October of 1994.\n  During the first 20 days of that school year, there were 91 recorded \nincidents of physical violence. One year later, during the same period, \nthere were 26 such incidents. I believe this remarkable difference is \nevidence that students do respond to Character Counts.\n  In New Mexico, the Character Counts movement has spread from the \nclassroom to the boardroom. Recently, a group of business professionals \nresolved to explore ways to implement the Six Pillars in all their \nbusiness relationships in an effort to spread these values throughout \nthe community.\n  Through their efforts, parents have an opportunity to participate in \nCharacter Counts along side their kids, thereby reinforcing lessons \nlearned in school. Promoting the Six Pillars at work also improves \nproductivity and morale on the job, and it pays incalculable dividends \nin job and customer satisfaction.\n  I could go on for quite some time talking about Character Counts in \nNew Mexico. The bottom line is that I believe it is working in New \nMexico and other parts of the country.\n  Consequently, I think we need to salute the efforts already underway \nand encourage even more character education across our country.\n  So today, Senator Dodd and I are here to applaud the passage of the \nresolution and hopefully our renewed effort will bring together even \nmore communities to ensure that character education is a part of every \nchild's life.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 204) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}]
